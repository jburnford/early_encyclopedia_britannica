But MN will be the\nleat space into which the rays will be collected, as ap-\npears by their progres represented in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. Now\nMN is but about half of KL; and therefore it is about\nthe 56th part of the breadth of that part of the glas\nthrough which the rays <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>; which was to be shown.\n\nSince therefore each point of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> will be re-\npresented in fo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and the centres of those\nplaces will be contiguous, because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> in the\nobject the rays flow from are so; it is evident, that\nthe image of an object made by such a glas must be a\nmoit confused representation, though it does not appear\nso when viewed through an eye-glas that magnifies in\na moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>; consequently the degree of magni-\nfying in the eye-glas must not be too great with re-\nspect to that of the object-glas, lest the confusion be-\ncome sensible.\n\nNotwithstanding this imperfection, a dioptrical te-\nlescope may be made to magnify in any given degree,\nprovided it be of sufficient length; for the greater the\nfocal diftance of the object-glas is, the lefs may be\nthe proportion which the focal diftance of the eye-glas\nmay bear to that of the object-glas, without render-\ning the image obscure. Thus, an object-glas, whose Refracting\nfocal diftance is about four feet, will admit of an eye-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TELESCOPE\">telescope</a>\nglas whose focal diftance shall be little more than an inch,\nand consequently will magnify almost 48 times; to their\nbut an object-glas of 40 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a> will admit of an eye-glas\nof only four inches focus, and will therefore\nmagnify 120 times; and an object-glas of 100 feet\nfocus will admit of an eye-glas of little more than six\ninches focus, and will therefore magnify almost 200\ntimes.\n\nThe reafon of this disproportion in their several de-\ngrees of magnifying may be explained thus: Since the\ndiameter of the spaces, into which rays flowing from\nthe several points of an object are collected, are as the\nbreadth of the object-glas, it is evident that the degree\nof confufedness in the image is as the breadth of that\nglas; for the degree of confufedness will only be as the\ndiameters <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> breadths of thole spaces, and not as the\nspaces themselves. Now the focal length of the eye-\nglas, that is, its power of magnifying, must be as that\ndegree; for, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it exceeds it, it will render the confufed-\nnels sensible; and therefore it must be as the breadth or\ndiameter of the object-glas. The diameter of the ob-\nject-glas, which is as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> root of its aperture\nor magnitude, must be as the square root of the power\nof magnifying in the telescope; for unless the aper-\nture itfelf be as the power of magnifying, the image\nwill want <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>: the square root of the power of mag-\nnifying will be as the square root of the focal diftance\nof the object-glas; and therefore the focal diftance\nof the eye-glas must be only as the square root of\nthat of the object-glas. So that in making ufe of an\nobject-glas of a longer focus, suppose, than one that\nis given, you are not obliged to apply an eye-glas of\na proportionally longer focus than what would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a>\nthe given object-glas, but such a one only whose fo-\ncal diftance fhall be to the focal diftance of that which\nwill suit the given object-glas, as the square root of\nthe focal length of the object-glas you make ufe of,\nis to the square root of the focal length of the given\none. And this is the reafon that longer telephones\nare capable of magnifying in a greater degree than\nthofer ones, without rendering the object confufed or\ncoloured.\n\nUpon thele principles the following new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, taken\nfrom the Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures, vol. ii. p.\n471, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> edition, has been computed.

VI. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACHROMATIC\">Achromatic</a> Telescopes.\n\nThe inconvenience of very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> telescopes is so great, that different attempts have been made to remove it. Of these, the most successful have been by Dollond and Blair; and the general principles upon which these eminent opticians proceeded have been mentioned in the historical part of this article, and in the preceding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>. A fuller account of Dr Blair's discovery will be seen in the Transactions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>; and of Dollond's, it may be sufficient to observe, in addition to what has been already said, that the object-glasses of his telescopes are composed of three distinct lenses, two convex and one concave; of which the concave one is placed in middle, as is represented in fig. 3, where a and c show the two convex lenses, and b b the concave one, which is by the British artists placed in the middle. The two convex ones are made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> glass, and the middle one of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> flint glass; and they are all ground to spheres of different radii, according to the refractive powers of the different kinds of glass and the intended focal distance of the object-glass of the telescope. According to Bozovich, the focal distance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> rays for the concave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENS\">lens</a> is one-half, and for the convex glass one third of the combined focus. When put together, they refract the rays in the following manner. Fig 4. Let a b, a b, be two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> rays of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>'s light falling parallel on the first convex lens c. Supposing there was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other lens present but that one, they would be converged into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> b e, b e, and at last meet in the focus q. Let the lines g h, g h, represent two violet rays falling on the surface of the lens. These are also refracted, and will meet in a focus; but as they have a greater degree of refrangibility than the red rays, they must of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> converge more by the same power of refraction in the glass, and meet sooner in a focus, suppose at r.\u2014Let now the concave lens d d be placed in such a manner as to intercept all the rays before they come to their focus. Were this lens made of the same materials, and ground to the same radius with the convex one, it would have the same power to cause the rays diverge that the former had to make them converge. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the red rays would become parallel, and move on in the line o o, o o: But the concave lens, being made of flint glass, and upon a shorter radius, has a greater refractive power, and therefore they diverge a little after they come out of it; and if no third lens was interposed, they would proceed diverging in the lines o p t, o p t; but, by the interpolation of the third lens o v o, they are again made to converge, and meet in a focus somewhat more distant than the former, as at x. By the concave lens the violet rays are also refracted, and made to diverge; but having a greater degree of refrangibility, the same power of refraction makes them diverge somewhat more than the red ones; and thus, if no third lens was interposed, they would proceed in such lines as l m n, l m n. Now as the differently coloured rays <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> upon the third lens with different degrees of divergence, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, that the same power of refraction in that lens will operate upon them in such a manner as to bring them all together to a focus very nearly at the same point. The red rays, it is true, require the greatest power of refraction to bring them to a focus; but they fall upon the lens with the least degree of divergence. The violet rays, though they require the least power of refraction, yet have the greatest degree of divergence; and thus all meet together in the point x, or nearly so.\n\nBut, though we have hitherto supposed the refraction of the concave lens to be greater than that of the convex ones, it is easy to see how the errors occasioned by the first lens may be corrected by it, though it should have even a less power of refraction than the convex one. Thus, let a b, a b, be two rays of red light falling upon the convex lens c, and refracted into the focus q; let also g h, g h, be two violet rays converged into a focus at r; it is not necessary, in order to their convergence into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> focus at x, that the concave lens should make them diverge; it is sufficient if the glass has\nOptical Instruments has a power of dispersing the violet rays somewhat more than the red ones; and many kinds have this power of dispersing some kinds of rays, without a very great power of refraction. It is better, however, to have the object-glass composed of three lenses; because there is then another correction of the aberration by means of the third lens; and it might be impossible to find two lenses, the errors of which would exactly correct each other. It is also easy to see, that the effect may be the same whether the concave glass is a portion of the same sphere with the others or not; the effect depending upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of certain circumstances, of which there is an infinite variety.\n\nBy means of this correction of the errors arising from the different refrangibility of the rays of light, it is possible to shorten refracting telescopes considerably, and yet leave them equal magnifying powers. The reason of this is, that the errors arising from the object-glass being removed, those which are occasioned by the eye-glasses are inconsiderable: for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> is always in proportion to the length of the focus in any glass; and in very long telescopes it becomes exceedingly great, being no less than 1/4th of the whole; but in glasses of a few inches focus it becomes trifling. Refracting telescopes, which go by the name of Dollond's, are therefore now constructed in the following manner. Let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a> represent an object-glass composed of three lenses as above described, and converging the rays 1, 2, 3, 4, &c., to a very distant focus at x. By means of the interposed lens CD, however, they are converged to one much nearer, as at y, where an image of the object is formed. The rays diverging from thence fall upon another lens EF, where the pencils are rendered parallel, and an eye placed near that lens would see the object magnified and very distinctly. To increase the magnifying power still more, however, the pencils thus become parallel are made to fall upon another at GH; by which they are again made to converge to a distant focus: but, being intercepted by the lens IK, they are made to meet at the nearer one x; whence diverging to LM, they are again rendered parallel, and the eye at N sees the object very distinctly.\n\nFrom an inspection of the figure it is evident, that Dollond's telescope thus constructed is two telescopes combined together; the first ending with the lens EF, and the second with LM. In the first we do not perceive the object itself, but the image of it formed at y; and in the second we perceive only the image of that image formed at x. Such telescopes are nevertheless exceedingly distinct, and represent objects so clearly, as to be preferred, in viewing terrestrial things, even to reflectors. The latter indeed have greatly the advantage in their powers of magnifying, but they are much deficient in point of light. Much more light is lost by reflection than by refraction: and as in these telescopes the light must unavoidably suffer two reflections, a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of it is lost; nor is this loss counterbalanced by the greater aperture which these telescopes will bear, which enables them to receive a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of light than the refracting ones. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> of reflecting telescopes also are very much subject to tarnish, and require much more dexterity to clean them than the glasses of refractors; which makes them more troublesome and expensive, though for making discoveries in the heavens they are undoubtedly the only proper instruments which have been hitherto constructed.\n\nII. The Reflecting Telescope.\n\nThe inconveniences arising from the great length of Newtonian refracting telescopes, before the discovery of the achromatic telescope, are sufficiently obvious; and these, together with the difficulties occasioned by the different refrangibility of light, induced Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton to turn his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the subject of reflection, and endeavour to realize the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of himself and others concerning the possibility of constructing telescopes upon that principle.\u2014The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> which he contrived is represented, fig. 7, where ABCD is a large tube, open at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">AD</a> and closed at BC, and of a length at least equal to the distance of the focus from the metallic spherical concave speculum GH placed at the end BC. The rays EG, FH, &c., proceeding from a remote object PR, intersect one another somewhere before they enter the tube, so that EG, &c., are those that come from the lower part of the object, and FH, FH from its upper part: these rays after falling on the speculum GH, will be reflected, so as to converge and meet in mn, where they will form a perfect image of the object.\u2014But as this image cannot be seen by the spectator, they are intercepted by a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> metallic speculum KK, intersecting the axis at an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of 45\u00b0, by which the rays tending to mn will be reflected towards a hole LL in the side of the tube, and the image will be less distinct, because some of the rays which would otherwise fall on the concave speculum GH, are intercepted by the plane speculum: nevertheless it will appear in a considerable degree distinct, because the aperture AD of the tube, and the speculum GH are large. In the lateral hole LL is fixed a convex lens, whose focus is at S q; and therefore this lens will refract the rays that proceed from any point of the image, so as at their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXIT\">exit</a> they will be parallel, and those that proceed from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> points S q will converge after refraction, and form an angle at O, where the eye is placed; which will see the image S q, as if it were an object through the lens LL; consequently the object will appear enlarged, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a>, bright, and distinct. In LL lenses of different convexities may be placed, which by being moved nearer to the image or farther from it, would represent the object more or less magnified, provided that the surface of the speculum GH be of a perfectly spherical figure. If, in the room of one lens LL, three lenses be disposed in the same manner with the three eye-glasses of the refracting telescope, the object will appear erect, but less distinct than when it is observed with one lens.\n\nOn account of the position of the eye in this telescope, it is extremely difficult to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the instrument towards any object. Huygens, therefore, first thought of adding to it a small reflecting telescope, the axis of which is parallel to that of the reflector. This is called a finder or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTOR\">director</a>. When the Newtonian telescope is large, and placed upon its lower end to view bodies in great altitudes, the common finder can be of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, from the difficulty of getting the eye to the eye-piece. On this account Dr Brewster proposes (Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures, vol. ii. p. 478.) to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> the tube of the finder to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> angle, and place a plane mirror at the angular point, so as to throw the image above the upper part of the tube,\nthat the eye-piece of the finder may be as near as possible to the eye-piece of the telescope. The angular part, where the plain mirror is to be fixed, should be placed as near as possible to the focal image, in order that only a small part of the finder may stand above the tube; and in this way the eye can be transferred with the greatest facility from the one eye-piece to the other.\n\nThe advantages of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> will be understood from fig. 3. Plate CCCLXXXIX, where TT is part of a Newtonian telescope, D the eye-piece, and ABC the finder. The image formed by the object-glass A is reflected upwards by the plain mirror B, placed at an angle of 45\u00b0 with the axis of the tube, and the image is viewed with the eye-glass AC. Those who have been in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of using the Newtonian telescope with the common finder will be sensible of the convenience resulting from this contrivance.\n\nIn order to determine the magnifying power of this telescope, it is to be considered that the plane speculum KK is of no use in this respect. Let us then suppose, that one ray proceeding from the object coincides with the axis GLIA of the lens and speculum; let bb be another ray proceeding from the lower extreme of the object, and passing through the focus I of the speculum KH: this will be reflected in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> b'd', parallel to the axis GLA, and falling on the lens d'L'd', will be refracted to G; so that GL will be equal to Ll, and d'G=d'I. To the naked eye the object would appear under the angle Ib i=b IA; but by means of the telescope it appears under the angle d'GL=d'II=d'di; and the angle I'di is to the angle I'di : Ib : I'di; consequently the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> magnitude by the telescope is to that by the naked eye as the distance of the focus of the speculum from the speculum, to the distance of the focus of the lens from the lens.\n\nThe following new table of the apertures and magnifying power of Newtonian telescopes is taken from the Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures, vol. ii. p. 480. It is founded on a Newtonian telescope constructed by Hadley, in which the focal length of the great speculum was three feet three inches, and the magnifying power 226. Its aperture varied from three and a half to four and a half inches, according to the want of brightness in the objects to be examined. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> contains the focal length of the great speculum in feet, and the second its linear aperture in inches, and hundredths of an inch. The third and fourth columns contain Sir Isaac Newton's numbers, by means of which the apertures of any kind of reflecting telescopes may be easily computed. The fifth column contains the focal length of the eye-glasses in thousandths of an inch, and the sixth contains the magnifying power of the instrument.\n\nLet TYYT be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> tube, in which LdD is a Gregorian metallic concave speculum, perforated in the middle at telescope X; and EF a less concave mirror, so fixed by the arm or strong wire RT, which is moveable by means of a long screw on the outside of the tube, as to be moved nearer to or farther from the larger speculum LdD, its axis being kept in the same line with that of the great one. Let AB represent a very remote object from each part of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> pencils of rays, e.g., cd, CD, from A the upper extreme of the object, and IL, il, from the lower part B; the rays IL, CD, from the extremes crossing one another before they enter the tube. These rays falling upon the larger mirror LD, are reflected from it into the focus KH, where they form an inverted image of the object AB, as in the Newtonian telescope. From this image the rays, issuing as from an object, fall upon the small mirror EF, the centre of which is at c; so that after reflection they would meet in their foci at QQ, and there form an erect image. But since an eye at that place could see but a small part of an object, in order to bring rays from more distant parts of it into the pupil, they are intercepted by the plano-convex lens MN, by which means a smaller erect image is formed at PV, which is viewed from...\nOptical Instruments.\n\nOptical Instrument from the meniscus SS by an eye at O. This meniscus both makes the rays of each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> parallel and magnifies the image PV. At the place of this image all the foreign rays are intercepted by the perforated partition ZZ. For the same reason the hole near the eye O is very narrow. When nearer objects are viewed by this telescope, the small speculum EF is removed to a greater distance from the larger LD, so that the second image may be always formed in PV; and this distance is to be adjusted (by means of the screw on the outside of the great tube) according to the form of the eye of the spectator. It is also necessary, that the axis of the telescope should pass through the middle of the speculum LL, and its centre, the centre of the speculum LL, and the middle of the hole X, the centres of the lenses MN, SS, and the hole near O. As the hole X in the speculum LL can reflect none of the rays issuing from the object, that part of the image which corresponds to the middle of the object must appear to the observer more dark and confused than the extreme parts of it. Besides, the speculum EF will also intercept many rays proceeding from the object; and therefore unless the aperture TT be large, the object must appear in some degree obscure.\n\nIn the best reflecting telescopes, the focus of the small mirror is never coincident with the focus of the great one, where the first image KH is formed, but a little beyond it (with respect to the eye), as at n; the consequence of which is, that the rays of the pencils will not be parallel after reflection from the small mirror, but converge so as to meet in points about Q q Q, where they would form a larger upright image than PV, if the glass R was not in their way; and this image might be viewed by means of a single eye-glass properly placed between the image and the eye; but then the field of view would be less, and consequently not so pleasant; for which reason, the glass R is still retained, to enlarge the scope or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of the field.\n\nTo find the magnifying power of this telescope, multiply the focal distance of the great mirror by the distance of the small mirror from the image next the eye, and multiply the focal distance of the small mirror by the focal distance of the eye-glass; then divide the former product by the latter, and the quotient will express the magnifying power. For a table of the apertures and powers of Gregorian telescopes, see Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures, vol. ii. p. 472, 473.\n\nOne great advantage of the reflecting telescope is, that it will admit of an eye-glass of a much shorter focal distance than a refracting telescope; and consequently it will magnify so much the more: for the rays are not coloured by reflection from a concave mirror, if it be ground to a true figure, as they are by passing through a convex glass, let it be ground ever so true.\n\nThe nearer an object is to the telescope, the more its pencils of rays will diverge before they fall upon the great mirror, and therefore they will be the longer of meeting in points after reflection; so that the first image KH will be formed at a greater distance from the large mirror, when the object is near the telescope, than when it is very remote. But as this image must be formed farther from the small mirror than its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> focus n, this mirror must be always set at a greater distance from the larger one, in viewing near objects, than in viewing remote ones. And this is done by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the screw on the outside of the tube, until the small mirror be so adjusted, that the object (or rather its image) appears perfect.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> through any telescope towards an object, we never see the object itself, but only that image of it which is formed next the eye in the telescope. For if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> holds his finger or a stick between his bare eye and an object, it will hide part (if not the whole) of the object from his view: But if he ties a stick across the mouth of a telescope before the object-glass, it will hide no part of the imaginary object he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> through the telescope before, unless it covers the whole mouth of the tube: for all the effect will be, to make the object appear dimmer, because it intercepts part of the rays. Whereas, if he puts only a piece of wire across the inside of the tube, between the eye-glass and his eye, it will hide part of the object which he thinks he sees; which proves, that he sees not the real object, but its image. This is also confirmed by means of the small mirror EF, in the reflecting telescope, which is made of opaque metal, and stands directly between the eye and the object towards which the telescope is turned; and will hide the whole object from the eye at O, if the two glasses ZZ and SS are taken out of the tube.\n\nIf the small mirror of the preceding instrument be convex instead of concave, it is then called the Caferrian telescope. As the small mirror is in this case placed between the great speculum and its focus, a Caferrian telescope will be shorter than a Gregorian one of the same magnifying power by twice the real length of the small mirror. For a table of the apertures, &c., of this instrument, see Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures, vol. ii. p. 474, 475.\n\nSect. VII. On the Merits of different Microscopes and Telescopes.\n\nThe advantages arising from the use of microscopes and telescopes depend, in the first place, upon their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of magnifying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> parts of objects, so that they can by that means be more distinctly viewed by the eye; and, secondly, upon their throwing more light into the pupil of the eye than what is done without them. The advantages arising from the magnifying power would be extremely limited, if they were not also accompanied by the latter: for if the same quantity of light is spread over a large portion of surface, it becomes proportionally diminished in force; and therefore the objects, though magnified, appear proportionally dim. Thus, though any magnifying glass should enlarge the diameter of the object 10 times, and consequently magnify the surface 100 times, yet if the focal distance of the glass was about eight inches (provided this was possible), and its diameter only about the size of the pupil of the eye, the object would appear 100 times more dim when we looked through the glass, than when we beheld it with our naked eyes; and this, even on supposition that the glass transmitted all the light which fell upon it, which no glass can do. But if the focal distance of the glass was only four inches, though its diameter remained as before, the inconvenience would be vastly diminished, because the glass could then\nthen be placed twice as near the object as before, and consequently would receive four times as many rays as in the former case, and therefore we would see it much brighter than before. Going on thus, still diminishing the focal distance of the glass, and keeping its diameter as large as possible, we will perceive the object more and more magnified, and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> very distinct and bright. It is evident, however, that with regard to optical instruments of the microscopic kind, we must sooner or later arrive at a limit which cannot be passed. This limit is formed by the following particulars. 1. The quantity of light lost in passing through the glass. 2. The diminution of the glass itself, by which it receives only a small quantity of rays. 3. The extreme shortness of the focal distance of great magnifiers, whereby the free access of the light to the object which we wish to view is impeded, and consequently the reflection of the light from it is weakened. 4. The aberrations of the rays, occasioned by their different refrangibility.\n\nTo understand this more fully, as well as to see how far these obstacles can be removed, let us suppose the lens made of such a dull kind of glass that it transmits only one half of the light which falls upon it. It is evident that such a glass, of four inches focal distance, and which magnifies the diameter of an object twice, still supposing its own breadth equal to that of the pupil of the eye, will show it four times magnified in surface, but only half as bright as if it was seen by the naked eye at the usual distance; for the light which falls upon the eye from the object at eight inches distance, and likewise the surface of the object in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> size, being both represented by 1, the surface of the magnified object will be 4, and the light which makes that magnified object visible only 2: because though the glass receives four times as much light as the naked eye does at the usual distance of distinct vision, yet one half is lost in passing through the glass. The inconvenience in this respect can therefore be removed only as far as it is possible to increase the clearness of the glass, so that it shall transmit nearly all the rays which fall upon it; and how far this can be done, hath not yet been ascertained.\n\nThe second obstacle to the perfection of microscopic glasses is the small size of great magnifiers, by which, notwithstanding their near approach to the object, they receive a smaller quantity of rays than might be expected. Thus, suppose a glass of only 1/8th of an inch focal distance; such a glass would increase the visible diameter 80 times, and the surface 6400 times. If the breadth of the glass could at the same time be preserved as great as that of the pupil of the eye, which we shall suppose 1/8th of an inch, the object would appear magnified 6400 times, at the same time that every part of it would be as bright as it appears to the naked eye. But if we suppose that this magnifying glass is only 1/8th of an inch in diameter, it will then only receive 1/4th of the light which otherwise would have fallen upon it; and therefore, instead of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> to the magnified object a quantity of illumination equal to 6400, it would communicate only one equal to 1600, and the magnified object would appear four times as dim as it does to the naked eye. This inconvenience, however, is still capable of being removed, not indeed by increasing the diameter of the lens, because this must be in proportion to its focal distance, but by throwing a greater quantity of light on the object. Thus, in the above-mentioned example, if four times the quantity of light which naturally falls upon it could be thrown upon the object, it is plain that the reflection from it would be four times as great as in the natural way; and consequently the magnified image, at the same time that it was as many times magnified as before, would be as bright as when seen by the naked eye. In transparent objects this can be done very effectually by a concave speculum, as in the reflecting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a> already described; but in opaque objects the case is somewhat more doubtful; neither do the contrivances for viewing these objects seem entirely to make up for the deficiencies of the light from the smallness of the lens and shortness of the focus.\n\nWhen a microscopic lens magnifies the diameter of an object forty times, it hath then the utmost possible magnifying power, without diminishing the natural brightness of the object.\n\nThe third obstacle arises from the shortness of the focal distance in large magnifiers; but in transparent objects, where a sufficient quantity of light is thrown on the object from below, the inconvenience arises at last from straining the eye, which must be placed nearer the glass than it can well bear; and this entirely supercedes the use of magnifiers beyond a certain degree.\n\nThe fourth obstacle arises from the different refrangibility of the rays of light, and which frequently causes such a deviation from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> in the appearances of things that many people have imagined themselves to have made surprising discoveries, and have even published them to the world; when in fact they have been only as many optical deceptions, owing to the unequal refractions of the rays. For this there seems to be no remedy, except the introduction of achromatic glasses into microscopes as well as telescopes. How far this is practicable, hath not yet been tried; but when these glasses shall be introduced (if such introduction is practicable,) microscopes will then undoubtedly have received their ultimate degree of perfection.\n\nWith regard to telescopes, those of the refracting kind have evidently the advantage of all others, where Blair's the aperture is equal, and the aberrations of the rays refracting are corrected according to Mr Dollond's method; because the image is not only more perfect, but a much greater quantity of light is transmitted than what can be reflected from the best materials hitherto known. Unluckily, however, the imperfections of the glass set a limit to these telescopes, as has been already observed, so that they cannot be made above three feet and a half long. On the whole, therefore, the reflecting telescopes are preferable in this respect, that they may be made of dimensions greatly superior; by which means they can both magnify to a greater degree, and at the same time throw much more light into the eye.\n\nWith regard to the powers of telescopes, however, they are all of them exceedingly less than what we would be apt to imagine from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of times which they magnify the object. Thus, when we hear of a telescope which magnifies 200 times, we are apt to imagine, that, on looking at any distant object through it, we should perceive it as distinctly as we would with our naked eye at the 200th part of the\nThe best method of trying the goodness of any telescope is to observe how much farther off you are able to read with it than with the naked eye. But that all deception may be avoided, it is proper to choose something to be read where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> cannot give any assistance, such as a table of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">logarithms</a>, or something which consists entirely of figures; and hence the truly useful power of the telescope is easily known. In this way Mr Short's large telescope, which magnifies the diameter of objects 1200 times, is yet unable to afford sufficient light for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> at more than 200 times the distance at which we can read with our naked eye.\n\nWith regard to the form of reflecting telescopes, it is now pretty generally agreed, that when the Gregorian ones are well constructed, they have the advantage of those of the Newtonian form. One advantage evident at first sight is, that with the Gregorian telescope an object is perceived by looking directly through it, and consequently is found with much greater ease than in the Newtonian telescope, where we must look into the side. The unavoidable imperfection of the specula common to both, also gives the Gregorian an advantage over the Newtonian form. Notwithstanding the utmost care and labour of the workmen, it is found impossible to give the metals either a perfectly spherical or a perfectly parabolical form. Hence arises some indistinctness of the image formed by the great speculum, which is frequently corrected by the little one, provided they are properly matched. But if this is not done, the error will be made much worse; and hence many of the Gregorian telescopes are far inferior to the Newtonian ones; namely, when the specula have not been properly adapted to each other. There is no method by which the workman can know the specula which will fit one another without a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>; and therefore it is necessary to have many specula ready made of each sort, that in fitting up a telescope those may be chosen which best suit each other.\n\nThe brightness of any object seen through a telescope, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with its brightness when seen by the naked eye, may in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> be easily found by the following formula. Let \\( n \\) represent the natural distance at which an object can be distinctly seen; and let \\( d \\) represent its distance from the object-glass of the instrument. Let \\( m \\) be the magnifying power of the instrument; that is, let the visual angle subtended at the eye by the object when at the distance \\( n \\), and viewed without the instrument, be to the visual angle produced by the instrument as \\( r \\) to \\( m \\). Let \\( a \\) be the diameter of the object-glass, and \\( p \\) that of the pupil. Let the instrument be so constructed, that no parts of the pencils are intercepted for want of sufficient apertures of the intermediate glasses. Lastly, let the light lost in reflection or refraction be neglected.\n\nThe brightness of vision through the instrument will be expressed by the fraction \\( \\frac{a^2}{mpd^2} \\), the brightness of natural vision being 1. But although this fraction may exceed unity, the vision through the instrument will not be brighter than natural vision. For, when this is the case, the pupil does not receive all the light transmitted through the infranument.\n\nIn microscopes, \\( n \\) is the nearest limits of distinct vision, nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> inches. But a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in this circumstance, arising from a difference in the eye, makes no change in the formula, because \\( m \\) changes in the same proportion with \\( n \\).\n\nIn telescopes \\( n \\) and \\( d \\) may be reckoned equal, and the formula becomes \\( \\frac{a^2}{mp^2} \\).\n\n**Sect. VIII. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">Apparatus</a> for Measuring the Intensity of Light.**\n\nThat some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> bodies give a stronger, and others a weaker light, and that some reflect more light than others, was always known; but no person before M. Bouguer, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol11.html#article-HIT\">hit</a> upon a tolerable method of ascertaining the proportion that two or more lights bear to one another. The methods he most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> used were the following:\n\nHe took two pieces of wood or pasteboard EC and CD, in which he made two equal holes P and Q, over which he drew pieces of oiled or white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>. Upon these holes he contrived that the light of the different bodies he was comparing should fall; while he placed a third piece of pasteboard FC, so as to prevent the two lights from mixing with one another. Then placing himself sometimes on one side, and sometimes on the other, but generally on the opposite side of this instrument, with respect to the light, he altered their position till the papers in the two holes appeared to be equally enlightened. This being done, he computed the proportion of their light by the squares of the distances at which the luminous bodies were placed from the objects. If, for instance, the distances were as three and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a>, he concluded that the lights they gave were as nine and eighty-one. Where any light was very faint, he sometimes made use of lenses, in order to condense it; and he enclosed them in tubes or not as his particular application of them required.\n\nTo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the intensity of light proceeding from the heavenly bodies, or reflected from any part of the sky, he contrived an instrument which resembles a kind of portable camera obscura. He had two tubes, of which the inner was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, fastened at their lower extremities by a hinge C. At the bottom of these tubes Fig. 5: were two holes, R and S, three or four lines in diameter, covered with two pieces of fine white paper. The two other extremities had each of them a circular aperture, an inch in diameter; and one of the tubes consisted of two, one of them sliding into the other, which produced the same effect as varying the aperture at the end. When this instrument is used, the observer has his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, and the end of the instrument C, so covered, that no light can fall upon his eye, besides that which comes through the two holes S and R, while an assistant manages the instrument, and draws out or shortens the tube DE, as the observer directs. When the two holes appear equally illuminated, the intensity of the lights is judged to be inversely as the squares of the tubes.\n\nIn using this instrument, it is necessary that the object should subtend an angle larger than the aperture A.\nApparatus or D, seen from the other end of the tube; for, otherwise, the lengthening of the tube has no effect. To avoid, in this case, making the instrument of an inconvenient length, or making the aperture D too narrow, he has recourse to another expedient. He constructs an instrument, represented (fig. 6.), consisting of two object-glasses, A.F. and D.F., exactly equal, fixed in the ends of two tubes six or seven feet, or, in some cases, ten or twelve feet long, and having their foci at the other ends. At the bottoms of these tubes B, are two holes, three or four lines in diameter, covered with a piece of white paper; and this instrument is used exactly like the former.\n\nIf the two objects to be observed by this instrument be not equally luminous, the light that issues from them must be reduced to an equality, by diminishing the aperture of one of the object-glasses; and then the remaining surface of the two glasses will give the proportion of their lights. But for this purpose, the central parts of the glass must be covered in the same proportion with the parts near the circumference, leaving the aperture such as is represented (fig. 7.), because the middle part of the glass is thicker and less transparent than the rest.\n\nIf all the objects to be observed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> nearly in the same direction, Bouguer remarks, that these two long tubes may be reduced into one, the two object-glasses being placed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> together, and one eye-glass sufficing for them both. The instrument will then be the same with that of which he published an account in 1748, and which he called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELIOMETER\">heliometer</a>, or goniometer.\n\nIt is not, however, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> quantity, but only the intensity of the light, that is measured by these two instruments, or the number of rays, in proportion to the surface of the luminous body; and it is of great importance that these two things be distinguished. The intensity of light may be very great, when the quantity, and its power of illuminating other bodies, may be very small, on account of the smallness of its surface; or the contrary may be the case, when the surface is large.\n\nHaving explained these methods which M. Bouguer took to measure the different proportions of light, we shall subjoin a few examples of his application of them.\n\nIt is observable, that when a person stands in a place where there is a strong light, he cannot distinguish objects that are placed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>; nor can he see anything upon going immediately into a place where there is very little light. It is plain, therefore, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of a strong light upon the eye, and also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> which it leaves upon it, makes it insensible to the effect of a weaker light. M. Bouguer had the curiosity to endeavour to ascertain the proportion between the intensities of the two lights in this case; and by throwing the light of two equal candles upon a board, he found that the shadow made by intercepting the light of one of them, could not be perceived by his eye, upon the place enlightened by the other, at little more than eight times the distance; from whence he concluded, that when one light is eight times eight, or sixty-four times less than another, its presence or absence will not be perceived. He allows, however, that the effect may be different on different eyes; and supposes that the boundaries in this case, with respect to different persons, may lie between 60 and 80.\n\nApplying the two tubes of his instrument, mentioned above, to measure the intensity of the light reflected from different parts of the sky; he found that when the sun was 25 degrees <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, the light was four times stronger at the distance of eight or nine degrees from his body, than it was at 31 or 32 degrees. But what struck him most was to find, that when the sun is 15 or 20 degrees high, the light decreases on the same parallel to the horizon to 110 or 120 degrees, and then increases again to the place exactly opposite to the sun.\n\nThe light of the sun, our author observes, is too strong, and that of the stars too weak, to determine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of their light at different altitudes: but as, in both cases, it must be in the same proportion with the diminution of the light of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> in the same circumstances, he made his observations on that luminary, and found, that its light at 19\u00b0 16', is to its light at 66\u00b0 11', as 1681 to 2300; that is, the one is nearly two thirds of the other. He chose those particular altitudes, because they are those of the sun at the two solstices at latitude of Croissic, where he then resided. When one limb of the moon touched the horizon of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, its light was 2000 at different times less than at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> of 66\u00b0 11'. But this proportion he acknowledges must be subject to many variations, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> varying so much in its density. From this observation he concludes, that at a medium light is diminished in the proportion of about 2500 to 1681, in traversing 7469 toises of dense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>.\n\nM. Bouguer also applied his instrument to the different parts of the sun's disk, and found that the centre is considerably more luminous than the extremities of the disk of the sun. As near as he could make the observation, it was more luminous than a part of the disk of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANETS\">planets</a>, the semidiameter from it, in the proportion of 35 to 28; which, as he observes, is more than in the proportion of the fines of the angles of obliquity. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, he observes, that both the primary and secondary planets are more luminous at their edges than near their centres.\n\nThe comparison of the light of the sun and moon is a subject that has frequently exercised the thoughts of philosophers; but we find nothing but random conjectures, before Bouguer applied his accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> in this case. In general, the light of the moon is imagined to bear a much greater proportion to that of the sun than it really does; and not only are the imaginations of the vulgar, but those of philosophers also, imposed upon with respect to it. It was a great surprize to M. de la Hire to find that he could not, by the help of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> mirror, collect the beams of the moon in a sufficient quantity to produce the least sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>. Other philosophers have since made the like attempts with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRRORS\">mirrors</a> of greater power, though without any greater success; but this will not surprize us, when we see the result of M. Bouguer's observations on this subject.\n\nIn order to solve this curious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> concerning the comparison of the light of the sun and moon, he compared each of them to that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> in a dark room, one in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>-time, and the other in the night following, the light of the moon.\nApparatus ing, when the moon was at her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> distance from the earth; and, after many trials, he concluded that the light of the sun is about 300,000 times greater than that of the moon; which is such a disproportion, that, as he observes, it can be no wonder that philosophers have had so little success in their attempts to collect the light of the moon with burning glasses. For the largest of them will not increase the light 1000 times; which will still leave the light of the moon, in the focus of the mirror, 300 times less than the intensity of the common light of the sun.\n\nTo this account of the proportion of light which we actually receive from the moon, it cannot be displeasing to the reader, if we compare it with the quantity which would have been transmitted to us from that opaque body, if it reflected all the light it receives. Dr Smith thought that he had proved, from two different considerations, that the light of the full moon would be to our day-light as 1 to about 90,900, if no rays were lost at the moon.\n\nIn the first place, he supposes that the moon enlightened by the sun, is as luminous as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> are at a medium. He therefore supposed the light of the sun to be equal to that of a whole hemisphere of clouds, or as many moons as would cover the surface of the heavens. But on this Dr Priestley observes, that it is true, the light of the sun shining perpendicularly upon any surface would be equal to the light reflected from the whole hemisphere, if every part reflected all the light that fell upon it; but the light that would in fact be received from the whole hemisphere (part of it being received obliquely) would be only one-half as much as would be received from the whole hemisphere, if every part of it shone directly upon the surface to be illuminated.\n\nIn his Remarks, par. 97. Dr Smith demonstrates his method of calculation in the following manner:\n\n\"Let the little circle cfdg represent the moon's body half enlightened by the sun, and the great circle ab, a spherical shell concentric to the moon, and touching the earth; ab, any diameter of that shell perpendicular to a great circle of the moon's body, represented by its diameter cd; e the place of the shell receiving full moon light from the bright hemisphere fdg. Now, because the surface of the moon is rough like that of the earth, we may allow that the sun's rays, incident upon any small part of it, with any obliquity, are reflected from it every way alike, as if they were emitted. And therefore, if the segment df shone alone, the points a, e would be equally illuminated by it; and likewise if the remaining bright segment dg shone alone, the points b e would be equally illuminated by it. Consequently, if the light at the point a was increased by the light at b, it would become equal to the full moon light at e. And conceiving the same transfer to be made from every point of the hemispherical surface hbi k to their opposite points in the hemisphere kaeh, the former hemisphere would be left quite dark, and the latter would be uniformly illuminated with full moon light; arising from a quantity of the sun's light, which immediately before its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCIDENCE\">incidence</a> on the moon, would uniformly illuminate a circular plane equal to a great circle of her body, called her disk. Therefore the quantities of light being the same upon both surfaces, the density of the sun's incident light is to the density of full moon light, as that hemispherical surface hek is to the said disk; that is, as any other hemispherical surface whose centre is at the eye, to that part of it which the moon's disk appears to possess very nearly, because it subtends but a small angle at the eye: that is, as radius of the hemisphere to the verified fine of the moon's apparent femidiameter, or as 10,000,000 to 1106; or as 90,400 to 15; taking the moon's mean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> diameter to be 16' 7''.\n\n\"Strictly speaking, this rule compares moon light at the earth with day light at the moon; the medium of which, at her quadratures, is the same as our day-light; but is less at her full in the duplicate ratio of 365 to 366, or thereabout, that is, of the sun's distances from the earth and full moon; and therefore full moon light would be to our day-light as about 1 to 90,900, if no rays were lost at the moon.\n\n\"Secondly, I lay that full moon light is to any other moon light as the whole disk of the moon to the part that appears enlightened, considered upon a plane surface. For now let the earth be at b, and let dl be Fig. 9, perpendicular to fg, and gm to cd: then it is plain, that gl is equal to dm; and that gl is equal to a perpendicular section of the sun's rays incident upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> dg which at b appears equal to dm; the eye being unable to distinguish the unequal distances of its parts. In like manner, conceiving the moon's surface to consist of innumerable physical circles parallel to ef dg, as represented at A, the same reason holds for every one of these circles as for ef dg. It follows then, that the bright part of the surface visible at b, when reduced to a flat as represented at B, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRESCENT\">crescent</a> pdqmp, will be equal and similar to a perpendicular section of all the rays incident on that part, represented at C by the crescent psglp. Now the whole disk being in proportion to this crescent, as the quantities of light incident upon them; and the light falling upon every rough particle, being equally rarefied in diverging to the eye at b, considered as equidistant from them all; it follows, that full moon light is to this moon light as the whole disk pdq to the crescent pdqmp.\n\n\"Therefore, by compounding this ratio with that in the former remark, day light is to moon light as the surface of an hemisphere whose centre is at the eye, to the part of that surface which appears to be possessed by the enlightened part of the moon.\"\n\nMr Michell made his computation in a much more simple and easy manner, and in which there is much less danger of falling into any mistake. Considering the distance of the moon from the sun, and that the density of the light must decrease in the proportion of the square of that distance, he calculated the density of the sun's light, at that distance, in proportion to its density at the surface of the sun; and in this manner he found, that if the moon reflected all the light it receives from the sun, it would only be the 45,000th part of the light we receive from the greater luminary. Admitting, therefore, that moon light is only a 300,000th part of the light of the sun, Mr Michell concludes, that it reflects no more than between the 6th and 7th part of what falls upon it.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Rumford, has constructed a photometer, in which the shadows, instead of being thrown upon a photometer paper spread out upon the wainscot, or side of the room, are projected upon the inside of the back part of\nApparatus of a wooden box \\(7\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches wide, \\(10\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches long, and \\(3\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches deep, in the clear. The light is admitted into it through two horizontal tubes in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a>, placed so as to form an angle of \\(6^\\circ\\); their axes meeting at the centre of the field of the instrument. In the middle of the front of the box, between these two tubes, is an opening through which is viewed the field of the photometer (see fig. 5). This field is formed of a piece of white paper, which is not fastened immediately upon the inside of the back of the box, but is pasted upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> pane of very fine ground glass; and this glass, thus covered, is let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a>, made to receive it, in the back of the box. The whole inside of the box, except the field of the instrument, is painted of a deep black dead <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>.\n\nTo the under part of the box is fitted a bail and socket, by which it is attached to a stand which supports it; and the top or lid of it is fitted with hinges, in order that the box may be laid quite open, as often as it is necessary to alter any part of the machinery it contains.\n\nThe count had found it very inconvenient to compare two shadows projected by the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>, as these were either necessarily too far from each other to be compared with certainty, or, when they were nearer, were in part hid from the eye by the cylinder. To remedy this inconvenience, he now makes use of two cylinders, which are placed perpendicularly in the bottom of the box <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> described, in a line parallel to the back part of it, distant from this back \\(2\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches, and from each other \\(3\\) inches, measuring from the centres of the cylinders; when the two lights made use of in the experiment are properly placed, these two cylinders project four shadows upon the white paper upon the inside of the back part of the box, or the field of the instrument; two of which shadows are in contact, precisely in the middle of that field, and it is these two alone that are to be attended to. To prevent the attention being distracted by the presence of unnecessary objects, the two outside shadows are made to disappear; which is done by rendering the field of the instrument so narrow, that they fall without it, upon a blackened surface, upon which they are not visible. If the cylinders be each \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of an inch in diameter, and \\(2\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches in height, it will be quite sufficient that the field be \\(2\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches wide; and as an unnecessary height of the field is not only useless, but disadvantageous, as a large surface of white paper not covered by the shadows produces too strong a glare of light, the field ought not to be more than \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) of an inch higher than the tops of the cylinders. That its dimensions, however, may be occasionally augmented, the covered glass should be made \\(5\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches long, and as wide as the box is deep, viz. \\(3\\frac{1}{4}\\) inches; since the field of the instrument can be reduced to its proper size by a screen of black plateboard, interposed before the anterior surface of this covered glass, and resting immediately upon it. A hole in this plateboard, in the form of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> square, \\(1\\frac{1}{8}\\) inch wide, and two inches high, determines the dimensions, and forms the boundaries of the field. This screen should be large enough to cover the whole inside of the back of the box, and it may be fixed in its place by means of grooves in the sides of the box, into which it may be made to enter. The position of the opening above-mentioned is determined by the height of the cylinders; the top of it being \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) of an inch higher than the tops of the cylinders; and as the height of it is only two inches, while the height of the cylinders is \\(2\\frac{1}{8}\\) inches, it is evident that the shadows of the lower parts of the cylinders do not enter the field. No inconvenience arises from that circumstance; on the contrary, several advantages are derived from that arrangement.\n\nThat the lights may be placed with facility and precision, a fine black line is drawn through the middle of the field, from the top to the bottom of it, and another (horizontal) line at right angles to it, at the height of the top of the cylinders. When the tops of the shadows touch this last mentioned line, the lights are at a proper height; and farther, when the two shadows are in contact with each other in the middle of the field, the lights are then in their proper directions.\n\nWe have said that the cylinders, by which the shadows are projected, are placed perpendicularly in the bottom of the box; but as the diameters of the shadows of these cylinders vary in some degree, in proportion as the lights are broader or narrower, and as they are brought nearer to or removed farther from the photometer, in order to be able in all cases to bring these shadows to be of the same diameter, which is very advantageous, in order to judge with greater facility and certainty when they are of the same density, the count renders the cylinders moveable about their axes, and adds to each a vertical wing \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of an inch wide, \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) of an inch thick, and of equal height with the cylinder itself, and firmly fixed to it from the top to the bottom. This wing commonly lies in the middle of the shadow of the cylinder, and as long as it remains in that situation it has no effect whatever; but when it is necessary that the diameter of one of the shadows be increased, the corresponding cylinder is moved about its axis, till the wing just described, emerging out of the shadow, and intercepting a portion of light, brings the shadow projected upon the field of the instrument to be of the width or diameter required. In this operation it is always necessary to turn the cylinder outwards, or in such a manner that the augmentation of the width of the shadow may take place on that side of it which is opposite to the shadow corresponding to the other light. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> for that precaution will appear evident to any one who has a just idea of the instrument in question, and of the manner of making use of it. They are turned likewise without opening the box, by taking hold of the ends of their axes, which project below its bottom.\n\nAs it is absolutely necessary that the cylinders should constantly remain precisely perpendicular to the bottom of the box, or parallel to each other, it will be best to construct them of brass; and, instead of fixing them immediately to the bottom of the box (which, being of wood, may warp), to fix them to a strong thick piece of well-hammered plate brass; which plate of brass may be afterwards fastened to the bottom of the box by means of one strong screw. In this manner two of the count's best instruments are constructed; and, in order to secure the cylinders still more firmly in their vertical positions, they are furnished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> flat rings, or projections, where they rest upon the brass plate; which rings are \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) of an inch thick, and equal in diameter to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a> of the wing of the cylinder, to the bottom of which they afford a firm support. These cylinders are likewise forcibly pushed, or rather pulled, against\nApparatus against the brass plate upon which they rest, by means of compressed spiral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> placed between the under side of that plate and the lower ends of the cylinders.\n\nOf whatever material the cylinders be constructed, and whatever be their forms or dimensions, it is absolutely necessary that they, as well as every other part of the photometer, except the field, should be well painted of a deep black dead colour.\n\nIn order to move the lights to and from the photometer with greater ease and precision, the observer should provide two long and narrow, but very strong and steady, tables; in the middle of each of which there is a straight groove, in which a sliding carriage, upon which the light is placed, is drawn along by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> which is fastened to it before and behind, and which, passing over pulleys at each end of the table, goes round a cylinder; which cylinder is furnished with a wheel, and is so placed, near the end of the table adjoining the photometer, that the observer can turn it about, without taking his eye from the field of the instrument.\n\nMany advantages are derived from this arrangement: First, the observer can move the lights as he finds necessary, without the help of an assistant, and even without removing his eye from the shadows; secondly, each light is always precisely in the line of direction in which it ought to be, in order that the shadows may be in contact in the middle of the vertical plane of the photometer; and, thirdly, the sliding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the lights being perfectly soft and gentle, that motion produces little or no effect upon the lights themselves, either to increase or diminish their brilliancy.\n\nThese tables must be placed at an angle of 60 degrees from each other, and in such a situation, with respect to the photometer, that lines drawn through their middles, in the direction of their lengths, meet in a point exactly under the middle of the vertical plane or field of the photometer, and from that point the distances of the lights are measured; the sides of the tables being divided into English inches, and a vernier, showing tenths of inches, being fixed to each of the sliding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a> upon which the lights are placed, and which are so contrived that they may be raised or lowered at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>; so that the lights may be always in a horizontal line with the tops of the cylinders of the photometer.\n\nIn order that the two long and narrow tables or platforms, just described, may remain immovable in their proper positions, they are both firmly fixed to the stand which supports the photometer; and, in order that the motion of the carriages which carry the lights may be as soft and gentle as possible, they are made to slide upon parallel brass wires, 9 inches apart, about 1/4 of an inch in diameter, and well polished, which are stretched out upon the tables from one end to the other.\n\nThe structure of the apparatus will be clearly understood by a bare inspection of Plate CCCCLXXXIX.\n\nFig. 5. is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of the inside of the box, and the adjoining parts of the photometer. Fig. 6. Plan of the two tables belonging to the photometer. Fig. 7. The box of the photometer on its stand. Fig. 8. Elevation of the photometer, with one of the tables and carriages.\n\nHaving sufficiently explained all the essential parts of this photometer, it remains for us to give some account of the precautions necessary to be observed in using it. And, first, with respect to the distance at which lights, whose intensities are to be compared, should be placed from the field of the instrument, the ingenious and accurate inventor found, that when the weakest of the lights in question is about as strong as a common wax candle, that light may most advantageously be placed from 30 to 36 inches from the centre of the field; and when it is weaker or stronger, proportionally nearer or farther off. When the lights are too near, the shadows will not be well defined; and when they are too far off, they will be too weak.\n\nIt will greatly facilitate the calculations necessary in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> conclusions from experiments of this kind, if some steady light, of a proper degree of strength for that purpose, be assumed as a standard by which all others may be compared. Our author found a good Argand's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a> much preferable for this purpose to any other lamp or candle whatever. As it appears, he says, from a number of experiments, that the quantity of light emitted by a lamp, which burns in the same manner with a clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>, and without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>, is in all cases as the quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> consumed, there is much reason to suppose, that, if the Argand's lamp be so adjusted as always to consume a given quantity of oil in a given time, it may then be depended on as a just standard of light.\n\nIn order to abridge the calculation necessary in these inquiries, it will always be advantageous to place the standard-lamp at the distance of 100 inches from the photometer, and to assume the intensity of its light at its source equal to unity; in this case (calling this standard light A), the intensity of the light at its source \\(= x = 1\\), and the distance of the lamp from the field of the photometer \\(= m = 100\\); the intensity of the illumination at the field of the photometer \\(\\left(=\\frac{x}{m^2}\\right)\\) will be expressed by the fraction \\(\\frac{1}{10000}\\); and the relative intensity of any other light which is compared with it, may be found by the following proportion: Calling this light B, putting \\(y\\) = its intensity at its source, and \\(n\\) = its distance from the field of the photometer, expressed in English inches, as it is \\(\\frac{y}{n^2} = \\frac{x}{m^2}\\), or, instead of \\(\\frac{x}{m^2}\\), <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> its value \\(\\frac{1}{10000}\\), it will be \\(\\frac{y}{n^2} = \\frac{1}{10000}\\); and consequently \\(y\\) is to 1 as \\(n^2\\) is to 10000; or the intensity of the light B at its source, is to the intensity of the standard light A at its source, as the square of the distance of the light B from the middle of the field of the instrument, expressed in inches, is to 10000; and hence it is \\(y = \\frac{n^2}{10000}\\).\n\nOr, if the light of the sun, or that of the moon, be compared with the light of a given lamp or candle C, the result of such comparison may be best expressed in words, by saying, that the light of the celestial luminary in question, at the surface of the earth, or, which is the same thing, at the field of the photometer, is equal to the light of the given lamp or candle, at the distance found by the experiment; or, putting \\(a\\) = the intensity of the light of this lamp C at its source, and \\(p\\) = its distance,\nApparatus distance, in inches, from the field, when the shadows corresponding to this light, and that corresponding to the celestial luminary in question, are found to be of equal densities, and putting \\( z \\) = the intensity of the rays of the luminary at the surface of the earth, the result of the experiment may be expressed thus, \\( z = \\frac{a}{p^2} \\);\n\nor the real value of \\( a \\) being determined by a particular experiment, made expressly for that purpose with the standard lamp, that value may be written instead of it. When the standard lamp itself is made use of, instead of the lamp C, then the value of \\( A \\) will be 1.\n\nThe count's first attempts with his photometer were to determine how far it might be possible to ascertain, by direct experiments, the certainty of the assumed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of the diminution of the intensity of the light emitted by luminous bodies; namely, that the intensity of the light is everywhere as the squares of the distances from the luminous body inversely. As it is obvious that this law can hold good only when the light is propagated through perfectly transparent spaces, so that its intensity is weakened merely by the divergency of its rays, he instituted a set of experiments to ascertain the transparency of the air and other mediums.\n\nWith this view, two equal wax candles, well trimmed, and which were found, by a previous experiment, to burn with exactly the same degree of brightness, were placed together, on one side, before the photometer, and their united light was counterbalanced by the light of an Argand's lamp, well trimmed, and burning very equally, placed on the other side over against them. The lamp was placed at the distance of 100 inches from the field of the photometer, and it was found that the two burning candles (which were placed as near together as possible, without their flames affecting each other by the currents of air they produced) were just able to counterbalance the light of the lamp at the field of the photometer, when they were placed at the distance of 60.8 inches from that field. One of the candles being now taken away and extinguished, the other was brought nearer to the field of the instrument, till its light was found to be just able, singly, to counterbalance the light of the lamp; and this was found to happen when it had arrived at the distance of 43.4 inches. In this experiment, as the candles burnt with equal brightness, it is evident that the intensities of their united and single lights were as 2 to 1; and in that proportion ought, according to the assumed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, the squares of the distances, 60.8 and 43.4, to be; and, in fact, \\( 60.8^2 = 3696.64 \\) is to \\( 43.4^2 = 1883.56 \\) as 2 is to 1 very nearly.\n\nAgain, in another experiment, the distances were,\n\n| With two candles | 54 inches.

For if the intensity of a light emitted by a luminous body, in a space void of all refraction, be diminished in the proportion of the squares of the distances, it must of necessity be diminished in a still higher ratio when the light passes through a refracting medium, or one which is not perfectly transparent; and from the difference of those ratios, namely, that of the squares of the distances, and that other higher ratio found by the experiment, the resistance of the medium might be ascertained. This he took much pains to do with respect to air, but did not succeed; the transparency of air being so great, that the diminution which light suffers in passing through a few inches, or even through several feet of it, is not sensible.\n\nHaving found, upon repeated trials, that the light of a lamp, properly trimmed, is incomparably more equal than that of a candle, whose wick, continually growing longer, renders its light extremely fluctuating, he substituted lamps to candles in these experiments, and made such other variations in the manner of conducting them as he thought bid fair to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to a discovery of the resistance of the air to light, were it possible to render that resistance sensible within the confined limits of his machinery. But the results of them, so far affording means for ascertaining the resistance of the air to light, do not even indicate any refraction at all; on the contrary, it might almost be inferred, from some of them, that the intensity of the light emitted by a luminous body in air is diminished in a ratio less than that of the squares of the distances; but as such a conclusion would involve an evident absurdity, namely, that light moving in air, its absolute quantity, instead of being diminished, actually goes on to increase, that conclusion can by no means be admitted.\n\nWhy not? Theories must give place to facts; and if this fact can be fairly ascertained, instead of rejecting the conclusion, we ought certainly to rectify our notions of light, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of which we believe no man fully comprehends. Who can take it upon him to say, that the substance of light is not latent in the atmosphere, as heat or caloric is now acknowledged to be latent, and that the agency of the former is not called forth by the passage of a ray through a portion of air, as the agency of the latter is known to be excited by\nPart III.","sp":289,"ep":301},{"h":"EXPLANATION OF PLATES CCCLXXI","t":"CCCLXXII, CCCLXXIII, AND CCCLXXIV.\n\nFig. 1.

At present we shall treat only upon the former. And now, that one thing may receive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> from another, it is necessary that some relation between them; for all things are adapted to prove one another.

Because it is the certain known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of all quantities, that whatsoever two things are equal to a third, are equal to one another; and where one of any two things is equal to a third, and the other unequal, those two things are unequal to one another. What has been said of quantities,\nto have taught oratory, whom he also places among the rhetoricians, and whose Eight Books of Medicine are yet extant, written in so beautiful a style as plainly shows him to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of eloquence. But Qui himself outdid all who went before him in diligence and accuracy as a writer. His Institutions are so comprehensive, and written with such great exactness and judgement, that they are generally allowed to be the most perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of the kind. With this excellent author we shall finish the account of the Latin rhetoricians.\n\nThere were indeed some others in the following whole works are yet extant; but as they contain nothing of moment which is not to be found in those already mentioned, we shall forbear to name them. Must we defend to that numerous body of writers since the revival of learning have treated upon the subject, for the same reason. And a very good judge not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> since given it as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that the art of forming the best system of oratory, is to collect from the finest precepts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, Cicero, Quintilian, Longinus, and other celebrated authors; with examples taken from the choicest parts of the purity of antiquity. And this is the method attempted to be used in the following treatise.\n\n\u00a7 2. Of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> of Oratory.\n\nThe terms <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a> and oratory, having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other difference but that one is taken from the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> and the other from the Latin, may be used promiscuously; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is not the same with respect to words rhetorician and orator. For although the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> used the former, both to express those who knew the art, and those who professed it; yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> afterward, when they took that word into their language, confined it to the teachers of the art, and called them orators. And there seems to have been a sufficient reason for this distinction, since the art was the same in both, and might therefore go by either name; but different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of rhetoricians and orators made it improper that they should be called by different names. Besides, anciently, before rhetoric was made a separate and distinct art from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, the same persons used both. And then they were called not only rhetors but sophists. But because they often employed the art rather to vindicate what was false and unjust, than to support <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>; this disingenuous conduct which they frequently imposed upon weak minds brought a discredit both upon themselves and their profession. And therefore the name sophist or sophistic has been more generally used in an ill <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, to signify skilled rather in the arts of cavilling, than qualified to speak well and accurately upon any subject.\n\nIt is not necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> many words, to prove oratory is an art. For it is comprised under certain rules, agreeable to reason, delivered in a regular method, and fitted to attain the end it proposes; these are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> sufficient to denominate it an art; indeed the case is the same here as in most other things, that a good genius is of itself more serviceable than the most exact acquaintance with all the rules of art, where that is wanting. But it is sufficient that art helps nature, and carry it farther than it can otherwise advance without it. And he who is desirous to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> the reputation of a good orator, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> find the assistance of art very necessary. Some persons have thought, that many of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> systems written upon the subject...\ncife account of things is often attended with obscurity, from an omission of some necessary circumstances relating to them. Or, however, where that is not the case, yet for want of proper embellishments to enliven the discourse, and thereby to excite and fix the hearers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, it is apt to slip through their minds without leaving any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>. But where the images of things are drawn in their full proportion, painted in their proper colours, set in a clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, and represented in different views, with all the strength and beauties of eloquence, they captivate the minds of the audience with the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, engage their attention, and by an irresistible force move and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> them to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of the speaker.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> end and design of oratory is to persuade: for which reason it is frequently called the art of persuasion. Indeed the orator has often other subordinate views; as when he endeavours either to delight his hearers with what is pleasant and agreeable, or to conciliate their good opinion by a smooth and artful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>: but still both these are in order to persuade and excite them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>.\n\nAn objection may, perhaps, hence be formed against eloquence, as an art which may be employed for persuading to ill as well as to good. There is no doubt that it may; and so reasoning may also be, and too often is, employed for leading men into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>. But who would think of forming an argument from this against the cultivation of our reasoning powers? Reason, eloquence, and every art which ever has been studied among mankind, may be abused, and may prove dangerous in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of bad men; but it were perfectly childish to contend, that upon this account they ought to be abolished.\n\nWhile the orator employs his art in pursuing only those ends for which it was at first designed, the persuading men to good and virtuous actions, and diffusing them from every thing that is ill and vicious; nothing can be more commendable in itself, or useful to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>.\n\n\u00a7 3. Of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">Division</a> of Oratory.\n\nOratory consists of four parts: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, disposition, elocution, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRONUNCIATION\">pronunciation</a>. This will appear by considering the nature of each of them, and what it contributes in forming an orator. Every one who aims to speak well and accurately upon any subject, does naturally in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> inquire after and pursue such thoughts as may seem most proper to explain and illustrate the thing upon which he designs to discourse. And if the nature of it requires that he should bring reasons to confirm what he says, he not only seeks the strongest, and such as are likely to be best received; but also prepares to answer any thing which may be offered to the contrary. This is invention.\u2014After this he deliberates with himself in what method to dispose of those things which have occurred to his mind, that they may appear in the plainest light, and not lose their force by disorder and confusion.\u2014This is the business of disposition.\u2014His next concern is to give his thoughts an agreeable dress; by making choice of the fittest words, clearest expressions, smooth and harmonious periods, with other ornaments of style, as may best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> the nature of his subject, brighten his discourse, and render it most entertaining to his hearers. And this is called elocution.\u2014The last thing he attends to, is to deliver what he has thus composed, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> and agreeable pronunciation. And daily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> convinces us, how much this contributes both to engage the attention and impress what is spoken upon the mind. This then is the method to which nature directs, in order to qualify ourselves for discoursing to the best advantage: Though by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> these things become so familiar to us, that we do not always attend to them separately in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> order. However, it is the business of art to follow nature, and to treat of things in that manner which she dictates.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">Part</a> I. Of Invention.\n\nChap. I. Of Invention in general; and particularly of Common Places, and State of a Cause.\n\nInvention, considered in general, is the discovery of such things as are proper to persuade. And in order to attain this end, the orator proposes to himself three things: To prove or illustrate the subject upon which he treats; to conciliate the minds of his hearers; and to engage their passions in his favour. And as these require different kinds of arguments or motives, invention furnishes him with a supply for each of them, as will be shown in their order.\n\nAn argument, as defined by Cicero, is a reason which induces us to believe what before we doubted of.\n\nAnd as different kinds of discourses require different arguments, rhetoricians have considered them two ways; in general, under certain heads, as a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> for all subjects; and in a more particular manner, as they are suited to demonstrative, deliberative, or judicial discourses. At present we shall treat only upon the former of these. And now, that one thing may receive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> and confirmation from another, it is necessary that there be some relation between them; for all things are not equally adapted to prove one another. Thus, in measuring the quantity of two things which we would show to be either equal or unequal, if they are of such a nature that one cannot be applied to the other, then we take a third thing, which may be applied to them both; and that must be equal at least to one of the two, which if applied to the other, and found equal to that also, we presently conclude that these two things are equal; but if it be unequal to the other, we say that these two things are unequal. Because it is the certain and known property of all quantities, that whatsoever two things are equal to a third, are equal to one another; and where one of any two things is equal to a third, and the other unequal, those two things are unequal to one another. What has been said of quantities,\nInvention will hold true in all other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, so far as any two things or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> agree to a third, so far they agree to one another. So likewise, on the contrary, as far as one of any two things or ideas does agree to a third, as the other does not, so far they disagree with one another; in which respect, one of them cannot be truly affirmed of the other. Since, therefore, in every proposition, one thing is spoken of another, if we would find out whether the two ideas agree to each other or not, where this is not evident of itself, we must find out some third thing, the idea of which agrees to one of them; and then that being applied to the other, as it does agree or disagree with it, so we may conclude, that the two things proposed do agree or disagree with one another. This will be made more clear by an example or two.\n\nShould it be inquired, Whether virtue is to be loved; the argument between virtue and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> might be found by comparing them separately with each other, as a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> to both. For since the idea of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> agrees to that of love, and the idea of virtue to that of happiness; it follows, that the ideas of virtue and love agree to one another; and therefore it may be affirmed, That virtue is to be loved. But, on the contrary, because the idea of misery disagrees with that of love, but the idea of vice agrees to that of misery, the two ideas of vice and love must consequently disagree with one another; and therefore it would be false to affirm, That vice is to be loved. Now, this third thing logicians call the medium, or middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, because it does as it were connect two extremes; that is, both parts of a proposition. But rhetoricians call it an argument, because it is so applied to what was before proposed, as to become the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of procuring our assent to it. Thus far as to the nature and use of arguments. We shall next explain by what methods they are to be sought.\n\nA lively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, and readiness of thought, are undoubtedly a very great help to invention. Some persons are naturally endowed with that quickness of fancy, and penetration of mind that they are seldom at a loss for arguments either to defend their own opinions, or to attack their adversaries. However, these things being the gift of nature, and not to be gained by art, do not properly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> under our present consideration.\n\nIt will be readily granted, that great learning and extensive knowledge are a noble fund for invention. An orator therefore should be furnished with a stock of important truths, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> maxims of reason, and a variety of knowledge, collected and treasured up both from observation and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> acquaintance with the liberal arts, that he may not only be qualified to express himself in the most agreeable manner, but likewise to support what he says with the strongest and clearest arguments.\n\nBut because all are not born with a like happy genius, and had not the same opportunity to cultivate their minds with learning and knowledge; and because nothing is more difficult than to dwell long upon the consideration of one thing, in order to find out the strongest arguments which may be offered for and against it; upon these accounts, art has prescribed a method to lessen, in some measure, these difficulties, and help every one to a supply of arguments upon any subject. And this is done by the contrivance of common places, which Cicero calls the feats or heads of arguments, and by a Greek name topoi. They are of two sorts, internal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a>.\n\nI. Internal topics. Though things, with regard to rules of art their nature and properties, are exceedingly various, to supply yet they have certain common relations, by means of the place whereof the truth of what is either affirmed or denied concerning them in any respect may be evinced. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Greek rhetoricians therefore reduced these relations to some general heads, which are termed loci or common places; because the reasons or arguments fitted to prove any proposition are resorted in them, as a common fund or receptacle. And they are called internal heads, because they arise from the subject upon which the orator treats; and are therefore distinguished from others named external, which he fetches from without, and applies to his present purpose, as will be shown hereafter. Cicero and Quintilian make them 16; three of which comprehend the whole thing they are brought to prove, namely, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a>, enumeration, and notation; of the remaining 13, some contain a part of it, and the rest its various properties and circumstances, with other considerations relating to it; and these are, genus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, antecedents, consequents, adjuncts, conjunctions, causes, effects, contraries, opposites, similitude, dissimilitude, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>.\n\nDefinition explains the nature of the thing defined, and shows what it is. And to whatsoever the definition agrees, the thing defined does likewise. If therefore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a> be a rational creature, he is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>; because it is the definition of a man, that he is a rational creature.\n\nEnumeration takes in all the parts of a thing. And from this we prove, that what agrees to all the parts agrees to the whole; and what does not agree to any one or more parts, does not agree to the whole: As when Cicero proves to Philo that all the Roman state hated him, by enumerating the several ranks and orders of Roman citizens who all did so.\n\nNotation, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">etymology</a>, explains the meaning or signification of a word. From which we reason thus: \"If he cannot pay his debts, he is insolvent;\" for that is the meaning of the word insolvent.\n\nGenus is what contains under it two or more sorts of things, differing in nature. From this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> logicians reason thus: \"Because every animal is mortal, and man is an animal, therefore man is mortal.\" But orators make a further use of this argument, which they call ascending from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THESIS\">thesis</a>; that is, from a particular to a general: As should a person, when speaking in praise of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, take occasion from thence to commend and show the excellency of virtue in general, with a view to render that particular virtue more amiable. For since every species contains in it the whole nature of the genus to which it relates, besides what is peculiar to itself, whereby it is distinguished from it; what is affirmed of the genus, must of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> be applicable to the species.\n\nSpecies is that which comprehends under it all the individuals of the same nature. From hence we may argue, \"He is a man, therefore he has a rational <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>.\" And orators sometimes take occasion from this head to descend from the thesis to the hypothesis;\nInvention: that is, in treating upon what is more general, to introduce some particular contained under it, for the greater illustration of the general.\n\nAntecedents are such things as, being once allowed, necessarily or very probably follow. From this head an inseparable property is proved from its subject: as, It is material, and therefore corruptible.\n\nConsequents are such things as, being allowed, necessarily or very probably infer their antecedents. Hence the subject is proved from an inseparable property, in this manner: It is corruptible, and therefore material.\n\nAdjuncts are separable properties of things, or circumstances that attend them. There are very numerous, and afford a great variety of arguments, some of which usually occur in every discourse. They do not necessarily infer their subject; but, if fitly chosen, render a thing credible, and are a sufficient ground for assent. The way of reasoning from them we shall show presently.\n\nConjugates are words deduced from the same origin with that of our subject. By these the habit is proved from its acts: as, He who does justly is just. He does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> wisely, therefore he is not wise. But this inference will not hold, unless the actions appear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> and constant.\n\nA cause is that, by the force of which a thing does exist. There are four kinds of causes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, form, efficient, and end, which afford a great variety of arguments. The way of reasoning from them is to infer the effect from the cause: as, Man is endowed with reason, therefore he is capable of knowledge.\n\nAn effect is that which arises from a cause, therefore the cause is proved by it: as, He is endowed with knowledge, therefore with reason.\n\nContraries are things, which, under the same genus, are at the utmost distance from each other; so that what we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> to the one, we utterly deny the other: as Virtue ought to be embraced, therefore vice should be avoided.\n\nOpposites are such things, which, though repugnant to each other, yet are not directly contradictory; as, To love and to injure, to hate and to commend. They differ from contraries in this, that they do not absolutely exclude one another. An argument is drawn from things repugnant, thus: He will do a man mischief, therefore he does not love him. He loves a man, therefore he will not reproach him.\n\nSimilitude is an agreement of things in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. Thus Cicero proves, that pernicious citizens ought to be taken out of the state, by the likeness they bear to corrupted members, which are cut off to prevent further damage to the body.\n\nDiffinitiude is a disagreement of things in quality. From this head Cicero shows the preference of his own exile to Piso's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACEDONIA\">Macedonia</a>; by the difference between their conduct, and the people's esteem of them.\n\nComparison is made three ways: for either a thing is compared with a greater, with a less, or with its equal. This place, therefore, differs from that of similitude on this account, that the quality was considered in that, but here the quantity. An argument from the greater is thus drawn: If five legions could not conquer the enemy, much less will two.\n\nWe shall just give one example of the manner of invention: reasoning from these heads, whereby the use of them may farther appear. If any one, therefore, should have endeavoured to persuade Cicero not to accept of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> upon the condition offered him by Antony, rising from that he would burn his Philippic orations which had these heads been spoken against him, he might be supposed to use such arguments as these; partly taken from the adjuncts of Cicero, partly from those of Antony, and partly from the thing itself. And first with regard to Cicero, it might be said, That so great a man ought not to purchase his life at so dear a price as the loss of that immortal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> which by so great pains and labour he had acquired. And this might be confirmed by another argument, That now he was grown old, and could not expect to live much longer. And from the character of Antony he might argue thus: That he was very crafty and deceitful; and only designed, by giving him hopes of life, to have the Philippics set burnt, which otherwise he knew would transmit to posterity an eternal brand of infamy upon him; and then he would take off the author. And this might be shown by comparison. For since he would not spare others, who had not so highly exasperated him, and from whom he had not so much to fear; certainly he would not forgive Cicero, since he knew well enough, that so long as he lived, he himself could never be in safety. And, lastly, An argument might also be fetched from the nature of the thing itself in the following manner: That Cicero, by this action would shamefully betray the state, and the cause of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, which he had through his whole life most courageously defended, with so great honour to himself, and advantage to the public. Upon such an account, a person might have used these or the like arguments with Cicero, which arise from the fore-mentioned heads.\n\nFrom this account of common places, it is easy to conceive what a large field of discourse they open to the soul mind upon every subject. At the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, though we have mentioned them from our respect for the orators of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> and Rome, we heartily subscribe to the opinion of a celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a>, who gives of them the following account:\n\n\"The Grecian sophists were the first inventors of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> system of oratory; and they showed a prodigious subtlety and fertility in the contrivance of these loci. Succeeding rhetoricians, dazzled by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, wrought them into a regular system, that one would think they meant to teach how a person might mechanically become an orator, without any genius at all. They gave him receipts for making speeches on all manner of subjects. At the same time, it is evident, that though this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of common places might produce very learned, showy academical declamations, it could never produce useful discourses on real business. The loci indeed supplied a most exuberant fecundity of matter. One who had no other aim, but to talk copiously and plentifully, by consulting them on every subject, and laying hold of all that they suggested, might discourse without end; and that too, though he had none but the most superficial knowledge of his subject. But such discourse could be no other than trivial. What is truly solid and persuasive, must be drawn ex subjectu causae, from a thorough knowledge of the subject, and profound meditation on it. They who would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> students of oratory...\"\nInvention to any other sources of argumentation, only deduce them; and by attempting to render rhetoric too perfect an art, they render it, in truth, a trilling and childish study.\"\n\nII. Of external topics. When the orator reasons from such topics as do not arise from his subject, but from things of a different nature, these are called external. They are all taken from authorities, and are by one general name called testimonies.\n\nNow a testimony may be expressed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, speech, or any other sign proper to declare a person's mind. And all testimonies may be distinguished into two sorts, divine and human. A divine testimony, when certainly known to be such, is incontestable, and admits of no debate, but should be acquiesced in without hesitation. Indeed the ancient Greeks and Romans esteemed the pretended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORACLES\">oracles</a> of their deities, the answers of their augurs, and the like fallacies, divine testimonies; but with us no one can be ignorant of their true notion, though they do not directly come under our present consideration. Human testimonies, considered as furnishing the orator with arguments, may be reduced to three heads; writings, witness, and contracts.\n\n1. By Writings, here, are to be understood written laws, wills, or other legal instruments, expressed and conveyed in that manner. And it is not so much the force and validity of such testimonies, considered in themselves, that is here intended, as the occasion of dispute which may at any time arise concerning their true design and import, when produced in proof upon either side of a controversy. And these are five; Ambiguity, Disagreement between the words and intention, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRARIETY\">Contrariety</a>, Reasoning, and Interpretation.\n\nA writing is then said to be ambiguous, when it is capable of two or more senses, which makes the writer's design uncertain. Now ambiguity may arise either from single words, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of sentences. From single words; as when either the sense of a word, or the application of it, is doubtful. As, should it be questioned, whether ready <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> ought to be included under the appellation of chattels left by a will; or, if a testator bequeath a certain legacy to his nephew Thomas, and he has two nephews of that name. But ambiguity is also sometimes occasioned from the construction of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a>; as when several things or persons having been already mentioned, it is doubtful to which of them that which follows ought to be referred. For example, a person writes thus in his will: 'Let my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> give as a legacy to Titus a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> out of my stable, which he pleases.' Here it may be questioned, whether the word he refers to the heir or to Titus; and consequently, whether the heir be allowed to give Titus which horse he pleases, or Titus may choose which he likes best. Now as to controversies of this kind, in the first case above mentioned, the party who claims the chattels may plead, that all moveable goods come under that name, and therefore that he has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to the money. This he will endeavour to prove from some instances where the word has been so used. The benefits of the opposite party is to refuse this, by showing that money is not there included. And if either side produce precedents in his favour, the other may endeavour to show that the cases are not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a>. As to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> case, arising from an ambiguity in the name, if any other invention, words or expressions in the will seem to countenance either of the claimants, he will not fail to interpret them to his advantage. So likewise, if any thing said by the testator, in his lifetime, or any regard shown to either of these nephews more than the other, may help to determine which of them was intended, a proper use may be made of it. And the same may be laid with regard to the third case. In which the legatee may rely on likewise from the common use of language, and show that in such expressions it is usual to make the reference to the last or next antecedent; and from thence plead, that it was the design of the testator to give him the option. But in answer to this, it may be said, that allowing it to be very often so, yet in this instance it seems more easy and natural to repeat the verb give after pleases, and so to supply the sentence, which he pleases to give him, referring it to the heir, than to bring in the verb chooses, which was not in the sentence before; and so, by flippantly the sense, which he pleases to choose, to give the option to Titus. But where controversies of this kind arise from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, recourse may be had to other laws where the same thing has been expressed with greater clearness; which may help to determine the sense of the passage in dispute.\n\nA second controversy from writings is, when one party adheres to the words, and the other to what he affirms was the writer's intention. Now he who opposes the literal sense, either contends, that what he himself offers is the simple and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> meaning of the writing, or that it must be so understood in the particular case in dispute. An instance of the former is this, as we find it in Cicero. A person who died without children, but left a widow, had made this provision in his will: \"If I have a son born to me, he shall be my heir.\" And a little after: \"If my son die before he comes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, let Curius be my heir.\" There is no son born: Curius therefore sues for the estate, and pleads the intention of the testator, who designed him for his heir, if he should have no son who arrived at age; and says, there can be no reason to suppose he did not intend the same person for his heir if he had no son, as if he should have one who afterwards died in his minority. But the heir at law insists upon the words of the will; which, as he says, require, that first a son should be born, and afterwards die under age, before Curius can succeed to the inheritance; and there being no son, a substituted heir, as Curius was, can have no claim where the first heir does not exist, from whom he derives his pretension, and was to succeed by the appointment of the will.\u2014Of the latter case, rhetoricians give this example: \"It was forbidden by a law to open the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> gates in the night. A certain person notwithstanding, in time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, did open them in the night, and let in some auxiliary troops, to prevent their being cut off by the enemy, who was posted near the town.\" Afterwards, when the war was over, this person is arraigned, and tried for his life, on account of this action. Now, in such a case, the prosecutor founds his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> upon the express words of the law; and pleads, that no sufficient reason can be assigned for going contrary to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> of it, which would be to make a new law, and not to execute one already made. The defendant, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, alleges, That the fact he is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a>\nwith cannot, however, come within the intention of the law; since he either could not, or ought not, to have complied with the letter of it in that particular case, which must therefore necessarily be supposed to have been excepted in the design of that law when it was made. But to this the prosecutor may reply, That all such exceptions as are intended by any law, are usually expressed in it: and instances may be brought of particular exceptions expressed in some laws; and if there be any such exception in the law under debate, it should especially be mentioned. He may further add, That to admit of exceptions not expressed in the law itself, is to enervate the force of all laws, by explaining them away, and in effect to render them useless. And this he may further corroborate, by comparing the law under debate with others, and considering its nature and importance, and how far the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of the state is concerned in the due and regular execution of it; from whence he may infer, that should exceptions be admitted in other laws of less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, yet, however, they ought not in this. Lastly, He may consider the reason alleged by the defendant, on which he founds his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEA\">plea</a>, and show there was not that necessity of violating the law in the present case, as is pretended. And this is often the more requisite, because the party who disputes against the words of the law, always endeavours to support his allegations from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a> of the case. If, therefore, this plea can be enervated, the main support of the defendant's cause is removed. For as the former arguments are designed to prevail with the judge, to determine the matter on this side the question from the nature of the case; so the intention of this argument is to induce him to it, from the weakness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> made by the opposite party. But the defendant will, on the contrary, use such arguments as may best demonstrate the equity of his cause, and endeavour to vindicate the fact from his good design and intention in doing it. He will say, That the laws have allotted punishments for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of such facts as are evil in themselves, or prejudicial to others; neither of which can be charged upon the action for which he is accused: That no law can be rightly executed, if more regard be had to the words and syllables of the writing, than to the intention of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a>. To which purpose, he may allege that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the law itself, which says, \"The law ought not to be too rigorously interpreted, nor the words of it strained; but the true intention and design of each part of it duly considered.\" As also that saying of Cicero, \"What law may not be weakened and destroyed, if we bend the sense to the words, and do not regard the design and view of the legislator?\" Hence he may take occasion to complain of the hardship of such a procedure, that no difference should be made between an audacious and wilful crime, and an honest or necessary action, which might happen to disagree with the letter of the law, though not with the intent of it. And as it was observed before to be of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to the accuser, if he could remove the defendant's plea of equity, so it will be of equal advantage to the defendant, if he can fix upon any words in the law, which may in the least seem to countenance his case, since this will take off the main force of the charge.\n\nThe third controversy of this kind is, when two writings happen to clash with each other, or at least invention seems to do so. Of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERMOGENES\">Hermogenes</a> gives the following instance. One law enjoins: \"He who continues alone in a ship during a tempest, shall have the property of the ship.\" Another law says, \"A disinherited son shall enjoy no part of his father's estate.\" Now a son, who had been disinherited by his father, happens to be in his father's ship in a tempest, and continues there alone, when every one else had deserted it. He claims the ship by the former of these laws, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> tries his right with him by the latter. In such cases, therefore, it may first be considered, \"Whether the two laws can be reconciled. And if that cannot be done, then, Which of them appears more equitable. Also, Whether one be positive, and the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>: because prohibitions are a sort of exceptions to positive injunctions. Or, If one be a general law, and the other more particular, and come nearer to the matter in question. Likewise, Which was last made: since former laws are often abrogated, either wholly or in part, by subsequent laws; or at least were designed to be so. Lastly, It may be observed, Whether one of the laws be not plain and express; and the other more dubious, or has any ambiguity in it. All, or any of which things, that party will not omit to improve for his advantage whose interest is concerned in it.\n\nThe fourth controversy is reasoning. As when something, not expressly provided for by a law, is inferred by a multitude, or parity of reason, from what is contained in it. Quintilian mentions this instance of it. \"There was a law made at Tarentum, to prohibit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>; but a certain person exports sheep.\" In this case, the prosecutor may first compare the thing which occasions the charge, with the words of the law, and show their agreement, and how unnecessary it was that particular thing should have been expressly mentioned in the law, since it is plainly contained in it, or at least an evident consequence from it. He may then plead, that many things of a like nature are omitted in other laws for the same reason. And, lastly, He may urge the reasonableness and equity of the procedure. The defendant, on the other hand, will endeavour to show the deficiency of the reasoning, and the difference between the two cases. He will insist upon the plain and express words of the law, and set forth the ill tendency of such inferences and conclusions drawn from multitudes and comparisons, since there is scarce anything but in some respect may bear a resemblance to another.\n\nThe last controversy under this head is interpretation, in which the dispute turns upon the true meaning and explication of the law in reference to that particular case. We have the following instance of this in the Pandects: \"A man who had two sons both under age, substitutes Titius as heir to him who should die last, provided both of them died in their minority. They both perish together at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> before they came to age. Here arises a doubt, whether the substitution can take place, or whether the inheritance devolves to the heir at law.\" The latter pleads, That as neither of them can be said to have died last, the substitution cannot take place; which was suspended, upon the condition that one died after the other.\nInvention. But to this it may be said, It was the intention of the testator, that if both died in their natures, Titus should succeed to the inheritance; and therefore it makes no difference whether they died together, or one after the other: and so the law determines it.\n\n2. The second head of external arguments are Witnesses. They may either give their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>, when absent, in writing subscribed with their name; or present, by word of mouth. And what both of them testify, may either be from hearsay; or what they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> themselves, and were present at the time it was done. As the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of the evidence may be thought greater or less on each of these accounts, either party will make such use of it as he finds for his advantage. The characters of the witnesses are also to be considered; and if any thing be found in their lives or behaviour that is justly exceptionable, to invalidate their evidence, it ought not to be omitted. And how they are affected to the contending parties, or either of them, may deserve consideration; for some allowances may be judged reasonable in case of friendship, or enmity, where there is no room for any other exception. But regard should chiefly be had to what they testify, and how far the cause is affected by it. Cicero is very large upon most of these heads in his defence of Marcus Fonteius, with a design to weaken the evidence of the Gauls against him. And where witnesses are produced on one side only, as orators sometimes attempt to lessen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> of this kind of proof, by pleading that witnesses are liable to be corrupted, or baffled by some prevailing interest or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, to which arguments taken from the nature and circumstances of things are not subject; it may be answered on the other hand, that sophistical arguments and false colourings are not exposed to infamy or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, whereas witnesses are restrained by shame and penalties, nor would the law require them if they were not necessary.\n\n3. The third and last head of external arguments are Contracts; which may be either public or private. By public are meant the transactions between different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, as leagues, alliances, and the like; which depend on the laws of nations, and come more properly under deliberative discourses, to which we shall refer them. Those are called private, which relate to lesser bodies or societies of men, and single persons; and may be either written or verbal. And it is not so much the true meaning and purport of them that is here considered as their force and obligation. And, as the Roman law declares, \"Nothing can be more agreeable to human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, than that persons should stand to their agreements.\" Therefore in controversies of this kind, the party whose interest it is that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> should be maintained, will plead, that such covenants have the force of private laws, and ought religiously to be observed, since the common affairs of mankind are transacted in that manner; and therefore to violate them, is to destroy all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> among men. On the other side it may be said, that justice and equity are chiefly to be regarded, which are immutable; and besides, that the public laws are the common rule to determine all differences, which are designed to redress those who are aggrieved. And indeed, where a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> has been obtained by force or fraud, it is in itself void, and has no effect either in law or reason. But on the other hand, the Roman lawyers seem to have very rightly determined, that all such obligations as are founded on natural equity, though not binding by national laws, and are therefore called nuda pacta, ought, however, in honour and confidence, to be performed.\n\nIII. Of the State of a Controversy. The ancients observing that the principal question or point of dilate a controversy in all controversies might be referred to some particular head, reduced their heads to a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, the manner that both the nature of the question might by that means be better known, and the arguments suited to it pal question be discovered with greater ease. And their heads they in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILUTE\">dilute</a> to some call states.\n\nBy the state of a controversy, then, we are to understand the principal point in dilute between contending parties, upon the proof of which the whole cause or content of controversy depends. We find it expressed by several other names in ancient writers; as, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the cause, the general head, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> question. And as this is the principal thing to be attended to in every such discourse; for it is what first requires the consideration of the speaker, and should be well fixed and digested in his mind, before he proceeds to look for arguments proper to support it. Thus Antony, the Roman orator, speaking of his own method in his pleading, says: \"When I understand the nature of the cause, and begin to consider it, the first thing I endeavour to do is, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> with myself what that is to which all my discourse relating to the matter in dispute ought to be referred: then I diligently attend to these other two things, How to recommend myself, or those for whom I plead, to the good esteem of my hearers; and how to influence their minds, as may best suit my design.\" This way of proceeding appears very agreeable to reason and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>. For what can be more absurd, than for a person to attempt the proof of any thing, before he has well settled in his own mind a clear and distinct notion what the thing is which he would endeavour to prove? Quintilian describes it to be, \"That kind of question which arises from the first conflict of causes.\" In judicial cases, it immediately follows upon the charge of the plaintiff, and plea of the defendant. Our common law expresses it by one word, namely the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>. Which interpreters explain, by describing it to be, \"That point of matter depending in suit, whereupon the parties join, and put their cause to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>.\" Examples will further help to illustrate this, and render it more evident. In the cause of Milo, the charge of the Clodian party is, Milo killed Clodius. Milo's plea or defence, I killed him, but justly. From hence arises this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> question, or state of the cause, Whether it was lawful for Milo to kill Clodius? And that Clodius was lawfully killed by Milo, is what Cicero in his defence of Milo principally endeavours to prove. This is the main subject of that fine and beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORATION\">oration</a>. The whole of his discourse is to be considered as centering at last in this one point. Whatever different matters are occasionally mentioned, will, if closely attended to, be found to have been introduced somehow or other the better to support and carry on this design. Now in such cases, where the fact is not denied, but something is offered in its defence, the state of the cause is taken from the defendant's plea, who is obliged to make it good: As in the instance here given, the chief point in dispute was the lawfulness of Milo's action, which it was Cicero's business to demonstrate. But when the defendant denies the fact, the state of\nInvention of the cause arises from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a>; the proof of which then lies upon the plaintiff, and not, as in the former case, upon the defendant. So in the case of Rufius, the charge made against him is, That he killed his father. But he denies the fact. The grand question therefore to be argued is, Whether or not he killed his father? The proof of this lay upon his accusers. And Cicero's design in his defence of him is to show, that they had not made good their charge. But it sometimes happens, that the defendant neither absolutely denies the fact, nor attempts to justify it; but only endeavours to qualify it, by denying that it is a crime of that nature, or deserves that name, by which it is expressed in the charge. We have an example of this proposed by Cicero: \"A person is accused of sacrilege, for taking a thing, that was sacred, out of a private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>. He owns the fact, but denies it to be sacrilege; since it was committed in a private house, and not in a temple.\" Hence this question arises, Whether to take a sacred thing out of a private house, is to be deemed sacrilege, or only simple theft? It lies, upon the accuser to prove what the other denies; and therefore the state of the cause is here also, as well as in the preceding case, taken from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDICTMENT\">indictment</a>.\n\nBut besides the principal question, there are other subordinate questions, which follow upon it in the course of a dispute, and should be carefully distinguished from it. Particularly that which arises from the reason, or argument, which is brought in proof of the principal question. For the principal question itself proves nothing, but is the thing to be proved, and becomes at last the conclusion of the discourse. Thus, in the case of Milo, his argument is, I killed Clodius justly, because he affinimated me. Unless the Clodian party be supposed to deny this, they give up their cause. From hence therefore this subordinate question follows, Whether Clodius affinimated Milo? Now Cicero spends much time in the proof of this, as the hinge on which the first question, and consequently the whole cause, depended. For if this was once made to appear, the lawfulness of Milo's killing Clodius, which was the grand question or thing to be proved, might be inferred as an allowed consequence from it. This will be evident, by throwing Milo's argument, as used by Cicero, into the form of a syllogism.\n\nAn affinim is lawfully killed:\nClodius was an affinim:\nTherefore he was lawfully killed by Milo whom he affinimated.\n\nIf the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> proposition of this syllogism was granted, no one would deny the conclusion; for the Roman law allowed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SELF_DEFENCE\">self-defence</a>. But as Cicero was very sensible this would not be admitted, so he takes much pains to bring the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> of it. Now where the argument brought in defence of the second question is confessed, or the orator supposes that it may be so, and therefore supports that with another argument, this occasions a third question consequent upon the former; and in like manner he may proceed to a fourth. But be they more or fewer, they are to be considered but as one chain of subordinate questions dependent upon the first. And though each of them has its particular state, yet none of these is what rhetorician call The state of the Cause, which is to be understood invention only of the principal question. And if, as it frequently happens, the first or principal question is itself directly proved from more than one argument; this makes no other difference, but that each of these arguments, so far as they are followed by others to support them, become a distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of subordinate questions, all dependent upon the first. As when Cicero endeavours to prove, that Rufius did not kill his father, from two reasons or arguments: Because he had neither any cause to move him to such a barbarous action, nor any opportunity for it.\n\nMoreover, besides these subordinate questions, there are also incidental ones often introduced, which have some reference to the principal question, and contribute towards the proof of it, though they are not necessarily connected with it, or dependent upon it. And each of these also has its state, though different from that of the cause. For every question, or point of controversy, must be stated, before it can be made the subject of disputation. And it is for this reason, that every new argument advanced by an orator is called a question; because it is considered as a fresh matter of controversy.\n\nIn Cicero's defence of Milo, we meet with several of this sort of questions, occasioned by some assertions which had been thrown out by the Clodian party to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> of Milo. As, \"That he was unworthy to see the light, who owned he had killed a man;\" For Milo before his trial had openly confessed he killed Clodius. So likewise, \"That the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> had declared the killing of Clodius was an illegal action.\" And further, \"That Pompey, by making a new law to settle the manner of Milo's trial, had given his judgment against Milo.\" Now to each of these Cicero replies, before he proceeds to the principal question. And therefore, though the question, in which the state of a controversy consists, is said by Quintilian to arise from \"the first conflict of causes;\" yet we find by this instance of Cicero, that it is not always the first question in order, upon which the orator treats.\n\nBut it sometimes happens, that the same cause or controversy contains in it more than one state. Thus in judicial causes, every distinct charge occasions a new state. All Cicero's orations against Verres relate to one cause, founded upon a law of the Romans against unjust exactions made by their governors of provinces upon the inhabitants; but as that prosecution is made up of as many charges as there are orations, every charge, or indictment, has its different state. So likewise his oration in defence of Coriolanus has two states, in answer to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> charge made against him by his adversaries: one, \"for borrowing money of Clodia, in order to bribe certain slaves to kill a foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a>;\" and the other, \"for an attempt afterwards to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> Clodia herself.\" Besides which, there were several other matters of a less heinous nature, which had been thrown upon him by his accusers, with a design, very likely, to render the two principal charges more credible; to which Cicero first replies, in the same manner as in his defence of Milo.\n\nThough all the examples we have hitherto brought to illustrate this subject have been taken from judicial cases, yet not only these, but very frequently discourses of the deliberative kind, and sometimes those of the demonstrative, are managed in a controversial way.\nAnd all controversies have their state. And therefore Quintilian very justly observes, that \"states belong both to general and particular questions; and to all sorts of causes, demonstrative, deliberative, and judicial.\" In Cicero's oration for the Manilian law, this is the main point in dispute between him and those who opposed that law: \"Whether Pompey was the fittest person to be intrusted with the management of the war against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MITHRIDATES\">Mithridates</a>?\" This is a subject of the deliberative kind. And of the same nature was that debate in the senate concerning the demolition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a>. For the matter in dispute between Cato, who argued for it, and those who were of the contrary opinion, seems to have been this: \"Whether it was for the interest of the Romans to demolish Carthage?\" And so likewise in those two fine orations of Cato and Caesar, given us by Sallust, relating to the conspirators with Catiline, who were then in custody, the controversy turns upon this: \"Whether those prisoners should be punished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, or perpetual imprisonment?\" Examples of the demonstrative kind are not so common; but Cicero's oration concerning the 'Answers of the Footsayers,' may afford us an instance of it. Several prodigies had lately happened at Rome; upon which the footsayers being consulted, affixed this as the reason of them, because some places consecrated to the gods had been afterwards converted to civil uses. Clodius charged this upon Cicero; whose house was rebuilt at the public expense, after it had been demolished by Clodius, and the ground consecrated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GODDESS\">goddess</a> Liberty. Cicero in this oration retorts the charge; and shows that the prodigies did not reflect him, but Clodius. So that the question in dispute was, \"To which of the two those prodigies related?\" This oration does not appear to have been spoken in a judicial way, and must therefore belong to the demonstrative kind. His invective against Piso is likewise much of the same nature, wherein he compares his own behaviour and conduct with that of Piso.\n\nAs to the number of these states, both Cicero and Quintilian reduce them to three. \"We must (says Quintilian) agree with those whose authority Cicero follows, who tells us, that three things may be inquired into in all disputes: Whether a thing is; what it is; and how it is. And this is the method which nature prescribes. For, in the first place, it is necessary the thing should exist about which the dispute is: because no judgment can be made either of its nature or quality till its existence be manifest; which is therefore the first question. But though it be manifest that a thing is, it does not presently appear what it is; and when this is known, the quality yet remains: and after these three are settled, no further inquiry is necessary.\" Now the first of these three states is called the conjectural state; as if it be inquired, \"Whether one person killed another?\" This always follows upon the denial of a fact by one of the parties; as was the case of Roscius. And it receives its name from hence, that the judge is left, as it were, to conjecture, whether the fact was really committed or not, from the evidence produced on the other side. The second is called the definitive state, when the fact is not denied; but the dispute turns upon the nature of it, and what name it is proper to give it: as in that example of Cicero, \"Whether to take a sacred thing out of a private house be theft or sacrilege?\" For in this case it is necessary to settle the distinct notion of those two crimes, and show their difference. The third is called the state of quality; when the contending parties are agreed both as to the fact, and the nature of it; but the dispute is, \"Whether it be just or unjust, profitable or unprofitable, and the like;\" as in the case of Milo.\n\nFrom what has been said upon this subject, the use of it may in a good measure appear. For whoever engages in a controversy, ought in the first place to consider with himself the main question in dispute, to fix it well in his mind, and keep it constantly in his view; without which he will be very liable to ramble from the point, and bewilder both himself and his hearers. And it is no less the business of the hearers principally to attend to this; by which means they will be helped to distinguish and separate from the principal question what is only incidental, and to observe how far the principal question is affected by it; to perceive what is offered in proof, and what is only brought in for illustration; not to be misled by digressions, but to discern when the speaker goes off from his subject, and when he returns to it again; and, in a word, to accompany him through the whole discourse, and carry with them the principal chain of reasoning upon which the cause depends, so as to judge upon the whole, whether he has made out his point, and the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nCHAP. II. Of Arguments suited to Demonstrative Discourses.\n\nThese consist either in praise or dispraise; and, agreeably to the nature of all contraries, one of them will serve to illustrate the other.\n\nNow we either praise persons or things.\n\nI. In praising or dispraising persons, rhetoricians describe two methods. One is, to follow the order in which every thing happened that is mentioned in the discourse; the other is, to reduce what is said under certain general heads, without a strict regard to the order of time.\n\n1. In pursuing the former method, the discourse may be very conveniently divided into three periods. The first of which will contain what preceded the person's birth; the second, the whole course of his life; and the third what followed upon his death.\n\nUnder the first of these may be comprehended what is proper to be said concerning his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>. And therefore, if these were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a>, it may be said to his advantage, that he nowise disgraced them, but acted suitably to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>. But if they were not so, they may be either wholly omitted; or it may be said, that, instead of deriving thence any advantage to his character, he has conferred a lasting honour upon them; and that it is not of so much moment where, or from whom, a person derives his birth, as how he lives.\n\nIn the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, which is that of his life, the qualities both of his mind and body, with his circumstances in the world, may be separately considered. Though, as Quintilian rightly observes, \"All external advantages are not praises for themselves, but according to the use that is made of them. For <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>, and power, and interest, as they have great influence, and may be applied either to good or bad purposes, are...\"\nInvention, a proof of the temper of our minds; and therefore we are either made better or worse by them. But these things are a just ground for commendation, when they are the reward of virtue or industry. Bodily endowments are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, strength, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>, and the like; which are more or less commendable, according as they are employed. And where these, or any of them, are wanting, it may be shown, that they are abundantly compensated by the more valuable endowments of the mind. Nay, sometimes a defect in these may give an advantageous turn to a person's character; for any virtue appears greater, in proportion to the disadvantages the person laboured under in exerting it. But the chief topics of praise are taken from the virtues and qualifications of the mind. And here the orator may consider the disposition, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, learning, and several virtues, which shone through the whole course of the person's life. In doing which, the preference should always be given to virtue above knowledge or any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a>. And in actions, those are most considerable, and will be heard with greatest approbation, which a person either did alone, or first, or wherein he had fewest associates; as likewise those which exceeded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a>, or were done for the advantage of others rather than his own. And further, as the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of a man's life generally commands the greatest regard, if anything remarkable at that time was either said or done, it ought particularly to be mentioned. Nor should the manner of his death, or cause of it, if accompanied with any commendable circumstances be omitted; as if he died in the service of his country, or in the pursuit of any other laudable design.\n\nThe third and last period relates to what followed after the death of the person. And here the public loss, and public honours conferred upon the deceased, are proper to be mentioned. Sepulchres, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a>, and other monuments to perpetuate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of the dead, at the expense of the public, were in common use both among the Greeks and Romans. But in the earliest times, as these honours were more rare, so they were less costly. For as in one age it was thought a sufficient reward for him who died in the defence of his country, to have his name cut in a marble inscription, with the cause of his death; so in others it was very common to see the statues of gladiators, and persons of the meanest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, erected in public places. And therefore a judgement is to be formed of these things from the time, custom, and circumstances, of different nations; since the frequency of them renders them less honourable, and takes off from their evidence as the rewards of virtue. But, as Quintilian says, \"Children are an honour to their parents, cities to their founders, laws to those who compiled them, arts to their inventors, and useful customs to the authors of them.\"\n\nAnd this may suffice for the method of praising persons, when we propose to follow the order of time, as Ilocrates has done in his funeral oration upon Evagoras <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALAMIS\">Salamis</a>, and Pliny in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PANEGYRIC\">panegyric</a> upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Trajan. But as this method is very plain and obvious, so it requires the more agreeable defects to render it delightful; lest otherwise it seem rather like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> than an oration: For which reason, we find, that epic poets, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a>, and others, begin with the middle of their story; and afterwards take a proper occasion to introduce what preceded, to diversify the subject, and give the greater pleasure and entertainment to their readers.\n\n2. The other method above hinted was, to reduce the discourse to certain general heads without regarding the order of time. As if any one, in praising the elder Cato, should propose to do it, by showing that he was a most prudent senator, an excellent orator, and most valiant general; all which commendations are given him by Pliny. In like manner, the character of a good general may be comprised under four heads; skill in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> affairs, courage, authority, and success; from all which Cicero commends Pompey. And agreeably to this method Suetonius has written the lives of the first twelve Caesars.\n\nBut in the praising of persons, care should always be taken to say nothing that may seem fictitious or out of character, which may call the orator's judgement or integrity in question. It was not without cause, therefore, that Lytippus the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATUARY\">statuary</a>, as Plutarch tells us, blamed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APELLES\">Apelles</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> Alexander the Great with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> in his hand; which could never suit his character as a man, however he might boast of his divine descent: for which reason Lytippus himself made an image of him holding a spear, as the sign of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a>. Light and trivial things in commendations are likewise to be avoided, and nothing mentioned but what may carry in it the idea of something truly valuable, and which the hearers may be supposed to wish for, and is proper to excite their emulation. These are the principal heads of praise with relation to men. In dispraise, the heads contrary to these are requisite; which being sufficiently clear from what has been said, need not particularly be insisted on.\n\nII. We proceed therefore to the other part of the division, which respects things, as distinguished from persons. By which we are to understand all beings inferior to man, whether animate or inanimate; as likewise the habits and dispositions of men, either good or bad, when considered separately, and apart from their subjects, as arts and sciences, virtues and vices, with whatever else may be a proper subject for praise or dispraise. Some writers, indeed, have, for their own amusement and the diversion of others, displayed their eloquence in a jocose manner upon subjects of this kind. So Lucian has written in praise of a fly, and Synecus an elegant encomium upon baldness. Others, on the contrary, have done the like in a satirical way. Such is Seneca's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOTHEOSIS\">apotheosis</a> or consecration of the emperor Claudius; and the Mylopogon or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a>-hater, written by Julian the emperor. Not to mention several modern authors, who have imitated them in such ludicrous compositions. But as to these things, and all of the like nature, the observation of Antony in Cicero seems very just: \"That it is not necessary to reduce every subject we discourse upon to rules of art.\" For many are so trivial, as not to deserve it; and others so plain and evident of themselves, as not to require it. But since it frequently comes in the way both of orators and historians to describe countries, cities, and facts, we shall briefly mention the principal heads of invention proper to illustrate each of these.\n\nCountries, then, may be celebrated from the pleasantest\nsantness of their situation, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLEMENCY\">clemency</a> and wholesomeness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and goodness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>; to which last may be referred the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, woods, plains, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, and minerals. And to all these may be added their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, cities, the number and antiquity of the inhabitants; their policy, laws, customs, wealth, character for cultivating the arts both of peace and war; their princes, and other eminent men they have produced. Thus Pacatus has given us a very elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, in this panegyric upon the emperor Theodosius, who was born there.\n\nCities are praised from much the same topics as countries. And here, whatever contributes either to their defence or ornament ought particularly to be mentioned; as the strength of the walls and fortifications, the beauty and splendour of the buildings, whether sacred or civil, public or private. We have in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a> a very fine description of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLON\">Babylon</a>, which was once the strongest, largest, and most regular city in the world. And Cicero has accurately described the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRACUSE\">Syracuse</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, in one of his orations against Verres.\n\nBut facts come much oftener under the cognizance of an orator. And these receive their commendation from their honour, justice, or advantage. But in describing them, all the circumstances should be related in their proper order; and that in the most lively and affecting manner suited to their different nature. Livy has represented the demolition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBA\">Alba</a> by the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, which was sent thither to destroy it, through the whole course of that melancholy scene, in a style so moving and pathetic, that one can hardly forbear condoling with the inhabitants, upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> his account.\n\nBut in discourses of this kind, whether of praise or dispraise, the orator should (as he ought indeed upon all occasions) well consider where, and to whom, he speaks. For wise men often think very differently both of persons and things from the common people. And we find that learned and judicious men are frequently divided in their sentiments, from the several ways of thinking to which they have been accustomed. Besides, different opinions prevail, and gain the ascendant, at different times. While the Romans continued a free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, love of their country, liberty, and public spirit, were principles in the highest esteem among them. And therefore, when Cato killed himself, that he might not fall into the hands of Caesar, and survive the liberty of his country, it was thought an instance of the greatest heroic virtue; but afterwards, when they had been accustomed to an arbitrary government, and the spirit of liberty was now lost, the poet Martial could venture to say,\n\nDeath to avoid 'tis madness sure to die.\n\nA prudent orator therefore will be cautious of opposing any settled and prevailing notions of those whom he addresses, unless it be necessary; and then he will do it in the loftiest and most gentle manner.\n\nChap. III. Of Arguments suited to Deliberative Discourses.\n\nThis kind of discourse must certainly have been very ancient; since, doubtless, from the first beginning of men's conversing together, they deliberated upon invention, their common interest, and offered their advice to each other. But neither those of the laudatory nor judicial kind could have been introduced, till mankind were settled in communities, and found it necessary to confer, and encourage virtue by public rewards, and bring vice the argument under the restraint of laws. The early practice of such discourses appears from sacred writ, where we find, that when Moses was ordered upon an embassy into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, he would have excused himself for want of eloquence. And Homer represents the Greeks at the siege of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">Troy</a>, as flocking like a swarm of bees to hear their generals <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARANGUE\">harangue</a> them. Nor is this part of oratory less conspicuous for its usefulness to mankind, than for its antiquity; being highly beneficial either in councils, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPS\">camps</a>, or any societies of men. How many instances have we upon record, where the fury of an enraged multitude has been checked and appeased by the prudent and artful persuasion of some particular person? The story of Agrippa Menenius, when the commons of Rome withdrew from the senators, and retired out of the city, is too well known to need reciting. And how often have armies been animated and fired to the most dangerous exploits, or recalled to their duty, when ready to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTINY\">mutiny</a>, by a moving speech of their general? Many instances of which we find in history.\n\nAll deliberation respects something future, for it is in vain to consult about what is already past. The subject matter of it is, either things public or private, sacred or civil; indeed all the valuable concerns of mankind, both present and future, come under its regard. And the end proposed by this kind of discourse is chiefly profit or interest. But since nothing is truly profitable, but what is in some respect good; and every thing which is good in itself may not in all circumstances be for our advantage; properly speaking, what is both good and profitable, or beneficial good, is the end here designed. And therefore, as it sometimes happens, that what appears profitable may seem to interfere with that which is strictly just and honourable; in such cases it is certainly most advisable to determine on the safer side of honour and justice, notwithstanding some plausible things may be offered to the contrary. But where the dispute lies apparently between what is truly honest, and some external advantage proposed in opposition to it, all good men cannot but agree in favour of honesty. Such was the case of Regulus, who, being taken prisoner by the Carthaginians, was permitted to go to Rome upon giving his oath, that unless he could persuade the senate to set at liberty some young Carthaginian noblemen, then prisoners at Rome, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> for him, he should return again to Carthage. But Regulus, when he came to Rome, was so far from endeavouring to prevail with the senate to comply with the desire of the Carthaginians, that he used all his interest to dissuade them from hearkening to the proposal. Nor could the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> entreaties of his nearest relations and friends, nor any arguments they were able to offer, engage him to continue at Rome, and not return again to Carthage. He had then plainly in his view, on the one side, ease, security, affluence, honours, and the enjoyment of his friends; and on the other, certain death, attended with cruel torments. However, thinking the former\nformer not confident with truth and justice, he chose the latter. And he certainly acted as became an honest and brave man, in choosing death, rather than to violate his oath. Though whether he did prudently in persuading the senate not to make the exchange, or they in complying with him, we shall leave others to determine. Now, when it proves to be a matter of debate, whether a thing upon the whole be really beneficial or not; as here arise two parts, advice and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a>, they will each require proper heads of argument. But as they are contrary to each other, he who is acquainted with one, cannot well be ignorant of the other. We shall therefore chiefly mention those proper for advice, from whence such as are suited to persuade will easily be perceived. Now the principal heads of this kind are these following, which are taken from the nature and properties of the thing itself under consideration.\n\n1. Pleasure often affords a very cogent argument in discourses of this nature. Every one knows what an influence this has upon the generality of mankind. Though, as Quintilian remarks, pleasure ought not of itself to be propounded as a fit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> for action in serious discourses, but when it is designed to recommend something useful, which is the case here. So, would any one advise another to the pursuit of polite literature, Cicero has furnished him with a very strong inducement to it from the pleasure which attends that study, when he says, \"If pleasure only was propounded by these studies, you would think them an entertainment becoming a man of sense and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>. For other pursuits neither agree with all times, all ages, nor all places; but these studies improve youth, delight old age, adorn prosperity, afford a refuge and comfort in adversity, divert us at home, are no hindrance abroad, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, travel, and retire with us into the country.\"\n\n2. Profit, or advantage. This has no less influence upon many persons than the former; and when it respects things truly valuable, it is a very just and laudable motive. Thus Cicero, when he sends his Book of Offices to his son, which he wrote in Latin for his use, advises him to make the best advantage both of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a>'s instructions and the conversation at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, where he then was; but withal to peruse his philosophical treaties, which would be doubly useful to him, not only upon account of the subjects, but likewise of the language, as they would enable him to express himself upon those arguments in Latin, which before had only been treated of in Greek.\n\n3. Honour; than which no argument will sooner prevail with generous minds, or inflame them with greater ardour. Virgil has very beautifully described Hector's ghost appearing to \u00c6neas the night Troy was taken, and advising him to depart, from this motive of honour:\n\nO goddefs-born, escape by timely flight\nThe flames and horrors of this fatal night.\nThe foes already have possest the wall;\nTroy nods from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, and totters to her fall.\nEnough is paid to Priam's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> name;\nMore than enough to duty and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>.\nIf by a mortal hand my father's throne\nCou'd be defended, 'twas by mine alone.\n\nThe argument here made use of to persuade \u00c6neas to leave Troy immediately, is, that he had done all that could be expected from him, either as a good subject or brave soldier, both for his king and country; which were sufficient to secure his honour; and now there was nothing more to be expected from him when the city was falling, and impossible to be saved; which, could it have been preferred by human power, he himself had done it.\n\nBut although a thing considered in itself appear beneficial if it could be attained, yet the expediency of undertaking it may still be questionable: in which case the following heads, taken from the circumstances which attend it, will afford proper arguments to engage in it.\n\n(1.) The possibility of succeeding may sometimes be argued, as one motive to this end. So <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANNIBAL\">Hannibal</a> endeavoured to convince King Antiochus, that it was possible for him to conquer the Romans, if he made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> the seat of the war; by observing to him, not only that the Gauls had formerly destroyed their city, but that he had himself defeated them in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> he fought with them in that country.\n\n(2.) But an argument founded upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> will be much more likely to prevail. For in many affairs of human life, men are determined either to prosecute them or not, as the prospect of success appears more or less probable. Hence Cicero, after the fatal battle at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARSALIA\">Pharsalia</a>, dissuades those of Pompey's party, with whom he was engaged, from continuing the war any longer against Caesar; because it was highly improbable, after such a defeat, by which their main strength was broken, that they should be able to stand their ground, or meet with better success than they had before.\n\n(3.) But further, since probability is not a motive strong enough with many persons to engage in the prosecution of a thing which is attended with considerable difficulties, it is often necessary to represent the facility of doing it, as a further reason to induce them to it. And therefore Cicero makes use of this argument to encourage the Roman citizens in opposing Mark Antony (who upon the death of Caesar had assumed an arbitrary power), by representing to them, that his circumstances were then desperate, and that he might easily be vanquished.\n\n(4.) Again, If the thing advised can be shown to be in any respect necessary, this will render the motive still much stronger for undertaking it. And therefore Cicero joins this argument with the former, to prevail with the Roman citizens to oppose Antony, by telling them, that \"The consideration before them was, not in what circumstances they should live, but whether they should live at all, or die with ignominy and disgrace.\" This way of reasoning will sometimes prevail when all others prove ineffectual. For some persons are not to be moved till things are brought to an extremity, and they find themselves reduced to the utmost danger.\n\n(5.) To these heads may be added the consideration of the event, which in some cases carries great weight with it. As when we advise to the doing of a thing from this motive, That whether it succeed or not, it will yet be of service to undertake it. So after the great victory gained by Themistocles over the Persian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> at...\nInvention. the straits of Salamis, Mardonius advised <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-XERXES\">Xerxes</a> to return into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> himself, lest the report of his defeat should occasion an insurrection in his absence; but to leave behind him an army of 300,000 men under his command; with which, if he should conquer Greece, the chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of the conquest would redound to Xerxes; but if the design miscarried, the disgrace would fall upon his generals.\n\nThese are the principal heads which furnish the orator with proper arguments in giving advice. Cicero, in his oration for the Manilian law, where he endeavours to persuade the Roman people to choose Pompey for their general in the Mithridatic war, reasons from three of these topics, into which he divides his whole discourse; namely, the necessity of the war, the greatness of it, and the choice of a proper general.\u2014Under the first of these he shows, that the war was necessary, from four considerations; the honour of the Roman state, the safety of their allies, their own revenues, and the fortunes of many of their fellow citizens, which were all highly concerned in it, and called upon them to put a stop to the growing power of King Mithridates, by which they were all greatly endangered. So that this argument is taken from the head of necessity. The second, in which he treats of the greatness of the war, is founded upon the topic of possibility. For though he shows the power of Mithridates to be very great, yet not so formidable, but that he might be subdued; as was evident from the many advantages Lucullus had gained over him and his associates. In the third head, he endeavours to prevail with them to intrust the management of the war in the hands of Pompey, whom he describes as a consummate general, for his skill in military affairs, courage, authority, and success; in all which qualities he represents him as superior to any other of their generals whom they could at that time make choice of. The design of all which was, to persuade them, that they had very good reason to hope for success, and a happy event of the war, under his conduct. So that the whole force of his reasoning under this head is drawn from probability. These are the three general topics which make up that fine discourse. Each of which is indeed supported by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> other arguments and considerations, which will be obvious in perusing the oration itself, and therefore need not be here enumerated. On the contrary, in another oration he endeavours to dissuade the senate from consenting to a peace with Mark Antony, because it was base, dangerous, and impracticable.\n\nBut no small skill and address are required in giving advice. For since the tempers and sentiments of mankind, as well as their circumstances, are very different and various; it is often necessary to accommodate the discourse to their inclinations and opinions of things. And therefore the weightiest arguments are not always the most proper and fittest to be used on all occasions. Cicero, who was an admirable master of this art, and knew perfectly well how to suit what he said to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and relish of his hearers, in treating upon this subject, distinguishes mankind into two sorts; the ignorant and unpolished, who always prefer profit to honour; and such as are more civilized and polite, who prefer honour and reputation to all other things.\u2014Wherefore they are to be moved by these different views: Praise, glory, and virtue, influence the one: Invention, while the other is only to be engaged by a prospect of gain and pleasure. Besides, it is plain, that the generality are much more inclined to avoid evils than to pursue what is good; and to keep clear of scandal and disgrace, than to practise what is truly generous and noble. Persons likewise of a different age act from different principles; young men for the most part view things in a different light from those who are older and have had more experience, and consequently are not to be influenced by the same motives.\n\nChap. IV. Of Arguments suited to Judicial Discourses.\n\nIn judicial controversies there are two parties; the plaintiff or prosecutor, and the defendant or person charged. The subject of them is always something and the affair. And the end propounded by them Cicero calls fitted to equity, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> and equity; the former of which arises from the laws of the country, and the latter from reason and the nature of things. For at Rome the praetors had a court of equity, and were empowered, in many cases relating to property, to relax the rigour of the written laws. But as this subject is very copious, and causes may arise from a great variety of things, writers have reduced them to three heads, which they call states, to some one of which all judicial proceedings may be referred; namely, whether a thing is, what it is, or how it is. By the state of a cause therefore is meant the principal question in dispute, upon which the whole affair depends. Which, if it stops in the first inquiry, and the defendant denies the fact, the state is called conjectural; but if the fact be acknowledged, and yet denied to be what the adversary calls it, it is termed definitive; but if there is no dispute either about the fact or its name, but only the justice of it, it is called the state of quality: as was shown more largely before (see No. 15.) But we there considered these states only in a general view, and deferred the particular heads of argument proper for each of them to this judicial kind of discourses; where they most frequently occur, and from which examples may easily be accommodated to other subjects.\n\nAll judicial causes are either private or public. Those are called private, which relate to the right of particular persons; and they are likewise called civil causes, as they are conversant about matters of property.\u2014Public causes are those which relate to public justice and the government of the state; which are also called criminal, because by them crimes are prosecuted, whether <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, or those of a less heinous nature. We shall take the heads of the arguments only from this latter kind, because they are more copious, and easy to be illustrated by examples; from which such as agree to the former, namely, civil causes, will sufficiently appear.\n\n1. The conjectural state. When the accused person denies the fact, there are three things which the prosecutor has to consider; whether he would have done it, whether he could, and whether he did it. And hence arise three topics; from the will, the power, and the signs or circumstances which attended the action. The affections of the mind discover the will; as passion, an old grudge, a desire of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a>, a resentment\nInvention. Sentiment of an injury, and the like. Therefore Cicero argues from Clodius's hatred of Milo, that he designed his death; and from thence infers, that he was the aggressor in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> between them, wherein Clodius was killed. This is what he principally endeavours to prove, and comes properly under this state: for Milo owned that he killed him, but alleged that he did it in his own defence. So that in regard to this point, which of them assaulted the other? the charge was mutual. The prospect of advantage may also be alleged to the same purpose. Hence it is said of L. Caecilius, that whenever he sat as judge in a case of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a>, he used to advise and move the court to examine to whom the advantage arose from the death of the deceased. And Cicero puts this to Antony concerning the death of Caesar. \"If any one (says he) should bring you upon trial, and use that saying of C\u00e6sars, *Qui bono?* 'Who got by it?' look to it, I beseech you, that you are not confounded. To these arguments may be added, hope of impunity, taken either from the circumstances of the accused person, or of him who suffered the injury. For persons, who have the advantage of interest, friends, power, or money, are apt to think they may easily escape; as likewise such who have formerly committed other crimes with impunity. Thus Cicero represents Clodius as hardened in vice, and above all the restraint of laws, from having so often escaped punishment upon committing the highest crimes. On the contrary, such a confidence is sometimes raised from the condition of the injured party, if he is indigent, obscure, timorous, or defective of friends; much more if he has an ill reputation, or is loaded with popular hatred and resentment. It was this presumption of the obscurity of Roelius, who lived in the country, and his want of interest at Rome, which encouraged his accusers to charge him with killing his father, as Cicero shows in his defence of him. Lastly, The temper of a person, his views, and manner of life, are considerations of great moment in this matter. For persons of bad morals, and such as are addicted to vice, are easily thought capable of committing any wickedness. Hence Sallust argues from the evil disposition and vicious life of Catiline, that he affected to raise himself upon the ruins of his country.\u2014The second head is the power of doing a thing: and there are three things which relate to this, the place, the time, and opportunity. As if a crime is said to have been committed in a private place, where no other person was present; or in the night; or when the injured person was unable to provide for his defence. Under this head may likewise be brought in the circumstances of the persons; as if the accused person was stronger, and so able to overpower the other; or more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>, and so could easily make his escape. Cicero makes great use of this topic in the case of Milo, and shows, that Clodius had all the advantages of place, time, and opportunity, to execute his design of killing him. The third head comprehends the signs and circumstances which either preceded, accompanied, or followed, the commission of the fact. So threats, or the accused person being seen at or near the place before the fact was committed, are circumstances that may probably precede murder; fighting, crying out, bloodshed, are such as accompany it; paleness, trembling, inconsistent answers, hesitation, or faltering of the speech, something found upon the person accused invention, which belonged to the deceased, are such as follow it. Thus Cicero proves, that Clodius had threatened the death of Milo, and given out that he should not live above three days at the farthest.\u2014These arguments, taken from conjectures, are called presumptions, which, though they do not directly prove that the accused person committed the fact with which he is charged; yet when laid together, they appeared very strong, sentence by the Roman law might sometimes be given upon them, to convict him.\n\nThere are the topics from which the prosecutor takes his arguments. Now the business of the defendant is to invalidate these. Therefore such as are brought from the will, he either endeavours to show are not true, or so weak as to merit very little regard. And he refutes those taken from the power, by proving that he wanted either opportunity or ability: as, if he can show, that neither the place nor time insisted on was at all proper; or that he was then in another place. In like manner he will endeavour to confute the circumstances, if they cannot be directly denied, by showing that they are not such as do necessarily accompany the fact, but might have proceeded from other causes, though nothing of what is alleged had been committed; and it will be of great service to assign some other probable cause. But sometimes the defendant does not only deny that he did the fact, but charges it upon another. Thus Cicero, in his oration for Roelius, not only defends him from each of these three heads, but likewise charges the fact upon his accusers.\n\n2. The definitive state, which is principally concerned in defining and fixing the name proper to the fact: though orators seldom make use of exact definitions, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> choose larger descriptions, taken from various properties of the subject or thing described.\n\nThe heads of argument in this state are much the same to both parties. For each of them defines the fact his own way, and endeavours to refute the other's definition. We may illustrate this by an example from Quintilian: \"A person is accused of sacrilege, for stealing money out of a temple, which belonged to a private person.\" The fact is owned; but the question is, Whether it be properly sacrilege? The prosecutor calls it so, because it was taken out of a temple. But since the money belonged to a private person, the defendant denies it to be sacrilege, and says it is only simple theft. Now the reason why the defendant uses this plea, and inflicts upon the definition, is, because by the Roman law the penalty of theft was only four times the value of what was stolen; whereas sacrilege was punished with death. The prosecutor then forms his definition agreeable to his charge, and says, \"To steal anything out of a sacred place is sacrilege.\" But the defendant excepts against this definition, as defective; and urges, that it does not amount to sacrilege, unless the thing stolen was likewise sacred. And this case might once, perhaps, have been a matter of controversy, since we find it expressly determined in the Pandects, that \"An action of sacrilege should not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a>, but only of theft, against any one who should steal the goods of private persons deposited in a temple.\"\n\nThe second thing is the proof brought by each party to support his definition; as in the example given.\nInvention, given us by Cicero, of one \"who carried his cause by bribery, and was afterwards prosecuted again upon an action of prevarication.\" Now, if the defendant was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> upon this action, he was, by the Roman law, subjected to the penalty of the former prosecution. Here the prosecutor defines prevarication to be, Any bribery or corruption in the defendant, with a design to pervert justice. The defendant, therefore, on the other hand, restrains it to bribing only the prosecutor.\n\nAnd if this latter sense agrees better with the common acceptation of the word, the prosecutor in the third place pleads the intention of the law, which was to comprehend all bribery in judicial matters under the term of prevarication. In answer to which the defendant endeavours to show, either from the head of contraries, that a real prosecutor and a prevaricator are used as opposite terms in the law; or from the etymology of the word, that a prevaricator denotes one who pretends to appear in the prosecution of a cause, while in reality he favours the contrary side; and consequently, that money given for this end only can, in the sense of the law, be called prevarication.\n\nLastly, The prosecutor pleads, that it is unreasonable that he who does not deny the fact should escape by a cavil about a word. But the defendant insists upon his explication as agreeable to the law; and says, the fact is misrepresented and blackened, by affixing to it a wrong name.\n\n3. The third state is that of quality, in which the dispute turns upon the justice of an action. And here the defendant does not deny he did the thing he is charged with; but affirms it to be right and equitable, from the circumstances of the case, and the motives which induced him to it.\n\nAnd, first, He sometimes alleges, the reason of doing it was in order to prevent some other thing of worse consequence, which would otherwise have happened. We have an instance of this in the life of Epaminondas, who, with two other generals joined in the command with him, marched the Theban army into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PELOPONNESUS\">Peloponnesus</a> against the Lacedemonians; but by the influence of a contrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a> at home, their commissions were superseded, and other generals sent to command the army. But Epaminondas, being sensible that, if he obeyed this order at that time, it would be attended with the loss of the whole army, and consequently the ruin of the state, refused to do it; and having persuaded the other generals to do the like, they happily finished the war in which they were engaged; and upon their return home, Epaminondas taking the whole matter upon himself, on his trial was acquitted. The arguments proper in this case are taken from the justice, usefulness, or necessity, of the action. The accuser therefore will plead, that the fact was not just, profitable, nor necessary, considered either in itself or comparatively with that for the sake of which it is said to have been done; and he will endeavour to show, that what the defendant affirms for the reason of what he did might not have happened as he pretends. Besides, he will represent of what ill consequence it must be, if such crimes go unpunished. The defendant, on the other hand, will argue from the same heads, and endeavour to prove the fact was just, useful, or necessary. And he will further urge, that no just estimate can be made of invention, any action, but from the circumstances which attend it; as the design, occasion, and motives for doing it, which he will represent in the most favourable light to his own cause, and endeavour to set them in such a view, as to induce others to think they could not but have done the same in the like circumstances.\n\nAgain, The cause of an action is sometimes charged by the defendant upon the party who received the damage, or some other person, who either made it necessary, or enjoined him to do it. The first of these was Milo's plea for killing Clodius, because he assaulted him with a design to take away his life. Here the fact is not denied, as in the case of Rufius above-mentioned, under the conjectural state; but justified from the reason of doing it. For that an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSASSIN\">assassin</a> might be justly killed, Cicero shows both from law and reason. The accuser, therefore, in such a case, will, if there be room for it, deny the truth of this allegation. So the friends of Clodius affirmed that Milo was the aggressor, and not Clodius; which Cicero, in his defence of Milo, principally labours to refute. In the second case, the prosecutor will say, No one ought to offend because another has offended first; which defeats the course of public justice, renders the laws useless, and destroys the authority of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>. The defendant, on the other hand, will endeavour to represent the danger and necessity of the case, which required an immediate remedy, and in that manner; and urges, that it was vain and impracticable to wait for redress in the ordinary way, and therefore no ill consequence can arise to the public. Thus Cicero, in defending Sextius, who was prosecuted for a riot in bringing armed men into the forum, shows that his design was only to repel force with force; which was then necessary, there being no other means left for the people to assemble, who were excluded by a mob of the contrary party. Of the third case we have also an example in Cicero, who tells us, that \"in making a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> between the Romans and Samnites, a certain young nobleman was ordered by the Roman general to hold the swine (designated for a sacrifice); but the senate afterwards disapproving the terms, and delivering up their general to the Samnites, it was moved, Whether this young man ought not likewise to be given up?\" Those who were for it might say, that to allege the command of another, is not a sufficient plea for doing an ill action; and this is what the Roman law now expressly declares. But in answer to that, it might be replied, that it was his duty to obey the command of his general, who was answerable for his own orders, and not those who were obliged to execute them; and therefore, to give up this young nobleman would be to punish one person for the fault of another.\n\nLastly, A fact is sometimes rather excused than defended, by pleading that it was not done designingly, or with any ill intent. This is called concession; and consists of two parts, apology and entreaty. The former represents the matter as the effect of inadvertency, chance, or necessity. Aristotle gives us an example of inadvertency or imprudence in a woman at Athens, who gave a young man a love potion, which killed him; for which she was tried, but acquitted: though afterwards this was made criminal by the Roman law. The case\nInvention of Adrafinus, as related by Herodotus, is an instance of chance; who being intrusted by Croesus with the care of his son, as they were hunting, killed him accidentally with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JAVELIN\">javelin</a> which he threw at a boar. It is necessity, when a person excuses his making a default from defects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, sickness, or the like. Thus Cicero pleaded his illness, contracted by the fatigue of a long journey, as an excuse for not appearing in the senate upon the summons of Mark Antony, who threatened to oblige him to it by pulling his house <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>. But what the defendant here attributes to inadvertency, chance, or necessity, the opposite party will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> to design, negligence, or some other culpable reason; and represent it as a matter injurious to the public to introduce such precedents; and also produce instances, if that can be done, where the like excuses have not been admitted. On the other hand, the defendant will insist on his innocence, and show the hardship and severity of judging men's actions rather by the event, than from the intention: that such a procedure makes no difference between the innocent and the guilty; but must necessarily involve many honest men in ruin and destruction, discourage all virtuous and generous designs, and turn greatly to the prejudice of human society. He will also consider the instances alleged by the accuser, and show the difference between them and his own case. And, lastly, He will have recourse to entreaty, or a submissive address to the equity and clemency of the court, or party offended, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a>; as Cicero has done in his oration to Caesar, in favour of Ligarius.\n\nCHAP. V. Of the Character and Address of an Orator.\n\nHaving considered and explained the first part of propriety of manners Invention, which furnishes the orator with such arguments as are necessary for the proof of his subject, we are next to show what are the proper means to conciliate the minds of his hearers; to gain their affections; and to recommend both himself, and what he says, to and address their good opinion and esteem. For the parts of invention are commonly thus distinguished; that the first respects the subject of the discourse, the second the speaker, and the third the hearers. Now the second of these, what we have at present to explain, is by Quintilian called a propriety of manners. And in order to express this it is necessary, as he tells us, \"that every thing appear easy and natural, and the disposition of the speaker be discovered by his words.\" We may form an easy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of this from the conduct of such persons as are most nearly concerned in each other's welfare. As when relations or friends <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> together upon any affairs of importance, the temper and disposition of the speaker plainly shows itself by his words and manner of address. And what nature here directs to without colouring or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a>, the orator is to endeavour to perform by his art. Though indeed, if what a person says be inconsistent with his usual conduct and behaviour at other times, he cannot expect it should gain much credit, or make any deep impression upon his hearers; which may be one reason why the ancient rhetoricians make it so necessary a qualification in an orator, that he be a good man; since he should always be consistent with himself, and, as we say, talk in character. And therefore it is highly requisite, that he should not only gain the skill of assuming those qualities which the nature and circumstances of his discourse require him to express; but likewise, that he should use his utmost endeavours to get the real habits implanted in his mind. For as by this means they will be always expressed with greater ease and facility; so, by appearing constantly in the course of his life, they will have more weight and influence upon particular occasions.\n\nNow there are four qualities, more especially suited to the character of an orator, which should always appear in his discourses, in order to render what he says acceptable to his hearers; and these are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, integrity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a>.\n\n1. Wisdom is necessary; because we easily give into those whom we esteem wiser and more knowing than ourselves. Knowledge is very agreeable and pleasant to all, but few make very great improvements in it; either by reason they are employed in other necessary affairs, and the mind of man cannot attend to many things at once; or because the way to knowledge at first is hard and difficult, so that persons either do not care to enter upon the pursuit of it, or, if they do, they are many times soon discouraged, and drop it, for want of sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to surmount its difficulties. Such, therefore, as either cannot, or do not care to give themselves the trouble of examining into things themselves, must take up with the representation of others; and it is an ease to them to hear the opinion of persons whom they esteem wiser than themselves. No one loves to be deceived; and those who are fearful of being misled, are pleased to meet with a person in whose wisdom, as they think, they can safely trust. The character of wisdom therefore is of great service to an orator, since the greater part of mankind are swayed by authority rather than arguments.\n\n2. But this of itself is not sufficient, unless the opinion of integrity be joined with it. Nay, so far from it, that the greater knowledge and understanding a man is supposed to have, unless he likewise have the character of an honest man, he is often the more suspected. For knowledge without honesty, is generally thought to dispose a person, as well as qualify him, to deceive.\n\n3. And to both these qualities the appearance of kindness and benevolence should likewise be added. For though a person have the reputation of wisdom and honesty, yet if we apprehend he is either not well affected to us, or at least regardless of our interest, we are in many cases apt to be jealous of him. Mankind are naturally swayed by their affections, and much influenced through love or friendship; and therefore nothing has a greater tendency to induce persons to credit what is said, than intimations of affection and kindness. The best orators have been always sensible what great influence the expressions of kindness and benevolence have upon the minds of others, to induce them to believe the truth of what they say; and therefore they frequently endeavour to impress them with the opinion of it. Thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMOSTHENES\">Demosthenes</a> begins his celebrated oration for Ctesiphon. \"It is my hearty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a> (says he) to all the deities, that this my defence may be received by you with the same affection which I have always expressed for you and your city.\" And it is a very fine image of it which we have in Cicero, where,\nInvention where, in order to influence the judges in favour of Milo, he introduces him speaking thus, as became a brave man, and a patriot, even upon the supposition he should be condemned by them: \"I bid my fellow citizens adieu: may they continue flourishing and prosperous; may this famous city be preserved, my most dear country, however it has treated me; may my fellow citizens enjoy peace and tranquillity without me, since I am not to enjoy it with them, though I have procured it for them: I will withdraw, I will be gone.\"\n\n4. Modesty. It is certain, that what is modestly spoken is generally better received than what carries in it an air of boldness and confidence. Most persons, though ignorant of a thing, do not care to be thought so; and would have some deference paid to their understanding. But he who delivers himself in an arrogant and assuming way seems to upbraid his hearers with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, while he does not leave them to judge for themselves, but dictates to them, and as it were demand their assent to what he says; which is certainly a very improper method to win upon them. For not a few, when convinced of an error in such a way, will not own it; but will rather adhere to their former opinion, than seem forced to think right, when it gives another the opportunity of a triumph. A prudent orator therefore will behave himself with modesty, that he may not seem to insult his hearers; and will set things before them in such an engaging manner, as may remove all prejudice either from his person or what he affirms. This is particularly necessary in the exordium of a discourse. If the orator set out with an air of arrogance and ostentation, the self-love and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> of the hearers will be presently awakened, and will follow him with a very fulsome eye throughout all his progress. His modesty should discover itself not only in his expressions at the beginning, but in his whole manner; in his looks, in his gestures, in the tone of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>. Every auditory take in good part those marks of respect and awe, which are paid to them by one who addresses them. Indeed the modesty of an introduction should never betray any thing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> or abject. It is always of great use to an orator, that together with modesty and deference to his hearers, he should show a certain sense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>, arising from a persuasion of the justice or importance of the subject of which he is to speak. For to speak timorously, and with hesitation, destroys the credit of what is offered; and so far as the speaker seems to distrust what he says himself, he often induces others to do the like.\n\nBut, as has been said already, great care is to be taken that these characters do not appear feigned and counterfeit. For what is fictitious can seldom be long concealed. And if this be once discovered, it makes all that is said suspected, how specious soever it may otherwise appear.\n\nIt is further necessary, that the orator should know the world, and be well acquainted with the different tempers and dispositions of mankind. Nor indeed can any one reasonably hope to succeed in this province, without well considering the circumstances of time and place, with the sentiments and dispositions of those to whom he speaks; which, according to Aristotle, may be distinguished four ways, as they discover themselves by the several affections, habits, ages, and fortunes, of mankind.\n\nAnd each of these require a different conduct and manner of address.\n\nThe affections denote certain emotions of the mind, which, during their continuance, give a great turn to the disposition. For love prompts to one thing, and hatred to another. The like may be said of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a>, lenity, and the rest of them.\n\nPersons differ likewise according to the various habits of their mind. So a just man is inclined one way, and an unjust man another; a temperate man to this, and an intemperate man to the contrary.\n\nAnd as to the several ages of men, Aristotle has described them very accurately; and how persons are differently affected in each of them. He divides the lives of men, considered as hearers, into three stages; youth, middle age, and old age.\u2014Young men, he says, have generally strong passions, and are very eager to obtain what they desire, but are likewise very mutable, so that the same thing does not please them long. They are ambitious of praise, and quick in their resentments; lavish of their money, as not having experienced the want of it; frank and open, because they have not often been deceived; and credulous for the same reason. They readily hope the best, because they have not suffered much, and are therefore not so fickle of the uncertainty of human affairs; for which reason they are likewise more easily deceived. They are modest, from their little acquaintance with the world. They love <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> and cheerfulness, from the briskness of their spirits. In a word, they generally exceed in what they do; love violently, hate violently, and act in the same manner through the rest of their conduct.\u2014The disposition of old men is generally contrary to the former. They are cautious, and enter upon nothing hastily; having in the course of many years been often imposed upon; having often erred, and experienced the prevailing corruption of human affairs; for which reason they are likewise suspicious, and moderate in their affections either of love or hatred. They pursue nothing great and noble, and regard only the necessaries of life. They love money; having learned by experience the difficulty of getting it, and how easily it is lost. They are fearful, which makes them provident. Commonly full of complaints, from bodily infirmities, and a deficiency of spirits. They please themselves rather with the memory of what is past, than with any future prospect; having so short a view of life before them, in comparison of what is already gone; for which reason also, they love to talk of things past; and prefer them to what is present, of which they have but little relish, and know they must shortly leave them. They are soon angry, but not to excess. Lastly, They are compassionate, from a sense of their own infirmities, which makes them think themselves of all persons most exposed.\u2014Persons of a middle age, between these two extremes, as they are freed from the rashness and temerity of youth, so they have not yet suffered the decays of old age. Hence in every thing they generally observe a better conduct. They are neither too hasty in their assent as the one, nor so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>-ly scrupulous as the other, but weigh the reasons of things. They regard a decency in their actions; are careful and industrious; and as they undertake what appears just and laudable upon better and more deliberate consideration than young persons, so they pursue them\nAs to the different fortunes of mankind, they may be considered as noble, rich, or powerful; and the contrary to these.\u2014Those of high birth, and noble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a>, are generally very tender of their honour, and ambitious to increase it; it being natural for all persons to desire an addition to those advantages of which they find themselves already possessed. And they are apt to consider all others as much their inferiors, and therefore expect great regard and deference should be shown them.\u2014Riches, when accompanied with a generous temper, command respect, from the opportunities they give of being useful to others; but they usually elate the mind, and occasion pride. For as money is commonly said to command all things, those who are possessed of a large share of it, expect others should be at their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BECK\">beck</a>; since they enjoy that which all desire, and which most persons make the main pursuit of their lives to obtain.\u2014But nothing is more apt to swell the mind than power. This is what all men naturally covet, even when perhaps they would not use it. But the views of such persons are generally more noble and generous than of those who only pursue riches and the heaping up of money. A state contrary to these gives a contrary turn of mind; and in lower life, persons dispositions usually differ according to their station and circumstances. A citizen and a courtier, a merchant and a soldier, a scholar and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a>, as their pursuits are different, so is generally their turn and disposition of mind.\n\nIt is the orator's business, therefore, to consider these several characters and circumstances of life, with the different bias and way of thinking they give to the mind; that he may conduct himself in his behaviour and manner of speaking, as will render him most acceptable, and gain him the good esteem of those whom he addresses.\n\n**Chap. VI. Of the Passions.**\n\nAs it is often highly necessary for the orator, so it requires his greatest skill, to engage the passions in his art. And, doubtless, nothing more discovers its empire over the minds of men, than this power to excite, appease, and sway their passions, agreeably to the design of the speaker. Hence we meet with the characters of admirable, divine, and other splendid titles, ascribed to eloquence by ancient writers. It has indeed been objected by some, that whatever high encomiums may be given of this art by the admirers of it, it is however disingenuous to deceive and impose upon mankind, as those seem to do, who, by engaging their passions, give a bias to their minds, and take them off from the consideration of the truth; whereas every thing should be judged of from the reasons brought to support it, by the evidence of which it ought to stand or fall. But, in answer to this, it may be considered that all fallacy is not culpable. We often deceive children for their good; and physicians sometimes impose on their patients, to come at a cure. And why, therefore, when persons will not be prevailed with by reason and argument, may not an orator endeavour, by engaging their passions, to persuade them to that which is for their advantage? Besides, Quintilian makes it a necessary qualification of an orator, that he be an honest man, and one who will not abuse his art. But since those of a contrary character will leave no methods untried in order to carry their point, it is requisite for those who design well to be acquainted with all their arts, without which they will not be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a> for them; as in military affairs it is highly advantageous for the general of an army to get himself informed of all the designs and stratagems of the enemy, in order to counteract them. Indeed this part of oratory is not necessary at all times, nor in all places. The better prepared persons are to consider truth, and act upon the evidence of it, the less occasion there appears for it. But the greater part of mankind either do not duly weigh the force of arguments, or refuse to act agreeably to their evidence. And where this is the case, that persons will neither be convinced by reason, nor moved by the authority of the speaker, the only way left to put them upon action, is to engage their passions. For the passions are to the mind, what the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> is to a ship; they move, and carry it forward; and he who is without them, is in a manner without action, dull and lifeless. There is nothing great or noble to be performed in life wherein the passions are not concerned. The Stoics, therefore, who were for eradicating the passions, both maintained a thing in itself impossible, and which, if it was possible, would be of the greatest prejudice to mankind. For while they appeared such zealous affirers of the government of reason, they scarce left it anything to govern; for the authority of reason is principally exercised in ruling and moderating the passions, which, when kept in a due regulation, are the springs and motives to virtue. Thus hope produces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>, and fear industry; and the like might be shown of the rest. The passions therefore are not to be extirpated, as the Stoics affected, but put under the direction and conduct of reason. Indeed where they are ungovernable, and resist the control of reason, they are, as some have fitly called them, diseases of the mind; and frequently hurry men to vice, and the greatest misfortunes of life: just as the wind, when it blows moderately, carries on the ship; but if it be too boisterous and violent, may overturn her. The charge therefore brought against this art, for giving rules to influence the passions, appears groundless and unjust; since the proper use of the passions is, not to hinder the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of reason, but engage men to act agreeably to reason. And if an ill use be sometimes made of this, it is not the fault of the art but of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>.\n\nWe shall here consider the passions, as they may be separately referred, either to demonstrative, deliberative, or judicial discourses; though they are not wholly confined to any of them.\n\n1. To the demonstrative kind, we may refer joy and sorrow, love and hatred, emulation and contempt.\n\nJoy is an elation of the mind, arising from a sense of some present good. Such a reflection naturally creates a pleasant and agreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>, which ends in a delective delightful calm and serenity. This is heightened by a description of former evils, and a comparison between them and the present felicity. Thus Cicero endeavours to excite in the minds of his fellow citizens the highest tenor of joy and delight at Catiline's departure from Rome, by representing to them the imminent danger which threatened\nInvention threatened both them and the city while he continued among them.\n\nSorrow, on the contrary, is an uneasiness of mind arising from a sense of some present evil. This passion has generally a place in funeral discourses. And it may be heightened, like the former, by comparison, when any past happiness is set in opposition to a present calamity. Hence Cicero aggravates the sorrow at Rome occasioned by the death of Metellus, from his character, and great services to the public, while living.\n\nLove excites us to esteem any person for some excellency, and to do him all the good in our power. It is distinguished from friendship, which is mutual; and therefore love may continue where friendship is lost; that is, the affection may remain on one side. And when we assist a person from no other motive but to do him a kindness, Aristotle calls this goodwill. Love takes its rise from a variety of causes. Generosity, benevolence, integrity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>, courtesy, and other social virtues, are great incitements to love any one endowed with such qualities. And persons generally love those who are of a like disposition with themselves, and pursue the same views. It is therefore the chief art of a flatterer to suit himself in every thing to the inclination of the person whose good graces he courts. When the orator would excite this affection towards any person, it is proper to show, that he is possessed of at least some, if not all, of these agreeable qualities. When the conspirators with Catiline were to be brought to justice, Cicero was very sensible of the envy he should contract on that account, and how necessary it was for him to secure the love of the Roman senate for his support and protection in that critical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a>. And this he endeavours to do in his fourth oration against Catiline, by representing to them in the most pathetic manner, that all the labours he underwent, the difficulties he contended with, and the dangers to which he was exposed on that account, were not for his own sake, but for their safety, quiet, and happiness.\n\nHatred is opposed to love, and produced by the contrary dispositions. And, therefore, persons hate those who never did them any injury, from the ill opinion they have of their base and vicious inclinations. So that the way to excite this passion is by showing that any one has committed some heinous fact with an ill intent. And the more nearly affected persons are by such actions, in what they account of the greatest concern, the higher in proportion their hatred rises. Since life, therefore, is esteemed the most valuable good, Cicero endeavours to render Mark Antony odious to the citizens of Rome, by describing his cruelty.\n\nEmulation is a disquiet, occasioned by the felicity of another, not because he enjoys it, but because we desire the like for ourselves. So that this passion is in itself good and laudable, as it engages men to pursue those things which are so. For the proper objects of emulation are any advantages of mind, body, or fortune, acquired by study or labour.\n\nEmulation therefore is excited by a lively representation of any desirable advantages which appear to be attainable, from the example of others who are or have been possessed of them. But where the felicity of another occasions an uneasiness, not from the want of it, but because he enjoys it, this passion is called envy, which the ancients describe as a hideous monster, feeding upon itself, and being its own tormentor. Aristotle justly observes, that it most usually affects such persons as were once upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with those they envy. For most men naturally think so well of themselves, that they are uneasy to see those who were formerly their equals advanced above them. But as this is a base and vicious passion, the orator is not to be informed how to excite it, but how to lessen or remove it. And the method prescribed by Cicero for this purpose is, to show that the things which occasioned it have not happened to the envied person undeservedly but are the just reward of his industry or virtue; that he does not too much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> them to his own profit or pleasure, as to the benefit of others; and that the same pains and difficulties are necessary to preserve them with which they were at first acquired.\n\nContempt is opposed to emulation, and arises from misconduct in things not of themselves vicious: As where a person either acts below his station and character, or affects to do that for which he is not qualified. Thus Cicero endeavours to expose C\u00e6cilius, and bring him into contempt of the court, for pretending to rival him in the accusation of Verres, for which he was altogether unfit.\n\n2. To deliberative discourses may be referred fear, of the passions which may be referred to hope, and shame.\n\nFear arises from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of some great and impending evil. For the greatest evils, while they appear at a distance, do not much affect us. Such discourses especially if they have been injured, or apprehend so likewise those who are addicted to do injuries, or who bear us an ill will. And the examples of others, who have suffered in a like case, or from the same persons, help to excite fear. From the circumstances therefore either of the thing or person, it will not be difficult for the orator to offer such arguments as may be proper to awaken this passion. So Demosthenes, when he would persuade the Athenians to put themselves in a condition of defence against King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a>, enumerates the several acts of hostility already committed by him against the neighbouring states. And because men's private concerns generally more affect them than what relates to the public, it is proper sometimes to show the necessary connexion these have with each other, and how the ruin of one draws the other after it.\n\nThe contrary passion to fear is hope; which arises either from a prospect of some future good, or the apprehension of safety from those things which occasion our fear. Young persons are easily induced to hope the best, from the vigour of their spirits. And those who have escaped former dangers are encouraged to hope for the like success for the future. The examples of others also, especially of wise and considerate men, have often the same good effect. To find them calm and sedate when exposed to the like dangers naturally creates confidence and the hopes of safety. But nothing gives persons such firmness and steadiness of mind under the apprehension of any difficulties, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of their own integrity and innocence. Let dangers come from what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> they will, they are best prepared\nInvention, prepared to receive them. They can calmly view an impending tempest, observe the way of its approach, and prepare themselves in the best manner to avoid it.\n\nIn Cicero's oration for the Manilian law, he encourages the Roman citizens to hope for success against Mithridates, if they choose Pompey for their general, from the many instances of his former successes which he there enumerates.\n\nShame arises from the apprehension of those things that hurt a person's character. Modesty has been wisely implanted in mankind by the great Author of nature, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">guardian</a> of virtue, which ought for this reason to be cherished with the greatest care; because, as Seneca has well observed, \"if it be once lost, it is scarce ever to be recovered.\" Therefore the true cause or foundation of shame is any thing base or vicious; for this wounds the character, and will not bear reflection. And he must arrive at no small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of insensibility, who can stand against such a charge, if he be conscious to himself that it is just. Therefore, to deter persons from vicious actions, or to expose them for the commission of them, the orator endeavours to let them in such a light as may most awaken this passion, and give them the greatest uneasiness by the reflection. And because the bare representation of the thing itself is not always sufficient for this purpose, he sometimes enforces it by enlarging the view, and introducing those persons as witnesses of the fact for whom they are supposed to have the greatest regard. Thus, when some of the Athenians, in an arbitration about certain lands which had been referred to them by the contending parties, proposed it as the shortest way of deciding the controversy, to take the possession of them in their own hands; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CYDIAS\">Cydias</a>, a member of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>, to dissuade them from such an unjust action, desired them to imagine themselves at that time in the general assembly of the states of Greece (who would all hear it if shortly), and then consider how it was proper to act. But where persons labour under an excess of modesty which prevents them from exerting themselves into things fit and laudable, it may sometimes be necessary to shew that it is faulty and ill grounded. On the other hand, immodesty, or impudence, which consists in a contempt of such things as affect the reputation, can never be too much discouraged and exposed. And the way of doing this is to make use of such arguments as are most proper to excite shame. We have a very remarkable instance of it in Cicero's second Philippic, wherein he affixes this character upon Mark Antony through every scene of his life.\n\n3 To judicial discourses, may be referred anger and lenity, pity and indignation.\n\nAnger is a resentment, occasioned by some affront or injury, done without any just reason. Now men are more inclined to resent such a conduct, as they think they least deserve it. Therefore persons of distinction and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, who expect a regard should be paid to their character, can the least bear any indications of contempt. And those who are eminent in any profession or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a>, are apt to be offended if reflections are cast either upon their reputation or art. Magistrates also, and persons in public stations, sometimes think it incumbent on them to resent indignities for the support of their office. But nothing sooner inflames this passion, than if good services are rewarded with flights and neglect. The instance of Narses, the Roman general, is remarkable in this kind; who, after he had been successful in his wars with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHS\">Goths</a>, falling under the displeasure of the emperor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTINIAN\">Justinian</a>, was removed from the government of Italy, and received by the empress with this taunt, That he must be sent to weave among the girls; which so provoked him, that he said he would weave such a web, as they would never be able to unravel. And accordingly, he soon after brought down the Longobards, a people of Germany, into Italy; where they settled themselves in that part of the country, which from them is now called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOMBARDY\">Lombardy</a>. (See Narses.) The time and place in which an injury was done, and other circumstances that attended it, may likewise contribute very much to heighten the fact. Hence Demosthenes, in his oration against Midias, endeavours to aggravate the injury of being struck by him, both as he was then a magistrate, and because it was done at a public festival. From hence it appears, that the persons who most usually occasion this passion are such as neglect the rules of decency, contemn and insult others, or oppose their inclinations; as likewise the ungrateful, and those who violate the ties of friendship, or requite favours with injuries. But when the orator endeavours to excite anger, he should be careful not to exceed due bounds in aggravating the charge, lest what he says appear rather to proceed from prejudice, than a strict regard to the merit of the action.\n\nLenity is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMISSION\">remission</a> of anger. The designs of men's actions are principally to be regarded; and therefore what is done ignorantly, or through inadvertency, is sooner forgiven. Also to acknowledge a fault, submit, and ask pardon, are the ready means to take off resentment. For a generous mind is soon cooled by submission. Besides, he who repents of his fault, does really give the injured party some satisfaction, by punishing himself; as all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPENTANCE\">repentance</a> is attended with grief and uneasiness of mind, and this is apt very much to abate the desire of revenge. As, on the contrary, nothing is more provoking, than when the offender either audaciously justifies the fact, or confidently denies it. Men are likewise wont to lay aside their resentment, when their adversaries happen by some other means to suffer what they think a sufficient satisfaction. Lastly, Easy circumstances, a lucky incident, or anything which gives the mind a turn to mirth and pleasure, has a natural tendency to remove anger. For anger is accompanied with pain and uneasiness, which very ill suit joy and cheerfulness. The orator therefore, in order to afflauge and pacify the minds of his auditors, will endeavour to lessen their opinion of the fault, and by that means to take off the edge of their resentment. And to this purpose, it will be proper either to represent that the thing was not designed, or that the party is sorry for it; or to mention his former services; as also to show the credit and reputation which will be gained by a generous forgiveness. And this last topic is very artfully wrought up by Cicero, in his address to Caesar in favour of Ligarius.\n\nPity arises from the calamities of others, by reflecting, that we ourselves are liable to the like misfortunes. So that evils, considered as the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> of human nature, are principally the cause of pity. And this makes the difference between pity and good will, which arises merely from a regard to the circumstances of those who want\nInvention want our assistance. But considering the uncertainty of every thing about us, he must seem in a manner divested of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, who has no compassion for the calamities of others; since there is no affliction which happens to any man, but either that, or some other as great, may fall upon himself. But those persons are generally most touched with this passion, who have met with misfortunes themselves. And by how much greater the distress is, or by how much the person appears least deserving it, the higher pity does it excite; for which reason, persons are generally most moved at the misfortunes of their relations and friends, or those of the best figure and character. The orator, therefore, in order to excite the greater pity, will endeavour to heighten the idea of the calamity, from the several circumstances both of the thing itself and the person who labours under it. A fine example of this may be seen in Cicero's defence of Murena, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">Cap</a>. 40, &c.\n\nIndignation, as opposed to pity, is an uneasiness at the felicity of another who does not seem to deserve it. But this respects only external advantages, such as riches, honours, and the like; for virtues cannot be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of this passion. Aristotle therefore says, \"that pity and indignation are generally to be found in the same persons, and are both evidences of a good disposition.\" Now the orator excites this passion, by showing the person to be unworthy of that felicity which he enjoys. And as, in order to move compassion, it is sometimes of use to compare the former happy state of the person with his present calamity; so here, the greater indignation is raised, by comparing his former mean circumstances with his present advancement: as Cicero does in the case of Vatinus.\n\nThese are the passions with which an orator is principally concerned. In addressing to which, not only the greatest warmth and force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> is often necessary, but he must likewise first endeavour to impress his own mind with the same passion he would excite in others.\n\nA man may convince, and even persuade others to act, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> reason and argument. But that degree of eloquence which gains the admiration of mankind, and properly denominates one an orator, is never found without warmth or passion. Passion, when in such a degree as to rouse and kindle the mind, without throwing it out of the possession of itself, is universally found to exalt all the human powers. It renders the mind infinitely more enlightened, more penetrating, more vigorous and masterly, than it is in its calm moments. A man, actuated by a strong passion, becomes much greater than he is at other times. He is conscious of more strength and force; he utters greater sentiments, conceives higher designs, and executes them with a boldness and a felicity of which on other occasions he could not think himself capable. But chiefly, with respect to persuasion, is the power of passion felt. Almost every man in passion is eloquent. Then he is at no loss for words and arguments. He transmits to others, by a fort of contagious sympathy, the warm sentiments which he feels; his looks and gestures are all persuasive; and nature here shows herself infinitely more powerful than art. This is the foundation of that just and noted rule, Si vis me fleere, dolendum est primum ipsi tibi.\n\nThe warmth, however, which we express, must be suited to the occasion and the subject; for nothing can be more preposterous than an attempt to introduce great vehemence into a subject, which is either of slight importance, or which, by its nature, requires to be treated calmly. A temperate tone of speech is that for which there is most frequent occasion; and he who is on every subject passionate and vehement, will be considered as a blusterer, and meet with little regard.\n\nPART II. OF DISPOSITION.\n\nAs Invention supplies the orator with necessary materials, so Disposition directs him how to place them in the most proper and suitable order. Disposition, therefore, considered as a part of oratory, naturally follows invention. And what is here chiefly intended by it is, the placing the several parts of a discourse in a just method and dependence upon one another.\n\nWriters are not all agreed in determining the parts of an oration; though the difference is rather in the manner of considering them, than in the things themselves. But Cicero, whom we shall here follow, mentions five, namely, Introduction, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NARRATION\">Narration</a>, Proposition, Confirmation, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUTATION\">Confutation</a>, and Conclusion.\n\nCHAP. I. Of the Introduction.\n\nThe design of this is to prepare the minds of the hearers for a suitable reception of the remaining parts that are to follow. And for this end, three things are requisite; that the orator gain the good opinion of his hearers, that he secure their attention, and give them some general notion of his subject.\n\n1. Good opinion. When the orator introduces his discourse with his own person, he will be careful to do it with modesty, and seem rather to extenuate his virtues and abilities, than to magnify them. And where the nature of the subject may seem to require it, he will endeavour to show, that some just and good reason induced him to engage in it. We have a very fine example of this in Cicero's oration for the poet Aulus Licinius Archias, which begins thus: \"If I have any natural genius, which I am sensible is very small, or any ability in speaking, wherein I own I have been very conversant; or any skill acquired from the study and precepts of the best arts, to which my whole life has been devoted; this Aulus Licinius has, in a particular manner, a right to demand of me the fruit of all these things. For as far back as I can remember, and call to mind what passed in my youth to the present time, he has been my chief adviser and encourager both to undertake and pursue this course of studies.\" When the orator sets out with the persons of those to whom the discourse is made, it is not unusual to commend them for their virtues, and those especially which have a more immediate relation to the present subject. Thus Cicero begins his oration of thanks for the pardon of Marcellus, with an encomium upon the mildness, clemency, and wisdom of Caesar, to whom it was addressed.\nBut sometimes the orator expresses his gratitude for past favours; as Cicero has done in his orations, both to the people and senate of Rome, after his return from banishment.\u2014And at other times he declares his concern for them and their interest; in which manner Cicero begins his fourth oration against Catiline, which was made in the senate. \"I perceive (says he) that all your countenances and eyes are turned on me; I perceive that you are solicitous, not only for your own danger, and that of the state, but for mine likewise, if that should be removed. Your affection for me is pleasant in misfortunes, and grateful in sorrow; but I adjure you to lay it aside, and, forgetting my safety, consider yourselves and your children.\" But in judicial cases, both the character of the person whose cause he espouses, and that of the adverse party likewise, furnish the orator with arguments for exciting the good will of his hearers: The former, by commemorating his virtues, dignity, or merits, and sometimes his misfortunes and calamities. So Cicero, in his defence of Placcus, begins his oration in commending him on the account of his services done to the public, the dignity of his family, and his love to his country. And Demosthenes, in his oration against Midias, sets out with a recital of his vices, in order to recommend his own cause to the favourable opinion of the court.\n\n2. Attention. On this head, Cicero says, \"We shall be heard attentively on one of these three things; if we propose what is great, necessary, or for the interest of those to whom the discourse is addressed.\" So that, according to him, the topics of attention are much the same with those of good opinion, when taken from the subject. And indeed, people are naturally led to attend either to those things or persons of which they have entertained a favourable opinion. But in order to gain this point, the orator sometimes thinks it proper to request the attention of his audience. Thus Cicero, in his defence of Cluentius, after having shown the impositions of the charge against him, concludes his introduction in the following manner, speaking to the judges: \"Wherefore I entreat, that while I briefly and clearly reply to a charge of many years standing, you will, according to your usual custom, give me a kind and attentive hearing.\" And again, in his second Philippic, addressing himself to the senate: \"But as I must say something for myself, and many things against Mark Antony; one of these I beg of you, that you will hear me kindly, while I speak for myself; and the other I will undertake for, that when I speak against him, you shall hear me with attention.\" But though the introduction be the most usual and proper place for gaining attention, yet the orator finds it convenient sometimes to quicken and excite his hearers in other parts of his discourse, when he observes they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a>, or has something of moment to offer.\n\n3. Some general account of the subject of the discourse. This is always necessary; which the two others are not. And therefore it must be left to the prudence of the orator when to use or omit them as he shall judge proper, from the nature of his discourse, the circumstance of his hearers, and how it stands with them. But some account of the subject is what cannot be neglected. For every one expects to be soon informed of the design of the speaker, and what he proposes to treat of. Nor when they are all made use of, is it necessary they should always stand in the order we have here placed them.\n\nCicero sometimes enters immediately upon his subject, and introduces the other heads afterwards. As in his third oration against Catiline, made to the body of the Roman people, which begins thus: \"You see that the state, all your lives, estates, fortunes, wives and children, and this seat of the greatest empire, the most flourishing and beautiful city, having by the favour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> towards you, and my labours, counsels, and dangers, been this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> rescued from fire and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> and the very jaws of destruction, are preserved and restored to you.\" And then he proceeds to recommend himself to their esteem and benevolence, from the consideration of these benefits.\n\nThese are the heads which commonly furnish matter for this part of a discourse. But orators often take occasion from the time, place, largeness of the assembly, or some other proper circumstance, to compliment their hearers, recommend themselves, or introduce the subject with which they are about to treat. Instances of each may be furnished by the circumstances of the case, or other ornament, which they accommodate to the occasion of their discourse. Thus Ilocrates enters upon his celebrated panegyric in praise of his countrymen the Athenians with the following comparison: \"I have often wondered what could be their design who brought together these assemblies, and instituted the gymnastic sports, to propose so great rewards for bodily strength; and to vouchsafe no honour to those who applied their private labours to serve the public, and so cultivated their minds as to be serviceable to others, to whom they ought to have shewn greater regard. For although the strength of a champion was doubled, no benefit would from thence accrue to others; but all enjoy the prudence of one man, who will hearken to his advice.\" In some cases, orators have recourse to a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVERT\">covert</a> and artful way of opening their subject, endeavour to remove jealousies, apologize for what they are about to say, and seem to refer it to the candour of the hearers to judge of it as they please. Cicero appears to have been a perfect master of this art, and used it with great success. Thus in his seventh Philippic, where he seems to express the greatest concern, lest what he was about to say should give any offence to the senate to whom he was speaking: \"I (says he) who always declared for peace, and to whom peace among ourselves, as it is wished for by all good men, was in a particular manner desirable; who have employed all my industry in the forum, in the senate, and in the defence of my friends, whence I have arrived to the highest honours, a moderate fortune, and what reputation I enjoy; I therefore, who owe what I am to peace, and without it could not have been the person I am, be that what it will, for I would arrogate nothing to myself; I speak with concern and fear, how you will receive what I am going to say; but I beg and entreat you, from the great regard I have always expressed for the support and advancement of your honour, that if anything said by me should at first appear harsh or unfit to be received, you will notwithstanding please to hear it without offence, and not reject it till I have explained myself: I then, for I must repeat it again, who have always approved of peace, and promoted it, am against a peace with Mark Antony,\"\nThis is called infinuation; and may be necessary, where a cause is in itself doubtful, or may be thought so from the received notions of the hearers, or the impressions already made upon them by the contrary side. An honest man would not knowingly engage in a bad cause; and yet, through prevailing prejudice, that may be so esteemed which is not so in itself. In these cases, therefore, great caution and prudence are necessary to give such a turn to things, and place them in that view as may be least liable to offence. And because it sometimes happens that the hearers are not so much displeased at the object as the person, Quintilian's rule seems very proper, when he says, \"If the subject displease, the character of the person should support it; and when the person gives offence, he should be helped by the cause.\"\n\n**Chap. II. Of Narration.**\n\nThe orator having prepared his hearers to receive his discourses with candour and attention, and acquainted them with his general design in the introduction, before he proceeds directly to his subject, often finds it necessary to give some account of what preceded, accompanied, or followed upon it. And this he does in order to enlarge the view of the particular point in dispute, and place it in a clearer light. This is called narration; which is a recital of something done, in the order and manner in which it was done. Hence it is easy to perceive what those things are which properly enter into a narration. And such are the cause, manner, time, place, and consequences of an action; with the temper, fortune, views, ability, associates, and other circumstances of those concerned in it. Not that each of these particulars is necessary in every narration; but so many of them at least as are requisite to set the matter in a just light, and make it appear credible. Besides, in relating a fact, the orator does not content himself with such an account of it as is barely sufficient to render what he says intelligible to his hearers; but describes it in so strong and lively a manner, as may give the greatest evidence to his relation, and make the deepest impression upon their minds. And if any part of it appear at present less probable, he promises to clear up and remove any remaining doubts in the progress of his discourse. For the foundation of his reasoning afterwards is laid in the narration, from whence he takes his arguments for the confirmation. And therefore it is a matter of no small importance that this part be well managed, since the success of the whole discourse so much depends upon it. See Narration.\n\nThere are four properties required in a good narration; that it be short, clear, probable, and pleasant.\n\n1. The brevity of a narration is not to be judged of merely from its length: for that may be too long, which contains but a little; and that too short, which comprehends a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a>. Wherefore this depends upon the nature of the subject, since some things require more words to give a just representation of them, and others fewer. That may properly therefore be called a short narration, which contains nothing that could well have been omitted, nor omits anything which was necessary to be said. Now, in order to avoid both these extremes, care should be taken not to go farther back in the account of things, nor to trace them down lower, than the subject requires; to say that only in the general, which does not need a more particular explication; not to assign the causes of things, when it is enough to show they were done; and to omit such things as are sufficiently understood, from what either preceded, or was consequent upon them. But the orator should be careful, lest, while he endeavours to avoid prolixity, he run into obscurity. Horace was very sensible of this danger, when he said,\n\nBy striving to be short, I grow obscure.\n\n2. Perspicuity. This may justly be esteemed the chief excellency of language. For as the design of speech is to communicate our thoughts to others, that must be its greatest excellence which contributes most to this end; and that, doubtless, is perspicuity. As perspicuity therefore is requisite in all discourse, so it is particularly serviceable in a narration, which contains the substance of all that is to be said afterwards. Wherefore, if this be not sufficiently understood, much less can those things which receive their light from it. Now the following things render a narration clear and plain: Proper and significant words, whose meaning is well known and determined; short sentences, though full and explicit, whose parts are not perplexed, but placed in their just order; proper particles to join the sentences, and show their connexion and dependence on each other; a due regard to the order of time, and other circumstances necessary to be expressed; and, lastly, suitable transitions.\n\n3. Probability. Things appear probable when the causes assigned for them appear natural; the manner in which they are described is easy to be conceived; the consequences are such as might be expected; the characters of the persons are justly represented; and the whole account is well attested, consistent with itself, and agreeable to the general opinion. Simplicity likewise in the manner of relating a fact, as well as in the style, without any reserve or appearance of art, contributes very much to its credibility. For truth loves to appear naked and open, stript of all colouring or disguise. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> of Catiline was so daring and extravagant, that no one but such a desperado could ever have undertaken it with any hopes of success. However, Cicero's account of it to the senate was so full and exact, and so well suited to the character of the person, that it presently gained credit. And therefore, when upon the conclusion of Cicero's speech, Catiline, who was present, immediately stood up, and desired they would not entertain such hard thoughts of him, but consider how much his family had always been attached to the public interest, and the great services they had done the state; their resentment rose so high, that he could not be heard: upon which he immediately left the city, and went to his associates.\n\n4. The last thing required in a narration is, that it be pleasant and entertaining. And this is more difficult, because it does not admit of that accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> and pompous dress which delight the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>, and recommend some other parts of a discourse. For it certainly requires no small skill in the speaker, while he endeavours to express every thing in the most natural, plain, and easy manner, not to grow flat and tiresome.\nDisposition. For Quintilian's remark is very just, that \"the most experienced orators find nothing in eloquence more difficult, than what all who hear it fancy they could have said themselves.\" And the reason of this seems very obvious. For as all art is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of nature, the nearer it resembles that, the more perfect it is in its kind. Hence unexperienced persons often imagine that to be easiest which suits best with those natural ideas to which they have been accustomed; till, upon trial, they are convinced of their mistake. Wherefore, to render this part of a discourse pleasant and agreeable, recourse must be had to variety both in the choice of words and turns of the expression. And therefore questions, admirations, interlocutions, imagery, and other familiar figures, help very much to diversify and enliven a narration, and prevent it from becoming dull and tedious, especially when it is carried on to any considerable length.\n\nHaving given a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> account of the nature and properties of a narration, we shall now proceed to consider the uses of it.\n\nLaudatory orations are usually as it were a sort of continued narration, set off and adorned with florid language and fine images proper to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> the subject, which is naturally so well fitted to afford pleasure and entertainment. Therefore a separate narration is more suited to deliberative and judicial discourses. In Cicero's oration for the Manilian law (which is of the former kind), the design of the narration is to show the Roman people the necessity of giving Pompey the command of the army against King Mithridates, by representing the nature of that war, which is done in the following manner: \"A great and dangerous war (says he) threatens your revenues and allies from two very powerful kings, Mithridates and Tigranes; one of whom not being pursued after his defeat, and the other provoked, they think they have an opportunity to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> Asia. Letters are daily brought from those parts to worthy gentlemen of the equestrian order, who have large concerns there in farming your revenues: they acquaint me, as friends, with the state of the public affairs, and danger of their own; that many villages in Bithynia, which is now your province, are burnt down; that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of Ariobarzanes, which borders upon your revenues, is entirely in the enemy's power; that Lucullus, after several great victories, is withdrawn from the war; that he who succeeds him is not able to manage it; that all the allies and Roman citizens wish and desire the command of that war may be given to one particular person; and that he alone, and no other, is dreaded by the enemies. You see the state of the case; now consider what ought to be done.\" Here is an unhappy scene of affairs, which seemed to call for immediate redress. The causes and reasons of it are assigned in a very probable manner, and the account well attested by persons of character and figure. And what the consequences would be, if not timely prevented, no one could well be ignorant. The only probable remedy suggested in general is, the committing that affair to one certain person, which he afterwards shows at large could be no other than Pompey. But in Cicero's defence of Milo (which is of the judicial kind), the design of the narration, which is greatly commended by Quintilian, is to prove that, in the combat between Clodius and Milo, the former was the aggressor. And in order to make this appear, he gives a summary account of the conduct of Clodius the preceding year; and from the course of his actions and behaviour, shows the inveterate hatred he bore to Milo, who obstructed him in his wicked designs. For which cause he had often threatened to kill him, and given out that he should not live beyond such a time; and accordingly he went from Rome without any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> reason, but that he might have an opportunity to attack him in a convenient place near his own house, by which he knew Milo was then obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>. Milo was in the senate that day, where he stood till they broke up, then went home, and afterwards set forward on his journey. When he came to the place in which he was to be assaulted, Clodius appeared every way prepared for such a design, being on horseback, and attended with a company of desperate ruffians ready to execute his commands; whereas Milo was with his wife in a chariot, wrapped up in his cloak, and attended with servants of both sexes. These were all circumstances which preceded the fact. And as to the action itself, with the event of it, the attack, as Cicero says, was begun by the attendants of Clodius from a higher ground, who killed Milo's coachman; upon which Milo, throwing off his cloak, leaped out, and made a brave defence against Clodius's men, who were got about the chariot. But Clodius, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the skirmish, giving out that Milo was killed, was himself slain by the servants of Milo, to avenge, as they thought, the death of their master. Here seems to be all the requisites proper to make this account credible. Clodius's open and avowed hatred of Milo, which proceeded so far as to threaten his life; the time of his leaving Rome; the convenience of the place; his habit and company so different from those of Milo; joined with his known character of a most profligate and audacious wretch, could not but render it very probable that he had formed that design to kill Milo. And which of them began the attack, might very reasonably be credited from the advanced ground on which Clodius and his men were placed; the death of Milo's coachman at the beginning of the combat; the skirmish afterwards at the chariot; and the reason of Clodius's own death at last, which does not appear to have been intended, till he had given out that Milo was killed.\n\nBut a distinct and separate narration is not always necessary in any kind of discourse. For if the matter be well known before, a set and formal narrative will be tedious to the hearers. Or if one party has done it already, it is needless for the other to repeat it. But there are three occasions especially, in which it may seem very requisite: when it will bring light to the subject; when different accounts have already been given out concerning it; or when it has been misrepresented by the adverse party. If the point in controversy be of a dubious nature, or not sufficiently known to the hearers, a distinct account of the matter, with the particular circumstances attending it, must be very serviceable, in order to let them into a true state of the case, and enable them to judge of it with greater certainty.\n\nMoreover, where the opposite party has set the matter in a false light by some artful and invidious turn, or loaded it with any odious circumstances, it seems no less necessary that endeavours should be used to remove any ill impressions, which otherwise might remain upon the minds.\nDisposition, minds of the hearers, by a different and more favourable representation. And if any thing can be fixed upon to make the contrary account appear absurd or incredible, it ought particularly to be remarked. Thus Cicero, in his defence of Sextus Roelius, shows that he was many miles distant from Rome at the time he was charged with having killed his father there. \"Now (says he), while Sextus Roelius was at Aemilia, and this Titus Roelius [his accuser] at Rome, Sextus Roelius [the father] was killed at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a> on Mount Palatine, returning from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>. From whence I hope there can be no doubt who ought to be suspected of the murder. And, were not the thing plain of itself, there is this farther suffusion to fix it upon the prosecutor; that, after the fact was committed, one Manlius Glaucia, an obscure fellow, the freedman, client, and familiar, of this Titus Roelius, first carried the account of it to Aemilia, not to the son of the deceased, but to the house of Titus Capito his enemy;\" with more to the same purpose. But what we bring it for is, to show the use which Cicero makes of this narration for retorting the crime upon the prosecutors.\n\nBut the orator should be very careful, in conducting this part, to avoid every thing which may prejudice the cause he espouses. Falshood, and a misrepresentation of facts, are not to be justified; but no one is obliged to say those things which may hurt himself. We shall just mention one instance of this from Cicero, where he has shown great skill in this respect, in pleading before Caesar for the pardon of Ligarius, who had joined with Pompey in the civil war. For Ligarius, having been represented by the adverse party as an enemy to Caesar, and so esteemed by Caesar himself; Cicero very artfully endeavours in his narration to take off the force of this charge, by showing, that, when the war first broke out, he refused to engage in it; which he would not have done, had he borne any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> hatred to Caesar. \"Quintus Ligarius (says he), before there was any suspicion of a war, went into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a> as a legate to the proconsul <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIUS\">Caius</a> Confidius; in which he so approved himself, both to the Roman citizens and allies, that, when Confidius left the province, the inhabitants would not be satisfied he should leave the government in the hands of any other person. Therefore Quintus Ligarius having excused himself in vain for some time, accepted of the government against his will; which he so managed during the peace, that both the citizens and allies were greatly pleased with his integrity and justice. The war broke out on a sudden, which those in Africa did not hear till it was begun: but upon the news of it, partly through inconsiderate haste, and partly from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> fear, they looked out for a leader, first for their own safety, and then as they were affected; when Ligarius, thinking of home, and desirous to return to his friends, would not be prevailed on to engage in any affairs. In the mean time, Publius Acutius Varus, the praetor, who was formerly governor of Africa, coming to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UTICA\">Utica</a>, recourse was immediately had to him, who very eagerly took upon himself the government; if that can be called a government, which was conferred on a private man by the clamour of the ignorant multitude, without any public authority. Ligarius, therefore, who endeavoured to avoid every thing of that kind, ceased to act soon after the arrival of Varus.\" Here Cicero ends his narrative. For though Ligarius afterwards joined with Pompey's party, yet to have mentioned that, which was nothing more than what many others had done, whom Caesar had already pardoned, could have served only to increase his displeasure against him. And therefore he doubtless showed great skill in so managing his account, as to take off the main force of the accusation, and by that means make way for his pardon, which he accordingly obtained.\n\nChap. III. Of the Proposition.\n\nIn every just and regular discourse, the speaker's intention is to prove or illustrate something. And when he lays down the subject upon which he designs to treat, in a distinct and express manner, this is called the proposition.\n\nOrators use several ways in laying down the subject of their discourses. Sometimes they do it in one general subject, which an proposition. We have an instance of this in Cicero's oration speech to the senate, the day after Caesar was killed (as seems to it is given us by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DION\">Dion</a> Cassius), in which his design was treat, to persuade them to peace and unanimity. \"This (says he) being the state of our affairs, I think it necessary that we lay aside all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCORD\">discord</a> and enmity which have been among us, and return again to our former peace and agreement.\" And then he proceeds to offer his reasons for this advice.\n\nAt other times, to give a clearer and more distinct view of their discourse, they subjoin to the proposition the general heads of argument by which they endeavour to support it. This method Cicero uses in his seventh Philippic, where he says, \"I who have always commended and advised to peace, am against a peace with Mark Antony. But why am I adverse to peace? Because it is safe, because it is dangerous, and because it is impracticable. And I beseech you to hear me with your usual candour, while I make out these three things.\"\n\nBut when the subject relates to several different things, which require each of them to be separately laid down subject re- in distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a>, it is called a partition; though some have made two kinds of partition, one of which things, and they call separation, and the other enumeration. By the requires former of these, the orator shows in what he agrees with his adversary, and wherein he differs from him. So, in the case formerly mentioned, of a person accused of forgery, for the crime of stealing private money out of a temple, he is called a who pleads for the defendant says, \"He owns the fact; partition, but it being private money, the point in question is, Whether this be sacrilege?\" And in the case of Milo, Cicero, speaking of Clodius, says, \"The point which now comes before the court, is not, Whether he was killed or not; that we confess; but, Whether justly or unjustly?\" Now in reality here is no partition, since the former branch of the proposition is what is agreed upon, and given up; and consequently it is only the latter that remains to be disputed. It is called enumeration, when the orator acquaints his hearers with the several parts of his discourse upon which he designs to treat. And this alone, properly speaking, is a partition. Thus Cicero states his plea in his defence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURCIA\">Murcia</a>: \"I perceive the accusation consists of three parts: the first respects the conduct of his life; the second his dignity; and the third contains a charge of bribery.\"\n\nThere are three things requisite in a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTI\">parti</a>-\nA partition is said to be short, when each proposition contains in it nothing more than what is necessary. So that the brevity here required is different from that of a narration; for that consists chiefly in things, this in words. And, as Quintilian justly observes, brevity seems very proper here, where the orator does not show what he is then speaking of, but what he designates to discourse upon.\n\nAgain, it ought to be complete and perfect. And for this end, care must be taken to omit no necessary part in the enumeration.\n\nBut, however, there should be as few heads as is consistent with the nature of the subject. The ancient rhetoricians prescribe three or four at the most. And we do not remember that Cicero ever exceeds that number. But it is certain, the fewer they are, the better, provided nothing necessary be omitted. For too large a number is both difficult of retention, and apt to introduce that confusion which partition is designed to prevent.\n\nHitherto we have been speaking only of those heads into which the subject or general argument of the discourse is at first divided. For it is sometimes convenient to divide these again, or at least some of them, into several parts or members. And when this happens, it is best done, as the speaker comes to each of them in the order at first laid down; by which means the memory of the hearers will be less burdened than by a multitude of particulars at one and the same time. Thus Cicero, in his oration for the Aemilian law, comprises what he designs to say under three general heads. \"First (says he) I shall speak of the nature of the war, then of its greatness, and lastly about the choice of a general.\" And when he comes to the first of these, he divides it again into four branches; and shows, \"how much the glory of the Romans, the safety of their allies, their greatest revenues, and the fortunes of many of their citizens, were all concerned in that war.\" The second head, in which he considers the greatness of the war, has no division. But when he comes to the third head, concerning the choice of a general, he divides that likewise into four parts; and shows, that so many virtues are necessary in a consummate general, such a one as was proper to have the management of that war, namely, skill in military affairs, courage, authority, and success: all which he attributes to Pompey. And this is the scheme of that celebrated oration.\n\nThis subdividing, however, should never have place but when it is absolutely necessary. To split a subject into a great many minute parts, by divisions and subdivisions without end, has always a bad effect in speaking. It may be proper in a logical treatise; but it makes an oration appear hard and dry, and unnecessarily fatigues the memory. In a sermon, there may be from three to five, or six heads, including subdivisions; seldom should there be more.\n\nFurther, some divide their subject into two parts, and propose to treat upon it negatively and positively; by showing first what it is not, and then what it is. But while they are employed to prove what it is not, they are not properly treating upon that, but something else; which seems as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> as it is unnecessary. For he who proves what a thing is, does at the same time show what it is not. However, in fact, there is a sort of division by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFIRMATION\">affirmation</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATION\">negation</a>, which may sometimes be conveniently used. As if a person, charged with killing another, should thus state his defence: \"I had done right if I had killed him, but I did not kill him.\" Here indeed, if the latter can be plainly made to appear, it may seem needless to insist upon the former. But if that cannot be so fully proved, but there may be room left for suspicion, it may be proper to make use of both: for all persons do not see things in the same light, and he who believes the fact, may likewise think it just; while he who thinks it unjust, may not believe it, but rather suppose, had it really been committed by the party, he would not have denied it, since he looked upon it as defensible. And this method of proceeding, Quintilian compares to a custom often used in traffic, when persons make a large demand at first, in order to gain a reasonable price. Cicero uses this way of reasoning in his defense of Milo; but in the contrary order; that is, he first answers the charge; and then justifies the fact, upon the supposition that the charge was true. For he proves, first, that Clodius was the aggressor; and not Milo, as the contrary party had asserted: and then, to give the greater advantage to his cause, he proceeds to show, that if Milo had been the aggressor, it would however have been a glorious action to take off such an abandoned wretch, who was not only a common enemy to mankind, but had likewise often threatened his life.\n\nA good and just partition is attended with considerable advantages. For it gives both light and ornament to a discourse. And it is also a great relief to the hearers, who, by means of these stops and rests, are much better enabled to keep pace with the speaker without confusion, and by calling their thoughts either way, from what has been said, both know and are prepared for what is to follow. And as persons, in travelling a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> with which they are acquainted, go on with greater pleasure and less fatigue, because they know how far it is to their journey's end; so to be apprised of the speaker's design, and the several parts of his discourse which he proposes to treat on, contributes very much to relieve the hearer, and keep up his attention. This must appear very evident to all who consider how difficult it is to attend long and closely to one thing, especially when we do not know how long it may be before we are like to be released. Whereas, when we are beforehand acquainted with the scheme, and the speaker proceeds regularly from one thing to another, opportunity is given to ease the mind, by relaxing the attention, and recalling it again when necessary. In a sermon, or in a pleading at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>, few things are of greater consequence than a proper or happy division. It should be studied with much accuracy and care; for if one take a wrong method at first setting out, it will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> him astray in all that follows. It will render the whole discourse either perplexed or languid; and though the hearers may not be able to tell where the fault or disorder lies, they will be sensible there is a disorder somewhere, and find themselves little affected by what is spoken. The French writers of sermons study neatness and elegance in the division of their subjects much more than the English do; whose distributions, though sensible and just, yet are often inartificial and verbose.\nCHAP. IV. Of Confirmation.\n\nThe orator having acquainted his hearers, in the proposition, with the subject on which he designs to discourse, usually proceeds either to prove or illustrate what he has there laid down. For some discourses require nothing more than an enlargement or illustration, to set them in a proper light, and recommend them to the hearers; for which reason, likewise, they have often no distinct proposition. But where arguments are brought in defense of the subject, this is properly confirmation. For, as Cicero defines it, \"confirmation is that which gives proof, authority, and support to a cause, by reasoning.\" And for this end, if any thing in the proposition seems obscure, or liable to be misunderstood, the orator first takes care to explain it, and then goes on to offer such arguments for the proof of it, and represent them in such a light, as may be most proper to gain the attention of his hearers.\n\nBut here it is proper to observe, that there are different ways of reasoning fitted to different arts. The mathematician treats his subject after another manner than the logician, and the orator in a method different from them both. Two methods of reasoning are employed by orators, the synthetic and analytic.\n\nI. Every piece of synthetic reasoning may be resolved into a syllogism or series of syllogisms, (see Logic). Thus we may reduce Cicero's argument, by which he endeavours to prove that Clodius assaulted Milo, and not Milo Clodius, to a syllogism in this manner:\n\nHe was the aggressor, whose advantage it was to kill the other.\nBut it was the advantage of Clodius to kill Milo, and not Milo to kill him.\nTherefore Clodius was the aggressor, or he assaulted Milo.\n\nThe thing to be proved was, that Clodius assaulted Milo, which therefore comes in the conclusion; and the argument, by which it is proved, is taken from the head of profit or advantage. Thus the logician would treat this argument; and if either of the premises were questioned, he would support it with another syllogism. But this short and dry way of reasoning does not at all suit the orator: who not only for variety changes the order of the parts, beginning sometimes with the minor, and at other times with the conclusion, and ending with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">major</a>; but likewise clothes each part with such ornaments of expression as are proper to enliven the subject, and render it more agreeable and entertaining. And he frequently subjoins, either to the major proposition, or minor, and sometimes to both, one or more arguments to support them; and perhaps others to confirm or illustrate them as he thinks it requisite. Therefore, as a logical syllogism consists of three parts or propositions, a rhetorical syllogism frequently contains four, and many times five parts. And Cicero reckons this last the most complete. But all that is said in confirmation of either of the premises is accounted but as one part. This will appear more evident by examples: By a short syllogism Cicero thus proves, that the Carthaginians were not to be trusted: \"Those who have often deceived us, by violating their engagements, ought not to be trusted. For if we receive any damage by their treachery, we can blame nobody but ourselves. But the Carthaginians have often so deceived us. Therefore it is madness to trust them.\" Here the major proposition is supported by a reason. The minor needed none; because the treachery of the Carthaginians was well known. So that this syllogism consists of four parts. But by a syllogism of five parts he proves somewhat more largely and elegantly, that the world is under the direction of a wise governor. The major is this: \"These things are better governed which are under the direction of wisdom, than those which are not.\" This he proves by several instances: \"A house managed with prudence has everything in better order, and more convenient, than that which is under no regulation. An army commanded by a wise and skilful general is in all respects better governed than one which has a fool or a madman at the head of it. And the like is to be said of a ship, which performs her course best under the direction of a skilful pilot.\" Then he proceeds to the minor thus: \"But nothing is better governed than the universe.\" Which he proves in this manner: \"The rising and setting of the heavenly bodies keep a certain determined order; and the several seasons of the year do not only necessarily return in the same manner, but are suited to the advantage of the whole; nor did the vicissitudes of night and day ever become prejudicial, by altering their course.\" From all which he concludes, \"that the world must be under the direction of a wise governor.\" In both these examples, the regular order of the parts is observed. We shall therefore produce another, in which the order is directly contrary; for beginning with the conclusion, he proceeds next to the minor proposition, and so ends with the major. In his defence of C\u00e6lius, his design is to prove that C\u00e6lius had not led a loose and vicious life, with which his enemies had charged him. And this he does, by showing he had closely followed his studies, and was a good orator. This may probably at first sight appear but a weak argument; though to him who considers what Cicero everywhere declares necessary to gain that character, it may perhaps be thought otherwise. The sense of what he says here may be reduced to this syllogism.\n\nThose who have pursued the study of oratory, so as to excel in it, cannot have led a loose and vicious life.\nBut C\u00e6lius has done this.\nTherefore his enemies charge him wrongfully.\n\nBut let us hear Cicero himself. He begins with the conclusion, thus: \"C\u00e6lius is not chargeable with profuseness, extravagancy, contracting of debts, or intemperance, a vice which age is so far from abating, that it rather increases it. Nay, he never engaged in amours, and those pleasures of youth, as they are called, which are soon thrown off, as reason prevails.\" Then he proceeds to the minor, and shows from the effects, that C\u00e6lius had closely applied himself to the best arts, by which he means those necessary for an orator: \"You have now heard him make his own defence, and you formerly heard him engaged in a prosecution (I speak this to vindicate, not to applaud him), you could not but perceive his manner of speaking, his ability, his good sense, and command of language. Nor did he only discover a good genius,\"\nPart II.\n\nDisposition: genius, which will oftentimes do much of itself when it is not improved by industry; but what he said (if my affection for him did not bias my judgment) appeared to be the effect of learning, application, and study.\" And then he comes to the major: \"But be assured, that those vices charged upon C\u00e6lius, and the studies upon which I am now discoursing, cannot meet in the same person. For it is not possible that a mind, disturbed by such irregular passions, should be able to go through what we orators do, I do not mean only in speaking, but even in thinking.\" And this he proves by an argument taken from the scarcity of good orators. \"Can any other reason be assigned, why so few, both now, and at all times, have engaged in this province, when the rewards of eloquence are so magnificent, and it is attended with so great delight, applause, glory, and honour? All pleasures must be neglected; diversions, recreations, and entertainments omitted; and even the conversation of all our friends must in a manner be laid aside. This it is which deters persons from the labour and study of oratory; nor their want of genius or education.\"\n\n2. By Enthymem. But orators do not often use complete syllogisms, but most commonly enthymemes. An enthymem, as is shown elsewhere, is an imperfect syllogism, consisting of two parts; the conclusion, and one of the premises. And in this kind of syllogism, that proposition is omitted, whether it be the major or minor, which is sufficiently manifest of itself, and may easily be supplied by the hearers. But the proposition that is expressed is usually called the antecedent, and the conclusion the consequent. So if the major of that syllogism be omitted, by which Cicero endeavours to prove that Clodius assaulted Milo, it will make this enthymem:\n\nThe death of Milo would have been an advantage to Clodius.\n\nTherefore Clodius was the aggressor; or, therefore, he assaulted Milo.\n\nIn like manner, that other syllogism above mentioned, by which he shows that the Carthaginians ought not to be trusted, by omitting the minor, may be reduced to the following enthymem:\n\nThose who have often broke their faith ought not to be trusted.\n\nFor which reason the Carthaginians ought not to be trusted.\n\nEvery one would readily supply the minor, since the perfidiousness of the Carthaginians was known to a proverb. But it is reckoned a beauty in enthymemes, when they consist of contrary parts, because the turn of them is most acute and pungent. Such is that of Micipia in Sallust: \"What stranger will be faithful to you who are an enemy to your friends?\" And likewise that of Cicero for Milo, speaking of Clodius: \"You fit as avengers of his death; whose life you would not restore, did you think it in your power.\" Orators manage enthymemes in the same manner they do syllogisms; that is, they invert the order of the parts, and confirm the proposition by one or more reasons; and therefore a rhetorical enthymem frequently consists of three parts, as a syllogism does of five. Though, strictly speaking, a syllogism can consist of no more than three parts, and an enthymem but of two: and the arguments brought to support either of the propositions constitute so many new Disposition-enthymems, of which the part they are designed to prove is the conclusion. To illustrate this by an example:\n\nAn honest man thinks himself under the highest obligation to his country.\n\nTherefore he should shun no danger to serve it.\n\nIn this enthymem the major is wanting, which would run thus: \"He who is under the highest obligations to another, should shun no danger in order to serve him.\" This last proposition is founded upon the common principle of gratitude; which requires that, to the utmost of our power, a return should be made in proportion to the kindness received. And this being a maxim generally allowed, it is omitted by the orator. But now this enthymem, consisting of the minor and conclusion, might be managed in some such manner as this, beginning with the conclusion: \"An honest man ought to shun no danger, but readily expose his life for the safety and preservation of his country.\" Then the reason of this conduct might be added, which is the antecedent of the enthymem, or minor of the syllogism: \"For he is sensible that his obligations to his country are so many, and so great, that he can never fully requite them.\" And this again might be confirmed by an enumeration of particulars: \"He looks upon himself as indebted to his country for every thing he enjoys; for his friends, relations, all the pleasures of life, and even for life itself. Now the orator calls this one enthymem, though in reality there are two: For the second reason, or argument, added to the first, becomes the antecedent of a new enthymem, of which the first reason is the consequent. And if these two enthymemes were expressed separately in the natural order of the parts, the former would stand thus: \"An honest man thinks himself under the highest obligations to his country; therefore he ought to shun no danger for its preservation.\" The latter thus: \"An honest man esteems himself indebted to his country for every thing he enjoys; therefore he thinks he is under the highest obligations to it.\" The same thing might be proved in the like way of reasoning, by arguments of a different kind. From comparison, thus: \"As it would be thought safe and ungrateful in a son not to hazard himself for the preservation of his father; an honest man must certainly esteem it so when his country is in danger.\" Or from an example, in this manner: \"An honest man in like circumstances would propose to himself the example of Decius who freely gave up his life for the service of his country. He gave up his life indeed, but did not lose it; for he cannot be said to have lost his life, who lives in immortal honour.\" Orators frequently intermix such arguments to adorn and illustrate their subject with others taken from the nature and circumstances of things. And now, if we consider a little this method of reasoning, we shall find it the most plain and easy imaginable. For when any proposition is laid down, and one or more reasons subjoined to prove it, each reason joined with the proposition makes a distinct enthymem, of which the proposition is the conclusion. Thus Cicero, in his seventh Philippic, lays down this as the foundation of his discourse, \"That he is against a peace with Mark Antony; for which he gives three reasons: 'Because it is base, because it is dangerous,\nThese severally joined with the proposition, form three enthymemes; and upon each of these he discourses separately, which make up that oration. And this method is what persons for the most part naturally fall into, who know nothing of the terms syllogism or enthymeme. They advance something, and think of a reason to prove it, and another perhaps to support that; and, so far as their invention will assist them, or they are matters of language, they endeavour to set what they say in the plainest light, give it the best drefs, embellish it with proper figures and different turns of expression; and, as they think convenient, illustrate it with similitudes, comparisons, and the like ornaments, to render it most agreeable, till they think what they have advanced sufficiently proved. As this method of arguing therefore is the most plain, easy, and natural; so it is what is most commonly used in oratory. Whereas a strict syllogistical way of discoursing is dry and jejune, cramps the mind, and does not admit of those embellishments of language which are a great advantage to the orator: for which reason he seldom uses complete syllogisms; and when he does, it is with great latitude. In every discourse care should be taken not to blend arguments confusedly together that are of a separate nature. \"All arguments (says the elegant Dr Blair) are directed to prove one or other of these three things; that something is true; that it is morally right or fit; or that it is profitable and good. These make the three great subjects of disputation among mankind; truth, duty, and interest. But the arguments directed towards any one of them are generally distinct; and he who blends them all under one topic, which he calls his argument, as, in sermons especially, is too often done, will render his reasoning indistinct and irrelevant. Suppose, for instance, that I am recommending to an audience benevolence, or the love of our neighbour; and that I take my first argument from the inward satisfaction which a benevolent temper affords; my second, from the obligation which the example of Christ lays upon us to this duty; and third, from its tendency to procure us the good will of all around us; my arguments are good, but I have arranged them wrong: for my first and third arguments are taken from considerations of interest, internal peace, and external advantages; and between these, I have introduced one, which rests wholly upon duty. I should have kept those classes of arguments, which are addressed to different principles in human nature, separate and distinct.\"\n\nH. The other method of reasoning is the analytic, in which the orator conceals his intention concerning the point he is to prove, till he has gradually brought his hearers to the designed conclusion. They are led on, step by step, from one known truth to another, till the conclusion be drawn from them, as the natural consequence of a chain of propositions. As, for instance, when one intending to prove the being of a God, sets out with observing that every thing which we see in the world has had a beginning; that whatever has had a beginning, must have had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> cause; that in human productions, art known in the effect, necessarily infers design in the cause; and proceeds leading you from one cause to another, till you arrive at one supreme first cause, from whom is derived all the order and design visible in his works. This is much the same with the Socratic method, by which that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> silenced the sophists of his age.\n\nHe proceeded by several questions, which being separately granted, the thing designed to be inferred was afterwards put, which, by reason of its similitude with several cafes allowed before, could not be denied. But this is a captious way of reasoning; for while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESPONDENT\">respondent</a> is not aware of what is designed to be inferred, he is easily induced to make those concessions, which otherwise he would not. Besides, it is not so well suited to continued discourses, as to those which are interlocutory; and therefore we meet with it oftentimes in the Socratic dialogues both of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> and Xenophon. However, it may be made use of in oratory by a figure called subjection, when the same person first puts the question, and then makes the answer. So in the famous cause of Epaminondas, general of the Thebans, who was accused for refusing to surrender his command to his successor appointed by the state, till after he had engaged the enemy, and given them a total defeat, Cicero thus represents his accuser pleading for the words of the law against Epaminondas, who alleged the intention of it in his defence: \"Should Epaminondas add that exception to the law, which, he says, was the intention of the writer, namely, Except anyone refuse to give up his command when it is for the interest of the public he should not; would you admit of it? I believe not. Should you yourselves, which is a thing most remote from your justice and wisdom, in order to screen him, order this exception to be added to the law, without the command of the people; would the Thebans suffer it to be done? No, certainly. Can it be right then to come into that, as if it was written, which it would be a crime to write? I know it cannot be agreeable to your wisdom to think so.\"\n\nUnder the analytic method may be comprehended May comprehending nearly the same with the Socratic, by example. Rhetoricians use this word in a different sense from the common acceptation. For that reasoning is usually called an example, which is brought either to prove or illustrate some general assertion: As if any one should say, that human bodies may be brought to sustain the greatest labours by use and exercise; and in order to prove this should relate what is said of Milo of Croton, that \"by the constant practice of carrying a calf several furlongs every day, he could carry it as far after it had grown to its full size.\" But in oratory the word example is used for any kind of similitude; or, as Velleius defines it, \"When one thing is inferred from another, by reason of the likeness which appears between them.\" Hence it is called an imperfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDUCTION\">induction</a>, which infers something from several others of a like nature, and has always the greatest force when the examples are taken from facts. Now facts may be compared with respect to some agreement or similitude between them, which in themselves are either equal or unequal. Of the former kind this is an instance: \"Cato acted as became a patriot and a lover of his country's liberty, in opposing the arms of Caesar: and therefore so did Cicero.\" The reason of the inference is founded in the parity of the case, which equally concerned all good subjects of the Roman government at that time. For all were alike obliged to oppose a common enemy, who endeavoured to subvert the constitution, and subject them to his own arbitrary power. But though an example...\nample consists in the comparison of two single facts, yet several persons may be concerned in each fact. Of this kind is that which follows: \"As Pompey, Caesar, and Crassus, acted illegally in the first triumvirate, by engrossing the sole power into their own hands, and by that means violating the public liberty; so likewise did Augustus, Mark Antony, and Lepidus, in the second triumvirate, by pursuing the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>.\" But when Cicero defends Milo for killing Clodius, from the like instances of Ahala, Servilius, Scipio Nasica, Lucius Opimius, and others; that is not an example, but an induction: because one thing is there inferred from its similitude to several others. But when a comparison is made between two facts that are unequal, the inference may be either from the greater to the less, or from the less to the greater. From the greater to the less in this manner: \"Caesar had no just pretensions to the Roman government, and therefore much less had Antony.\" The reason lies in the difference between the two persons. Caesar had very much enlarged the bounds of the Roman empire by his conquests, and greatly obliged the populace by his generosity; but as he had always acted by an authority from the senate and people of Rome, these things gave him no claim to a power over them. Much less then had Antony any such pretence, who always acted under Caesar, and had never performed any signal services himself. Cicero has described the difference between them in a very beautiful manner in his second Philippic, thus speaking to Antony: \"Are you in anything to be compared to him? He had a genius, sagacity, memory, learning, care, thought, diligence; he had performed great things in war, though detrimental to the state; he had for many years designed to get the government into his hands, and obtained his end by much labour and many dangers; he gained over the ignorant multitude by public shows, buildings, concagories, and feasts; obliged his friends by rewards, and his enemies by a show of clemency. In a word, he subjected a free state to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>, partly through fear, and partly compliance. I can liken you to him for ambition of power; but in other things you are in no respect to be compared with him.\" By a comparison from the less to the greater, Cicero thus argues against Catiline: \"Did the brave Scipio, when a private man, kill Tiberius Gracchus, for attempting to weaken the state; and shall we confide bear with Catiline endeavouring to destroy the world by fire and sword?\" The circumstances of these two cases were very different; and the comparison runs between a private man and a confidant intrusted with the highest authority; between a design only to raise a tumult, and a plot to destroy the government: whence the orator justly infers, that what was esteemed lawful in one case, was much more so in the other. The like way of reasoning is sometimes used from other similitudes, which may be taken from things of all kinds, whether animate or inanimate. Of the former sort is that of Cicero speaking of Murena, when candidate for the consulship, after he had himself gone through that office: \"If it is usual (says he) for such persons as are lately arrived in port, to give those who are going out the best account they can with relation to the weather, pirates, and coasts; because thus nature directs us to assist those who are entering upon the same dangers which we ourselves have escaped: how ought I, who now after a great storm am brought within a near prospect of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, to be affected towards him, who, I perceive, must be exposed to the greatest tempests of the state?\" He alludes to the late disturbances and tumults occasioned by the conspiracy of Catiline, which had been so happily suppressed by him in the time of his consulate. Of the latter kind is that of Quintilian: \"As the ground is made better and more fruitful by culture, so is the mind by instruction.\" There is both a beauty and justness in this figure.\n\nBut comparisons are sometimes made between facts and other things, in order to infer some difference or opposition between them. In comparing two facts, on account of some disagreement and unlikeness, the inference is made from the difference between one and the other in that particular respect only. As thus: \"Though it was not effected cruelty in Brutus to put his two sons to death, for endeavouring to betray their country; it might be so in Manlius, who put his son to death, only for engaging the enemy without orders, though he gained the victory.\" The difference between the two facts lies in the different nature of the crime. The sons of Brutus entered into a conspiracy to betray their country; and though they miscarried in it, yet the intention and endeavours they used to accomplish it were criminal in the highest degree. But young Manlius could only be charged with rashness. His design was honourable, and intended for the interest of his country; only it was irregular, and might have proved of ill consequence to military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>. Now in all such cases, the force of the argument is the stronger the greater the difference appears. But the same facts which differ in one respect may agree in many others; as in the example here mentioned. Brutus and Manlius were both magistrates as well as fathers; they both killed their sons, and that for a capital crime by the Roman law. In any of which respects they may be compared in a way of similitude: as, \"If Brutus might lawfully put his son to death for a capital crime, so might Manlius.\" But now contrary facts do not only differ in some certain respect, but are wholly opposite to each other; so that what is affirmed of the one must be denied of the other; and if one be a virtue, the other is a vice. Thus Cicero compares the conduct of Marcellus and Verres in a way of opposition. \"Marcellus (says he), who had engaged, if he took Syracuse, to erect two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a> at Rome, would not beautify them with the spoils he had taken: Verres, who had made no vows to Honour and Virtue, but to Venus and Cupid, endeavoured to plunder the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a>. The former would not adorn the gods with the spoils of other deities: the latter carried the ornaments of Minerva, a virgin, into the house of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARLOT\">harlot</a>.\" If therefore the conduct of Marcellus was laudable and virtuous, that of Verres must bear the contrary character. But this way of reasoning has likewise place in other respects. Thus Cicero, in the quarrel between Caesar and Pompey, advised to peace from the difference between a foreign and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> war: \"That the former might prove beneficial to the state; but in the latter, whichever side conquered, the public must suffer.\" And thus the ill effects of intemperance may be shown in a way of opposition: \"That as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a> preserves the health of the body, keeps up the vigour of the mind, and prolongs life; so excess must necessarily have the contrary effects.\"\n\nThus we have given a brief account of the principal ways...\nways of reasoning commonly made use of by orators. As to the disposition of arguments, or the order of placing them, some advice to put the weaker, which cannot wholly be omitted, in the middle; and such as are stronger, partly in the beginning, to gain the esteem of the hearers, and render them more attentive; and partly at the end, because what is last heard is likely to be retained longest: But if there are but two arguments, to place the stronger first, and then the weaker; and after that to return again to the former, and insist principally upon that. But this must be left to the prudence of the speaker, and the nature of the subject. Though to begin with the strongest, and to gradually descend to the weakest, can never be proper, for the reason last mentioned. Nor ought arguments to be crowded too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> upon one another; for that takes off from their force, as it breaks in upon the attention of the hearers, and does not leave them sufficient time duly to consider them. Nor indeed should more be used than are necessary; because the fewer they are, the more easily they are remembered. And the observation of a great master of eloquence upon this subject is certainly very just, that arguments ought rather to be weighed than numbered.\n\n**CHAP. V. Of Confutation.**\n\nThe forms of reasoning here are the same as have been already explained under confirmation. Confutation, however, is often the more difficult task; because he who is to confute a thing comes usually prepared; but he who is to confute it is frequently left to a sudden answer. For which reason, in judicial cases, Quintilian says, \"It is as much easier to accuse than defend, as it is to make a wound than to heal it.\" Therefore, not only a good judgment, but a readiness of thought also, seems necessary for this province. But, in all disputes, it is of the greatest consequence to observe where the fires of the controversy lies. For without attending to this, persons may cavil about different matters, without understanding each other, or deciding anything. And in confutation, what the adversary has advanced ought carefully to be considered, and in what manner he has expressed himself. As to the things themselves, whether they immediately relate to the matter in dispute, or are foreign to it. Those things that are foreign to the subject may either be passed over in silence, or in a very few words shown to be insignificant. And there ought likewise to be a distinction made between such things as relate to the subject, according to their importance. Those that appear to have no great weight should be lightly remarked. For to insist largely upon such matters is both tiresome to the hearers, and apt to bring the judgment of the speaker into question. And therefore things of that nature are generally better turned off with an air of neglect, a pungent question, or an agreeable jest, than confuted by a serious and laboured answer. But those things, which relate to the merits of the cause, may be confuted either by contradicting them, or by showing some mistake in the reasoning, or their invalidity when granted.\n\nThings may be contradicted several ways. What is apparently false may be expressly denied. Thus Cicero in his defense of Cluentius: \"When the accuser had said, that the man fell down dead after he had drank off his cup, denies that he died that day.\" And things which the adversary cannot prove, may likewise be denied. Of which we have also an instance in Cicero, who first upbraids Mark Antony as guilty of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> not only of good breeding, but likewise of friendship, for reading publicly a private letter he had sent him. And then adds, \"But what will you say now, if I should deny that ever I sent you that letter? How will you prove it? By the handwriting? In which I confess you have a peculiar skill, and have found the benefit of it. But how can you make it out? For it is in my secretary's hand. I cannot but envy your master who had so great a reward for teaching you to understand just nothing. For what can be more unbecoming not only an orator, but even a man, than for anyone to offer such things, which if the adversary denies he has nothing more to say?\" It is an handsome way of contradicting a thing, by showing that the adversary himself maintained the contrary. So when Oppius was charged with defrauding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, Cicero refutes it, by proving, that the same persons charged Oppius with a design to corrupt the army by his liberality. An adversary is never more effectually silenced than when you can fall contradictions upon him; for this is flabbing him with his own weapon. Sometimes a thing is not in express terms denied, but represented to be utterly incredible. And this method exposes the adversary more than a bare denial. So when some persons reproached Cicero with cowardice, and a shameful fear of death, he recites their reasons in such a manner, that any one would be inclined to think the charge entirely false. \"Was it becoming me (says he) to expect death with that composure of mind as some have imagined? Well, and did I then avoid it? Nay, was there anything in the world that I could apprehend more desirable? Or, when I had done the greatest things in such a crowd of ill-minded persons about me, do you think banishment and death were not always in my view, and continually founding in my ears as my certain fate, while I was so employed? Was life desirable when all my friends were in such sorrow, and myself in so great distress, deprived of all the gifts both of nature and fortune? Was I so inexperienced, so ignorant, so void of reason and prudence? Had I never seen or heard anything in my whole life? Did all I had read and studied avail nothing? What! did not I know that life is short, but the glory of generous actions permanent? When death is appointed for all, does it not seem eligible, that life, which must be wrested from us, should rather be freely devoted to the service of our country, than reserved to be worn out by the decays of nature? Was not I sensible, there has been this controversy among the wisest men, that some say, the minds of men and their consciences utterly perish at death; and others, that the minds of wise and brave men are then in their greatest strength and vigour, when they are set free from the body?\" The first state is not greatly to be dreaded, to be void of sense: but the other, of enjoying larger capacities, is greatly to be desired. Therefore, since I always aimed at dignity, and thought nothing was worth living for without it; how should I, who am past the usefulness, and did do great things in it, be afraid to die?\" Thus far Cicero. There is likewise an ironical way of contradicting a thing, by restoring that and other things of the like nature upon the\nThus Cicero, in his oration against Vatinus, says: \"You have objected to me, that I defended Cornelius, my old friend, and your acquaintance. But pray why should I not have defended him? Has Cornelius carried any law contrary to the omens? Has he violated any law? Has he assaulted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a>? Did he take possession of a temple by force of arms? Did he drive away the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBUNE\">tribune</a>, who opposed the passing a law? Has he thrown contempt upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>? Has he plundered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>? Has he pillaged the state? No, these, all these, are your doings.\" Such an unexpected return is sometimes of great service to abate the confidence of an adversary.\n\nA second way of confutation is, by observing some flaw in the reasoning of the adverse party. We shall endeavour to illustrate this from the several kinds of reasoning treated of before under confirmation. And first, as to syllogisms; they may be refuted, either by showing some mistake in the premises, or that the conclusion is not justly deduced from them. So when the Clodian party contended, that Milo ought to suffer death for this reason, because he had confessed that he had killed Clodius; that argument, reduced to a syllogism, would stand thus:\n\nHe who confesses he has killed another, ought not to be allowed to see the light.\nBut Milo confesses this.\nTherefore he ought not to live.\n\nNow the force of this argument lies in the major or first proposition; which Cicero refutes, by proving, that the Roman people had already determined contrary to what is there alleged: \"In what city (says he) do these men dispute after this weak manner? In that wherein the first capital trial was in the case of the brave Horatius, who, before the city enjoyed perfect freedom, was saved by the suffrages of the Roman people, though he confessed that he killed his sister with his own hand.\" But when Cicero accused Verres for maladministration in his government of Sicily, Hortensius, who defended him, being sensible the allegations brought against him could not be denied, had no other way left to bring him off, but by pleading his military virtues in abatement, which at that time were much wanted, and very serviceable to the state. The form of the argument was this:\n\nThat the Romans then wanted good generals.\nThat Verres was such.\nAnd consequently, that it was for the interest of the public that he should not be condemned.\n\nBut Cicero, who knew his design, states the argument for him in his charge; and then answers it by denying the consequence, since the crimes of Verres were of so heinous a nature, that he ought by no means to be pardoned on the account of any other qualifications: Though indeed he afterwards refutes the minor or second proposition, and shows that he had not merited the character of a good general. Enthymemes may be refuted, either by showing that the antecedent is false, or the consequent not justly inferred from it. As thus, with respect to the former case:\n\nA strict adherence to virtue has often proved detrimental.\nTherefore virtue ought not constantly to be embraced.\n\nHere the antecedent may be denied. For virtue is always beneficial to those who strictly adhere to it, both in the present satisfaction it affords them, and the future rewards they may certainly expect from it. And as to the latter case, in this manner:\n\nShe is a mother.\nTherefore she loves her children.\n\nNow as the certainty of that inference depends upon this general assertion, That all mothers love their children, which is not true, the mistake of the reasoning may be shown from the instance of Medea and others, who destroyed their own children. As to induction and example, by which the truth or equity of a thing is proved from its likeness to one or more other things; the reasoning in either is invalid, if the things compared can be shown not to have that similitude or agreement on which the inference is founded. One instance therefore may serve for both. As when Cicero, after the death of Caesar, pleaded for the continuance of his laws, but not of those which were made afterwards by Mark Antony: Because, though both were in themselves invalid, and impositions upon the public liberty; yet some of Caesar's were useful, and others could not be set aside without disturbance to the state, and injuring particular persons; but those of Antony were all detrimental to the public.\n\nThe last method of confutation before-mentioned was, when the orator does in some sense grant the adversary his argument, and at the same time shows its invalidity. And this is done by a variety of ways, according to the different nature of the subject. Sometimes he allows what was said may be true; but pleads, that what he contends for is necessary. This was the method by which Hortensius professed to bring off Verres, as we have already shown from Cicero, whose words are these, addressing himself to the judges; \"What shall I do? which way shall I bring in my accusation? where shall I turn myself? for the character of a brave general is placed like a wall against all the attacks I can make. I know the place, I perceive where Hortensius intends to display himself. He will recount the hazards of war, the necessities of the state, the scarcity of commanders; and then he will entreat you, and do his utmost to persuade you not to suffer the Roman people to be deprived of such a commander upon the testimony of the Sicilians, nor the glory of his arms to be filled by a charge of avarice.\" At other times the orator pleads, that although the contrary opinion may seem to be attended with advantage, yet that his own is more just, or honourable. Such was the case of Regulus, when his friends endeavoured to prevail with him to continue at Rome, and not return to Carthage, where he knew he must undergo a cruel death. But as this could not be done without violating his oath, he refused to hearken to their persuasions. Another way of confutation is, by retorting upon the adversary his own argument. Thus Cicero, in his defence of Ligarius, says: \"You have, Tubero, that which is most definable to an accuser, the confession of the accused party; but yet such a\nconfession, that he was on the same side that you, Tubero, chose yourself, and your father too, a man worthy of the highest praise. Wherefore, if there was any crime in this, you ought first to confess your own before you attempt to fasten any upon Ligarius.\" The orator takes this advantage where an argument proves too much, that is, more than the person designed it for, who made use of it. Not much unlike this is what they call <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERSION\">inversion</a>, by which the orator shows, that the reasons offered by the opposite party make for him. So when C\u00e6cilius urged, that the province of accusing Verres ought to be granted to him, and not to Cicero, because he had been his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a> in Sicily at the time those crimes were committed with which he was charged, and consequently knew most of that affair; Cicero turns the argument upon him, and shows, for that very reason he was the most unfit of any man to be intrusted with his prosecution; since having been concerned with him in his crimes, he would certainly do all in his power to conceal or lessen them. Again, sometimes the charge is acknowledged, but the crime shifted off to another. Thus, when Sextius was accused of sedition, because he had got together a body of gladiators, and brought them into the forum, where a warm engagement happened between them and Clodius's faction; Cicero owns the fact, but charges the crime of sedition upon Clodius's party in being the aggressors. Another method made use of for the same purpose is to alleviate the charge, and take off the force of it, by showing, that the thing was not done with that intention which the adversary inferrates. Thus Cicero, in his defence of King Dejotarus, owns he had raised some forces, though not to invade the Roman territories, as had been alleged, but only to defend his own borders, and send aid to the Roman generals.\n\nWe have hitherto been speaking of the methods of confutation used by orators, in answering those arguments which are brought by the contrary party. But sometimes they raise such objections themselves to what they have said, as they imagine may be made by others; which they afterwards answer, the better to induce their hearers to think that nothing considerable can be offered against what they have advanced, but what will admit of an easy reply. Thus, when Cicero, at the request of the Sicilians, had undertaken the accusation of Verres, it came under debate, whether he, or C\u00e6cilius, who had been Verres's quaestor in Sicily, should be admitted to that province. Cicero, therefore, in order to set him aside, among other arguments, shows his incapacity for such an undertaking, and for that end recounts at large the qualifications necessary for an orator. Which he represents to be so many and great, that he thought it necessary to start the following objection to what he had himself said upon that subject. \"But you will say perhaps, Have you all these qualifications?\" To which he thus replies: \"I wish I had; but it has been my constant study from my youth to gain them. And if, from their greatness and difficulty, I have not been able to attain them, who have done nothing else through my whole life; how far, do you imagine, you must be from it, who never thought of them before; and even now, when you are entering upon them, have no apprehension what, and how great, they are?\" This is an effectual way of defeating an adversary, when the objection is well founded, and clearly answered. But we shall have occasion to consider this matter more largely hereafter, under the figure of preludes, to which it properly relates.\n\nCHAP. VI. Of the Conclusion.\n\nRhetoricians make the conclusion of a discourse to the conclusion of two parts: recapitulation, and an address to the audience. Recapitulation is a summary account of what the speaker has before offered in maintenance of his subject; and is designed both to refresh the memory of the hearers, and to bring the principal arguments together into a narrow compass, that they may appear in a stronger light. Now there are several things necessary to a good repetition.\n\nAnd first, it must be short and concise; since it is designed to refresh the memory, and not to burden it. For this end, therefore, the chief things only are to be touched upon; those on which the cause principally depends, and which the orator is most desirous should be regarded by his hearers. Now these are, The general heads of the discourse, with the main arguments brought to support them. But either to infill particularly upon every minute circumstance, or to enlarge upon those heads which it may be thought proper to mention, carries in it not so much the appearance of a repetition, as of a new discourse.\n\nAgain, it is convenient in a repetition to recite things in the same order in which they were at first laid down. By this means the hearers will be enabled much better to keep pace with the speaker as he goes along; and if they happen to have forgot any thing, they will the more readily recall it. And besides, this method appears most simple and open, when the speaker reviews what he has said in the same manner it was before delivered, and sets it in the clearest light for others to judge of it. But though a repetition contains only the same things which had been more largely treated of before; yet it is not necessary they should be expressed in the same words. Nay, this would many times be tiresome and unpleasant to the hearers; whereas a variety of expression is grateful, provided the sense be the same. Besides, every thing ought now to be represented in the strongest terms, and in so lively a manner, as may at the same time both entertain the audience, and make the deepest impression upon their minds. We have a very exact and accurate example of repetition in Cicero's oration for Quintius. Cicero was then a young man, and seems to have kept more closely to the rules of art, than afterwards, when, by use and practice, he had gained a greater freedom of speaking. We formerly cited the partition of this speech, upon another occasion, which runs thus: \"We deny, Sextus Nevius, that you were put into the possession of the estate of P. Quintius, by the praetor's edict. This is the dispute between us. I will therefore show, first, that you had no just cause to apply to the praetor for the possession of the estate of P. Quintius; then that you could not possess it by the edict; and lastly, that you did not possess it. When I have proved these three things, I will conclude.\" Now Cicero begins his conclusion with a repetition of those three heads, and a summary account of the several arguments he made use of under each of them. But they are too long to be here exhibited.

There is a distinction between the old and the new town; this last is regular, the houses are well built, and the streets are wide. Its position is by the side of the sea, and it is terminated, on one side, by a charming terrace, which serves for a promenade.\n\nAny person may live peaceably in this province, without fear of being troubled on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, provided he conduct himself with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECORUM\">decorum</a>.

The houses are commodious, facing on one side the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> which leads to France, and on the other a fine garden, with a prospect of the sea. All the houses are separate from each other: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> hire them for the season, i.e. from October till May.

Reamur's thermometer, in 1781, never fell more than three degrees below the freezing point, and that only for two days; while at Geneva it fell ten: and in the course of the winter of 1785 it fell only two degrees; while at Geneva it fell 15. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of May is rarely so fine in France as February at Nice. The summer is not so hot as might be expected. The thermometer never rises more than 24 degrees (86\u00b0 Fahrenheit) above temperate in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>; and there is always an agreeable sea breeze from ten in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> till sunset, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> breeze comes on. There are three chains of graduated mountains, the last of which confound their summits with the Alps; and to this triple rampart is owing the mild temperature so sensibly different from that of the neighbouring parts.\n\n\"The cultivation of the ground is as rich as can be desired. There are alternately rows of corn and beans, separated by vines attached to different fruit-trees, the almond and the fig; so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> being incessantly cultivated, and covered with trees, olive, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEDAR\">cedar</a>, pomegranate, laurel, and myrtle, causes the constant appearance of spring, and forms a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> with the summits of the Alps, in the background, covered with snow.\"\n\nNice, an ancient town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATOLIA\">Natolia</a>, now called Nice, with a Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a>'s see.

He was a great favourite of the elder Andronicus, who made him librarian of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Constantinople, and sent him Nicephorus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVIA\">Servia</a>. He accompanied this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> in his misfortunes, and assisted at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; after which he repaired to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of the younger Andronicus, where he seems to have been well received; and it is certain that, by his influence over the Greeks, that church was prevailed on to refuse entering into any conference with the legates of Pope John XXII. But in the dispute which arose between Barlaam and Palamos, taking the part of the former, he maintained it zealously in the council that was held at Constantinople in 1351, for which he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> into prison, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> there till the return of John Palaeologus, who released him; after which he held a disputation with Palamos, in the presence of that emperor. He compiled a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, which in 11 books contains all that passed from 1204, when Constantinople was taken by the French, to the death of Andronicus Palaeologus the younger, in 1341.\u2014The best edition of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> is that of the Louvre, in Greek and Latin, in 1792.\n\nNicephorus, Caliphus, a Greek historian, who flourished in the 14th century under the emperor Andronicus Palaeologus the elder, wrote an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> history in 23 books; 18 of which are still extant, containing the transactions of the church from the birth of Christ to the death of the emperor Phocas in 610.\u2014We have nothing else but the arguments of the other five books, from the commencement of the reign of the emperor Heraclius, to the end of that of Leo the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">Philosopher</a>, who died in the year 911. Nicephorus dedicated his history to Andronicus Palaeologus the elder. It was translated into Latin by John Langius; and has gone through several editions, the best of which is that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, in 1630.\n\nNic\u00e9ron, John Francis, a French philosopher, was born at Paris in 1613. Having finished his academical studies, with a success which raised the greatest hopes of him, he entered into the order of the Minims, and took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> in 1632; and, as is usual, he changed the name given him at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a> for that of Francis, the name of his paternal uncle, who was also a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINIM\">Minim</a>, or Franciscan. The inclination and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> which he had for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> appeared early. He began to apply himself to that science in his philosophical studies, and devoted to it all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> he could spare from his other employments, after he had completed his studies in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>. All the branches of the mathematics, however, did not equally engage his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>; he confined himself particularly to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">optics</a>, and only learned of the rest as much as was necessary for rendering him perfect in this. There remain still, in several houses wherein he dwelt, especially at Paris, some excellent performances, which discover his skill in this way, and which make us regret that a longer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> did not suffer him to carry it to that perfection which he desired; since one cannot help being surprized that he proceeded so far as he did, in the midst of those occupations and travels by which he was forced from it, during the short space of time which he lived. He hath himself observed, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a> to his Thaumaturgus Opticus, that he went twice to Rome; and that, on his return home, he was appointed teacher of theology. He was afterwards chosen to accompany Father Francis de la Noue, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VICAR\">vicar</a> general of the order, in his visitation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONVENTS\">convents</a> throughout all France. But the eagerness of\nof his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> put him upon making the best of all the moments he had to spare for books; and that wife economy furnished him with as much as satisfied him.

His father was a barrister at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>; and both his parents were of good families in Cornwall. After receiving the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> at a private school in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, where his docility and sweetness of temper endeared him equally to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> and his school fellows, Frank was in a few years removed to Weyminster, and from thence to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, where he was admitted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONER\">commoner</a> (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> sojourner) of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXETER\">Exeter</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, under the tuition of Mr John Haviland, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 4. 1714. There he applied himself diligently to all the usual academical studies, but particularly to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> and polite literature.\nNicholls literature, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> were most conspicuous in his subsequent lectures on physiology. After <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> a few books on anatomy, in order to perfect himself in the nomenclature of the animal parts then adopted, he engaged in dissections, and then devoted himself to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, perfectly free and unbiased by the opinions of others.\n\nOn his being chosen reader of anatomy in that university, he employed his utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to elevate and illustrate a science which had there been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> depressed and neglected; and by quitting the beaten track of former lecturers, and minutely investigating the texture of every bowel, the nature and order of every vessel, &c. he gained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> reputation. He did not then reside at Oxford; but, when he had finished his lectures, used to repair to London, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of his abode, where he had determined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a>. He had once an intention of fixing in Cornwall, and for a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> practised there with great reputation; but being soon tired of the fatigues attendant on that profession in the country, he returned to London, bringing back with him a great insight, acquired by diligent observation, into the nature of the miliary fever, which was attended with the most salutary effects in his subsequent practice at London.\n\nAbout this time he resolved to visit the continent, partly with a view of acquiring the knowledge of men, manners, and languages; but chiefly to acquaint himself with the opinions of foreign naturalists on his favourite study. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, by conversing freely with the learned, he soon recommended himself to their notice and esteem. Windlow's was the only good system of physiology at that time known in France, and Morgagni's and Santorini's of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, which Dr Nicholls likewise soon after visited. On his return to England, he repeated his physiological lectures in London, which were much frequented, not only by students from both the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a>, but also by many surgeons, apothecaries, and others. Soon after, his new and successful treatment of the miliary fever, then very prevalent in the southern parts of England, added much to his reputation. In 1725, at a meeting of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>, he gave his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> on the nature of aneurysms, in which he differed from Dr Freind in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of Physic.\n\nAt the beginning of the year 1728, he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society, to which he afterwards communicated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of an uncommon disorder (published in the Transactions), viz. a polypus, resembling a branch of the pulmonary vein (for which Tulpus has strangely mistaken it), coughed up by an asthmatic person. He also made observations (in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Transactions) on a treatise by M. Helvetius of Paris, on the Lungs. Towards the end of the year 1729, he took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> of physic at Oxford. At his return to London, he underwent an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> and censors of the College of Physicians, previous to his being admitted a candidate, which every practitioner must be a year before he can apply to be chosen a fellow. Dr Nicholls was chosen into the college on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 26, 1732; and two years after, being chosen Gulstonian reader of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATHOLOGY\">Pathology</a>, he made the structure of the heart, and the circulation of the blood, the subject of his lectures. In 1736, at the request of the president, he again read the Gulstonian lecture; taking for his subject those parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> body which serve for the secretion and discharge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>; and the causes, symptoms, and cure of the diseases occasioned by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>. In 1739, he delivered the anniversary Harveian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORATION\">oration</a>. In 1743, he married <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, youngest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of the celebrated Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAD\">Mead</a>, by whom he had five children, two of whom died young. Two sons and a daughter survived him. In 1748, Dr Nicholls undertook the office of chirurgical lecturer, beginning with a learned and elegant dissertation on the Anima Medica. About this time, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Dr John Cunningham, one of the elects of the college, Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a> was chosen to succeed him in preference to our author, who was his senior, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> reason. With a just resentment, he immediately resigned the office of chirurgical lecturer, and never after attended the meetings of the fellows, except when business of the utmost importance was in agitation.\n\nIn 1751, he took some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> in an anonymous pamphlet, entitled \"The petition of the Unborn Babes to the Censors of the Royal College of Physicians of London?\" in which Dr Nefit (Pocus), Dr Maule (Maulus), Dr Barrowby (Barboune), principally, and Sir William <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">Brown</a>, Sir Edward Hulfe, and the Scots incidentally, are the objects of his satire.\n\nIn 1753, on the death of Sir Hans Sloane, Bart. in his 94th year, Dr Nicholls was appointed to succeed him as one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s physicians, and held that office till the death of his royal master in 1760; when this most skilful physician was superseded with something like the offer of a pension, which he rejected with disdain.\n\nThe causes, &c. of the uncommon disorder of which the late king died, viz. a rupture of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> ventricle of the heart, our author explained in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Macclesfield, president of the Royal Society, which was published in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. I.\n\nIn 1772, to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> edition of his treatise De Anima Medica, he added a dissertation De motu cordis et sanguinis in homine nato et non nato, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> to his learned friend and coadjutor the late Dr Lawrence.\n\nTired at length of London, and also desirous of superintending the education of his son, he removed to Oxford, where he had spent most agreeably some years in his youth. But when the study of the law recalled Mr Nicholls to London, he took a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> at Epsom, where he passed the remainder of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> in a literary retirement, not inattentive to natural philosophy, especially the cultivation of grain, and the improvement of barren soils, and contemplating also with admiration the internal nature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, as taught by Linnaeus.\n\nHis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> never was robust. In his youth, at Oxford, he was with difficulty recovered from a dangerous fever by the skill of Doctors Frampton and Frewen; and afterwards at London he had frequently been afflicted with a catarrh, and an inveterate asthmatic cough, which, returning with great violence at the beginning of the year 1778, deprived the world of this valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 7th, in the 80th year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>.\n\nDr Lawrence, formerly president of the college of physicians, who gratefully ascribed all his physiological and medical knowledge to his precepts, and who, while he\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NICIAS\">Nicias</a> he lived, loved him as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, and revered him as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a>, two years after printed, and gave to his friends, a few copies of an elegant Latin Life of Dr Nicholls (with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> prefixed, a striking likeness, engraved by Hall from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of Golfei, 1779); from which, through the medium of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">Gentleman</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>, the above particulars are chiefly extracted.","sp":7,"ep":9},{"h":"NICIAS","t":"a celebrated painter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, flourished about 322 years before the Christian era; and was universally extolled for the great variety and noble choice of his subjects, the force and relievo of his figures, his skill in the distribution of the lights and shades, and his dexterity in representing all sorts of four-footed animals, beyond any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>.

The largest of these islands is about 40 miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and 15 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and the inhabitants are said to be a harmless sort of people, ready to supply the ships that stop there with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>. The fourth end of the great Nicobar is placed in east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> 94\u00b0 23' 30\"; and we collect from Mr Rennell's Memoir, that it is within the 12th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> latitude.\n\nOf the northernmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, which is called Carnicobar, we have, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Asiatic Researches, some interesting information respecting both the produce and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and the manners of its inhabitants. The author of the memoir is Mr G. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a>, who, in his account of this island, says, \"It is low, of a round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, about 40 miles in circumference, and appears at a distance as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> entirely covered with trees; however, there are several well cleared and delightful spots upon it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> kind of clay, and marshy. It produces in great abundance, and with little care, most of the tropical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, such as pine apples, plantains, papayas, cocoa-nuts, and areca-nuts; also excellent yams, and a root called cachu. The only four-footed animals upon the island are, hogs, dogs, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> rats, and an animal of the lizard kind, but large, called by the natives tolongui; these frequently carry off fowls and chickens. The only kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a> are hens, and those not in great plenty. There is an abundance of snakes of many different kinds, and the inhabitants frequently die of their bites. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> upon the island is of many sorts, in great plenty, and some of it remarkably large, affording excellent materials for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> repairing ships.\n\n\"The natives are low in stature, but very well made, and surprisingly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> and strong; they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>-coloured, and their features have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> of the Malay, quite the reverse of elegant. The women in particular are extremely ugly. The men cut their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> short, and the women have their heads shaved quite bare, and wear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> covering but a short petticoat, made of a sort of rush or dry grass, which reaches half way <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the thigh. This grass is not interwoven, but hangs round the person something like the thatching of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>. Such of Nicobar. them as have received presents of cloth petticoats from the ships, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> tie them round immediately under the arms. The men wear nothing but a narrow strip of cloth about the middle, in which they wrap up their privacies so tight that there hardly is any appearance of them. The ears of both sexes are pierced when young; and by squeezing into the holes large plugs of wood, or hanging heavy weights of shells, they contrive to render them wide, and disagreeable to look at. They are naturally disposed to be good humoured and gay, and are very fond of fitting at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> with Europeans, where they eat everything that is set before them; and they eat most enormously. They do not care much for wine, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> drink bumpers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARRACK\">arrack</a> as long as they can feel. A great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> is spent in feasting and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a>. When a feast is held at any village, every one that chooses goes uninvited, for they are utter strangers to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>. At those feasts they eat immense quantities of pork, which is their favourite food. Their hogs are remarkably fat, being fed upon the cocoa-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> kernel and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; indeed all their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> animals, fowls, dogs, &c., are fed upon the same. They have likewise plenty of small sea fish, which they strike very dexterously with lances, wading into the sea about knee deep. They are sure of killing a very small fish at 10 or 12 yards distance. They eat the pork almost raw, giving it only a hasty grill over a quick fire. They roast a fowl, by running a piece of wood through it, by way of spit, and holding it over a brisk fire until the feathers are burnt off, when it is ready for eating, in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. They never drink water; only cocoa-nut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, and a liquor called soura which oozes from the cocoa-nut tree after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> off the young sprouts or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>. This they suffer to ferment before it is used, and then it is intoxicating; to which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> they add much by their method of drinking it, by sucking it slowly through a small straw. After eating, the young men and women, who are fancifully dressed with leaves, go to dancing, and the old people surround them smoking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a> and drinking soura. The dancers, while performing, sing some of their tunes, which are far from wanting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>, and to which they keep exact time. Of musical instruments they have only one kind, and that the simplest. It is a hollow bamboo about two feet and a half long and three inches in diameter, along the outside of which there is stretched from end to end a single string made of the threads of a split <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANE\">cane</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> under the string is hollowed a little to prevent it from touching. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> is played upon in the same manner as a guitar. It is capable of producing but few notes; the performer, however, makes it speak harmoniously, and generally accompanies it with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>.\n\n\"Their houses are generally built upon the beach; in villages of 15 or 20 houses each; and each house contains a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of 20 persons and upwards. These habitations are raised upon wooden pillars about 10 feet from the ground; they are round, and, having no windows, are like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEE\">bee</a>-hives, covered with thatch. The entry is through a trap door below, where the family mount by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADDER\">ladder</a>, which is drawn up at night. This manner of building is intended to secure the houses from being infested with snakes and rats; and for that purpose the pillars are bound round with a smooth kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>,\"\nleaf, which prevents animals from being able to mount; besides which, each pillar has a broad round flat piece of wood near the top of it, the projecting of which effectually prevents the further progress of such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMIN\">vermin</a> as may have passed the leaf. The flooring is made with thin strips of bamboos, laid at such distances from one another as to leave free admittance for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; and the inside is neatly finished and decorated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> lances, nets, &c.\n\n\"The art of making cloth of any kind is quite unknown to the inhabitants of this island; what they have is got from the ships that come to trade in coconuts.\n\n\"They purchase a much larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of cloth than is consumed upon their own island. This is intended for the Choury market. Choury is a small island to the southward of theirs, to which a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> of their boats sails every year about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of November, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> cloth for canoes; for they cannot make these themselves. This voyage they perform by the help of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> and stars, for they know nothing of the compass.\n\n\"In their disposition there are two remarkable qualities. One is their entire neglect of compliment and ceremony; and the other, their aversion to dishonesty. A Caribocobarian travelling to a distant village, upon business or amusement, passes through many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> in his way without speaking to any one; if he is hungry or tired, he goes into the nearest house, and helps himself to what he wants, and sits till he is fed, without taking the smallest notice of any of the family unless he has business or news to communicate. Theft or robbery is so very rare amongst them, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> going out of his house never takes away his ladder or shuts his door, but leaves it open for any body to enter that pleases without the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of having anything stolen from him.\n\n\"Their intercourse with strangers is so frequent, that they have acquired in general the barbarous Portuguese so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>; their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> quite different from most others, their words being pronounced with a kind of stop, or catch in the throat, at every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYLLABLE\">syllable</a>.\n\n\"They have no notion of a God, but they believe firmly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a>, and worship him from fear. In every village there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> pole erected with long strings of ground rattans hanging from it, which, it is said, has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> to keep him at a distance. When they see any signs of an approaching storm, they imagine that the devil intends them a visit, upon which many superstitious ceremonies are performed. The people of every village <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> round their own boundaries, and fix up at different distances small sticks split at the top, into which split they put a piece of cocoa-nut, a whip of tobacco, and the leaf of a certain plant; whether this is meant as a peace offering to the devil or a scarecrow to frighten him away, does not appear.\n\n\"When a man dies, all his live stock, cloth, hatchets, fishing lances, and in short every moveable thing he possessed, is buried with him, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> is mourned by the whole village. In one view this is an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, seeing it prevents all disputes about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the deceased amongst his relations. His wife must conform to custom by having a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> cut off from one of her fingers; and if she refuses this, she must submit to have a deep notch cut in one of the pillars of her house.\n\n\"I was once present at the funeral of an old woman. When we went into the house which had belonged to the deceased, we found it full of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> relations; some of them were employed in wrapping up the corpse in leaves and cloth, and others tearing to pieces all the cloth which had belonged to her. In another house hard by, the men of the village with a great many others from the neighbouring towns, were fitting drinking jars and smoking tobacco. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time two stout young fellows were busy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> near the house. When the women had done with the corpse, they set up a most hideous howl, upon which the people began to assemble round the grave, and four men went up into the house to bring down the body; in doing this they were much interrupted by a young man, son to the deceased, who endeavoured with all his might to prevent them; but finding it in vain, he clung round the body, and was carried to the grave along with it; there, after a violent struggle, he was turned away and conducted back to the house. The corpse being now put into the grave, and the lashings which bound the legs and arms cut, all the live stock which had been the property of the deceased, consisting of about half a dozen hogs, and as many fowls, was killed, and hung in above it; a man then approached with a bunch of leaves stuck upon the end of a pole, which he swept two or three times gently along the corpse, and then the grave was filled up. During the ceremony, the women <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to make the most horrible vocal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> imaginable: the men said nothing. A few days afterwards, a kind of monument was erected over the grave, with a pole upon it, to which long strips of cloth of different colours were hung.\n\n\"Polygamy is not known among them; and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADULTERY\">adultery</a> is not less severe than effectual. They cut, from the man's offending member, a piece of the foreskin proportioned to the frequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> or enormity of the crime.\n\n\"There seems to subsist among them a perfect equality. A few persons, from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, have a little more respect paid to them; but there is no appearance of authority one over another. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> seems bound rather by mutual obligations continually conferred and received; the simplest and best of all ties.\"\n\nIt is our wish to take all opportunities of laying before our readers every authentic fact which can throw light upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> mind. In this narrative of Mr Hamilton's respecting the natives of Caribocobar, there is however one circumstance at which we stumble. It is known to the learned, that the philosophers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> and Rome, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGI\">magi</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, admitted two self-existent beings, a good and an evil (see Polytheism); but we never before read of any people who had no notion of a God, and yet firmly believed in the devil. We could give instances of men worshipping the evil principle from fear, and neglecting the worship of the benevolent principle from a persuasion that he would do them all the good in his power without being bribed by sacrifices.\nNicodemus, critics and oblations; but this is the only instance of which we have ever heard, of a people, under the influence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, who had no notion of a God! As good as is least as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> in the world as evil, it appears to us so very unnatural to admit an evil and deny a good principle, that we cannot help thinking that Mr Hamilton, from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of the language of Carnicobar, (which he acknowledges to be different from most others), has not a perfect acquaintance with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> creed of the natives: and that they believe in a good as well as in an evil principle, though they worship only the latter, from a persuasion, that to adore the former could be of no advantage either to him or to themselves.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NANCOWRY\">Nancowry</a> or Soury, and Comerty, two other of the Nicobar islands, are said to be the best peopled, containing not less than 800 inhabitants. Between these islands there is a safe and spacious harbour. On the north point of Nancowry, within the harbour, the Danes have long retained a fixed settlement, protected by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERGEANT\">sergeant</a> and a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> and slaves.","sp":9,"ep":11},{"h":"NICODEMUS","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ, a Jew by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, and by feet a Pharisee (John iii. 1. &c.) The Scripture calls him a ruler of the Jews, and our Saviour gives him the name of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of Israel. When our Saviour began to manifest himself by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, at the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSOVER\">passover</a> that he celebrated there after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a>, Nicodemus made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> doubt but that he was the Messiah, and came to him by night, that he might learn of him the way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a>. Jesus told him, that no one could see the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> except he should be born again. Nicodemus taking this in the literal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, made answer, \"How can a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> that is old be born again?\" Can he enter the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> into his mother's womb?\" To which Jesus replied, \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> a man be not born of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit.\" Nicodemus asks him, \"How can these things be?\" Jesus answered, \"Are you a master of Israel, and are you ignorant of these things? We tell you what we know, and you receive not our testimony. If you believe not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> things, and which may be called earthly, how <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> you believe me if I speak to you of heavenly things? Nobody has ascended into heaven but the Son of God, who came <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> from thence. And <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as Moses lifted up the brazen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENT\">serpent</a> in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>. For God so loved the world that he has given his only Son, so that no man who believes in him shall perish, but shall have eternal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>.\"\n\nAfter this conversation Nicodemus became a disciple of Jesus Christ; and there is no doubt to be made, but he came to hear him as often as our Saviour came to Jerusalem. It happened on a time, that the priests and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARISEES\">Pharisees</a> had sent officers to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> Jesus (John vii. 45. &c.), who returning to them, made their report, that never man spoke as he did; to which the Pharisees replied, \"Are you also of his disciples? Is there any one of the elders <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Pharisees that have believed in him?\" Then Nicodemus thought himself obliged to make answer, saying, \"Does the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> permit us to condemn any one before he is heard?\" To which they replied, \"Are you also a Galilean? Read the Scriptures, and you will find that never any prophet came out of Galilee.\" After this the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> was dismissed. At last Nicodemus declared himself openly a disciple of Jesus Christ (John xix. 39, 40.), when he came with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> of Arimathea to pay the last duties to the body of Christ, which they took down from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>, embalmed, and laid in a sepulchre.\n\nWe are told, that Nicodemus received baptism from the disciples of Christ; but it is not mentioned whether before or after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>. It is added, that the Jews being informed of this, deposed him from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of senator, excommunicated him, and drove him from Jerusalem; but that Gamaliel, who was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a>-german, took him to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, and maintained him there till his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, when he had him buried honourably near St Stephen. There is still extant an apocryphal gospel under the name of Nicodemus, which in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a> bears the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of the Acts of Pilate.","sp":11,"ep":11},{"h":"NICOLAITANS","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, Christian heretics, who assumed this name from Nicholas of Antioch; who, being a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENTILE\">Gentile</a> by birth, first embraced Judaism and then Christianity; when his zeal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a> recommended him to the church of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, by whom he was chosen one of the first deacons.

He had two wives, and by one of them he was persuaded to leave his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> to her son, in preference to his elder brothers; but when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> how he died is not certainly known.\n\nNicomedes II., the grandson of the former, began his reign like him, by sacrificing his brothers to his jealousy, after having waded to the throne in the blood of Prusias his father. He assumed the name of Epiphanes, or \"the Illustrious,\" though he performed nothing worthy of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>, or even of notice, during the whole time of his long reign. He was succeeded by his son\u2014\n\nNicomedes III., named by antiphrasis, Philopater, because he had murdered his father to get possession of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>. This monarch having entered into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MITHRIDATES\">Mithridates</a> the Great king of Pontus, invaded Paphlagonia; and having seized on that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, he attempted likewise to make himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of Cappadocia. This country, however, was at that time subject to his powerful ally; who thereupon marching into Bithynia at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, drove Nicomedes from the throne, and raised his brother <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a> to it in his room. The dethroned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> had recourse to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, who expelled the usurper, and restored him to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> dominions. For this favour they preferred him, and at length prevailed upon him, contrary to his own inclination, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of his friends, to make incursions into the territories of Mithridates, with whom Rome wanted a subject of dispute. The king of Pontus bore for some time the devastations committed by Nicomedes with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>, that he might not seem to be the aggressor; but at last he routed his army on the banks of the Amnus, drove him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time from his dominions, and obliged him to seek for shelter in Paphlagonia, where he led a private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> till the time of Sylla, who replaced him on the throne. He was succeeded by his son\u2014\n\nNicomedes IV., who performed nothing which the many writers who flourished in his time have thought worth transmitting to posterity. As he died without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a>, he left his kingdom by his last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> to the Romans, who reduced it to the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>.

He received at the baptismal font the name of Nikita, which afterwards, when he became monk, he changed to Nicon, the appellation by which he is more generally known. He was educated in the convent of St Macarius, under the care of a monk. From the course of his studies, which were almost solely directed to the Holy Scriptures, and the exhortations of his preceptor, he imbibed at a very early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> the strongest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to a monastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; and was only prevented from following the bent of his mind by the persuasions and authority of his father. In conformity, however, to the wishes of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, though contrary to his own inclination, he entered into matrimony; and, as that state precluded him from being admitted into a convent, he was ordained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>. With his wife he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> ten years, partly in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> and partly at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSCOW\">Moscow</a>, officiating as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> priest. The loss of three children, however, gave him a total disgust to the world; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which, his wife was persuaded to take the veil, and he became a monk; his retreat was in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">White</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> establishment was formed, as remarkable for the austerities of its rules as the situation was in its solitude. There were about 12 monks, but they all lived in different cells. Such a system, combined with the most gloomy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, occasioned so much cloistered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> as tarnished his character, when he was afterwards called up to fulfil the duties of a public and exalted station. Our limits do not permit us to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> in our account of his life, we must therefore be contented with barely reciting general facts. Within less than the space of five years, Nicon was successively\nsuccessively created archimandrite, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABBOT\">abbot</a> of the Novofpatkoi convent, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of Novogorod, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a> of Ruffia. That he was worthy of these rapid promotions, few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> doubt who are acquainted with his character; for he was possessed of very extraordinary qualities, such as even his enemies allow and admire. His courage was undaunted, his morals irreproachable, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> extensive and exalted, his learning deep and comprehensive, and his eloquence commanding. When archbishop, he obtained the respect of the inhabitants by his unwearied affability in the discharge of his trust; and conciliated their affections by acts of unbounded charity: Nor was he less conspicuous in the discharge of the office of patriarch, to which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> he was appointed in 1652, in the 39th year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>.\n\nNor was he only distinguished in his own profession, for he shone even as a statesman. At length, however, he fell a victim to popular discontents; which misfortune, though he was far from deserving it, was certainly the effect of imprudence. He abdicated the office of patriarch, which would otherwise have been taken from him, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1658, and bore his reverse of fortune with heroic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a>: he returned to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CELL\">cell</a>, and commenced his former austeritys. His innocence, however, could not protect him from further malice: his enemies obtained him to be formally deposed in 1666. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a> was followed by imprisonment, which was for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> very rigorous, because he, conscious of his own innocence, refused to accept <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> for crimes of which he was not guilty. In 1676, however, he was removed to the convent of St Cyril, and enjoyed perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>.\n\nNicon survived his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> 15 years. In 1681, he requested and obtained permission to return to the convent of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, that he might end his days in that favourite spot; but he expired upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> near Yaroslav, in the 66th year of his age.

This was first discovered in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> by the Spaniards about the year 1560, and by them imported into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. It had been used by the inhabitants of America <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before; and was called by those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> yoli, and petun by the inhabitants of the continent. It was sent into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> from Tabaco, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-YUCATAN\">Yucatan</a>, where it was first discovered, and from whence it takes its common name. Sir Walter Raleigh is generally said to have been the first that introduced it into England about the year 1585, and who taught his countrymen how to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> it. Dr Cotton Mather, however, (in his Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">Philosopher</a>) says, that in the above year one Mr Lane carried over some of it from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a>, which was the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> it had ever been seen in Europe. Tobacco is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> used among the oriental nations, though it is uncertain by whom it was introduced among them. Considerable quantities of it are cultivated in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVANT\">Levant</a>, on the coasts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> and the Archipelago, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MALTA\">Malta</a>.\n\nThere are two varieties of that species of nicotiana which is cultivated for common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, and which are distinguished by the names of Oronokoe, and sweet-scented tobacco. They differ from each other only in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of their leaves; those of the former being longer and narrower than the latter. They are tall herbaceous plants, growing erect with fine foliage, and rising with a strong stem from six to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>. The stalk near the root, is upward of an inch diameter, and surrounded with a kind of hairy or velvet clammy substance, of a yellowish green <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. The leaves are rather of a deeper green, and grow alternately at the distance of two or three inches from each other. They are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a>, of a spear-shaped oval, and simple; the largest about 25 inches long, but decreasing in size as they ascend, till they come to be only 10 inches long, and about half as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the leaves is much corrugated, like those of spinach when fully ripe. Before they come to maturity, when they are about five or six inches long, the leaves are generally of a full green, and rather smooth; but as they increase in size, they become rougher, and acquire a yellowish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>. The stem and branches are terminated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> bunches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> collected into clusters, of a delicate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>; the edges, when full blown, inclining to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> purple. They continue in succession till the end of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>; when they are succeeded by seeds of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> colour, and kidney-shaped. These are very small, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPSULE\">capsule</a> containing about 1000; and the whole produce of a single plant is reckoned at about 35000. The seeds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIPEN\">ripen</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of September.\n\nMr Carver informs us, that the Oronokoe, or, as it is called, the long Virginian tobacco, is the kind best suited for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the rigour of a northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, the strength as well as the scent of the leaves being greater than that of the other. The sweet-scented sort flourishes most in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, and in a warm climate,\nNicotiana where it greatly exceeds the former in the celerity of its growth; and is likewise, as its name intimates, much more mild and pleasant.\n\nCulture.\u2014Tobacco thrives best in a warm, kindly, rich soil, that is not subject to be overrun by weeds. In Virginia, the soil in which it thrives best is warm, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, and inclining to be sandy; and therefore, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the plant is to be cultivated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, it ought to be planted in a soil as nearly of the same kind as possible. Other kinds of soil might probably be brought to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> it, by a mixture of proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a>; but we must remember, that whatever manure is made use of, must be thoroughly incorporated with the soil. The best situation for a tobacco plantation is the southern declivity of a hill, rather gradual than abrupt, or a spot that is sheltered from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> winds: but at the same time it is necessary that the plants enjoy a free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; for without that they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not prosper.\n\nAs tobacco is an annual plant, those who intend to cultivate it ought to be as careful as possible in the choice of the seeds; in which, however, with all their care, they may be sometimes deceived. The seeds are to be sown about the middle of April, or rather sooner in a forward season, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> prepared for this purpose of such soil as has been already described, mixed with some warm rich manure. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, hot beds are most eligible for this purpose, and gardeners imagine that they are always necessary: but Mr Carver tells us, that he is convinced, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> is not very severe, the tobacco seeds may be raised without doors; and for this purpose gives us the following directions.\n\n\"Having sown the seed in the manner above directed, on the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROST\">frost</a> after the plants appear, it will be necessary to spread mats over the beds, a little elevated from the ground by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a> laid across, that they may not be crushed. These, however, must be removed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, soon after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> appears, that they may receive as much benefit as possible from its warmth and from the air. In this manner proceed till the leaves have attained about two inches in length and one in breadth; which they will do in about a month after they are sown, or near the middle of May, when the frosts are usually at an end. One invariable rule for their being able to bear removal is, when the fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> is sprouted, and the fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> appears. Then take the opportunity of the first rains or gentle showers to transplant them into such a soil and situation as before described; which must be done in the following manner.\u2014The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> must be ploughed, or dug up with spades, and made as mellow and light as possible. When the plants are to be placed, raise with the hot small hillocks at the distance of two feet or a little more from each other, taking care that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> hard spots or lumps are in it; and then just indent the middle of each, without drilling holes, as for some other plants.\n\n\"When your ground is thus prepared, dig in a gentle manner from their native bed such plants as have attained the proper growth for transplanting above-mentioned; and drop, as you <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>, one on every hillock. Insert a plant gently into each centre, pressing the soil around gently with your fingers; and taking the greatest care, during the operation, that you do not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> off any of the leaves, which are at this time exquisitely tender. If the weather proves dry Nicotiana, after they are thus transplanted, they must be watered with soft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, in the same manner as is usually done to coleworts, or plants of a similar kind. But though you now seem to have a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of plants for the space you intend to cultivate, it is yet necessary that you continue to attend to your bed of seedlings, that you may have enough to supply any deficiencies which through accident may arise. From this time great care must be taken to keep the ground soft and free from weeds, by often stirring with your hoe the mould round the roots; and to prune off the dead leaves that sometimes are found near the bottom of the stalks.\n\n\"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of this climate from that in which I have been accustomed to observe the progress of this plant, will not permit me to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> with certainty the time which is most proper to take off the top of it, to prevent it from running to seed. This knowledge can only be acquired by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>. When it has risen to the height of more than two feet, it commonly begins to put forth the branches on which the flowers and seeds are produced; but as this expansion, if suffered to take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, would drain the nutriment from the leaves, which are the most valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>, and thereby lessen their size and efficacy, it becomes needful at this stage to nip off the extremity of the stalk to prevent its growing higher. In some other climates, the top is commonly cut off when the plant has fifteen leaves; but if the tobacco is intended to be a little stronger than usual, this is done when it has only thirteen; and sometimes, when it is designed to be remarkably powerful, eleven or twelve are only allowed to expand. On the contrary, if the planter is desirous of having his crop very mild, he suffers it to put forth eighteen or twenty: but in this calculation, the three or four lower leaves next the ground, which do not grow so large and fine as the others, are not to be reckoned.\n\n\"This operation, denominated topping the tobacco, is much better performed by the finger and thumb than with any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>; because the grasp of the fingers closes the pores of the plant; whereas, when it is done by instruments, the juices are in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> exhausted. Care must also be taken to nip off the sprouts that will be continually springing up at the junction of the leaves with the stalks. This is termed succouring, or suckering, the tobacco; and ought to be repeated as often as occasion requires.\n\n\"As it is impossible to ascertain the due time for topping the plant, so it is equally impossible, without experiment, to ascertain the time it will take to ripen in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> signs of its maturity are these: The leaves, as they approach a state of ripeness, become more corrugated or rough; and when fully ripe, appear mottled with yellowish spots on the raised parts; whilst the cavities retain their usual green colour. They are at this time also thicker than they have been before; and are covered with a downy velvet, like that formerly mentioned, on the stalks. If heavy rains happen at this critical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, they will wash off this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCREMENT\">excrement</a> substance, and thereby damage the plants. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, if the frothy nights are not begun, it is proper to let them stand a few days longer; when, if the weather be moderate, they will recover this substance again. But if a frost unexpectedly happens during\nNicotiana. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> the night, they must be carefully examined in the morning, before the sun has any influence upon them; and those which are found to be covered with frothy particles, whether thoroughly ripe or not, must be cut up; for though they may not all appear to be arrived at a state of maturity, yet they cannot be far from it, and will differ but little in goodness from those that are perfectly so.\n\nTobacco is subject to be destroyed by a worm; and without proper care to exterminate this enemy, a whole field of plants may soon be lost. This animal is of the horned species, and appears to be peculiar to the tobacco plant; so that in many parts of America it is distinguished by the name of the tobacco worm. In what manner it is first produced, or how propagated, is unknown; but it is not discernible till the plants have attained about half their height; and then appears to be nearly as large as a gnat. Soon after this it lengthens into a worm; and by degrees increases in magnitude to the bigness of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>'s finger. In shape it is regular from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> to its tail, without any diminution at either extremity. It is indented or ribbed round at equal distances, nearly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an inch from each other; and having at every one of these divisions a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of feet or claws, by which it fastens itself to the plant. Its mouth, like that of the caterpillar, is placed under the fore part of the head. On the top of the head, between the eyes, grows a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">horn</a> about half an inch long, and greatly resembling a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THORN\">thorn</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> part of which is of a brown colour, a firm texture, and the extremity sharp pointed. It is easily crushed; being only, to appearance, a collection of green juice enclosed in a membranaceous covering, without the internal parts of an animated being. The colour of its skin is in general green, intermixed with several spots of a yellowish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>; and the whole covered with a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> scarcely be discerned. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a> are found the most predominant during the latter end of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> and the beginning of August; at which time the plants must be particularly attended to, and every leaf carefully searched. As soon as a wound is discovered, and it will not be long before it is perceptible, care must be taken to destroy the cause of it, which will be found near it, and from its unsubstantial texture may easily be crushed; but the best method is to pull it away by the horn, and then crush it.\n\nWhen the tobacco is fit for being gathered, as will appear from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the foregoing directions, on the first morning that promises a fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, before the sun is risen, take an axe or a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, and holding the stalk near the top with one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, fever it from its root with the other, as low as possible. Lay it gently on the ground, taking care not to break off the leaves, and there let it remain exposed to the rays of the sun throughout the day, or until the leaves, according to the American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, are entirely wilted: that is, till they become limber, and will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> any way without breaking. But if the weather should prove rainy without any intervals of sunshine, and the plants appear to be fully ripe, they must be housed immediately. This must be done, however, with great care, that the leaves, which are in this state very brittle, may not be broken. They are next to be placed under proper shelter, either in a barn or covered hovel, where they cannot be affected by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> or too much air, thinly scattered on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>; and if the sun does not appear for several days, they must be left to wilt in that manner; but in this case the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the tobacco will not be quite so good.\n\nWhen the leaves have acquired the above-mentioned flexibility, the plants must be laid in heaps, or rather in one heap if the quantity is not too great, and in about 24 hours they will be found to sweat. But during this time, when they have lain for a little while, and begin to ferment, it will be necessary to turn them; bringing those which are in the middle to the surface, and placing those which are at the surface in the middle. The longer they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in this situation, the darker coloured is the tobacco; and this is termed sweating the tobacco. After they have lain in this manner for three or four days, (for a longer continuance might make the plants turn mouldy), they may be fastened together in pairs with cords or wooden pegs, near the bottom of the stalk, and hung across a pole, with the leaves suspended in the same covered place, a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> being left between each pair. In about a month the leaves will be thoroughly dried, and of a proper temperature to be taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>. This state may be ascertained by their appearing of the same colour with those imported from America. But this can be done only in wet weather.\u2014The tobacco is exceedingly apt to attract the humidity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, which gives it a pliability that is absolutely necessary for its preservation; for if the plants are removed in a very dry season, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> parts of the leaves will crumble into dust, and a considerable waste will ensue.\n\nCure. As soon as the plants are taken down, they must again be laid in a heap, and pressed with heavy logs of wood for about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>; but this climate may possibly require a longer time. While they remain in this state, it will be necessary to introduce your hand frequently into the heap, to discover whether the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> be not too intense; for in large quantities this will sometimes be the case, and considerable damage will be occasioned by it. When they are found to heat too much, that is, when the heat exceeds a moderate glowing warmth, part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> by which they are pressed must be taken away; and the cause being removed, the effect will cease. This is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> or last sweating; and, when completed, which it generally will be about the time just mentioned, the leaves must be stripped from the stalks for use. Many omit this last sweating; but Mr Carver thinks that it takes away any remaining harshness, and renders the tobacco more mellow. The strength of the stalk also is diffused by it through the leaves, and the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> becomes equally meliorated.\u2014When the leaves are stripped from the stalks, they are to be tied up in bunches or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, and kept in a cellar or other damp place; though if not handled in dry weather but only during a rainy season, it is of little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> in what part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> or barn they are laid up. At this period the tobacco is thoroughly cured, and as proper for manufacturing as that imported from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>.\n\nOur author advises the tobacco planter, in his first trials, not to be too avaricious, but to top his plants before they have gained their utmost height: leaving only about the middle quantity of leaves directed before to give it a tolerable degree of strength. For though\nNicotiana this, if excessive, might be abated during the cure by an increase of sweating, or be remedied the next season by suffering more leaves to grow; it can never be added; and, without a certain degree of strength, the tobacco will always be tasteless and of little value. On the contrary, though it be ever so much weakened by sweating, and thereby rendered mild, yet it will never lose the aromatic flavour, which accompanied that strength, and which greatly adds to its value. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> yard of land, he tells us, will rear about 500 plants, and allow proper space for their nurture till they are fit for transplanting.\n\nThe following extract, which is copied from a manuscript of Dr Barham (A), for directing the raising, cultivating, and curing tobacco in Jamaica, is perhaps worthy of the attention of those who wish to be further acquainted with this subject.\n\n\"Let the ground or woodland wherein you intend <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANTING\">planting</a> tobacco be well burned, as the greater the quantity of wood ashes the better. The spot you intend raising your plants on must be well freed with ashes, laid smooth and light: then blow the feed from the palm of your hand gently on the bed, and cover it over with palm or plantain leaves.\n\n\"When your plants are about four inches high, draw them and plant them out about three feet under; and when they become as high as your knee; cut or pluck off the top; and if there are more than 12 leaves on the plant, take off the overplus, and leave the rest entire.\n\n\"The plant should now be daily attended to, in order to destroy the caterpillars that are liable to infest it; as also to take off every sprout or sucker that puts out at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>, in order to throw the whole vegetable nourishment into the large leaves.\n\n\"When the edges and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of the leaves begin to turn a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>, cut down the stalks about ten o'clock in the morning, taking the opportunity of a fine day, and be careful the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEW\">dew</a> is fully off the plant, and do not continue this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> after two in the afternoon. As fast as it is cut let it be carried into your tobacco house, which must be so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> as to shut out all air, (on this much depends), and hung up on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> tied across, for the purpose of drying.\n\n\"When the stalks begin to turn brownish, take them off the lines, and put them in a large bin, and lay on them heavy weights for 12 days; then take them out, and strip off the leaves, and put them again into the bin, and let them be well pressed, and so as no air gains admission for a month. Take them out; tie them in bundles about 60 leaves in each, which are called monocoes; and are ready for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>. But observe to let them always be kept close till you have occasion to dispose of them.\n\n\"Let your curing house be well built, and very close and warm; if a boarded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, it will not be amiss, in a wet situation, to cover the whole outside with thatch and plantain straw, to keep off the damps; for by this care you preserve the fine volatile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> in the leaves. Observe, no smoke is to be made use of or admitted into your curing house.\"\n\nFor an account of the medical effects of tobacco. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MATERIA_MEDICA\">Materia Medica</a> Index.\n\nThe most common uses of this plant, are either as a stimulantary when taken by way of snuff, as a masticatory by chewing it in the mouth, or as effluvia by smoking it; and when taken in moderation, it is not an unhealthful amusement. Before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> were invented, it was usually smoked in segars, and they are still in use among some of the southern nations. The method of preparing these is at once simple and expeditious. A leaf of tobacco being formed into a small twisted roll, somewhat larger than the item of a pipe, and about eight inches long, the smoke is conveyed through the winding folds which prevent it from expanding, as through a tube; so that one end of it being lighted, and the other applied to the mouth, it is in this form used without much inconvenience. But, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time, pipes being invented, they were found more commodious vehicles for the smoke, and are now in general use.\n\nAmong all the productions of foreign climes introduced into these kingdoms, scarce any has been held in higher estimation by persons of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> than tobacco. In the countries of which it is a native, it is considered by the Indians as the most valuable offering that can be made to the beings they worship. They use it in all their civil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> ceremonies. When once the spiral wreaths of its smoke ascend from the feathered pipe of peace, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> that has been just made is considered as sacred and inviolable. Likewise, when they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> their great Father, or his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">guardian</a> spirits, residing, as they believe, in every extraordinary production of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, they make liberal offerings to them of this valuable plant, not doubting but that they are thus secured of protection.\n\nTobacco is made up into rolls by the inhabitants of the interior parts of America, by means of a machine called a tobacco wheel. With this machine they spin the leaves after they are cured, into a twist of any size they think fit; and having folded it into rolls of about 20 pounds each, they lay it by for use. In this state it will keep for several years, and be continually improving, as it always grows milder. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ILLINOIS\">Illinois</a> usually form it into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARROTS\">carrots</a>; which is done by laying a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of leaves, when cured, on each other after the ribs have been taken out, and rolling them round with pack-thread, till they become cemented together. These rolls commonly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> about 18 or 20 inches in length, and nine round in the middle part.\n\nTobacco forms a very considerable article in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>; for an account of which see the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> Glasgow and Virginia.\n\nNictitating Membrane, a thin membrane chiefly found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> and fish kind, which covers the eyes of these animals, sheltering them from the dust or too much light; yet is so thin and pellucid, that they can see pretty well through it.\n\n(A) This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> with Sir Hans Sloane.

The angler will be alarmed by the noise which the fish makes in rising, and must give him line, and time to swallow the hook; then a flight touch secures him. The best and largest trouts are found to bite thus in the night; and they rise mostly in the still and clear deeps, not in the swift and shallow currents. Sometimes, though there are fish about the place, they will not rise at the bait: in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the angler must put on some lead to his line, and sink it to the bottom.\n\nNight Mare, or Incubus.

It is said, that a large glass of warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a>, taken as soon as possible after eating the berries, will prevent their bad effects.\n\nNight Watching, a practice of very remote antiquity, which belongs to the oldest regulations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a>. So early as the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a> we find mention made of watching it, and likewise in the Psalms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>. Sentinels were stationed in different places in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a> and other cities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, and they were kept to their duty by the vigilance of the Thesmophore. There were also vet. i. Palaestra nocturni in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Rome, as appears from the commentaries of Heubach on the police of the Romans. It appears, however, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of these institutions was rather the prevention of fires, than the guarding against alarms or dangers by night, although <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> was likewise paid to these in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> of fires was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> of Augustus, when he wished to strengthen the night-watch for suppressing nocturnal commotions.\n\nIt does not appear that calling out the hours became an established practice before the erection of city gates, and probably had its rise in Germany; yet it would have been attended with advantages in ancient Rome, where there were no public clocks, nor anything in private houses to indicate the hours. The periods for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> to mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> were determined by water-clocks; at the end of each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> they blew a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>, and by means of this signal each individual might ascertain the hour of the night. It seems evident, however, that these regulations were only attended to in time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>.\n\nIn the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NIGHT_WATCHING\">night-watching</a> was established, as at Rome, in the very commencement of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>; and De la Mare quotes the ordinances of Clothaire II. upon this subject, in the year 595. The citizens at first kept watch in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a>; but this practice was afterwards set aside, and, by the payment of a certain sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, a permanent watch was established. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of the learned and indefatigable Beckmann, the establishment of single watchmen, to call out the hours through the streets, is peculiar to Germany, and only copied by surrounding nations in more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELECTOR\">elector</a>, John George, in 1588, appointed watchmen at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>; and Mabillon describes it as a practice peculiar to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. Horns are made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of by watchmen in some places, and rattles in others, the former being most proper for villages, and the latter for cities.\n\nThe Chinese, so early as the ninth century, had watchmen posted on their towers, who announced the hours both by day and night, by striking forcibly on a suspended board, which in that country is said to be in use to the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>; and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETERBURGH\">Peterburgh</a>, in Russia, the watchmen employ a suspended plate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> for a similar purpose. In this manner also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> are assembled together in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVANT\">Levant</a>, for the purpose of attending divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>; and monks were thus awakened in monasteries at the most early periods, to attend to the proper hours of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a>.\n\nWe find mention made of firepole-watchmen in Germany in the 14th century. In the year 1563, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>-tower was erected in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEIPZIG\">Leipzig</a>, and an apartment built in it for a permanent watchman, who was obliged to proclaim the hours every time the clock struck. Permanent watchmen were kept in many of the steeples at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ULM\">Ulm</a> in the 15th century. The same thing was practised at Frankfort on the Main, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OETTINGEN\">Oettingen</a>, and many other places; and Montaigne was astonished at finding a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> on the steeple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTANCE\">Constance</a>, who kept watch.","sp":17,"ep":18},{"h":"NIGIDUS FIGULUS","t":"PUBLIUS, one of the most learned men of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Rome, flourished at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> with Cicero.

This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a> has been solved by James Bruce, Esq. of Kinmaird, in Scotland; who spent several years at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABYSSINIA\">Abyssinia</a>, and by the favour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> and great people of the country was enabled to accomplish the arduous task.\n\nIn the account of his travels, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> has been at particular pains to show, that none of those who undertook this task ever succeeded in it but himself. The inquiry concerning its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>, he says, began either before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>, and is by some supposed to be the origin of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIEROGLYPHICS\">hieroglyphics</a>. Though Egypt was the country which received the greatest benefit from this river, it was not there that the inquiries concerning its inundation began: it being probable that everything relative to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> and periodical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of that inundation would be accurately settled (which could not be done but by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of observations) before any person would venture to build houses within its reach.\n\nThe philosophers of Meroe, in our author's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, were the first who undertook to make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of observations sufficient to determine these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>; their country being so situated, that they could perceive everything relative to the increase or decrease of the river without any danger from its overflowing. Being much addicted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, it could not long escape them, that the heliacal rising of the dog-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a> was a signal for Egypt to prepare for the inundation; without which it was vain to expect any crop. The connection of this celestial sign with the annual rising of the river would undoubtedly soon become a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of curiosity; and as this could not easily be discovered, it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> for an ignorant and superstitious people to ascribe the whole to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the dog-star as a deity. Still, however, by those who were more enlightened, the phenomenon would be ascribed to natural causes; and a great step towards the discovery of these, undoubtedly was that of the sources of the river itself. In the early ages, when travelling into foreign countries was impracticable by private persons, the inquiry into the sources of the Nile became an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> to the greatest monarchs. Scopelis is said to have preferred the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of discovering them almost to all the victories he obtained. Alexander the Great is well known to have had a great curiosity to discover these fountains. On his arrival at the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMON\">Ammon</a>, he is said to have made inquiry concerning the fountains of the Nile, even before he asked about his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> from Jupiter. The priests are said to have given him proper directions for finding them; and Alexander took the most ready means of accomplishing his purpose, by employing natives of Ethiopia to make the search. These discoverers, in the opinion of Mr Bruce, missed their aim, by reason of the turn which the Nile takes to the east in the latitude of 9\u00b0 where it begins to surround the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of Gojam; but which they might imagine to be only a winding of the river soon to be compensated by an equal turn to the west. \"They therefore (says he) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> their journey south till near the line, and never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> it more; as they could have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> possible notion it had turned back behind them, and that they had left it as far <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> as latitude 9\u00b0.\" They reported then to Alexander, what was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, that they had ascended the Nile, as far south as latitude 9\u00b0; where it unexpectedly took its course to the east, and was seen no more. The river was not known, nor to be heard of near the line, or farther southward, nor was it diminished in size, nor had it given any symptom that they were near its source; they had found the Nile calentem (warm), while they expected its rise among melting snows.\n\nMr Bruce is of opinion that this turn of the Nile to the eastward was the occasion of Alexander's extravagant mistake, in supposing that he had discovered the fountains of the Nile when he was near the source of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDUS\">Indus</a>; and which he wrote to his mother, though he afterwards caused it to be erased from his books.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILADELPHUS\">Philadelphus</a> succeeded Alexander in his attempt to discover the source of the Nile; but he likewise proving unsuccessful, the task was next undertaken by Ptolemy Euergetes, the most powerful of the Greek princes who sat on the throne of Egypt. \"In this (says Mr Bruce) he had probably succeeded, had he not mistaken the river itself. He supposed the Siris, now the Tacazz\u00e9, to be the Nile; and ascending in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of its stream, he came to Axum, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of Sire and of Ethiopia. But the story he tells of the snow which he found knee-deep on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> of Samen, makes me question whether he ever crossed the Siris, or was himself an ocular witness of what he says he observed there.\"\n\nCaesar had the same curiosity with other conquerors to visit the springs of the Nile, though his situation did not allow him to make any attempt for that purpose. Nero, however, was more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>. He sent two centuries into Ethiopia, with orders to explore the unknown fountains of this river; but they returned without having accomplished their errand. They reported, that after having gone a long way, they came to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Ethiopia, who furnished them with necessaries, and recommendations to some other kingdoms adjacent; passing which, they came to immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, of which nobody knew the end, nor could they ever hope to find it. Their story, however, is by Mr Bruce supposed to be a fiction;\nNo other attempt was made by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> to discover the sources of this celebrated river; and the matter was looked upon to be an impossibility, insomuch that caput Nili quereere became a proverb, denoting the impossibility of any undertaking. The first who, in more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> ages, made any attempt of this kind, was a monk sent into Abyssinia in the year 522, by Nomofus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> from the emperor Justin. This monk is called Cosmas the Hermit, and likewise Indoplatytes, from his supposed travels into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>. He proceeded as far as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Axum, but did not visit that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the country where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the Nile lies; nor, in Mr Bruce's opinion, would it have been practicable for him to do so. The discovery, however, is said to have been made at last by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> Paez the missionary. But the truth of this account is denied by Mr Bruce, for the following reasons:\n\n1. \"No relation of this kind (says he) was to be found in three copies of Peter Paez's history, to which I had access when in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, on my return home. One of these copies I saw at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a>; and, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of friends, had an opportunity of perusing it at my leisure. The other two were at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a> and Rome. I ran through them rapidly; attending only to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> ought to have been, and where I did not find it: but having copied the first and last page of the Milan manuscript, and comparing them with the two last mentioned, I found that all the three were, word for word, the same, and none of them contained one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYLLABLE\">syllable</a> of the discovery of the source.\"\n\n2. Alphonso Mendez came into Abyssinia about a year after Paez's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. New and desirable as that discovery must have been to himself, to the pope, king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, and all his great patrons in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a> and Italy; though he wrote the history of the country, and of the particulars concerning the mission in great detail and with good judgement, yet he never mentions this journey of Peter Paez, though it probably must have been conveyed to Rome and Portugal after his inspection and under his authority.\n\n3. Balthazar Tellez, a learned Jesuit, has wrote two volumes in folio, with great candour and impartiality, considering the spirit of those times; and he declares his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> to be compiled from those of Alphonso Mendez the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a>, from the two volumes of Peter Paez, as well as from the regular reports made by the individuals of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> in some places, and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> letters in others; to all which he had complete access, as also to the annual reports of Peter Paez, among the rest from 1598 to 1622; yet Tellez makes no mention of such a discovery, though he is very particular as to the merit of each missionary during the long reign of Facilidias, which occupies more than half the two volumes.\"\n\nThe first, and indeed the only account of the fountains of the Nile, published before that of Mr Bruce, was Kircher's; who says that he took it from the writings of Peter Paez. The time when the discovery is said to have been made was the 21st of April 1618; at which season the rains are begun, and therefore very wholesome; so that the Abyssinian armies are not without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> in the field; between September and February at farthest is the time they are abroad from the capital and in action.\n\n\"The river (says Kircher) at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, by the Ethiopians, is called Abay; it rises in the kingdom of Gojam, in a territory called Sabala, whose inhabitants are called Agoua. The source of the Nile is situated in the west part of Gojam, in the highest part of a valley, which resembles a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> on every side surrounded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> mountains. On the 21st of April 1618, being here, together with the king and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, I ascended the place, and observed everything with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>: I discovered first two round fountains each about four palms in diameter, and saw, with the greatest delight, what neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYRUS\">Cyrus</a> the Persian, nor Cambyses, nor Alexander the Great, nor the famous Julius Caesar, could ever discover. The two openings of these fountains have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> in the plain on the top of the mountain, but flow from the root of it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> fountain lies about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> west from the former: the inhabitants say that this whole mountain is full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; and add, that the whole plain about the fountain is floating and unsteady, a certain mark that there is water concealed under it; for which reason the water does not overflow at the fountain, but forces itself with great violence out at the foot of the mountain. The inhabitants together with the emperor, who was then present with his army, maintain, that that year it trembled very little on account of the drought; but in other years, that it trembled and overflowed so that it could scarce be approached without danger. The breadth of the circumference may be about the cast of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLING\">sling</a>: below the top of this mountain the people live about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> distant from the fountain to the west; and this place is called Geeth; and the fountain seems to be about a cannon-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> distant from Geeth; moreover the field where the fountain is, is on all sides difficult of access, except on the north side, where it may be ascended with ease.\"\n\nOn this relation Mr Bruce observes, that there is no such place as Sabala; it ought to have been named Sacala, signifying the highest ridge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, where the water falls equally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> on both sides, from east and west, or from north and south. So the sharp roofs of our houses, where the water runs down equally on the opposite sides, are called by the same name. Other objections are drawn from the situation of places, and from the number and situation of the fountains themselves, every one of which Mr Bruce found by actual menuration to be different from Kircher's account. The following, however, he looks upon to be decisive that Paez never was on the spot. He says, \"the field in which the fountains of the Nile are, is of very difficult access; the ascent to it being very steep, excepting on the north, where it is plain and easy. Now, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we look at the beginning of this description, we should think it would be the descent, not the ascent, that would be troublesome; for the fountains were placed in a valley, and people rather descend into valleys than ascend into them; but supposing it was a valley in which there was a field upon which there was a mountain, and on the mountain these fountains; still, I say, that these mountains are nearly inaccessible on the three sides; but that the most difficult of them all is the north, the way we ascend from the plain of Goutto. From the east, by Sacala, the ascent is made from the valley of Litchambara, and from the plain of Afloa to the south you have the almost perpendicular craggy cliff of Geeth, covered with thorny\nthorny bushes, and bamboos, which cover the mouths of the caverns; and on the north you have the mountains of Aformalha, thick set with all sorts of thorny trees and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>, especially with the kantufia; these thickets are, moreover, filled with wild beasts, especially huge, long-haired baboons, which we frequently met walking upright. Through these high and difficult mountains we have only narrow paths, like those of sheep, made by the goats, or the wild beasts we are speaking of, which, after we had walked on them for a long space, landed us frequently at the edge of some valley or precipice, and forced us to go back again to seek a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>. From towards Zeggan to the westward, and from the plain where the river winds too much, is the only easy access to the fountains of the Nile: and they that ascend to them by this way <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not even think that approach too easy.\"\n\nPeter Heiling, a Protestant of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUBECK\">Lubeck</a>, resided several years in the country of Gojiam, and was even governor of it, but he never made any attempt to discover the source of the Nile; dedicating himself entirely to a frivolous and solitary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. The most extraordinary attempt, however, that ever was made to discover the source of this or any other river, was that of a German nobleman named Peter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> de Roux, comte de Defreval. He had been in the Danish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a> from the year 1721; and, in 1739, was made rear-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a>. That same year he resigned his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>, and began his attempt to discover the source of the Nile in Egypt. To this country he took his wife along with him; and had no sooner reached <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a>, than he quarrelled with a Turkish mob on a point of etiquette; which instantly brought upon them the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JANIZARIES\">janizaries</a> and guards of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a>, to take them into custody. The countess exerted herself in an extraordinary manner; and armed only with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of pistols, put all the janizaries to flight, and even wounded several of them; so that her husband was left at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to pursue his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of discovery. To accomplish this, he provided a barge with small cannon, and furnished with all necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> for himself and his wife, who was still to accompany him. Before he set out, however, it was suggested to him, that supposing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> might protect him so far as to allow his barge to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> the confines of Egypt safely, and to the first cataract; supposing also that she was arrived at Ibrim, or Deir, the last garrisons depending on Cairo; yet still some days journey above the garrisons of Deir and Ibrim began the dreadful deserts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUBIA\">Nubia</a>; and farther south, at the great cataract of Jan Adel, the Nile falls 20 feet down a perpendicular rock\u2014so that here his voyage must undoubtedly end. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a>, however, flattered himself with being able to obtain such assistance from the garrisons of Ibrim and Deir as would enable him to take the vessel to pieces, and to carry it above the cataract, where it could again be launched into the river. To facilitate this scheme he had even entered into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> with some of the barbarians named Kennoufs, who reside near the cataract, and employ themselves in gathering senna, which abounds in their country. These promised to assist him in this extraordinary adventure; but, luckily for the count, he suffered himself at last to be persuaded by some Venetian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> at Cairo not to proceed in person on such a dangerous and unheard-of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>, but rather to depute Mr. Norden, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a>, who was likewise to serve as his draughtsman, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECONNOITRE\">reconnoitre</a> the forts of Ibrim and Deir, as well as the cataract of Jan Adel, and renew his treaty with the Kennoufs. This gentleman accordingly embarked upon one of the vessels <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> on the Nile, but met with a great many difficulties and dangers before he could reach <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYENE\">Syene</a> and the first cataract; after which having with still greater difficulty reached Ibrim, instead of meeting with any encouragement for the count to proceed on his voyage, he was robbed of all he had by the governor of the fort, and narrowly escaped with his life; it having been for some time determined by him and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> that Mr. Norden should be put to death. By these difficulties the count was so much disheartened, that he determined to make no more attempts on the Nubian side. He now resolved to enter Abyssinia by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Mafush. With this view he undertook a voyage round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good Hope, in order to reach the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RED_SEA\"><a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> by the straits of Babelmandel: but having begun to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> his Spanish commission, and taken two English ships, he was met by Commodore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARNET\">Barnet</a>, who made prizes of all the vessels he had with him, and sent home the count himself passenger in a Portuguese ship to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a>.\n\nThus Mr. Bruce considers himself as the first European who reached the sources of this river. He informs us that they are in the country of the Agows, as Kircher had said; so that the latter must either have visited them himself, or have had very good information concerning them. The name of the place through which is the passage to the territory of the Agows, is Abala; a plain or rather valley, generally about half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>, and never exceeding a whole mile, in breadth. The mountains which surround it are at first of an inconsiderable height, covered to the very top with herbage and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-ACACIA\">acacia</a> trees; but as they proceed to the southward they become more rugged and woody.\u2014On the top of these mountains are delightful plains producing excellent pasture. Those to the west join a mountain called Aformalha, where, from a direction nearly southeast, they turn south, and enclose the villages and territory of Sacala, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> at the foot of them; and still lower, that is, more to the westward, is the small village of Geeth, where the fountains of the Nile are situated. Here the mountains are in the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRESCENT\">crescent</a>; and along these the river takes its course. Those which enclose the east side of the plain run <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the former in their whole course, making part of the mountains of Lechtabara, or at least joining with them, and these two, when behind Aformalha, turn to the south, and then to the south-west, taking the same form as they do; only making a greater curve, and enclosing them likewise in the form of a crescent, the extremity of which terminates immediately above a small lake named Gooderoo in the plain of Affoa, below Geeth, and directly at the fountains of the Nile.\n\nHaving passed several considerable streams, all of which empty themselves into the Nile, our traveller found himself at last obliged to ascend a very steep and rugged mountain, where no other path was to be found but a very narrow one made by the sheep or goats, and which in some places was broken, and full of holes; in others, he was obstructed with large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, which seemed to have remained there since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>. The whole was covered with thick wood; and he was everywhere flopped by the kantufia, as well as by several other\nthorny <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> almost as troublesome as that. Having at last, however, reached the top, he had a sight of the Nile immediately below him; but so diminished in size, that it now appeared only a brook scarcely sufficient to turn a mill. The village of Geeth is not within sight of the fountains of the river, though not more than 600 yards distant from them. The country about that place terminates in a cliff of about 300 yards high, which reaches down to the plain of Aifoa, continuing in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of elevation till it meets the Nile again about 17 miles to the southward, after having made the circuit of the provinces of Gojam and Damot. In the middle of this cliff is a vast cave running straight northward, with many bye-paths forming a natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LABYRINTH\">labyrinth</a>, of sufficient bigness to contain the inhabitants of the whole village with their cattle. Into this Mr Bruce advanced about 100 yards; but he did not choose to go farther, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> he carried with him seemed ready to go out; and the people assured him that there was nothing remarkable to be seen at the end. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of this cliff, fronting the south, affords a very picturesque view from the plain of Aifoa below; parts of the houses appearing at every flage through the bushes and thickets of trees. The mouths of the cavern above mentioned, as well as of several others which Mr Bruce did not see, are hid by almost impenetrable fences of the worst kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THORN\">thorn</a>; nor is there any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> between the upper part and the houses but by narrow winding sheep paths, very difficult to be discovered; all of them being allowed to be overgrown, as a part of the natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the people. The edge of the cliff is covered with lofty and high trees, which seem to form a natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FENCE\">fence</a> to prevent people from falling down; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> which the Abyssinian thorns bear, seems to make some amends for their bad qualities.\n\nFrom the edge of the cliff of Geeth, above where the village is situated, the ground slopes with a descent due north, till we come to a triangular marsh upwards of 86 yards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and 286 from the edge of the cliff, and from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> where Bruce resided. On the east, the ground descends with a very gentle slope from the large village of Sacala, which gives its name to the territory, and is about six miles distant from the source, though to appearance not above two. About the middle of this marsh, and not quite 40 yards from the foot of the mountain of Geeth, rises a circular hillock about three feet from the surface of the marsh itself, though founded apparently much deeper in it. The diameter of this hillock is not quite 12 feet, and it is surrounded by a shallow trench which collects the water, and sends it off to the eastward. This is firmly built of sod brought from the sides, and kept constantly in repair by the Agows, who worship the river, and perform their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> ceremonies upon this as an altar. In the midst of it is a circular hole, in the formation or enlargement of which the work of art is evidently discernible. It is always kept clear of grass and aquatic plants, and the water in it is perfectly pure and limpid, but without any ebullition or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> discernible on its surface. The mouth is some parts of an inch less than three feet diameter, and at the time our author first visited it (Nov. 5, 1770), the water stood about two inches from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIM\">brim</a>, nor did it either increase or diminish during all the time of his residence at Geeth. On putting down the shaft of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANCE\">lance</a>, he found a very feeble resistance at six feet four inches, as if from weak rushes and grasses; and, about six inches deeper, he found his lance had entered into soft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, but met with no obstruction from stones or gravel: and the same was confirmed by using a heavy plummet, with a line befouled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>.\n\nThis is the first fountain of the Nile.\n\nThe second fountain is situated at about ten feet distant from the former, a little to the west of south; and is only 11 inches in diameter, but eight feet three inches deep. The third is about 20 feet SSW from the first; the mouth being somewhat more than two feet in diameter, and five feet eight inches in depth. These fountains are made use of as altars, and from the foot of each issues a brisk running rill, which, uniting with the water of the first trench, goes off at the east side in a stream which, our author conjectures, would fill a pipe about two inches diameter. The water of these fountains is extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and good, and intensely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, though exposed to the scorching <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, without any shelter; there being no trees nearer than the cliff of Geeth. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> fountain was found by Mr Bruce to be $36^\\circ 55' 30''$ E. from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a>. The elevation of the ground, according to his account, must be very great, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a> stood only at 22 English inches. \"Neither (says he) did I vary sensibly from that height any of the following days. I stood at Geeth; and thence I inferred, that at the sources of the Nile I was then more than two miles above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the sea; a prodigious height, to enjoy a sky perpetually clear, as also a hot sun never overcast for a moment with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> from rising to setting.\" In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> of Nov. 6, the thermometer stood at $44^\\circ$, at noon $95^\\circ$, and at sunset $46^\\circ$. It was extremely cold at night, and still more so about an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> before sunrise.\n\nThe Nile thus formed by the union of streams from these three fountains, runs eastward through the marsh for about 30 yards, with very little increase of its water, but still distinctly visible, till it is met by the grassy brink of the land descending from Sacala. By this it is turned gradually NE, and then due north; and in the two miles in which it flows in that direction it receives many small streams from springs on each side; so that about this distance from the fountains it becomes a stream capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> a common mill. Our traveller was much taken with the beauty of this spot. \"The small rising hills about us (says he) were all thick covered with verdure, especially with clover the largest and finest I ever saw; the tops of the heights covered with trees of a prodigious size: the stream, at the banks of which we were fitting, was limpid, and pure as the finest crystal; the sod covered thick with a kind of bushy tree, that seemed to affect to grow to no height, but, thick with foliage and young branches, rather to assist the surface of the water; whilst it bore, in prodigious quantities, a beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> flower, not unlike a single rose of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, but without thorns; and indeed, upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, we found that it was not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of the rose, but of the hypericum.\"\n\nHere Mr Bruce exults greatly in his success; as having not only seen the fountains of the Nile, but the river itself running in a small stream; so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> saying of the poet,\n\n*Nec licuit populis parvum te Nile videre,* could not be applied to him. Here he stepped over it, he says, more than 50 times, though he had told us, in the preceding page, that it was three yards over. From this ford, however, the Nile turns to the westward; and, after\nafter running over loose stones occasionally in that direction about four miles farther, there is a small cataract of about six feet in height; after which it leaves the mountainous country, and takes its course through the plains of Goutto. Here it flows so gently that its motion is scarcely to be perceived, but turns and winds in its direction more than any river he ever saw; forming more than 20 sharp angular peninsulas in the space of five miles. Here the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is composed of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARLY\">marly</a> clay, quite destitute of trees, and very difficult to travel through; and where its stream receives no considerable addition. Issuing out from thence, however, it is joined by several rivulets which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> from the mountains on each side, so that it becomes a considerable stream, with high and broken banks covered with old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> trees for three miles. In its course it inclines to the north-east, and winds very much, till it receives first a small river named Divon, and then another named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEE\">Dee</a>-ahka, or the river Dee. Turning then sharply to the east, it falls down another cataract, and about three miles below receives the Jemma, a pure and limpid stream, not inferior in size to itself. Proceeding still to the northward, it receives a number of other streams, and at last crosses the southern part of the lake Tzana or Dembea, preserving the colour of its stream during its passage, and issuing out at the west side of it in the territory of Dara.\n\nThere is a ford, though very deep and dangerous, at the place where the Nile first affirms the name of a river, after emerging from the lake Dembea; but the stream in other places is exceedingly rapid: the banks in the course of a few miles become very high, and are covered with the most beautiful and variegated verdure that can be conceived. It is now confined by the mountains of Begemder, till it reaches Alata, where is the third cataract. This, we are informed by Mr Bruce, is the most magnificent sight he ever beheld; but he thinks that the height has rather been exaggerated by the missionaries, who make it 50 feet; and after many attempts to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> it, he is of opinion that it is nearly 40 feet high. At the time he visited it, the river had been pretty much swelled by rains, and fell in one sheet of water, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, for the space of half an English mile in breadth, with such a noise as stunned and made him giddy for some time. The river, for some space both above and below the fall, was covered with a thick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIST\">mist</a>, owing to the small particles of the water dashed up into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> by the violence of the shock. The river, though swelled beyond its usual size, retained its clearness, and fell into a natural basin of rock; the stream appearing to run back against the foot of the precipice over which it falls with great violence; forming innumerable eddies, waves, and being in excessive commotion, as may easily be imagined. Jerome Lobo pretends that he was able to reach the foot of the rock, and sit under the prodigious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of water spouting over it; but Mr Bruce does not hesitate to pronounce this to be an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> falsehood. The noise of the cataract, which, he says, is like the loudest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>, could not but confound and destroy his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of hearing; while the rapid motion of the water before his eyes would dazzle the sight, make him giddy, and utterly deprive him of all his intellectual powers. \"It was a most magnificent sight,\" says Mr Bruce, \"that ages, added to the greatest length of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> life, would not deface or eradicate from my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>: it struck me with a kind of stupor, and a total oblivion of where I was, and of every other sublunary concern.\"\n\nAbout half a mile below the cataract, the Nile is confined between two rocks, where it runs in a narrow channel with impetuous velocity and great noise. At the village of Alata there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> over it, consisting of one arch, and that no more than 25 feet wide. This bridge is strongly fixed into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> rock on both sides, and some part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAPET\">parapet</a> still remains. No crocodiles ever come to Alata, nor are any ever seen beyond the cataract.\n\nBelow this tremendous water-fall the Nile takes a south-east direction, along the western side of Begemder and Amhara on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, enclosing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Gojam. It receives a great number of streams from both sides, and after several turns takes at last a direction almost due north, and approaches within 62 miles of its source. Notwithstanding the vast increase of its waters, however, it is still fordable at some seasons of the year; and the Galla <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> it at all times without any difficulty, either by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a>, or on goatskins blown up like bladders. It is likewise crossed on small rafts, placed on two skins filled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>: or by twisting their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> round the tails of the horses who swim over; a method always used by the women who follow the Abyssinian armies, and are obliged to cross unfordable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>. In this part of the river crocodiles are met with in great numbers; but the superstitious people pretend they have charms sufficiently powerful to defend themselves against their voracity.\u2014The Nile now seems to have forced its passage through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAP\">gap</a> in some very high mountains which bound the country of the Gongas, and falls down a cataract of 280 feet high; and immediately below this are two others, both of very considerable height. These mountains run a great way to the westward, where they are called Dyre or Tegla, the eastern end of them joining the mountains of Kuara, where they have the name of Fazzebo. These mountains, our author informs us, are all inhabited by Pagan nations; but the country is less known than any other on the African continent. There is plenty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> washed down from the mountains by the torrents in the rainy season; which is the fine gold of Sennar named Tilbar.\n\nThe Nile, now running <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> by Sennar in a direction nearly north and south, makes afterwards a sharp turn to the east; affording a pleasant view in the fair season, when it is brim-full, and indeed the only ornament of that bare and inhospitable country. Leaving Sennar, it passes by many large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> inhabited by Arabs, all of them of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>; then passing Gerri, and turning to the north-east, it joins the Tacazze, passing during its course through this country, a large and populous town named Chendi, probably the Candace of the ancients. Here Mr Bruce supposes the ancient island or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> of Meroe to have been situated. Having at length received the great river Atbara, the Ahababoras of the ancients, it turns directly north for about two degrees; then making a very unexpected turn west by south for more than two degrees in longitude, and winding very little, it arrives at Korti, the first town in Barabra, or kingdom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DONGOLA\">Dongola</a>. From Korti it runs almost south-west till it passes Dongola, called also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEJA\">Beja</a>, the capital of Barabra; after which it comes\nto Mocho, a considerable town and place of refreshment to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARAVANS\">caravans</a> when they were allowed to pass from Egypt to Ethiopia. From thence turning to the north-east it meets with a chain of mountains in about $22^\\circ 15'$ of N. latitude, where is the seventh cataract named Jan Adel. This is likewise very tremendous, though not above half as high as that of Alata. This course is now continued till it falls into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>; there being only one other cataract in the whole space, which is much inferior to any of those already described.\n\nThis very particular and elaborate account of the sources of the Nile and of the course of the river given by Mr Bruce, hath not escaped criticism. We find him accused by the reviewers, not only of having brought nothing to light that was not previously known to the learned, but even of having revealed nothing which was not previously published in Guthrie's Geographical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">Grammar</a>. This, however, seems by no means a fair and candid criticism. If the sources of the Nile, as described by Mr Bruce, were known to the author of Guthrie's Grammar, they must likewise have been to every retailer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a> since the time of the missionaries; which, as the reviewers have particularized that book, would not seem to have been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. If anything new was published there previous to the appearance of Mr Bruce's work, it must probably have been derived indirectly from himself; of which clandestine method of proceeding that gentleman has had frequent occasion to complain in other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>. It is alleged, however, that he has given the name of Nile to a stream which does not deserve it. This, like all other large rivers, is composed of innumerable branches; to visit the top of every one of which would be indeed an Herculean task. The source of the largest branch, therefore, and that which has the longest course, is undoubtedly to be accounted the source of the river; but here it is denied that Mr Bruce had sufficient information. \"Of the innumerable streams (say they) that feed the lake of Tzana, there is one that ends in a bog, to which Mr Bruce was conducted by Woldo, a lying guide, who told him it was the source of the Nile. Mr Bruce, in a matter of far less importance, would not have taken Woldo's word; but he is persuaded, that in this case he spoke truth; because the credulous barbarians of the neighbouring district paid something like worship to this brook, which, at the distance of 14 miles from its source, is not 20 feet broad, and nowhere one foot deep. Now it is almost unnecessary to observe, that the natives of that country being, according to Mr Bruce's report, pagans, might be expected to worship the pure and salutary stream, to which, with other extraordinary qualities, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> ascribed the power of curing the bite of a mad dog. Had he traced to its source any of the other rivulets which run into the lake Tzana, it is not unlikely that he might have met with similar instances of credulity among the ignorant inhabitants of its banks. Yet this would not prove any one of them in particular to be the head of the Nile. It would be trifling with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> of our readers to say one word more on the question, whether the Portuguese Jesuits or Mr Bruce discovered what they erroneously call the head of the Nile. Before either they or he had indulged themselves in a vain triumph over the labours of antiquity, they ought to have been sure that they had effected what antiquity was unable to accomplish. Now the river described by the Jesuit Kircher, who collected the information of his brethren, as well as by Mr Bruce, is not the Nile of which the ancients were in quest. This is amply proved by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of modern geographers, the incomparable D'Anville (at least till our own Rennell appeared), in a copious memoir published in the 26th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the Academy of Belles Lettres, p. 45.\u2014See Rennell's Map of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a>, p. 441.\n\nTo this learned dissertation we refer our readers; adding only what seems probable from the writings of Diodorus Siculus and Herodotus, that the ancients had two meanings when they spoke of the head or source of the Nile: First, Literally, the head or source of that great western stream now called the White River, which contains a much greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of waters, and has a much longer course than the river described by the Jesuits and by Mr Bruce; and, 2dly, Metaphorically, the cause of the Nile's inundation. This cause they had discovered to be the tropical rains, which fall in the extent of 16 degrees on each side of the line; which made the sacrificial of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINERVA\">Minerva</a>'s temple of Sais in Egypt tell that inquisitive traveller Herodotus, that the waters of the Nile run in two opposite directions from its source; the one north into Egypt, the other south into Ethiopia; and the reports of all travellers into Africa serve to explain and confirm this observation. The tropical rains, they acknowledge, give rise to the Nile and all its tributary streams which flow northward into the kingdom of Senaar, as well as to the Zebec, and so many large rivers which flow south into Ethiopia; and then, according to the inclination of the ground, fall into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATLANTIC_OCEAN\">Atlantic ocean</a>. Such then, according to the Egyptian priests, is the true and philosophical source of the Nile; a source discovered above 3000 years ago, and not, as Mr Bruce and the Jesuits have supposed, the head of a paltry rivulet, one of the innumerable streams that feed the lake Tzana.\"\n\nOn this severe criticism, however, it is obvious to remark, that if the source of the Nile has been discovered so many years ago, there is not the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> that the finding of it should have been deemed an impossible undertaking, which it most certainly was, by the ancients.\u2014That the finding out the fountains of the river itself was an object of their inquiry, cannot be doubted; and from the accounts given by Mr Bruce, it appears very evident that none of the ancients had equal success with himself; though indeed the Jesuits, as has already been observed, seem to have a right to dispute it with him. From the correspondence of his accounts with that of the Jesuits, it appears certain that the most considerable stream which flows into the lake Tzana takes its rise from the fountains at Geeth already described; and that it is the most considerable plainly appears from its stream being visible through the whole breadth of the lake, which is not the case with any of the rest. The preference given to this stream by the Agows, who worship it, seems also an irrefutable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that they look upon it to be the great river which passes through Ethiopia and Egypt; nor will the argument of the reviewers hold good in supposing that other streams are worshipped, unless they could prove that they are so. As little can it be any objection or disparagement\ndisparagement to Mr Bruce's labours, that he did not discover the sources of the western branch of the Nile called the White River. Had he done so, it might next have been objected that he did not visit the springs of the Tacazze, or any other branch. That the origin of the White river was unknown to the ancients may readily be allowed; but so were the fountains of Geeth, as evidently appears from the erroneous position of the sources of the eastern branch of the Nile laid down by Ptolemy. Our traveller, therefore, certainly has the merit, if not of discovering the sources, at least of confirming the accounts which the Jesuits have given of the sources of the river called the Nile; and of which the White river, whether greater or smaller, seems to be accounted only a branch. The superior veneration paid to the eastern branch of this celebrated river will also appear from the variety of names given to it, as well as from the import of these names; of which Mr Bruce gives the following account.\n\nBy the Agows it is named Gzeir, Geefa, or Seir; the first of which terms signifies a god. It is likewise named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">Ab</a>, father; and has many other names, all of them implying the most profound veneration. Having descended into Gojam it is named Abay; which, according to Mr Bruce, signifies the river that suddenly swells and overflows periodically with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>. By the Gonas on the south side of the mountains Dyre and Tegla, it is called Dahli, and by those on the north side Kowas; both of which names signify a watching dog, the latrator <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANUBIS\">anubis</a>, or dog-star. In the plain country between Fazuolo and Sennar it is called Nile which signifies blue; and the Arabs interpret this name by the word Azergue; which name it retains till it reaches Halfaia, where it receives the White river.\n\nFormerly the Nile had the name of Siris, both before and after it enters Beja, which the Greeks imagined was given to it on account of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> colour during the inundation; but Mr Bruce affirms us that the river has no such colour. He affirms, with great probability, that this name in the country of Beja imports the river of the dog-star, on whose vertical appearance this river overflows; \"and this idolatrous worship (says he) was probably part of the reason of the question the prophet Jeremiah asks: And what hast thou to do in Egypt to drink the water of Seir, or the water profaned by idolatrous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a>?\" As for the first, it is only the translation of the word <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAHAR\">bahar</a> applied to the Nile. The inhabitants of the Barabra to this day call it Bahar el Nil, or the sea of the Nile, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> to the Red sea, for which they have no other name than Bahar el Molech, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">Salt</a> sea. The junction of the three great rivers, the Nile flowing on the west side of Moroc; the Tacazze, which washes the east side, and joins the Nile at Maggiran in N. Lat. 17\u00b0; and the Mareb, which falls into this last something above the junction, gives the name of Triton to the Nile.\n\nThe name Aegyptus, which it has in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>, and which our author supposes to have been a very ancient name even in Ethiopia, is more difficult to account for. This has been almost universally supposed to be derived from the black colour of the inundation; but Mr Bruce, for the reasons already given, will not admit of this. \"Egypt (says he) in the Ethiopic is called y Gipt, Agar; and an inhabitant of the country, Gypa, for precisely so it is pronounced; which means the country of ditches or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>, drawn from the Nile on both sides at right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> with the river: nothing surely is more obvious than to write y Gipt, so pronounced, Egypts; and, with its termination us or os, Egypts. The Nile is also called Kronides, Jupiter; and has had several other appellations bestowed upon it by the poets; though these are rather of a transitory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> than to be ranked among the ancient names of the river. By some of the ancient fathers it has been named Geon; and by a strange train of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a> they would have it to be one of the rivers of the terrestrial paradise; the same which is said to have encompassed the whole land of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSH\">Cush</a> or Ethiopia. To effect this, they are obliged to bring the river a great number of miles, not only under the earth, but under the sea also; but such reveries need no refutation.\n\nUnder the article Egypt we have so fully explained the cause of the annual inundation of the Nile, that, with regard to the phenomenon itself, nothing farther seems necessary to be added. We shall therefore only extract from Mr Bruce's work what he has said concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of natural operation by which the tropical rains are produced; which are now universally allowed to be the cause of the annual overflowing of this and other rivers.\n\nAccording to this gentleman, the air is so much rarified by the sun during the time that he remains almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a> over the tropic of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPRICORN\">Capricorn</a>, that the other winds loaded with vapours rush in upon the land from the Atlantic ocean on the west, the Indian ocean on the east, and the cold Southern ocean beyond the Cape. Thus a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of vapour is gathered, as it were, into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a>; and as the same causes continue to operate during the progress of the sun northward, a vast train of clouds proceed from south to north, which, Mr Bruce informs us, are sometimes extended much farther than at other times. Thus he tells us, that for two years some white dappled clouds were seen at Gondar, on the 7th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a>; the sun being then 34\u00b0 distant from the zenith, and not the least cloudy speck having been seen for several months before. About the first of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, however, it begins to rain at Gondar, but only for a few minutes at a time, in large drops; the sun being then about 5\u00b0 distant from the zenith. The rainy season commences with violence at every place when the sun comes directly over it; and before it commences at Gondar, green boughs and leaves appear floating in the Bahar el Abiad, or White river, which, according to the accounts given by the Gallo, our author supposes to take its rise in about 30\u00b0 north latitude.\n\nThe rains therefore precede the sun only about 5\u00b0; but they continue and increase after he has passed it. In April all the rivers in the southern parts of Abyssinia begin to swell, and greatly augment the Nile, which is now also farther augmented by the vast quantity of water poured into the lake Tzana. On the first days of May, the sun passes the village of Gerr, which is the limit of the tropical rains; and it is very remarkable, that, though the sun still continues to operate with unabated vigour, all his influence cannot bring the clouds farther northward than this village;\nthe reason of which Mr Bruce, with great reason, supposes, to be the want of mountains to the northward. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of this opinion, he observes, that the tropical rains stop at the latitude of $14^\\circ$ instead of $16^\\circ$ in the western part of the continent. All this time, however, they continue violent in Abyssinia; and in the beginning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> the rivers are all full, and continue so while the sun remains stationary in the tropic of Cancer.\n\nThis excessive rain, which would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEEP\">sweep</a> off the whole soil of Egypt into the sea were it to continue without intermission, begins to abate as the sun turns southward; and on his arrival at the zenith of each place, on his passage towards that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, they cease entirely: the reason of which is no less difficult to be discovered than that of their coming on when he arrives at the zenith in his passage northward. Be the reason what it will, however, the fact is certain; and not only so, but the time of the rains ceasing is exact to a single day; inasmuch, that on the 25th of September the Nile is generally found to be at its highest at Cairo, and begins to diminish every day after. Immediately after the sun has passed the line, he begins the rainy season to the southward; the rains constantly coming on with violence as he approaches the zenith of each place; but the inundation is now promoted in a different manner, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of circumstances in the situation of the places. From about $6^\\circ$ S. Lat., a chain of high mountains runs all the way along the middle of the continent towards the Cape of Good Hope, and intercepts the southern part of the peninsula nearly in the same manner that the Nile does the northern. A strong wind from the south, stopping the progress of the condensed vapours, dashes them against the cold summits of this ridge of mountains, and forms many rivers, which escape in the direction either of east or west as the level presents itself. If this is towards the west, they fall down the sides of the mountains into the Atlantic, and if on the east into the Indian ocean.\u2014\"The clouds (says Mr Bruce), drawn by the violent action of the sun, are condensed, then broken, and fall as rain on the top of this high ridge, and swell every river; while a wind from the ocean on the east blows like a monsoon up each of these streams, in a direction contrary to their current during the whole time of the inundation; and this enables boats to ascend into the western parts of Sotala, and the interior country, to the mountains where lies the gold. The same effect, from the same cause, is produced on the western side towards the Atlantic; the high ridge of mountains being placed between the different countries west and east, is at once the source of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>, and of those rivers which conduct to the treasures, which would be otherwise inaccessible, in the eastern parts of the kingdoms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENIN\">Benin</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONGO\">Congo</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGOLA\">Angola</a>.\n\n\"There are three remarkable appearances attending the inundation of the Nile. Every morning in Abyssinia is clear, and the sun shines. About <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a>, a small cloud not above four feet broad, appears in the east, whirling violently round as if upon an axis; but arriving near the zenith, it first abates its motion, then loses its form, and extends itself greatly, and seems to call up vapours from all the opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>. These clouds having attained nearly the same height, rush against each other with great violence, and put me always in mind of Eliisa foretelling rain on Mount Carmel. The air, impelled before the heaviest mists, or swiftest mover, makes an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of its form on the collection of clouds opposite; and the moment it has taken possession of the space made to receive it, the most violent thunder possible to be conceived instantly follows, with rain: after some hours the sky again clears, with a wind at north; and it is always disagreeably cold when the thermometer is below $63^\\circ$.\n\n\"The second thing remarkable is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of the thermometer. When the sun is in the southern tropic, $36^\\circ$ distant from the zenith of Gondar, it is seldom lower than $72^\\circ$; but it falls to $68^\\circ$, and $63^\\circ$, when the sun is immediately vertical; so happily does the approach of rain compensate the heat of a too scorching sun.\n\nThe third is that remarkable stop in the extent of the rain northward, when the sun that has conducted the vapours from the line, and should seem now more than ever to be in the possession of them, is here overruled suddenly; till, on his return to Gerrit, again it resumes the absolute command over the rain, and reconducts it to the line, to furnish distant deluges to the southward.\"\n\nWith regard to the Nile itself, it has been said that the quantity of earth brought down by it from Abyssinia is so great, that the whole land of Egypt is produced from it. This question, however, is discussed under the article Egypt, where it is shown that this cannot possibly be the case.\u2014Among other authorities there quoted was that of Mr Volney, who strenuously argues against the opinion of Mr Savary and others, who have maintained that Egypt is the gift of the Nile. Notwithstanding this, however, we find him asserting that the soil of Egypt has undoubtedly been augmented by the Nile, in which case it is not unreasonable to suppose that it has been produced by it altogether.\u2014\"The reader (says he) will conclude, doubtless, from what I have said, that writers have flattered themselves too much in supposing they could fix the precise limits of the enlargement and rise of the Delta. But, though I would reject all illusory circumstances, I am far from denying the fact to be well founded; it is plain from reason, and an examination of the country. The rise of the ground appears to me demonstrated by an observation on which little stress has been laid. In going from Rofetta to Cairo, when the waters are low, as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of March, we may remark, as we go up the river, that the shore rises gradually above the water; so that if overflowed two feet at Rofetta, it overflows from three to four at Faona, and upwards of twelve at Cairo (A). Now by reasoning from this fact, we may deduce the proof of an increase by sediment; for the layer of mud being in proportion to the thickness of the sheets of water by which it is deposited, must be more or less considerable\n\n(A) \"It would be curious to ascertain in what proportion it continues up to Aswan. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPTS\">Copts</a>, whom I have interrogated on the subject, assured me that it was much higher through all the Said than at Cairo.\"\nconsiderable as these are of a greater or less depth; and we have seen that the like gradation is observable from Aboan to the sea.\n\n\"On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the increase of the Delta manifests itself in a striking manner, by the form of Egypt along the Mediterranean. When we consider its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> on the map, we perceive that the country which is in the line of the river, and evidently formed of foreign materials, has assumed a semicircular shape, and that the shores of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a> and Africa, on each side, have a direction towards the bottom of the Delta; which manifestly discovers that this country was formerly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a>, that in time has been filled up.\n\n\"This accumulation is common to all rivers, and is accounted for in the same manner in all: the rain water and the snow descending from the mountains into the valleys, hurry incessantly along with them the earth they wash away in their descent. The heavier parts, such as pebbles and sands, soon stop, unless forced along by a rapid current. But when the waters meet only with a fine and light earth, they carry away large quantities with the greatest facility. The Nile, meeting with such a kind of earth in Abyssinia and the interior parts of Africa, its waters are loaded and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> filled with it; nay, it is frequently so embarrassed with this sediment as to be straitened in its course. But when the inundation restores to it its natural energy, it drives the mud that has accumulated towards the sea, at the same time that it brings down more for the ensuing season; and this, arrived at its mouth, heaps up, and forms shoals, where the declivity does not allow sufficient action to the current, and where the sea produces an equilibrium of resistance. The stagnation which follows occasions the groarser particles, which till then had floated, to sink; and this takes place more particularly in those places where there is least motion, as towards the shores, till the sides become gradually enriched by the spoils of the upper country and of the Delta itself; for if the Nile takes from Abyssinia to give to the Thebais, it likewise takes from the Thebais to give to the Delta, and from the Delta to carry to the sea. Wherever its waters have a current, it defoils the same territory that it enriches. As we ascend towards Cairo, when the river is low, we may observe the banks worn steep on each side and crumbling in large flakes. The Nile, which undermines them, depriving their light earth of support, it falls into the bed of the river; for when the water is high, the earth imbibes it; and when the sun and drought return, it cracks and moulders away in great flakes, which are hurried along by the Nile.\"\n\nThus does Mr Volney argue for the increase of the Delta in the very same manner that others have argued for the production of the whole country of Egypt; an opinion which he is at great pains to refute. Under the article Egypt, however, it is shown that the Nile does not bring down any quantity of mud sufficient for the purposes assigned; and with regard to the argument drawn from the shallowness of the inundation when near the sea, this does not prove any rise of the land; but as Mr Reemel has judiciously observed in his remarks on the inundation of the Ganges, arises from the nature of the fluid itself. The reason, in short, is this: The surface of the sea is the lowest point to which the waters of every inundation have a tendency; and when they arrive there, they spread themselves over it with more ease than anywhere else, because they meet with less resistance. Their motion, however, by reason of the small declivity, is less swift than that of the waters farther up the river, where the declivity is greater; and consequently the latter being somewhat impeded in their motion, are in some degree accumulated. The surface of the inundation, therefore, does not form a perfectly level plain, but one gradually sloping from the interior parts of the country towards the sea; so that at the greatest distance from the ocean the water will always be deepest, even if we should suppose the whole country to be perfectly smooth, and composed of the most solid materials.\u2014This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> is easily underflood from observing a quantity of water running along a wooden spout, which is always more shallow at the end of the spout where it runs off than at the others.\u2014With regard to Mr Volney's other arguments, they are without doubt contradictory; for if, as he says, the river takes from Abyssinia to give to the Thebais, from Thebais to give to the Delta, and from Delta to the sea, it undoubtedly follows, that it gives nothing to any part of the land whatever, but that altogether is swept into the Mediterranean sea; which, indeed, some very trifling quantities excepted, is most probably the case.\n\nIt has been remarked by Mr Pococke, a very judicious traveller, that, in the beginning of the inundation, the waters of the Nile run red, and sometimes green; and while they remain of that colour, they are unwholesome. He explains this phenomenon by supposing, that the inundation at first brings away that red or green filth which may be about the lakes where it takes its rise; or about the sources of the small rivers which flow into it, near its principal source; \"for,\" says he, although there is so little water in the Nile when at lowest, that there is hardly any current in many parts of it, yet it cannot be supposed that the water should stagnate in the bed of the Nile so as to become green. Afterwards the water begins to be red and still more turbid, and then it begins to be wholesome.\" This circumstance is explained by Mr Bruce in the following manner: The country about Narea and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAFFA\">Caffa</a>, where the river Abiad takes its rise, is full of immense marshes, where, during the dry season, the water stagnates, and becomes impregnated with every kind of corrupted matter. There, on the commencement of the rains, overflow into the river Abiad, which takes its rise there. The overflowing of these vast marshes first carries the discoloured water into Egypt; after which follows that of the great lake Tzana, through which the Nile passes; which having been stagnated, and without rain, under a scorching sun for six months, joins its putrid waters to the former. In Abyssinia also, there are very few rivers that run after November, but all of them stand in prodigious pools, which, by the heat of the sun, likewise turn putrid, and on the commencement of the rains throw off their stagnant water into the Nile; but at last, the rains becoming constant, all this putrid matter is carried off, and the sources of the inundation become sweet and wholesome. The river then passing through the kingdom of Sennaar, the soil of which is this red <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOLE\">bole</a>, becomes coloured with that earth; and a mixture, along with the moving sands of the deserts, of which it receives\nreceives a great quantity when raised by the wind, precipitates all the viscous and putrid matters which float in the waters; whence Mr Pococke judiciously observes, that the Nile is not wholesome when the water is clear and green, but when fo red and turbid that it stains the water of the Mediterranean.\n\nThe rains in Abyssinia, which cease about the 8th of September, generally leave a sickly season in the low country; but the diseases produced by these rains are removed by others which come on about the end of October, and cease about the 8th of November. On these rains depend the latter crops of the Abyssinians; and for these the Agows pray to the river, or the genius or spirit residing in it. In Egypt, however, the effect of them is seldom perceived; but in some years they prove excessive; and it has been observed that the Nile, after it has fallen, has again risen in such a manner as to alarm the whole country. This is said to have happened in the time of Cleopatra, when it was supposed to prefigure the extinction of the government of the Ptolemies; and in 1737 it was likewise imagined to portend some dreadful calamity.\n\nThe quantity of rain, by which all this inundation is occasioned, varies considerably in different years, at least at Gondar, where Mr Bruce had an opportunity of measuring it. In 1770 it amounted to 35\u00bd inches; but in 1771 it amounted to no less than 41,355 inches from the vernal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUINOX\">equinox</a> to the 8th of September. What our author adds concerning the variation of the rainy months seems totally irreconcilable with what he had before advanced concerning the extreme regularity of the natural causes by which the tropical rains are produced. \"In 1770 (says he) August was the rainy month; in 1771, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>. When July is the rainy month, the rains generally cease for some days in the beginning of August, and then a prodigious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> falls in the latter end of that month and first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> of September. In other years July and August are the violent rainy months, while June is fair. And lastly, in others, May, June, July, August, and the first week of September.\" If this is the case, what becomes of the regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of the clouds by the sun as he advances northwards; of the coming on of the rains when he arrives at the zenith of any place, in his passage to the tropic of Cancer; and of their ceasing when he comes to the same point in his return southward?\n\nUnder Abyssinia we have mentioned a threat of one of the Abyssinian monarchs, that he would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the course of the Nile and prevent it from fertilizing the land of Egypt; and it has likewise been related, that considerable progress was made in this undertaking by another emperor. Mr Bruce has bestowed an entire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> on the subject; and is of opinion, that \"there seems to be no doubt that it is possible to diminish or divert the course of the Nile, that it should be insufficient to fertilize the country of Egypt; because the Nile, and all the rivers that run into it, and all the rains that fall on these rivers, fall in a country two miles above the level of the sea; therefore it cannot be denied, that there is level enough to divert many of the rivers into the Red Sea, or perhaps still easier by turning the course of the river Abiad till it meets the level of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGER\">Niger</a>, or pass through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> into the Mediterranean. Alphonso <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBUQUERQUE\">Albuquerque</a> is said to have written frequently to the king of Portugal to send him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIONEERS\">pioneers</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MADEIRA\">Madeira</a>, with people accustomed to level grounds, and prepare them for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> canes; by whose assistance he meant to turn the Nile into the Red Sea. This undertaking, however, if it really had been projected, was never accomplished; nor indeed is there any probability that ever such a mad attempt was proposed. Indeed, though we cannot deny that there is a possibility in nature of accomplishing it, yet the vast difficulty of turning the course of so many large rivers may justly stigmatize it as impracticable; not to mention the obstructions which must naturally be suggested from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> imutility of the undertaking, and those which would arise from the opposition of the Egyptians.\n\nIt has already been observed in a quotation from the reviewers, that Herodotus was informed by the satirist or secretary of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a> of Minerva, that one half of the waters of the Nile run north and the other south. This is also taken notice of by Mr Bruce; who gives the following explanation of it. \"The secretary was probably of that country himself, and seems by his observation to have known more of it than all the ancients together. In fact we have seen, that between 13\u00b0 and 14\u00b0 north latitude, the Nile, with all its tributary streams, which have their rise and course within the tropical rains, falls down into the flat country (the kingdom of Sennar), which is more than a mile lower than the high country in Abyssinia; and thence, with a little inclination, it runs into Egypt. Again, in latitude 9\u00b0, in the kingdom of Gingiro, the Zebu runs south or south-east, into the Inner Ethiopia, as do also many other rivers, and, as I have heard from the natives of that country empty themselves into a lake, as those on the north side of the line do into the lake Tzana, thence distributing their waters to the east and west. These become the heads of great rivers, that run through the interior countries of Ethiopia (corresponding to the sea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MELINDA\">Melinda</a> and Mombaza) into the Indian ocean; whilst, on the westward, they are the origin of the vast streams that fall into the Atlantic, passing through Benin and Congo, southward of the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAMBIA\">Gambia</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIERRA_LEONE\">Sierra Leone</a>. In short, the periodical rains from the tropic of Capricorn to the line, being in equal quantity with those that fall between the line and the tropic of Cancer, it is plain, that if the land of Ethiopia sloped equally from the line southward and northward, the rains that fall would go, the one half north and the other half south; but as the ground from 9\u00b0 north declines all southward, it follows, that the rivers which run to the southward must be equal to those that run northward, plus the rain that falls in the 5\u00b0 north latitude, where the ground begins to slope to the southward; and there can be little doubt that is at least one of the reasons why there are in the southern continent so many rivers larger than the Nile, that run both into the Indian and Atlantic oceans.\"\n\nFrom this account given to Herodotus, it has been supposed, by some writers on geography, that the Nile divides itself into two branches, one of which runs northward into Egypt, and one through the country of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">Negroes</a> westward into the Atlantic ocean. This opinion was first broached by Pliny.\u2014It has been adopted by the Nubian geographer, who urges\nurges in support of it, that if the Nile carried down all the rains which fall into it from Abyssinia, the people of Egypt would not be safe in their houses. But to this Mr Bruce answers, that the waste of water in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> deserts through which the Nile passes is so great, that unless it was supplied by another stream, the White River, equal in magnitude to itself, and which, rising in a country of perpetual rains, is thus always kept full, it never could reach Egypt at all, but would be lost in the sands, as is the case with many other very considerable rivers in Africa. \"The rains (says he) are collected by the four great rivers in Abyssinia; the Mareb, the Bowihi, the Taccazze, and the Nile. All these principal, and their tributary streams, would, however, be absorbed, nor be able to pass the burning deserts, or find their way into Egypt, were it not for the White River, which having its source in a country of almost perpetual rains, joins to it a never-failing stream equal to the Nile itself.\"\n\nWe shall conclude this article with some account of the Agows who inhabit the country about the sources of the Nile. These, according to Mr Bruce, are one of the most considerable nations in Abyssinia, and can bring into the field about 4000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> and a great number of foot; but were once much more powerful than they are now, having been greatly reduced by the invasions of the Galla. Their province is nowhere more than 60 miles in length, or than 30 in breadth; notwithstanding which they supply the capital and all the neighbouring country with cattle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, wax, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIDES\">hides</a>, and a number of other necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>; whence it has been customary for the Abyssinian princes to exact a tribute rather than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> from them. The butter is kept from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a> during the long carriage, by mixing it with a small quantity of a root somewhat like a carrot, which they call mormico. It is of a yellow colour, and answers the purpose perfectly well; which in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> it is very doubtful if salt could do. The latter is besides used as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>; being circulated instead of silver <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>, and used as change for gold. Brides paint their feet, hands, and nails, with this root. A large quantity of the seed of the plant was brought into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> by Mr Bruce.\n\nThe Agows carry on a considerable trade with the Shangalla and other black savages in the neighbourhood; exchanging the produce of their country for gold, ivory, horns of the rhinoceros, and some fine cotton. The barbarity and thievish disposition of both nations, however, render this trade much inferior to what it might be.\n\nIn their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> the Agows are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> idolaters, paying divine honours to the Nile, as has already been observed. Mr Bruce, who lodged in the house of the priest of the river, had an opportunity of becoming acquainted with many particulars of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>. He heard him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a> to the Nile, in which he styled it the \"Most High God, the Saviour of the world. In this prayer he petitioned for seasonable rain, plenty of grass, and the preservation of a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a>; deprecating thunder very pathetically. The most sublime and lofty titles are given by them to the spirit which they suppose to reside in the river Nile; calling it everlasting God, Light of the World, Eye of the World, God of Peace, their Saviour, and Father of the Universe.\n\nThe Agows are all clothed in hides, which they manufacture in a manner peculiar to themselves. These hides are made in the form of a shirt reaching down to their feet, and tied about the middle with a kind of girdle or girdle. The lower part of it resembles a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> petticoat, one fold of which they turn back over their shoulders, fastening it with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROACH\">broach</a> or skewer across their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> before, and the married women carry their children in it behind. The younger fort generally go naked. The women are marriageable at nine years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, though they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> do not marry till eleven; and they continue to bear children till 30, and sometimes longer. They are generally thin and below the middle size, as well as the men. Barrenness is quite unknown among them.\n\nThe country of the Agows has a very elevated situation, and is of course so temperate that the heat may easily be borne, though little more than 10\u00b0 from the equator. The people, however, are but short lived; which may in part be owing to the oppression they labour under. This, according to Mr Bruce, is excessive. \"Though their country (says he) abounds with all the necessaries of life, their taxes, tributes, and services, especially at present, are so multiplied upon them, whilst their distresses of late have been so great and frequent, that they are only the manufacturers of the commodities they sell, to satisfy these constant exorbitant demands, and cannot enjoy any part of their own produce themselves, but live in penury and misery scarcely to be conceived. We saw a number of women wrinkled and sun-burnt so as fearlessly to appear human, wandering about under a burning sun, with one and sometimes two children upon their backs; gathering the seeds of bent grass to make a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>.","sp":19,"ep":29},{"h":"NILOMETER","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> NILOSCOPE, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> used among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the height of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> of the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a> in its overflows.\n\nThe word comes from \u039d\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 Nile (and that from \u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \"new mud,\" or as some others would have it, from \u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd, \"I flow,\" and \u1f00\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03c1\u03c9, \"mud,\") and \u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \"measure.\" The Greeks more ordinarily call it, \u039d\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1.\n\nThe nilometer is said, by several Arabian writers, to have been first set up, for this purpose, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> during his regency in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>: the measure of it was 16 cubits, this being the height of the increase of the Nile, which was necessary to the fruitfulness of Egypt.\n\nFrom the measure of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a>, Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a> deduces an argument, in order to prove that the Jewish and Egyptian cubits were of the same length.\n\nIn the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s library is an Arabic treatise on nilometers, entitled Neil fi alhal al Nil; wherein are described all the overflows of the Nile, from the first year of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEGIRA\">Hegira</a> to the 875th.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a> mentions a column erected in a point of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> Delta, to serve as a nilometer; and there is still one of the same kind in a mosque of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>.\n\nAs all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> of Egypt arise from the inundations of the Nile, the inhabitants used to supplicate them at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERAPIS\">Serapis</a>; and committed the most execrable crimes, as actions, forsooth, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, to obtain the favour. This occasioned Constantine expressly\nNilometer to prohibit these sacrifices, &c., and to order the nilometer to be removed into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>; whereas, till that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, it had been in the temple of Serapis. Julian the Apostate had it replaced in the temple, where it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till the time of Theodosius the Great.\n\nThe following is Mr Bruce's account of the nilometer. \"On the point of the island Rhode, between Geeza and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a>, near the middle of the river, is a round tower enclosing a neat well or cistern lined with marble. The bottom of this well is on the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with the bottom of the Nile, which has free access to it through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> opening like an embrasure. In the middle of the well rises a thin column of eight faces of blue and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> marble; of which the foot is on the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> with the bottom of the river. This pillar is divided into 20 peeks, of 22 inches each. Of these peeks the two lowermost are left, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, to stand for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of sludge which the water deposits there. Two peeks are then divided, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, into 24 digits each; then on the left, four peeks are divided into 24 digits; then on the right, four; and on the left another four; again, four on the right, which completes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of 18 peeks from the first division marked on the pillar, each peek being 22 inches. Thus the whole marked and unmarked amounts to something more than 36 feet English.\n\nOn the night of St John, when, by the falling of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEW\">dew</a>, they perceive the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> water from Ethiopia mixed with the Nile at Cairo, they begin to announce the elevation of the river, having then five peeks of water marked on the nilometer, and two unmarked for the sludge, of which they take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> notice. Their first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a>, supposing the Nile to have risen 12 digits, is 12 from 6, or it wants 12 digits to be six peeks. When it has risen three more, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> from six; and so on, till the whole 18 be filled, when all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> of Egypt is fit for cultivation. Several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a> are then opened, which convey the water into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a>, and hinder any further stagnation on the fields. There is indeed a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of more water to come from Ethiopia; but were the inundation suffered to go on, it would not drain soon enough to fit the land for tillage: and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against this mischief is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the nilometer, though the Turkish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> makes it an engine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol6.html#article-TAXATION\">taxation</a>. From time immemorial the Egyptians paid, as tribute to the king, a certain proportion of the fruit of the ground; and this was anciently ascertained by the elevation of the water on the nilometer, and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENSURATION\">mensuration</a> of the land actually overflowed. But the Saracen government, and afterwards the Turkish, has taxed the people by the elevation alone of the water, without attending to its course over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the land actually overflowed; and this tax is sometimes cruelly oppressive.","sp":29,"ep":30},{"h":"NIMBUS","t":"in antiquity, a circle observed on certain medals, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> round the heads of some emperors; answering to the circles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> drawn round the images of saints.","sp":30,"ep":30},{"h":"NIMEGUEN","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, handsome, and strong town of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NETHERLANDS\">Netherlands</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of Dutch Gelderland, with a citadel, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, and several forts.

He tells us, that \"Nimrod began to be a mighty one in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>;\" that he was a \"mighty hunter before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>,\" even to a proverb; and that \"the beginning of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BABEL\">Babel</a>, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> of Shinar.\"\n\nFrom this account he is supposed to have been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of extraordinary strength and valour.

It is generally thought, that by the words a mighty hunter, is to be understood, that he was a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>; but some of the rabbins interpret those words favourably, saying, that Nimrod was qualified by a peculiar dexterity and strength for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a>, and that he offered to God the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAME\">game</a> which he took; and several of the moderns are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that this passage is not to be understood of his tyrannical oppressions, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> of hunting of men, but of beasts.

By that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, we are told, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Persians fitted their kings for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>; and hunting is still, in many countries, considered as one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>.\n\nThere is nothing in the short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of Nimrod which carries the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of reproach, except his name, which signifies a rebel; and that is the circumstance which seems to have occasioned the injurious opinions which have been entertained of him in all ages. Commentators, being prepossessed in general that the curse of Noah fell upon the posterity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAM\">Ham</a>, and finding this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> stigmatized by his name, have interpreted every passage relating to him to his disadvantage. They represent him as a rebel against God, in perverting the defendants of Noah to disobey the divine command to disperse, and in setting them to build the tower of Babel, with an impious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of scaling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>. They brand him as an ambitious usurper, and an insolent oppressor; and make him the author of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a> of fire, of idolatrous worship given to men, and the first persecutor on the score of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, some account him a virtuous prince, who, far from advising the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of Babel, left the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and went into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSYRIA\">Assyria</a>, because he would not give his consent to that project.\n\nNimrod is generally thought to have been the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>; though some authors, supposing a plantation or dispersion <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> to that of Babel, have made kings in several countries before his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIZRAIM\">Mizraim</a> is thought, by many who contend for the antiquity of the Egyptian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>, to have begun his reign much earlier than Nimrod; and others, from the uniformity of the languages spoken in Assyria, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLONIA\">Babylonia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANAAN\">Canaan</a>, affirm those countries to have been peopled before the confusion of tongues.\n\nThe four cities Moses gives to Nimrod constituted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> kingdom in those early times, when few kings had more than one; only it must be observed, that possessions might at first have been large, and afterwards divided into several parcels; and Nimrod being the leader of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, we may suppose his subjects settled within these limits: whether he became possessor of those cities by conquest or otherwise, does not appear; it is most probable he did not build Babel, all the posterity of Noah seeming to have been equally concerned in that affair; nor does it appear that he built the other three, though the founding of them, and many more, with other works, are attributed to him by some authors. It may seem also a little strange, that Nimrod should be preferred to the regal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>, and enjoy the most cultivated part of the earth then known, rather than any other of the elder chiefs or heads of nations, even of the branch of Ham. Perhaps it was conferred on him for his dexterity in hunting; or, it may be, he did not assume the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of king till after his father Cush's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, who might have been settled there before him, and left him the sovereignty; but we incline to think, that he seized Shinar from the descendants of Shem, driving out Cush, who from thence went and founded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINEVEH\">Nineveh</a>, and other cities in Assyria.\n\nThe Scripture does not inform us when Nimrod began his reign: Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a> it before the dispersion; but such a conjecture does not seem to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> with the Mosaic history; for before the dispersion we read of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> but Babel; nor could there well be more, while all mankind were yet in a body together; but when Nimrod assumed the regal title, there seem to have been other cities; a circumstance which shows it was a good while after the dispersion. The learned writers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">Universal</a> History place the beginning of his reign 30 years from that event, and in all likelihood it should be placed rather later than earlier.\n\nAuthors have taken a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of pains to find Nimrod in profane history: some have imagined him to be the same with Belus, the founder of the Babylonish empire; others take him to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINUS\">Ninus</a>, the first Assyrian monarch. Some believe him to have been Ezechus, the first Chaldean king after the deluge; and others perceive a great resemblance between him and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACCHUS\">Bacchus</a>, both in actions and name. Some of the Mohammedan writers suppose Nimrod to have been Zohak, a Persian king of the first dynasty; others contend for his being Cay Caus, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> king of the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>; and some of the Jews say he is the same with Amraphel the king of Shiner, mentioned by Moses. But there is no certainty in these conjectures, nor have we any knowledge of his immediate successors.\n\nThe Scripture mentions nothing as to the death of Nimrod; but authors have taken care that such an essential circumstance in his history should not be wanting. Some of the rabbins pretend he was slain by Elau, whom they make his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a>. There is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a> that he was killed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of the tower of Babel, which was overthrown by tempestuous winds.

Diodorus Siculus, who has given us the dimensions of it, says it was 480 stadia in circumference, or 47 miles; and that it was surrounded with lofty walls and towers; the former being 200 feet in height, and so very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> that three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARIOTS\">chariots</a> might drive on them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABREAST\">abreast</a>; and the latter 200 feet in height, and 1500 in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>; and Strabo allows it to have been much\nNineveh, much greater than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLON\">Babylon</a>.

It was taken a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time by Affyages and Nabopolassar from Chynaladanus king of Assyria in the year 3378. After this time, Nineveh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more recovered its former splendour.

We mention him, because he is said to have been the first who converted the Scots and Picts to the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>; which he did during the reign of Theodosius the Younger. Bede informs us, that he built a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> dedicated to St Martin, in a style unknown to the Britons of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>; and adds, that during his time the Saxons held this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> (Galluvia, now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALLOWAY\">Galloway</a>), and that, as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the labours of this saint the converts to Christianity increased, an episcopal see was established there. Dr Henry, considering that \"few or none of the writings of the most ancient fathers of the British church are now extant, and since little being said of them by their contemporaries, we can know little of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of their erudition,\" gives a short account of some of them. Of St Ninian he says, \"he was a Briton of noble birth and excellent genius. After he had received as good an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> at home as his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> could afford, he travelled for his further improvement, and spent several years at Rome, which was then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> seat of learning as well as of empire.

Her mother was a lady of exemplary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>; but her father early inspired her with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. Having lost her parents at 14 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, and finding herself mistress of her own actions, she resolved never to marry: she had an income of 10,000 livres a-year; and, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LESSONS\">lessons</a> she had received from her father, drew up a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of life and gallantry, which she pursued till her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. Never delicate with respect to the number, but always in the choice, of her pleasures, she sacrificed nothing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>; but loved only while her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>; and had among her admirers the greatest lords of the court. But notwithstanding the levity of her conduct, she had many virtues.\u2014She was constant in her friendship, faithful to what are called the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>, of strict veracity, disinterested, and more particularly remarkable for perfect probity. Women of the most respectable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> were proud of the honour of having her for their friend; at her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> was an affable\n\n---\n\n(A) This assertion, however, is far from seeming probable; for every trace of it seems to have totally disappeared, even so early as A.D. 627, that the vacant space afforded a spacious field for the celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Heraclius and the Persians. There are few things in ancient history which have more puzzled the learned world, than to determine the spot where this city stood. Mr Ives informs us, that some have imagined it stood near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JONAH\">Jonah</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a>; others, however, place it at another place, some hours journey up the Tigris. These different opinions, however, seem perfectly reconcilable; for it appears at least probable, that ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINEVEH\">Nineveh</a> took in the whole of the ground which lies between these two ruined places. Mr Ives adds, that \"what confirms this conjecture is, that much of this ground is now hilly, owing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> doubt to the rubbish of the ancient buildings. There is one mound of 200 or 300 yards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, which stands some yards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-east of Jonah's tomb, wherein it is likely a fortification once stood.

But the illustrious Madame de Sevign\u00e9 with great justness remarks in her letters, that this school was dangerous to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and the Christian virtues; because Ninon L'Enclos made use of seducing maxims, capable of depriving the mind of those invaluable treasures. Ninon was esteemed beautiful even in old age; and is said to have inspired violent passions at 80. She died at Paris in 1705. This lady had several children; one of whom, named Chevalier de Villiers, excited much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> by the tragic manner in which he ended his life.

This consummate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> was afraid of disturbing her features too much, knowing full well that the point where he was to expect most sympathy was there, where distress co-operated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, and where our pity met our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>.

This extraordinary person having therefore found favour in the eyes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>, and God seeing that all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> had corrupted their ways, told Noah, that he was resolved to destroy mankind from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a> of waters; and not them alone, but all the beasts of the earth, and every creeping thing, as well as the fowls of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> (Ibid. 7.). The Lord therefore directed Noah, as a means of preserving him and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> (for he had three sons, Shem, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAM\">Ham</a>, and Japheth, who were all married before the flood), to build an ark or vessel, of a certain form and size fitted to that end, and which might besides accommodate such numbers of animals of all sorts, that were liable to perish in the flood, as would be sufficient to preserve the several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, and again replenish the earth; together with all necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> for them; all which Noah performed, as may be seen more particularly under the article Ark.\n\nIn the year of the world 1656, and in the 600th year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, Noah, by God's appointment, entered the ark, together with his wife, his three sons, their wives, and all the animals which God caused to come to Noah; and being all entered, and the door of the ark being shut upon the outside, the waters of the deluge began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> upon the earth, and increased in such a manner, that they were fifteen cubits above the tops of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> thus upon the earth for 150 days; so that whatever had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> upon the earth, or in the air, was destroyed, except such as were with Noah in the ark. But the Lord remembering Noah, sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> upon the earth, which caused the waters to subside; so that upon the seventeenth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of the seventh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> the ark rested on the mountains of Ararat; and Noah having uncovered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> of the ark, and observing the earth was dry, he received orders from the Lord to come out of it, with all the animals that were therein; and this he did in the five hundred and first year of his age, on the 27th day of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> month. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the deluge is more circumstantially related already under the article DELUGE.\n\nThen he offered as a burnt sacrifice to the Lord one of all the pure animals that were in the ark; and the Lord accepted his sacrifice, and said to him, that he would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more pour out his curse upon the whole earth, nor any more destroy all the animals as he had now done. He gave Noah power over all the brute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>, and permitted him to eat of them, as of the herbs and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of the earth; except only the blood, the life of which God did not allow them. He bid him increase and multiply, made a covenant with him, and God engaged himself to send no more an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> deluge upon the earth; and as a memorial of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a>, he let his bow in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a>, to be as a pledge of the covenant he made with Noah (Gen. ix.).\n\nNoah, being a husbandman, began now to cultivate the vine; and having made wine and drank thereof, he unwarily made himself drunk, and fell asleep in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENT\">tent</a>, and happened to uncover himself in an indecent posture. Ham, the father of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANAAN\">Canaan</a>, having observed him in this condition, made himself sport with him, and acquainted his two brothers with it, who were without. But they, instead of making it a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of sport, turned away from it, and going backwards they covered their father's nakedness, by throwing a mantle over him. Noah awaking, and knowing what Ham had done, said, that Canaan the son of Ham should be accursed, that he should be a slave of slaves in respect of his brethren. It is thought he had a mind to spare the person of his son Ham, for fear the curse might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> upon\nupon the other children of Ham, who had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. He cursed Canaan by a spirit of prophecy, because the Canaanites his descendants were after this to be rooted out by the Israelites. Noah added, Let the Lord, the God of Shem, be blessed, and let Canaan be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> of Shem. And he was so in effect, in the person of the Canaanites subdued by the Hebrews. Lastly, Noah said, Let God extend the possession of Japheth; let Japheth dwell in the tents of Shem, and let Canaan be his servant. This prophecy had its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a>, when the Grecians, and afterwards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, being descended from Japheth, made a conquest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, which was the portion of Shem.\n\nBut Noah lived yet after the deluge three hundred and fifty years; and the whole time of his life having been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> hundred and fifty years, he died in the year of the world 2056. He left three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, of whom mention is made under their several names; and according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, he divided the whole world amongst them, in order to repopulate it. To Shem he gave Asia, to Ham <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> to Japheth. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> have it, that besides these three sons he had several others. The spurious Berosus gives him thirty, called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TITANS\">Titans</a>, from the name of their mother Titaea. They pretend that the Teutons or Germans are derived from a son of Noah called Thuiticon. The false Methodius also makes mention of Jonithus or Jonicus, a pretended son of Noah.\n\nSt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> calls Noah a preacher of righteousness (2 Peter ii. 5.), because before the deluge he was incessantly preaching and declaring to men, not only by his discourses, but by his unblameable life, and by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of the ark, in which he was employed five score years, that the wrath of God was ready to pour upon them. But his preaching had no effect, since, when the deluge came, it found mankind plunged in their former enormities (Mat. xxiv. 37.).\n\nSeveral learned men have observed, that the Heathens confounded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEUCALION\">Deucalion</a>, Ogyges, the god Cebus or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-URANUS\">Uranus</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JANUS\">Janus</a>, Proteus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMETHEUS\">Prometheus</a>, &c. with Noah. The wife of Noah is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORIA\">Noria</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GNOSTICS\">Gnostics</a>; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> of Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha is manifestly invented from the history of Noah.\n\nThe Rabbins pretend, that God gave Noah and his sons (all who are not of the chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a> they call Noachidae) certain general precepts, which contain, according to them, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> which is common to all men indifferently, and the observation of which alone will be sufficient to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> them. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of Moses, the Hebrews would not suffer any stranger to dwell in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, unless he would conform to the precepts of the Noachidae. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> they put to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, all that were ignorant of them. These precepts are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>.\n\nThe first directs, that obedience be paid to judges, magistrates, and princes.\n\nBy the second, the worship of false gods, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, and sacrilege, are absolutely forbidden.\n\nThe third forbids cursing the name of God, blasphemies, and false <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a>.\n\nThe fourth forbids all incestuous and unlawful connexions, as sodomy, bestiality, and crimes against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>.\n\nThe fifth forbids the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of blood of all sorts of animals, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a>, wounds, and mutilations.\n\nThe sixth forbids thefts, cheats, lying, &c.\n\nThe seventh forbids to eat the parts of an animal still alive, as was practised by some Pagans.\n\nTo these the Rabbins have added some others; but what inclines us to doubt the antiquity of these precepts is, that no mention is made of them in Scripture, or in the writings of Josephus or Philo; and that none of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> fathers knew anything of them.","sp":36,"ep":37},{"h":"NOB","t":"a sacerdotal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of Benjamin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Ephraim.

A state of perfect equality can subsist only among\nNobility among beings possessing equal talents and equal virtues; but such beings are not men. Were all mankind under the constant influence of the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, a distinction of ranks would be unnecessary; but in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> itself would likewise be unnecessary, because men would have attained all that perfection to which it is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of civil government as well as of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> to guide them: every man then would be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> unto himself. But whilst, in so many breasts, the selfish passions predominate over those which are social, violence must be restrained by authority; and there can be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> authority without a distinction of ranks, such as may influence the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>.\n\nIt is well observed by Hume, that government is founded only on opinion; and that this opinion is of two kinds, opinion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, and opinion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>. When a people are persuaded that it is their interest to support the government under which they live, that government must be very stable. But among the worthless and unthinking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>, this persuasion has seldom <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. All men, however, have a notion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a>\u2014of a right to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> and a right to power: and when the majority of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> considers a certain order of men as having a right to that eminence in which they are placed, this opinion, call it prejudice or what we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, contributes much to the peace and happiness of civil society. There are many, however, who think otherwise, and imagine that \"the society in which the greatest equality prevails must always be the most secure. These men conceive it to be the business of a good government to distribute as equally as possible those blessings which bounteous nature offers to all.\" It may readily be allowed that this reasoning is conclusive; but the great question returns, \"How far can equality prevail in a society which is secure? and what is possible to be done in the equal distribution of the blessings of nature?\" Till these questions be answered, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> nothing by declaiming on the rights and equality of men; and the answers which have sometimes been given to them suppose a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of perfection in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> nature, which, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it were real, would make all civil institutions useless, as well as the reveries of those reformers. The conduct of the democratic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of Pagan antiquity, together with the oppressive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a> and shameful violences which we have seen and still see in a neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, will be considered by many as a full and satisfactory answer, deduced from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, to all the schemes of the visionary theorist: such facts at least render the abolition of the order of nobility a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of more importance, and of infinitely greater difficulty, than those who plead for it are disposed to allow.\n\nIt is an opinion not uncommon, and at least plausible, that the nobility of a well regulated state is the best security against monarchical despotism or lawless usurpation on the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and the confusion of democratic insolence on the other. Self interest is the most powerful principle in the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>; and it is obviously the interest of such men to preserve that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> of power in society upon which the very existence of their order depends. Corrupted as the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> confessedly is, a very recent instance could be given, in which the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">House</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEERS\">Peers</a> rescued at once the sovereign and the people from the threatened tyranny of a factious junto. As it is our business, however, to exhibit all opinions of any celebrity, we shall lay before our readers a short extract from Du Laure's Critical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of the French Nobility, which contains, in few but forcible words, some of the common arguments against this distinction of ranks.\n\n\"Nobility (says he), a distinction equally impolitic and immoral, and worthy of the times of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> and of rapine, which gave it birth, is a violation of the rights of that part of the nation that is deprived of it; and as equality becomes a stimulus towards distinction, so on the other hand this is the radical vice of a government and the source of a variety of evils. It is almost impossible that there should be any uncommon instances of virtue in a state, when reputations belong exclusively to a certain class of society, and when it costs them no more to obtain these than the trouble of being born. Amongst this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of privileged persons, virtues, talents, and genius, must of course be much less frequent than in the other classes, since, without the possession of any of these qualities, they who belong to it are still honoured and rewarded. Those who profit by this absurd subversion of principles, and those who lose by this unjust distribution of favours, which seem to have grown into a right, cannot have any other than false, immoral, and pernicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> concerning merit.\"\n\nA perfect equality, however, in rank and fortune has seldom been contended for, except by the most ignorant enthusiasts. It is indeed doubtful whether it could possibly exist. The more moderate and rational reformers have acknowledged, that as these differences have always existed in some way or other, so, from the infinite variety of talents and attainments in the world, we have reason to expect they will exist in every form of government and among every people. The question, therefore, is reduced to this: Whether the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of distinction, or any other which could be instituted in its stead, be upon the whole the best? That the present is not perfect, or wholly without faults, few will be sanguine enough to contradict: and a wise man in the sober <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> of philosophical reflection will scarce presume to assert, that any other scheme which human ingenuity can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> would be wholly without imperfection, or altogether free from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>. The case is, the errors of our own system are present, and on this account we see and feel them with peculiar force: the other plan we look forward to perhaps in too sanguine a manner, and we probably forget, in the delusive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, that if distinction depended entirely on merit, we should scarce find a society of men so honest, or so able, as always to reward it according to its deserts; or if this were possible, as perhaps in the nature of things it is not, such is the self-partiality of the generality of men, that few would think he were dealt justly by if he were not promoted as well as his neighbour; and it is clearly impossible to promote every one. For such reasons then, and many more which our limits oblige us to omit, many think (and we are inclined to think with them), that it is safer to remain as we are, as we know the evils that attend our situation, and are still able to bear them, rather than to hazard a change, which,\nNobility, which, with some benefits, might also perhaps increase the troubles, and destroy many of the pleasures of social life.\n\nPerhaps it may not be amiss to lay before our readers the following observations from that most judicious commentator on the laws of England, Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">Justice</a> Blackstone, on this important subject.\n\n\"The distinction of rank and honours (says he) is necessary in every well-governed state, in order to reward such as are eminent for their services to the public, in a manner the most desirable to individuals, and yet without burden to the community; exciting thereby an ambitious, yet laudable ardour, and generous emulation, in others. And emulation, or virtuous ambition, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> which, however dangerous or invidious in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> republic or under a despotic sway, will certainly be attended with good effects under a free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>; where, without destroying its existence, its excesses may be continually restrained by that superior power from which all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> is derived. Such a spirit, when nationally diffused, gives life and vigour to the community; it sets all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> of government in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, which, under a wise regulator, may be directed to any beneficial purpose; and thereby every individual may be made subservient to the public good, while he principally means to promote his own particular views. A body of nobility is also more peculiarly necessary in our mixed and compounded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, in order to support the rights of both the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> and the people, by forming a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> to withstand the encroachments of both. It creates and preserves that gradual scale of dignity, which proceeds from the peasant to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>; rising like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a> from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> foundation, and diminishing to a point as it rises. It is this ascending and contracting proportion that adds stability to any government; for when the departure is sudden from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> to another, we may pronounce that state to be precarious. The nobility, therefore, are the pillars, which are reared from among the people, more immediately to support the throne; and, if that falls, they must also be buried under its ruins. Accordingly, when in the 17th century the commons had determined to extirpate monarchy, they also voted the house of lords to be useless and dangerous. And since titles of nobility are thus expedient in the state, it is also expedient that their owners should form an independent and separate branch of the legislature. If they were confounded with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of the people, and like them had only a vote in electing representatives, their privileges would soon be borne <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> and overwhelmed by the popular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a>, which would effectually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> all distinctions. It is therefore highly necessary that the body of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a> should have a distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>, distinct deliberations, and distinct powers from the commons.\"\u2014These remarks, at a time like the present, deserve our serious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>; nor do we suppose our readers will be displeased, if we add the following observations on the subject from a periodical publication of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> standing and very considerable merit.\n\n\"Birth and nobility are a stronger obligation to virtue than is laid upon meaner persons. A vicious or dishonourable nobleman is in effect perjured; for his honour is his oath.\n\n\"Under the patriarchal scheme, and at the first setting out of the tribes, the heads of families had their Nobility, particular escutcheons, and their genealogies recorded with the utmost exactness: Even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">Ancient</a> of Days confirmed this; he often put his people in mind of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> and virtues of their forefathers; and hath set a precedent for attainders, by visiting the third and fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>.\n\n\"It is a vulgar error to suppose, that his blest Son chose his followers out of the meanest of the people, because <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>; for this was part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> of every Jewish nobleman: Two of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, being his kinsmen, were of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> house of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>; one was a Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, and another of the royal family of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>; and for the rest, he had the same right of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> as his Father and his vicegerents, of advancing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> to honour, and of exalting the lowly and meek.\n\n\"The ancient Greeks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> paid great regard to nobility; but when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVELLING\">levelling</a> principle obtained, and the people shared power and honour, those states soon dwindled and came to ruin. And in present Rome, great respect is paid to the renowned families of Colonna and Caesarei. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>, the notion of nobility is carried so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as to become inconsistent with a republican scheme. The Spaniards pay more regard to their old nobles than to their old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>; and the French are but little behind them. What was said of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTMORENCY\">Montmorency</a> by Henry IV.\n\n\"That he was a better gentleman than himself,\" was, perhaps, the reason why the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> of so illustrious a family was cut off, to make the house of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOURBON\">Bourbon</a> the first in France.\u2014The Welsh, Irish, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">Poles</a>, are remarkable for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to blood and pedigree.\n\n\"It is for the sake of the meanest of our people, that the high value and regard for quality should be kept up; for they are best governed by those who seem formed for power: the robe of authority fits easily upon them, and submission is as much our choice as our duty; but upstarts prove the worst of tyrants.\n\n\"The ancient legislators, who studied human nature, thought it advisable, for the better government of states, that the people should be divided into the noble and the common. They judged it for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> good of mankind, that the valiant and the wise should be separated from the rest, and appointed for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> and command.\n\n\"To this I take it that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> of nobility is owing in all countries; even those nations which we are pleased to call <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a>, distinguish the wise and the valiant, obey them as counsellors and commanders, which is placing them in the rank of nobles.\n\n\"Some, I know, look upon the institution of nobility to be one of the grossest impositions upon the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of mankind; they confine it indeed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> nobility; they allow, that those who have done the commonwealth any signal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> should be distinguished with honours, but it seems an absurdity to them that a man should be born a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a>, as if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> or a knowledge of government ran in the blood. But if they would consider how strong the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of posterity is planted in human nature, they must allow that nothing can be a stronger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> to great and worthy actions, than the notion that a man's posterity will reap the honour and profit of his labours.\"\nNobility. Besides, we are to suppose that men born to honours and a high fortune may be bred up in generous sentiments, and formed for the station they are to fill; that they must be strangers to those vicious falsehoods and corruptions which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> first, and then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>, puts men upon practising, whose lives are spent in pursuit of their fortunes. I will own, notwithstanding all these advantages, that many of them are like rocks whose heads are in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a>, but are so barren that they are quite incapable of producing anything; but in general, were their minds only upon a level with those of other men, we should expect better fruit from them.\n\n\"As authority is founded in opinion, all wise commonwealths have been extremely jealous in keeping up the honour of their nobility. Wherever they become base, effeminate, cowardly, or servile, their authority finks, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into contempt; then the people begin to consider them as useless to government, and look upon their privileges as a grievance to society, and perhaps they think how to get rid of them, as happened in the commonwealth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a>, where, after the expulsion of the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, a petty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, many of the nobility having behaved fervently to him, and insolently to the people, were degraded from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> and the magistracy, and rendered incapable of holding any employment in the commonwealth.\n\n\"Father Paul, the Venetian, says, that you must either keep your nobility free from taint, or have no nobility at all: That the high employments of the commonwealth should be bestowed amongst the most ancient families, unless where a person should distinguish himself by some signal service to the state. Such a man would think himself sufficiently rewarded by the honour of being put upon a footing with the ancient nobility; and the nobility would be pleased to find that no commoner, except some of great reputation and merit, was to hold any of the employments usually possessed by their body. If the person so preferred should not be rich enough to support the dignity of the office, the state may give him a pension, but by no means should employments be made lucrative; which not only exhaust and weaken the commonwealth, but wherever the high employments are sought for profit, the nobility lose their generous sentiments, and it is a means of introducing corruption amongst them.\"\n\nThe origin of nobility in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> is by some referred to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHS\">Goths</a>; who, after they had seized a part of Europe, rewarded their captains with titles of honour, to distinguish them from the common people. We shall only in this place further consider the manner in which in our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> they may be created, and the incidents attending them; referring for a fuller account of their origin in Europe to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> Revolution, and Civil Society.\n\n1. The right of peerage seems to have been originally territorial; that is, annexed to lands, honours, castles, manors, and the like; the proprietors and possessors of which were (in right of those estates) allowed to be peers of the realm, and were summoned to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> to do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> and service to their sovereign; and, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> was alienated, the dignity passed with it as appendant. Thus in England the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> still sit in the house of lords in right of succession to certain ancient baronies annexed, or supposed to be Nobility annexed, to their episcopal lands; and thus in Henry VI., the possession of the castle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARUNDEL\">Arundel</a> was adjudged to confer an earldom on its possessor. But afterwards, when Alienations grew to be frequent, the dignity of peerage was confined to the lineage of the party ennobled, and instead of territorial became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a>. Actual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENURE\">tenure</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARONY\">barony</a> became no longer necessary to constitute a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> of parliament; but the record of the writ of summons to him or his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> was admitted as a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of the tenure.\n\nPeers of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> are now created either by writ or by patent; for those who claim by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESCRIPTION\">prescription</a> must suppose either a writ or patent made to their ancestors; though by length of time it is lost. The creation by writ or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> is a summons to attend the house of peers, by the style and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of that barony which the king is pleased to confer: that by patent is a royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> to a subject of any dignity and degree of peerage. The creation by writ is the more ancient way; but a man is not ennobled thereby, unless he actually take his seat in the house of lords; and some are of opinion that there must be at least two writs of summons, and a fitting in two distinct parliaments, to evidence a hereditary barony; and therefore the most usual, because the surest way, is to grant the dignity by patent, which endures to a man and his heirs according to the limitation thereof, though he never himself makes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of it. Yet it is frequent to call up the eldest son of a peer to the house of lords by writ of summons, in the name of his father's barony, because in that case there is no danger of his children's losing the nobility in case he never takes his seat; for they will succeed to their grandfather. Creation by writ has also one advantage over that by patent; for a person created by writ holds the dignity to him and his heirs, without any words to that purport in the writ; but in letters patent there must be words to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the inheritance, else the dignity endures only to the grantee for life. For a man or woman may be created noble for their own lives, and the dignity not descend to their heirs at all, or descend only to some particular heirs: as where a peerage is limited to a man and the heirs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> of his body by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> his present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>, and not to such heirs by any former or future wife.\n\n2. Let us next take a view of a few of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> incidents attending the nobility,\u2014exclusive of their capacity as members of parliament, and as hereditary counsellors of the crown; for both which we refer to the articles Lords and Parliament. And first we must observe, that in criminal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> a nobleman shall be tried by his peers. The great are always obnoxious to popular envy: were they to be judged by the people, they might be in danger from the prejudice of their judges; and would moreover be deprived of the privilege of the meanest subjects, that of being tried by their equals, which is secured to all the realm by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNA_CHARTA\">magna <a cla</a>ss=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARTA\">charta</a>, c. 29. It is said, that this does not extend to bishops, who, though they are lords of parliament, and fit there by virtue of their baronies which they hold jure ecclesiastic, yet are not ennobled in blood, and consequently not peers with the nobility. As to peersesses, no provision was made for their\ntheir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> when accused of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a> or felony, till after Eleanor duchess of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLOUCESTER\">Gloucester</a>, wife to the lord protector, had been accused of treason, and found guilty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITCHCRAFT\">witchcraft</a>, in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNOD\">synod</a>, through the intrigues of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUFORT\">Beaufort</a>. This very extraordinary trial gave occasion to a special statute, 20 Hen. VI. c. 9, which enacts, that peers, either in their own right or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, shall be tried before the same judicature as peers of the realm. If a woman, noble in her own right, marries a commoner, she still remains noble, and shall be tried by her peers; but if she be only noble by marriage, then by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> marriage with a commoner she loses her dignity; for as by marriage it is gained, by marriage it is also lost. Yet if a duchess dowager marries a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">baron</a>, she continues a duchess till; for all the nobility are peers, and therefore it is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a>. A peer or peeress (either in her own right or by marriage) cannot be arrested in civil cases; and they have also many peculiar privileges annexed to their peerage in the course of judicial proceedings. A peer fitting in judgement, gives not his verdict upon oath, like an ordinary jurymen, but upon his honour; he answers also to bills in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHANCERY\">chancery</a> upon his honour, and not upon his oath; but, when he is examined as a witness either in civil or criminal cases, he must be sworn; for the respect which the law shows to the honour of a peer does not extend so far as to overturn a settled maxim, that in judicio non creditur nisi juratus. The honour of peers is however so highly tendered by the law, that it is much more penal to spread false reports of them, and certain other great officers of the realm, than of other men: scandal against them being called by the peculiar name of scandalum magnatum, and subjected to peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> ancient statutes.\n\nA peer cannot lose his nobility but by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> or attainder; though there was an instance, in the reign of Edward IV., of the degradation of George Neville duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEDFORD\">Bedford</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of parliament, on account of his poverty, which rendered him unable to support his dignity. But this is a singular instance, which serves at the same time, by having happened, to show the power of parliament; and, by having happened but once, to show how tender the parliament hath been in exerting so high a power. It hath been said indeed, that if a baron wastes his estate, so that he is not able to support the degree, the king may degrade him; but it is expressly held by later authorities, that a peer cannot be degraded but by act of parliament.\n\nAntonius Matthaeus observes, that nobility, among the Romans, was a quite different thing from what it is among us. The nobles, among the Romans, were either those raised to the magistrature, or descended from magistrates: there was no such thing as nobility by patent.\n\nBartoli says, that doctors, after they have held a professor's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> in an university for 20 years, become noble; and are entitled to all the rights of counts.\n\nBut this claim is not admitted at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, &c. though Bartoli's sentiments be backed with those of several other authors, particularly Chaffanoux in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUCIUS\">Confucius</a>-din Burgundicus; Royer for la Coutume de Berry; Faber C. de Dig. Def. 9. &c. which last, however, restrains Bartoli's rule to doctors in law, and princes physicians.\n\nBy an edict of the French king in 1669, it is declared, that trade shall not derogate from nobility, provided the person do not fall by retail.\n\nIn Bretagne, by ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, a nobleman loses nothing by trading even in retail; but he realiurnes all his rights as soon as he ceases traffic, his nobility having slept all the time.\n\nIn Germany, a woman, not noble by birth, doth not become, v. gr. a countess or baroness by marrying a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> or baron: a lady of the higher degree indeed becomes a princess by marrying a prince; but this does not hold of a lady of the lower nobility.\n\nOn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Malabar, children are only capable of being noble by the mother's side; it being allowed them to take as many husbands as they please, and to quit them whenever they think proper.","sp":37,"ep":41},{"h":"NOBLE","t":"Nobilitis, a person who has a privilege which raises him above a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONER\">commoner</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a>, either by birth, by office, or by patent from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>. The word comes from the Latin nobilitas; formed from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> nobilitas, \"distinguihable, remarkable.\"\n\nIn England, the word noble is of a narrower import than in other countries, being confined to persons above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of knights; whereas, abroad, it comprehends not only knights, but what we simply call gentlemen. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a> of England are also called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEERS\">peers</a> regni, as being nobilitatis pares, though gradu impares.\n\nThe Venetian noblesse is famous; it is in this that the sovereignty of the state resides. It is divided into three classes. The first only comprehends 24 families. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> includes the descendants of all those who were entered in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">Golden</a> Book, in 1280, and destined to govern the state, which then began to be aristocratic. The third consists of such as have bought the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of noble Venetians. This last class is only admitted to the inferior employ; the two former to all indifferently. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of noble Venetian is sometimes also given to foreign kings, princes, &c.\n\nNobles, among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, were such as had the jus imaginum, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of using the pictures or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>; a right which was allowed only to those whose ancestors had borne some curule office, that is, had been curule edile, censor, praetor, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a>. For a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, none but the patricii were the nobles, because <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> person but of that superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> could bear any curule office; hence in Livy, Sallust, &c. nobilitas is used to signify the patrician order, and opposed to plebs. To make the true meaning of nobilitas fill more clear, let it be observed, that the Roman people were divided into nobiles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVI\">novi</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNOBILES\">ignobiles</a>. Nobiles were they who had the pictures, &c. of their ancestors; novi were such as had only their own; ignobiles were such as had neither. See Jus Imaginis.\n\nThe Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, by way of distinction, wore a half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> upon their shoes, especially those of patrician rank.\n\nThe Grecian nobility were called Eumegides, as being descended from those old heroic ancestors so famous in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>. Such were the Praxiergidae, Etrobutidae, Alexanidae, &c. all which had many privileges annexed to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>; amongst which was this, that they wore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-GRIFFON\">griffon</a> heads in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> as a badge of nobility.\n\nNoble, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> of account containing six shillings and eight pence.\n\nThe noble was anciently a real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a> struck in the reign of Edward III. and then called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENNY\">penny</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>; but\nbut it was afterwards called a rofe-noble, from its being stamped with a rofe: it was current at 6s. 8d.","sp":41,"ep":42},{"h":"NOCERA","t":"a town in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, in the dominions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a>, as he is more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called, the king of the Two Sicilies. It is an episcopal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, but might with greater propriety be styled a cluster of villages; its several parts being extended along the foot of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, form the Citt\u00e0 Sotana, or low town; and the bishop's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, together with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONVENTS\">convents</a> embowered in cypresses groves, cover the peak of a single hill in a very picturesque manner, and compose the Citt\u00e0 Sopra.\n\nNocera (A), it is reported, contains near 30,000 inhabitants; they are dispersed in forty patches of habitation. Their houses are constructed of two kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> walls are built with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> tufa dug out of the hills that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> to the east of the town; which stone seems unquestionably to have been formed by a conglomeration of substances thrown out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VESUVIUS\">Vesuvius</a>, because, on opening these quarries, the workmen have frequently discovered tombs, vases, and coins locked up in the body of the stony stratum. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of their doors and windows are made of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> stone drawn from the hill of Fiano, two miles to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>: it lies eight feet below the surface, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> or vein 140 feet thick, resting upon a base of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>. This seems evidently to be a stream of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAVA\">lava</a> congealed.\n\nNocera is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of very considerable antiquity: in the 13th century it was called de Pagani, to distinguish it from a city in Umbria of a similar name; this addition was in allusion to a colony of Saracens which Frederick of Swabia brought from Sicily, and settled here, that they might be out of the way of their dangerous connexions with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>: hence Nocera has often been confounded with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUCERA\">Lucera</a> by the negligent or ignorant chroniclers of the succeeding ages.

To make up the want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>, they determined to give their son a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>. They sent him to the college of Clermont in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUVAIS\">Beauvais</a>, and afterwards to Beauvais, there to finish his introductory studies. The progress which he made in the different classes, determined them to send him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> at Paris. Thenceforward they intended him for the clerical order; and they considered the strictness and purity of his morals, together with his unwearied application to study, as sufficient proofs of his vocation. The young Nollet yielded without reluctance to the wishes of his parents. As soon as he was capable of showing an inclination for any thing, he had discovered a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for physics; but this was not become his ruling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>; he therefore sacrificed it to the study of scholastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>, to which he wholly dedicated himself during his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of probation in 1728. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> sooner had he been invested with the deaconship, than he solicited and obtained a license to preach. This new occupation, however, did not make him entirely lose sight of those studies which had first engaged his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. They insensibly began to occupy a greater portion of his time, which was now more equally divided between theology and the sciences. The latter, however, prevailed; and thenceforth he entered into the study of physics with an ardour which was only increased by that kind of privation to which he had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> subject. He was received into the Society of Arts, established at Paris under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> of the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> de Clermont. In 1730, the abbe Nollet was engaged in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> conductedly with Reaumur and du Fay of the Academy of Sciences. In 1734, he went to London in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> with M. M. du Fay, du Hamel, and de Juffieu. His merit procured him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the Royal Society without any solicitation. Two years after, he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, where he formed an intimate connection with Desaguliers, Gravefendt, and Mouchenbroeck. On his return to Paris, he resumed the course of experimental physics which he had begun in 1735, and which he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till 1760. These courses of physics first suggested the idea of particular courses in other branches of science, such as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>, anatomy, natural history, &c. In 1738, the count de Maurepas prevailed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">cardinal</a> Fleury to establish a public class for experimental physics; and the abbe Nollet was appointed the first professor. In the beginning of the year 1739, he was admitted a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of April following, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARDINIA\">Sardinia</a> intending to establish a professorship of physics at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURIN\">Turin</a>, invited the abbe Nollet into his dominions. From thence he travelled into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>. In 1744, he was honoured with an invitation to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSAILLES\">Versailles</a>, to instruct the dauphin in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXPERIMENTAL_PHILOSOPHY\">experimental philosophy</a>; the king and royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> were often present at his lectures. The qualities as well of his understanding as of his heart gained him the esteem and confidence of his pupil. Going one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> in state to Paris, he caused intimation to be made that he was to dine at the Tuileries. M. Nollet having gone thither to pay his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, the dauphin no sooner perceived him, than he had the goodness to say, \"Binet has the advantage of me, he has been at your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>.\" Till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> showed marks of the strongest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> and favour for this ingenious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>. He would have wished that he had been a little more attentive to the improvement of his fortune. He prevailed upon him to go and pay court to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> in power, whose patronage might have been of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to him. The abbe Nollet accordingly waited upon the placeman, and made him a present of his works. \"I never read any works of that kind,\" said the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> coldly, and casting a look at the volumes before him. \"Sir (replied the abbe), <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> you allow them to remain in your antechamber?

At Turin, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>, and Bologna, the abbe Nollet appeared as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a> from the philosophers of the rest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>.

Upon his return through Turin, the king of Sardinia, always truly sensible of his merit, offered him the order of Saint Maurice, which he did not think proper to accept without his sovereign's permission. In 1753, the king instituted a class of experimental philosophy in the royal college of Navarre, and appointed the abbe Nollet professor. In 1757, he received from the king a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREVET\">brevet</a> appointing him preceptor in physics and natural history to the Enfans de France. In the month of August, the same year, he was appointed professor of experimental philosophy in the school of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>, at that time established at la Fere. In the month of November following, he was admitted as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENSIONARY\">pensionary</a> of the Royal Academy of Sciences. M. de Cremillo, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTOR\">director</a> general of artillery and fortification, having founded a class of experimental philosophy at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEZIERES\">Mezieres</a> in 1761, the abbe Nollet was appointed professor. This celebrated and laborious philosopher, who has rendered the most important services to physics by the discoveries with which he has enriched every branch of this science, but particularly electricity, died at Paris on the 25th of April 1770, aged 70; much regretted by the literary world, and by his friends, of whom his gentle character and benevolent heart had procured him a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>.

They were great dealers in words, whence they were vulgarly denominated Word-sellers; but had the denomination of Nominalists, because, in opposition to the Realists, they maintained, that words, and not things, were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALECTICS\">dialectics</a>.\n\nThis sect had its first rise towards the end of the 11th century, and pretended to follow Porphyry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>; but it was not till Ocham's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that they bore the name. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of this sect, in the 11th century, was a person called John, who, on account of his logical subtlety, was called the sophist; and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> disciples were Robert of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, Roscelin of Compi\u00e8gne, and Arnoul of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAON\">Laon</a>. At the beginning, the Nominals had the upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>; but the Realists, though greatly divided among themselves, were supported by men of great abilities; such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBERTUS_MAGNUS\">Albertus Magnus</a>, T. Aquinas, and Duns Scotus. The nominal sect came hereby into disrepute; till William Occam, in the 14th century, again revived it, and filled France and Germany with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> of disputation. Having joined the party of the Franciscan monks, who strenuously opposed John XXII., that pope himself, and his successors after him, left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> means untried to extirpate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> of the Nominalists, which was deemed highly prejudicial to the interests of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>: and hence it was, that, in the year 1339, the university of Paris, by a public edict, solemnly condemned and prohibited the philosophy of Occam, which was that of the Nominalists. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> was, that the Nominalists flourished more than ever. In the 15th century, the controversy was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> with more vigour and animosity than before; and the disputants were not content with using merely the force of eloquence, but had frequently recourse to more hostile and dangerous weapons; and battles were the consequence of a philosophical question, which neither side understood. In most places, however, the Realists maintained a manifest superiority over the Nominalists. While the famous Germon, and the most eminent of his disciples were living, the Nominalists were in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> esteem and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> in the university of Paris. But upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of these patrons, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of things was much changed to their disadvantage. In the year 1473, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XI., by the instigation of his confessor, the bishop of Avranches, issued out a severe edict against the doctrines of the Nominalists, and ordered all their writings to be seized and secured, that they might not be read by the people; but the same monarch mitigated this edict the year following, and permitted some of the books of that sect to be delivered from their confinement. In the year 1481, he not only granted a full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to the Nominalists and their writings, but also restored that philosophical sect to its former authority and lustre in the university.\n\nThe Nominalists were the founders of the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LEIPZIG\">Leipzig</a>: and there are many yet abroad who pique themselves on being Nominals.\n\nThe Nominals, with the Stoics, admit the formal conceptions or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of things, as the subject and foundation of universality: but to this they add names, which represent and signify, after the same univocal manner, and without any distinction, a great variety of single things alike in genus and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>.\n\nWhence it is that they are called Nominals; as pretending, that to become learned, it is not enough to have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> ideas of things, but it is likewise required to know the proper names of the genera and species of things, and to be able to express them clearly and precisely, without confusion or ambiguity.","sp":45,"ep":45},{"h":"NOMINATIVE","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">Grammar</a>, the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOUNS\">nouns</a> which are declinable.\n\nThe simple position, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> laying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> of a noun, or name,\nname, is called the nominative case; yet it is not so properly a case, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> or ground whence the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> are to be formed, by the several changes and inflections given to this first termination.

Dissenting teachers, in order to be exempted from the penalties of the statutes 13 and 14 Car. II. c. 4. 17 Car. II. c. 2. and 22 Car. II. c. 1., are also to subscribe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> mentioned in the statute 13 Eliz. c. 12. (viz. those which only concern the confession of the true Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, and the doctrine of the sacraments), with an express exception of those relating to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> and powers of the church, and to infant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a>. And by stat. 10 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANN\">Ann</a>. c. 2. this toleration is ratified and confirmed; and it is declared, that the said act shall at all times be inviolably observed for the exempting such Protestant dissenters as are thereby intended from the pains and penalties therein mentioned. Thus, though the offence of non-conformity is by no means universally abrogated, it is suspended, and ceases to exist with regard to these Protestant dissenters, during their compliance with the conditions imposed by the act of toleration: and, under these conditions, all persons, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> approve themselves no Papists or oppugners of the Trinity, are left at full liberty to act as their consciences shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> them in the matter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> worship. And if any person shall wilfully, maliciously, or contemptuously disturb any congregation assembled in any church or permitted meeting-house, or shall mischievously preach or teach there, he shall (by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of the same statute) be bound over to the sessions of the peace, and forfeit 20l. But by statute 5 Geo. I. c. 4., no mayor or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> magistrate must appear at any dissenting meeting with the ensigns of his office, on pain of disfavour to hold that or any other office: the legislature judging it a matter of propriety, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of worship, set up in opposition to the national, when allowed to be exercised in peace, should be exercised also with decency, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>, and humility. Neither doth the act of toleration extend to enervate those clauses of the statutes 13 & 14 Car. II. c. 4. and 17 Car. II. c. 2. which prohibit (upon pain of fine and imprisonment) all persons from teaching school, unless they be licensed by the ordinary, and subscribe a declaration of conformity to the liturgy of the church, and reverently frequent divine service established by the laws of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>.\n\n\"As to Papists what has been said of the Protestant dissenters would hold equally strong for a general toleration of them; provided their separation was founded only upon difference of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> in religion, and their principles did not also extend to a subversion of the civil government. If once they could be brought to renounce the supremacy of the Pope, they might quietly enjoy their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> sacraments; their purgatory, and auricular confession; their worship of relics and images; nay, even their transubstantiation. But while they acknowledge a foreign power, superior to the sovereignty of the kingdom, they cannot complain, if the laws of that kingdom will not treat them upon the footing of good subjects.\n\n\"The following are the laws that have been enacted against the Papists; who may be divided into three classes, persons professing Popery, Popish recusants convict, and Popish priests. 1. Persons professing the Popish religion, besides the former penalties for not frequenting their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> church, are disfavored from taking any lands either by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> or purchase, after 18 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, until they renounce their errors; they must at the age of 21 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> their estates before acquired, and all future conveyances and wills relating to them; they are incapable of presenting to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOWSON\">advowson</a>, or granting to any person any avoidance of the same; they may not keep or teach any school, under pain of perpetual imprisonment; and, if they willingly say or hear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, they forfeit the one 200l., the other 100 marks, and each shall suffer a year's imprisonment. Thus much for persons, who, from the misfortune of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> prejudices, or otherwise, have conceived an unhappy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to the Romish church from their infancy, and publicly profess its errors. But if any evil industry is used to rivet these errors upon them; if any person lends another abroad to be educated in the Popish religion, or to reside in any religious house abroad for that purpose, or contributes to their maintenance when there; both the lender, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENT\">lent</a>, and the contributor, are disfavored to sue in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a>, to be executor or administrator to any person, to take any legacy or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a> of gift, and to bear any office in the realm; and shall forfeit all their goods and chattels, and likewise all their real estate for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. And where these errors are also aggravated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOSTASY\">apostasy</a> or perversion; where a person is reconciled to the see of Rome, or procures others to be reconciled, the offence amounts to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a>. 2. Popish recusants, convicted in a court of law of not attending the service of the church of England, are subject to the following disabilities, penalties, and forfeitures, over and above those before mentioned. They are considered as persons excommunicated; they can hold no office or employment; they must not keep arms in their houses, but the same may be seized by the justices of the peace; they may not come within 10 miles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, on pain of 100l.; they can bring no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> at law or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> in equity; they are not permitted to travel above five miles from home, unless by license, upon pain of forfeiting all their goods; and they may not come to court, under pain of 100l. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURIAL\">burial</a> of such recusant, or baptism of his child, shall be had otherwise than by the ministers of the church of England, under other severe penalties. A married woman, when recusant, shall forfeit two-thirds of her dower or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINTURE\">jointure</a>, may not be executrix or administratrix to her husband, or have any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his goods; and during the coverture may be kept in prison, unless her husband redeems her, at the rate of 10l. a month, or the third part of all his lands. And lastly, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVERT\">covert</a> recusant may be imprisoned, so all others must, within three months after conviction, either submit and renounce their errors, or, if required to do by four justices, must abjure and renounce the realm: and if they do not depart, or if they re-\nturn without the king's licence, they shall be guilty of felony, and suffer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> as felons, without benefit of clergy. There is also an inferior species of recusancy, (refusing to make the declaration against Popery enjoined by statute 30 Car. II. c. 2. when tendered by the proper magistrate;) which, if the party resides within ten miles of London, makes him an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> recusant convict; or, if at a greater distance, suspends him from having any seat in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, keeping arms in his house, or any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> above the value of \u00a31. 3. Popish priests are in a still more dangerous condition. By statute 11 & 12 W. III. c. 4. Popish priests, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>, celebrating mass or exercising any part of their functions in England, except in the houses of ambassadors, are liable to perpetual imprisonment. And by the statute 27 Eliz. c. 2. any Popish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>, born in the dominions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of England, who shall come over hither from beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> (unless driven by storms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> and tarrying only a reasonable time), or shall be in England three days without conforming and taking the oaths, is guilty of high treason: and all persons harbouring him are guilty of felony without the benefit of clergy.\n\n\"This is a short summary of the laws against the Papists; of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> Montesquieu observes, that they are so rigorous, though not professedly of the sanguinary kind, that they do all the hurt that can possibly be done in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> blood. But in answer to this, it may be observed (what foreigners who only judge from our statute book are not fully apprized of), that these laws are seldom exerted to their utmost rigour: and indeed, if they were, it would be very difficult to excuse them. For they are rather to be accounted for from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, and the urgency of the times which produced them, than to be approved (upon a cool review) as a standing system of law. The nefarious machinations of the Jesuits during the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, the turbulence and uneasiness of the Papists under the new religious establishment, and the boldness of their hopes and wishes for the succession of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> of Scots, obliged the parliament to counteract so dangerous a spirit by laws of a great, and then perhaps necessary, severity. The powder-treason, in the succeeding reign, struck a panic into James I. which operated in different ways: it occasioned the enacting of new laws against the Papists; but deterred him from putting them in execution. The intrigues of Queen Henrietta in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I., the protest of a Popish successor in that of Charles II., the allusion-plot in the reign of King William, and the avowed claim of a Popish pretender to the crown in subsequent reigns, will account for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of these penalties at those several periods of our history.\"\n\nBut now that all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> fears of a pretender may be said to have vanished, and the power and influence of the pope has become feeble, ridiculous, and despicable, not only in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, but in almost every kingdom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>: and as in fact the British Catholics solemnly disclaim the dangerous principles ascribed to them; the British legislature, giving way to that liberality of sentiment becoming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a>, have lately repealed the most rigorous of the above edicts, viz. The punishment of Popish priests or Jesuits who should be found to teach or officiate in the services of that church; which acts were felony in foreigners, and high treason in the natives of this kingdom:\u2014The forfeitures of Nonconformists heirs, who had received their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> abroad; and whose estates went to the next Protestant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a>:\u2014The power given to the son, or other relation, being a Protestant, to take possession of the father's or other relation's estate, during the life of the real proprietor:\u2014And the debarring Papists from the power of acquiring any legal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> by purchase.\u2014In proposing the repeal of these penalties, it was observed, That, besides that some of them had now ceased to be necessary, others were at all times a disgrace to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>. The imprisonment of a Popish priest for life, only for officiating in the services of his religion, was horrible in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>: And although the mildness of government had hitherto softened the rigour of the law in the practice, it was to be remembered that the Roman Catholic priests constantly lay at the mercy of the basest and most abandoned of mankind\u2014of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> informers; for on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of any of these wretches, the magisterial and judicial powers were of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> bound to enforce all the shameful penalties of the act. Others of these penalties held out the most powerful temptations for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of acts of depravity, at the very thought of which our nature recoils with horror: They seemed calculated to loosen all the bands of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>: to dissolve all civil, moral, and religious obligations and duties, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> the sources of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> felicity, and to annihilate every principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>. The encouragement given to children to lay their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> upon the estates of their parents, and the restriction which bars any man from the honest acquisition of property, need only to be mentioned to excite indignation in an enlightened age.\n\nIn order the better to secure the English established church against perils from nonconformists of all denominations, Infidels, Turks, Jews, Heretics, Papists, and Sectaries, there are, however, two bulwarks erected; called the corporation and test acts: By the former of which, no person can be legally elected to any office relating to the government of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> or corporation, unless, within a twelvemonth before, he has received the sacrament of the Lord's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a> according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> of the church of England; and he is also enjoined to take the oath of allegiance and supremacy at the same time that he takes the oath of office: or, in default of either of these requisites, such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> shall be void. The other, called the test act, directs all officers civil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> to take the oaths and make the declaration against transubstantiation, in any of the king's courts at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a>, or at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> sessions, within six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALENDAR\">calendar</a> months after their admission; and also within the same time to receive the sacrament of the Lord's supper, according to the usage of the church of England, in some public church immediately after divine service and sermon, and to deliver into court a certificate thereof signed by the minister and church warden, and also to prove the same by two credible witnesses; upon forfeiture of \u00a3500l. and disqualification to hold the said office. And of much the same nature with these is the statute 7 Jac. I. c. 2. which permits no persons to be naturalized or restored in blood, but such as undergo a like test: which test having been removed in 1753, in favour of the Jews, was the next session of parliament restored again with some precipitation.\nNon-naturals, in Medicine, so called, because by their abuse they become the causes of diseases.\n\nPhysicians have divided the non-naturals into six classes, viz. the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, meats and drinks, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> and watching, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> and rest, the passions of the mind, the retentions and excretions. See Medicine, passim.\n\nNon-obstante (notwithstanding) a clause frequent in statutes and letters patent, importing a license from the king to do a thing, which at common law might be lawfully done, but being restrained by act of parliament cannot be done without such license.\n\nNon-Pro. See Nolle Prosequi.\n\nNon-Suit, signifies the dropping of a suit or action, or a renouncing thereof by the plaintiff or defendant; which happens most commonly upon the discovery of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in the plaintiff's proceedings when the cause is so far proceeded in, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a> is ready at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> to deliver in their verdict.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NONES\">Nones</a>, (non\u00e6), in the Roman calendar, the fifth day of the months <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a>, February, April, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, August, September, November, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>; and the seventh of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, May, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>, and October. March, May, July, and October, had six days in their nones; because these alone, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the year by Numa, had 31 days apiece, the rest having only 29, and February 30: but when Caesar reformed the year, and made other months contain 31 days, he did not allot them five days of nones.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NONJURORS\">Nonjurors</a>, those who refused to take the oaths to government, and who were in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> under certain incapacities, and liable to certain severe penalties. It can scarcely be said that there are any nonjurors now in the kingdom; and it is well known that all penalties have been removed both from Papists and Protestants, formerly of that denomination, as well in Scotland as in England. The members of the Episcopal church of Scotland have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> been denominated Nonjurors; but perhaps they are now called so improperly, as the ground of their difference from the establishment is more on account of ecclesiastical than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> principles.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NONIUS\">Nonius</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>, in Spanish Nunez, a learned Portuguese, and one of the ablest mathematicians of the 16th century, was born at Alcacer. He was preceptor to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Henry, King Emmanuel's son, and taught the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> in the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COIMBRA\">Coimbra</a>. He published the following works, by which he gained great reputation: 1. De arte Navigandi. 2. Annotations in theorias planetarum Purbachii; which are greatly esteemed. 3. A treatise De Crepulculis. 4. A treatise on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALGEBRA\">Algebra</a>. It is observed in Furetiere's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DICTIONARY\">dictionary</a>, that Peter Nonius, in 1530, first invented the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> of 45 degrees made in every meridian, and that he called them rhumbs in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, and calculated them by spherical triangles. Nonius died in 1577, aged 80.\n\nNonius, the name which was not many years ago given to the common device for subdividing the arcs of quadrants and other astronomical instruments, from the persuasion that it was invented by Nonius or Nunez, of whom some account has been given in the preceding article. The generality of astronomers of the present age transferring the honour of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> from Nunez to Peter Vernier, a native of Franche Comte, have called this method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> by his name. (See Vernier.) Mr Adams, however, in his Geometrical and Geographical Essays, has lately shown that Clevis the Jesuit may dispute the invention with them both. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> seems to be, that Nunez started the idea, Clevis improved it, and Vernier carried it to its present state of perfection. The method of Nunez, described in his treatise De Crepulculis, printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a> 1542, consists in describing within the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a> 45 concentric circles, dividing the outermost into 90 equal parts, the next within into 80, the next into 88, &c. till the innermost was divided into 46 only. On a quadrant thus divided the plumb line or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a> must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> one or other of the circles very near a point of division; whence, by computation, the degrees and minutes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> might be easily ascertained. This method is also described by Nunez in his treatise De arte atque ratione Navigandi, where he would fain persuade himself, that it was not unknown to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>. But as the degrees are thus divided very unequally, and as it is very difficult to attain exactness in the division, especially when the numbers into which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> are to be divided are incomposite (of which there are no less than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a>), the method of diagonals, first published by Thomas Digges, Esq. in a treatise entitled Ayle seu facie mathematicae, printed at London in 1573, and said to be invented by one Richard Chenefler, was substituted in its room. Nonius's method was, however, improved at different times and by different persons; and it must be acknowledged, that if Vernier <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> either the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> or any of the improvements (and there can be little doubt of his having seen them all), his merit is only that of having applied to an useful practical purpose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> invention of another person.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NONNUS\">Nonnus</a>, a Greek poet of the 5th century, and native of Panopolis in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, was the author of an heroic poem in 48 books, entitled Dionysiaca, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAPHRASE\">paraphrase</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a> of St John's Gospel, which may serve as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMENTARY\">commentary</a> upon it.\n\nNonupla, in the Italian music, denotes a quick time, peculiar to jigs. This species of time is otherwise called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of nine times, which requires two falls of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and one rise. There are three sorts of nonupla. 1. Nonupla di semi minim\u00e6, or dupla semifiquarta, thus marked \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), where nine crotchets are to be in the bar, of which four make a semibreve in common time, i.e. in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> stroke fix, and but three up: it is usually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> adagio. 2. Nonupla di crone, or semifiquarta, marked thus \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\), wherein nine quavers make a bar instead of eight in common time, i.e. fix down and three up: it is beat presto. 3. Nonupla di semifiorcione or super feti parte <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NONA\">nona</a>, thus distinguished \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\), in which nine semifiorciones are contained in a bar, whereof sixteen are required in common time, fix down, and three up: it is ordinarily beat prestissimo. Besides these, there are two other species of nonupla, for which see Triple.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOOTKA\">Nootka</a> Sound, or, as it was called by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Cook, King George's Sound, lies in N. Lat. 49\u00b0 33' W. Long. 153\u00b0 12'. It is an entrance or strait to a vast inland sea on the west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, and is said to resemble the Baltic or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a> in Europe. Upon the sea-coast the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> is tolerably high and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>; but within the sound it rises into steep hills, which have an uniform appearance. The trees of which the woods are composed, are the Canadian pine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> cypress,\nNootka Sound.\n\nCypress, and two or three other sorts of pine. In general, the trees grow here with great vigour, and are of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> size. About the rocks and borders of the woods were seen some strawberry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, and raspberry, currant, and gooseberry bushes, all in a flourishing state. The principal animals seen here were raccoons, martens, and squirrels. Birds are far from being numerous, and those that are to be seen are remarkably shy, owing perhaps to their being continually harried by the natives, either to eat them, or to become possessed of their feathers to be worn as ornaments. The quercuslactucifera, thongs, and gulls, were seen off the coast; and the two last were also frequent in the sound. Though the variety of fish is not very great, yet they are in greater quantities than birds. The principal sorts are the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERRING\">herring</a>, a river coloured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-BREAM\">bream</a>, and another of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> colour. Captain Cook and Mr King, who visited this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, consider it as an excellent shelter for ships: and in the account of A Voyage to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PACIFIC_OCEAN\">Pacific Ocean</a>, they give some directions for sailing into it. These and other matters of that kind we shall not trouble our readers with; and perhaps the generality of them will be better pleased with the following extract from Meares's Voyages to the North-west Coast of America.\n\n\"The people of the Nootka <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> are, in general, robust and well-proportioned:\u2014their faces are large and full, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a> high and prominent, with small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> eyes\u2014-their noses are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> and flat, their lips thick, and they have generally very fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, and of the most brilliant whiteness.\n\n\"The manner in which the children of Nootka are treated, when young, is not more extraordinary from its strange, and, as it should appear, total insufficiency, as from its agreement with the customs of the Chinese and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARS\">Tartars</a>, to whom this practice gives these people a considerable resemblance. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the infant is bound by the mother with a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILLET\">fillet</a> of several folds, as low down as the eyes, in order to give it a certain form, which, at this tender age, it is capable of receiving. It might be supposed, that such a tight drawn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGATURE\">ligature</a> must cause considerable pain to the child; but we never observed that any of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a>, in such a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>-loaf heads, suffered any visible pain or inconvenience.\n\n\"Though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of compressing the head in this manner gives them an unpleasing appearance, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> up the eyebrows, and sometimes producing the disagreeable effect of squinting, as well as of flattening the nose and distending the nostrils, they are by no means an ill-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of people. They have also the custom, which is known to prevail in so many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> nations, of plucking out the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a> by the roots, on its first appearance; and, as it continues to sprout, to keep it down by the same practice. It is one of the domestic employments assigned to their wives, to watch this appearance of manhood, and to eradicate the hairs as they come forth; which they do in a very dexterous manner with their fingers, and without giving the least pain in the operation.\u2014Some of them, however, though we saw but very few of this disposition, when they advance in years and become infirm, suffer their beards to grow without interruption. But notwithstanding they have to great an aversion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> of their chin, that of the head is an object of their attentive vanity: it is strong, black, and glossy; grows to a considerable length; and is either tied in a kind of knot on the top of their heads, or suffered to hang down their backs in flowing negligence.\n\n\"In their exterior form they have not the symmetry or elegance which is found in many other Indian nations.\u2014Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, though stout and athletic, are crooked and ill shaped; their skin, when cleansed of filth and ocre, is white; and we have seen some of the women, when in a state of cleanliness (which, however, was by no means a common sight, and obtained with difficulty), who not only possessed the fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> of Europe, but features that would have attracted notice, for their delicacy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, in those parts of the world where the qualities of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> form are best understood. But these examples of beauty are by no means numerous among the women of Nootka, who are calculated rather to disgust than to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARM\">charm</a> an European beholder. Their hair, like that of the men, is black; their eyes are of the same colour; and, in exterior appearance, they are not to be immediately distinguished from the men. In their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> they are reserved and chaste; and examples of loose and immoral conduct were very rare among them. There were women in St George's Sound, whom no offers could tempt to meretricious submissions.\"\n\nAll reports concerning Nootka Sound agree in characterizing the inhabitants as \"a very motile race of people.\"\u2014Inoffensive, however, as they are, a custom of a very unnatural, and we should imagine cruel, kind prevails among them: for, together with many other articles which they exposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> to Captain Cook's ships, they brought human skulls and hands (part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> still remaining on them), which they acknowledged they had been feeding on; and some of them, we are told, had evident marks of the fire.\n\nFrom hence it is too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>, that the horrid practice of devouring their enemies exists here as well as at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-NEW_ZEALAND\">New <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZEALAND\">Zealand</a> and other South Sea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>: and hence, too, appears what men of even the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> dispositions will be, if left entirely to the freedom of their own will, without law to control or religion to instruct them. As there are but two villages of the Sound inhabited, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of people cannot be many; perhaps they are about 2000 in all. Our limits prevent us from being so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> as we could wish to be, respecting the form of their houses and their manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> them; of their furniture, decorations, and other things of that kind: we can therefore only refer those who wish for further information on this subject to Cook, and other voyagers and travellers, &c.\n\nThe employment of the men is chiefly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a>, &c., whilst the women manufacture their garments. Their ingenuity in this and in the mechanic arts is far from being inconsiderable; and in the imitative arts their skill is very great. On these subjects, however, we cannot enlarge: we have in general made it our business, and it certainly is our duty, to dwell, where it can be done, on the manners or religion of the inhabitants of the several places which come under our notice; and they who know the utility of this in developing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> of the human mind, the most important of all sciences, will not blame our intentions, even if they should not approve of the execution. In Cook's\nCook's Voyages before referred to, we find the following observations on the religion and language of the inhabitants of Nootka Sound.\n\n\"Little knowledge we can be supposed to have acquired of the political and religious institutions established among these people. We discovered, however, that there were such men as chiefs, distinguished by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Acweeke, to whom the others are, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, subordinate. But the authority of each of these great men seems to extend no farther than to his own family, who acknowledge him as their head. As they were not all elderly men, it is possible this title may be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a>.\n\n\"Nothing that we saw could give us any insight into their notions of religion, except the figures already mentioned, called Kuma. These, perhaps, were idols; but as the word Acweeke was frequently mentioned when they spoke of them, we may suppose them to be the images of some of their ancestors, whose memories they venerate. This, however, is all conjecture; for we could receive no information concerning them; knowing little more of their language than to enable us to ask the names of things, and being incapable of holding any conversation with the natives relative to their traditions or their institutions.\n\n\"Their language is neither harsh nor disagreeable, farther than proceeds from their pronouncing the k and h with less softness than we do. As to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of their language, we are enabled to say but little. It may, however, be inferred from their flow and distinct method of speaking, that it has few prepositions or conjunctions, and is destitute of even a single interjection to express surprise or admiration. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> it may bear to other languages, we have not been able sufficiently to trace, not having proper specimens to compare it with; but from the few Mexican words we have procured, there is an obvious agreement throughout the language, in the frequent terminations of the words in l, ll or x.\n\n\"The word waka/b was frequently in the mouths of the people of Nootka. It seemed to express approbation, applause, and friendship. Whenever they appeared to be pleased or satisfied at any sight or occurrence, they would call out waka/b! waka/b!\u2014It is worthy of remark, that these people do essentially differ from the natives of the islands in the Pacific ocean, in their persons, customs, and language, we cannot suppose their respective progenitors to have belonged to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a>, when they emigrated into those places where we now find their descendants.\"\n\nWe cannot finish this article without taking notice of a circumstance, which at the time made a great noise in Europe, and which it is probable will find a place in the future histories of the contending countries.\n\nA small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> of British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> resident in the East Indies had, early in the year 1786, formed the project of opening a trade to this part of the world, for the purpose of supplying the Chinese market with furs. The principal point towards which these expeditions were directed, was Port Nootka, or King George's Sound; and the adventurers, being in some degree satisfied with their traffic, took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, in the year 1788, to secure to themselves a permanent settlement; at the same time that the shipping employed in this expedition was generally two, and never exceeded the amount of four, small vessels. The Spaniards conceived some jealousy of the intrusion of the English into a part of the world which they had long been desirous to regard as their exclusive property; and accordingly a Spanish frigate of 26 guns was despatched from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a>, for the purpose of putting an end to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>. The Spanish frigate arrived in May 1789, and captured two English vessels in the following July, at the same time taking possession of the little settlement which had been formed upon the coast. Such, in short, is the circumstance which was likely to involve us in an expensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>. Happily, however, for both countries, and perhaps for Europe, the matter was at length, after great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERCATION\">altercation</a>, amicably settled; and it must still be so fresh in the memories of our readers, that we trust they will excuse us from enlarging further upon it\u2014the whole article having extended perhaps to more than a sufficient length.","sp":46,"ep":53},{"h":"NOPAL","t":"RAQUETTE, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> fig; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> so named by the Indians, on which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COCHINEAL\">cochineal</a> insect breeds in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a>.

The Bure abounds in excellent perch, and the Yare has a fish peculiar to it called the ruffe. The latter rises about the middle of the county; and after being joined by the Waveney and Bure, falls into the sea at Yarmouth. At the equinoxes, especially the autumnal, the Ouse is subject to great inundations, being forced back by the sea, that enters it with great fury. This county was famous at a very early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">fisheries</a>, which were extensive and valuable, and seem to have been carried on with spirit.

This conclusion is formed from the vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of pumice <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> which is scattered in all parts of it, and mixed with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRATER\">crater</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> at least some traces of its former existence, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> probably be found at the summit of a small mountain, which rises...\"\nrises near the middle of the island. To this mountain the commandant has given the name of Mount Pitt. The island is exceedingly well watered. At or near Mount Pitt rises a strong and copious stream, which flowing through a very fine valley, divides itself into several branches, each of which retains sufficient force to be used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a>; and in various parts of the island <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> have been discovered.\n\n\"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> is pure, salubrious, and delightful; preserved from oppressive heats by constant breezes from the sea, and of so mild a temperature throughout the winter, that vegetation continues there without interruption, one crop succeeding another. Refreshing showers from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to time maintain perpetual verdure; not indeed of grass, for none has yet been seen upon the island; but of the trees, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>, and other vegetables, which in all parts grow abundantly. On the leaves of these, and of some kinds in particular, the sheep, hogs, and goats, not only live, but thrive and fatten very much. To the salubrity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> every individual in this little colony can bear ample testimony, from the uninterrupted state of good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> which has been, in general, enjoyed.\n\n\"When our settlers landed, there was not a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a> clear of wood in the island, and the trees were so bound together by that kind of creeping shrub called supple jack, interwoven in all directions, as to render it very difficult to penetrate far among them. The commandant, small as his numbers were at first, by indefatigable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> soon caused a space to be cleared sufficient for the requisite accommodations, and for the production of excellent vegetables of all kinds in the greatest abundance. When the last accounts arrived, three acres of barley were in a very thriving state, and ground was prepared to receive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> corn. In the wheat there had been a disappointment, the grain that was sown having been so much injured by the weevil as to be unfit for vegetation. But the people were all at that time in commodious houses; and, according to the declarations of Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> himself, in his letters to Governor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a>, there was not a doubt that this colony would be in a situation to support itself entirely without assistance in less than four years; and with very little in the intermediate time. Even two years would be more than sufficient for this purpose, could a proper supply of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> cattle be sent.\n\n\"Fish are caught in great plenty, and in the proper season very fine turtle. The woods are inhabited by innumerable tribes of birds, many of them very gay in plumage. The most useful are pigeons, which are very numerous; and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> not unlike the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUINEA\">Guinea</a> fowl, except in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> (being chiefly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>), both of which were at first so tame as to suffer themselves to be taken by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>.

This, it is hoped, by transplanting and care, will be much improved in size and flavour.\n\n\"But the productions which give the greatest importance to Norfolk Island are the pines and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a> plant; the former rising to a size and perfection unknown in other places, and promising the most valuable supply of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASTS\">masts</a> and spars for our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a> in the East Indies; the latter not less estimable for the purposes of making sailcloth, cordage, and even the finest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>, growing in great plenty, and with such luxuriance as to attain the height of eight feet. The pines <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> frequently 160, or even 180 feet in height, and are sometimes 9 or 10 feet in diameter at the bottom of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a>. They rise to about 80 feet without a branch: the wood is said to be of the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, almost as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> as that of the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a> masts; and the turpentine obtained from it is remarkable for purity and whiteness. The fern tree is found also of a great height for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, measuring from 70 to 80 feet, and affords excellent food for the sheep and other small cattle. A plant producing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>, and supposed to be the true oriental pepper, has been discovered lately in the island, growing in great plenty; and specimens have been sent to England in order to ascertain this important point.\"\n\nNorfolk <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">Sound</a>, according to the account of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> George Dixon, is situated in 57\u00b0 3' <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> latitude, and 135\u00b0 36' west longitude. It is a very extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, but how far it stretches to the northward is not known.

The shore, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> with the rest of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, abounds with pines; there are also great quantities of the witch hazel. There are various kinds of flowering trees and shrubs, wild gooseberries, currants, and raspberries; wild parsley is found here in great plenty, and it eats excellently either as a salad or boiled amongst soup. The faramee, or wild lily root, grows also in great plenty and perfection.

The buckets have a lateral office to receive and to discharge the water. The axis of this wheel is embraced by four small beams, crossing each other at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, tapering at the extremities, and forming eight little arms. This wheel is near the centre of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> walk, contiguous to the vertical axis, into the top of which the horse beam is fixed; but near the bottom it is embraced by four little beams, forming eight arms similar to those above described, on the axis of the water wheel.

He did not disappoint his superior's expectations. He gave himself up entirely to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, and spent whole days, and even nights, in the library of the Angeliques of St Augustine. His constant course was to stick to his books 14 hours a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; and this course he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till he became a cardinal. By this means he became qualified to instruct others; and on this errand he was sent first to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERUGIA\">Perugia</a>, and thence to Perugia, where he took his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>; after which, proceeding to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PADUA\">Padua</a>, he applied himself to finish his History of Pelagianism.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> had procured him a great reputation, but met with several antagonists, to whom he published proper answers; the dispute grew warm, and was carried before the sovereign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INQUISITION\">inquisition</a>. There the history was examined with the utmost rigour, and the author dismissed without the least censure. It was reprinted twice afterwards, and Mr Noris honoured by Pope Clement X. with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Qualifier of the Holy Office. Notwithstanding this, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> was renewed against the Pelagian History, and it was dilated afresh before the inquisition in 1676; but it came out again with the same success as at first. Mr Noris was now suffered to remain in peace for fifteen years, and taught ecclesiastical history at Pifa, without any molestation, till he was called to Rome by Innocent XII. who made him under-librarian of the Vatican in 1692. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> was the way to a cardinal's hat; his accusers, therefore, took fresh fire, and published several new pieces against him. Hence the Pope appointed some learned divines, who had the character of having taken neither side, to re-examine Father Noris's books, and make their report of them. Their testimony was so advantageous to the author, that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a> made him counsellor of the inquisition. Yet neither did this hinder one of his adversaries, the most formidable on account of his erudition, to rise up against him, and attack him warmly, under the assumed title of a Scrupulous Doctor of the Sorbonne. Noris tried to remove these scruples in a work which appeared in 1695, under the title of An Historical Dissertation concerning one of the Trinity that suffered in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">Flesh</a>; wherein, having justified the monks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCYTHIA\">Scythia</a>, who made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, he vindicated himself also from the imputation of having attacked the Pope's infallibility, of having abused Vincentius Lirinensis, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a>, as favourers of Semi-Pelagianism, and of having himself gone into the errors of the bishop of Ypres.\n\nHis answers to all these accusations were so much to the satisfaction of the pope, that at length his holiness honoured him with the purple in 1695. After this, he was in all the congregations, and employed in the most important affairs; so that he had little time to spend in his study, a thing of which he frequently complained to his friends. Upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Cardinal Catanati, he was made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> library keeper of the Vatican in 1700; and two years afterwards nominated, among others, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALENDAR\">calendar</a>: but he died at Rome in 1704 of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DROPSY\">dropsy</a>. He was one of the most learned men in the last century: his writings abound with erudition, and are very elegantly finished. He was a member of the Academy; whence he assumed the name of Eucrates Agoreto. His works are numerous, and were published at Verona, in 1729 and 1730, in five volumes folio.","sp":56,"ep":57},{"h":"NORKOPING","t":"a town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of East Gothland, in east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> 15\u00b0 30', latitude 58\u00b0 20'.

The late earl succeeded his father August 4, 1790. His lordship succeeded the celebrated Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Townend as manager of the house of commons and chancellor of the exchequer; and in 1779, on the resignation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Grafton, was made first lord of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>; in which office he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> until the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> rather until the formation of the Rockingham ministry, which began the business of peace with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>. He was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of strong mental faculties; and as an orator, at once commanded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> and enforced conviction; but taking the helm at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s party were unpopular, and when it was supposed that the late earl of Bute was the great machine by which the cabinet was moved, so he continued in that state of unpopularity until he resigned the seals. During the whole of his premiership (and to conduct the helm at that time required uncommonly great abilities) he studiously avoided imposing any taxes that should materially affect the lower class of people. The luxuries, and not the necessaries, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> were repeated objects of his budget. As a financier, he stood <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, even in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of opposition; and they were a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of all the great talents in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>: but, fatally wedded to the destructive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of subduing the republican spirit of the Americans, his administration <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not only stand marked in the page of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> with an immense waste of public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a>, but it will appear bejewelled with the kindred blood of thousands of British subjects. To the very last moment he spoke in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>, however; he defended that war; and said, he was then, as he was formerly, prepared to meet the minutest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> as to his conduct in that business; which nothing but the unforeseen intervention of France could have prevented from being crowned with success.

He died on the 6th of August 1792. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a> he retained to his last moments: his family, except Lord North, who came within a few minutes afterwards, were assembled round his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, and he took leave of them individually.

They joined the procession at Magdalen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">Bridge</a>, and paraded on foot before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> up the high street to Carfax; from thence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the corn market to St Giles's church at the town's end, in a most solemn manner.

The person who had the honour to conceive this idea was Robert Thorne, a merchant of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a>, who addressed two papers on the subject, the one to King Henry VIII., the other to Dr Ley, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> from that monarch to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Charles V. To remove any objection to the undertaking, which might be drawn from the supposed danger, he insists, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> to the king, upon the great advantages of constant daylight in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLAR_SEAS\">polar seas</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> being in those regions temperate during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> months. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> addressed to Dr Ley, he observes that cosmographers may as probably be mistaken in the opinion which they entertain of the polar regions being impassable from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, as it has been found they were in supposing the countries under the line to be uninhabitable from excessive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>.\n\nThe possibility of the passage was, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of these addresses, very generally supposed; and in 1557, Sir Martin Frobisher failed to 62\u00b0 north latitude, where he discovered the straits which have since borne his name. In 1577, Barne, in a book entitled the *Regiment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">Sea</a>*, mentions a north-west passage as one of the five ways to Cathay; and dwells on the mildness of the climate, which, from the constant presence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> during summer, he imagines must be found near the pole. In 1578, George Best, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> who had been with Sir Martin Frobisher in his voyages of discovery, wrote a very ingenious discourse to prove all parts of the world habitable. It does not, however, appear that any voyage was undertaken, for the express purpose of attempting to fail to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> in a north-west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, till the year 1607, when Henry Hudson was sent, at the expense of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> in London to discover a passage by the north pole to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAPAN\">Japan</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>. He failed from Graveend on the 1st of May, and on the 21st of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> fell in with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> to the westward, in latitude 73\u00b0, which he named *Hold-with-hope*. On the 27th he discovered Spitzbergen, and met with much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>. The highest latitude in which he made an observation was 80\u00b0 27'. See HUDSON.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1609, Jones Poole was sent by Sir Thomas Smith, and the rest of the Muscovy Company, to make further discoveries towards the north pole. After great severity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, and much difficulty from ice, he made the fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Spitzbergen on the 16th of May; and failing along and founding the coast, he made many accurate discoveries; but was not in that voyage able to proceed beyond 79\u00b0 50'. He was again employed (1611), in a small vessel called the *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>*, to attempt the north-west passage; but after surmounting numberless difficulties, and penetrating to 80\u00b0 of latitude, he lost his ship at Spitzbergen. Two voyages, equally unsuccessful, were made in 1614 and 1615, by Baffin and Fotherby; the latter of whom concludes the account of his discoveries and dangers, with exhorting the company which employed him not to adventure more than \u00a350l. or \u00a3200l. at most on yearly voyages to these seas.\n\nHitherto nothing had been done in this great undertaking; but by private adventurers, fitted out for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> purpose of discovery and present advantage; and the polar regions were suffered to remain unexplored in that direction, from the year 1615 till 1773, when the earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDWICH\">Sandwich</a>, in consequence of an application which had been made to him by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>, laid before his majesty a proposal for an expedition to try how far <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> is practicable towards the north pole. Upon receiving this proposal, his majesty was pleased to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> that the voyage should be immediately undertaken, with every assistance that could contribute to its success. Accordingly, the Racehorse and Carcass bombs were fitted out for the purpose, and the command of the expedition given to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Phipps, now Lord Mulgrave. His Lordship's instructions were to proceed up to the pole, or as far towards it as possible, and as nearly upon a meridian as the ice or other obstructions should admit; and during the course of the voyage, to make such observations...\nNorth-westerns of every kind as might be useful to navigation, or tend to the promotion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> knowledge. A very accurate account of this voyage was published by his Lordship in 1774. He had, by exerting all the powers of a skilful and intrepid seaman, forced his way, on the 1st of August, to 80\u00b0 37\u2032; but could proceed no farther, as he was there opposed by one continued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of smooth unbroken ice, bounded only by the horizon.\n\nMany other attempts have been made to discover this passage, by sailing along the western coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>; but hitherto none of them has been crowned with success. So early as 1579, Sir Francis Drake assured Queen Elizabeth that he had sailed some leagues up the straits of Anian (see ANIAN), and discovered New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBION\">Albion</a>, to the north of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALIFORNIA\">California</a>; but the strait is now known to have no existence; and Drake's real discoveries were not improved. In 1638, King Charles I. sent Captain Luke Fox in one of his pinnaces to attempt the passage; but of his proceedings we know nothing, but that he reached Port Nelson in Hudson's bay, where he found some remains of former navigators. Next year Captain James was fitted out by the merchants of Bristol for the same purpose. James was one of the ablest navigators that ever sailed from England or any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; and his voyages to the north were printed in 1633. After all the experiments he had made, he concluded that there was no such passage; or if there be, he affirmed that the discovery of it would not be attended with those advantages which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> expected. His reasons, however, for these opinions have been answered, and many subsequent attempts have been made to perform what he thought impossible. The arguments for a north-west passage were so plausible, that, in 1744, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> was passed to encourage the discovery of it. Among many others, Captain Cook attempted the discovery in vain, and thence adopted James's opinion. (See COOKE'S Discoveries, No. 153.) This celebrated navigator, after having proceeded northwards to the western extremity of America, and ascertained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROXIMITY\">proximity</a> of the two great continents of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> and America, returned to the Sandwich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, firmly persuaded of the impracticability of a passage in that hemisphere from the Atlantic into the Pacific ocean, either by an eastern or a western course.\n\nLater voyagers, however, have pretended to detect some errors in Cooke's discoveries; and the author of a small tract, entitled An authentic Statement of all the Facts relative to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOOTKA\">Nootka</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">Sound</a>, goes a great way to make the discovery not yet hopeless. In his account of the expedition under the direction of Mr. Etches, he says, that \"one of the first discoveries made by these ships was, that what was by the immortal Cook laid down as a continuation of the north-west continent of America, and lying between the northern latitudes of 48\u00b0 and 57\u00b0, is on the contrary an extensive cluster of unexplored islands inhabited by numerous tribes of friendly Indians, with whom a regular connexion was formed.\"\n\nThese islands they discovered, contrary to the assertion of Captain Cook, to conceal the opening of a vast inland sea, or archipelago, in all probability equal to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a> or Baltic seas, and dividing the great northern continent of America. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a>'s Royal penetrated some hundred leagues among them, in a north-east course, to within 200 leagues of Hudson's house, but had not then an opportunity to explore the North-east extreme termination of that archipelago, their commercial concerns obliging them to return to the China market; but the commanders had the strongest reasons to believe, had the time favoured their survey, that they should have been able to discover the long wished for passage between the Atlantic and South Sea. They conceived, that should neither the inland arm of the sea through which the Prince's Royal penetrated, nor a large strait named Sir Charles Middleton's about three degrees to the southward, be found to reach across the continent, yet that the land <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> must be very inconsiderable; and that at the extremity of this bay a practicable passage, either by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, will, by perseverance, be found terminating towards Hudson's bay.\n\nThe last attempt to discover this passage was made by Vancouver between the years 1790 and 1795; but the result of this voyage renders the existence of such a passage still more doubtful.\n\nUpon the whole, however, it appears to us extremely doubtful whether there be such a passage; but it is much more likely to be discovered, if discovered at all, by the progressive advances of mercantile enterprise than by any immediate expedition undertaken for that purpose.","sp":58,"ep":60},{"h":"NORTH ROCKS","t":"(otherwise called St Patrick's rocks, from a seat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> amongst them called St Patrick's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a>, whence the rocks have taken this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> name;) situated in the harbour of Donaghadee, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">Down</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Ulster, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>.

The first attempt was made in 1553, by Sir Hugh Willoughby, who commanded three ships. He departed from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a> and sailed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a>, where one of his ships left him, and returned home.

But Richard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">Chancellor</a>, in the third ship, with better success, in the meanwhile entered Wardhuys, where he waited some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> for his companions to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> purpose; uncertain whether they were lost, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> driven farther by treas of weather. He held a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> on what he should do; whether to return, or pursue his voyage. Whatever danger might be in the last, every one agreed to it, that they might not seem to have less courage than their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>. They therefore set sail, and in a few days found themselves in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> where they could no longer perceive any night. This ship, wandering about, entered soon after into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a>.

He followed, and, overtaking them, showed them such civilities as conciliated their affections to him; and they carried him to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where now is the famous port of St Michael the Archangel. These people immediately spread through all the coasts an account of the arrival of those strangers; and people came from several parts to see them, and ask them questions.

To enumerate all the attempts which have been made to discover a north-east passage, would swell the article to very little purpose. The English, Dutch, and Danes, have all attempted it without success. The last voyage from England for this purpose was made in 1676, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>. That unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, who was on all occasions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> for the promotion of commerce, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Berkeley, &c., fitted out a ship, commanded by Captain Wood, for an attempt once more to find a north-east passage to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, accompanied with a ship of the king's. They were encouraged to this attempt, after it had been so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> despised of, by several new reports and reasonings: some of which seem not to have been very well grounded\u2014As,\n\n\"1. On the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COREA\">Corea</a>, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAPAN\">Japan</a>, whales had been found with English and Dutch harpoons sticking in them. This is no infallible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that ships could get thither by a north-east passage, although whales might.\n\n\"2. That, 20 years before, some Dutchmen had sailed within one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of the north pole, and found it temperate weather there: and that therefore William Barents, the Dutch navigator who wintered at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol16.html#article-NOVA_ZEMBLA\">Nova Zembla</a> in the year 1596, should have failed further to the north before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> eastward; in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, said they, he would not have found to much obstruction from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>.\n\n\"3. That two Dutch ships had lately sailed 300 leagues to the eastward of Nova Zembla; but their East India Company had stifled that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, as against their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>:\u2014and such like other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIRY\">airy</a> reports. But this attempt proved very unfortunate. They doubled the North Cape, and came among much ice and drift wood, in 76\u00b0 of north latitude, steering to the coast of Nova Zembla, where the king's ship struck upon the rocks, and was soon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> to pieces; and Captain Wood returned home with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, \"that such a passage was utterly impracticable, and that Nova Zembla is a part of the continent of Greenland.\"\n\nThese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>, however, are not yet deemed impracticable by all. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> de Buffon holds it for certain, that there is a passage from Europe to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a> by the North sea. The reason why it has been so often attempted in vain, he thinks, is, that fear prevented the undertakers from keeping at a sufficient distance from land, and from approaching the pole, which they probably imagined to be an immense rock. Hence he affirms, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> any farther attempts be made to find a passage to China and Japan by the north seas, it will be necessary to keep at a distance from the land and the ice; to steer directly towards the pole; and to explore the most open seas, where unquestionably, says he, there is little or no ice. This opinion has been lately revived by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> Daines Barington, who says, that if the passage be attempted by the pole itself, he has very little doubt of its being accomplished.

These, he thinks, become rarefied, and being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with electrical fluid, become specifically <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> than the circumambient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; hence, of course, they ascend; and being elevated to the upper regions of the air, and driven by the winds from warmer to colder climates, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> makes them combine and stiffen. When they are afterwards agitated by different currents of air, they sparkle and crackle like the hairs of cats and other animals when stiffened with cold. This concretion in quite cold atmospheres, and in those which are more temperate, appears in different positions in the horizon, zenith, or otherwise, according to the situation of the spectator, and the position of the elevated exhalations. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of colours the doctor supposes to arise from the different qualities of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> combined, those of the most inflammable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> shining with the greatest lustre.\n\nThe doctor likewise tries to account for these lights not appearing, or but seldom appearing, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> times.

This county, which gives\ngives the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> to a nobleman who married the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Algernon duke of Somerset, whose mother was heiress of the Percy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, extends about 66 miles in length from north to south, and about 47 in breadth from east to west. It is remarkably populous, containing 12 market <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, 280 villages, and 460 parishes. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, especially towards the west, is roughened with huge <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, the most remarkable of which are the Cheviot hills, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> ridge called Redesdale; but the lands are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> side and the borders of Durham. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, like that of every other mountainous country in the neighbourhood of the sea, is moist and disagreeable: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, however, is pure and healthy, as being well ventilated by breezes and strong gales of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>; and in winter mitigated by the warm vapours from the two seas, the Irish and the German ocean, between which it is situated. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> varies in different parts of the county. Among the hills it is barren; though it affords good pasture for sheep, which cover those mountains. The low country, when properly cultivated, produces plenty of wheat, and all sorts of grain; and great part of it is laid out in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEADOW\">meadow</a> lands and rich enclosures. Northumberland is well watered with many rivers, rivulets, and fountains: its greatest rivers are the Tweed and the Tyne. The Tyne is composed of two streams called South and North Tyne: the first rises on the verge of Cumberland, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTON\">Alton</a> moor; enters Northumberland, running north to Haltwhistle; then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENDS\">bends</a> easterly, and receiving the two small rivers East and West Alon, unites above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEXHAM\">Hexham</a> with the other branch, taking its rise at a mountain called Fane-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> in the western part of the county, thence called Tyne-dale; is swollen in its course by the little river Shele; joins the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEES\">Tees</a> near Billingham; and running in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> line to the south-east, is united with the southern Tyne, forming a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> river that washes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEWCASTLE\">Newcastle</a>, and falls into the German ocean near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TYNEMOUTH\">Tynemouth</a>.\n\nIn all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> the mountains of Northumberland contain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> ore, and other mineralized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> in their bowels, as they in all respects resemble those parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a> and Scotland where lead <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> have been found and prosecuted. Perhaps the inhabitants are diverted from inquiries of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, by the certain profits and constant employment they enjoy in working the coal pits, with which this county abounds. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, and the greatest part of England, are supplied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> from these stores of Northumberland, which are inexhaustible, enrich the proprietors, and employ an incredible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> and shipping. About 658,958 chaldrons are annually shipped for London.\n\nThere are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> woods of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> in this county; but many plantations belonging to the seats of noblemen and gentlemen, of which here is a great number. As for pot herbs, roots, saladings, and every article of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a> garden and orchard, they are here raised in great plenty by the usual means of cultivation; as are also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of more delicate flavour, such as the apricot, peach, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECTARINE\">nectarine</a>. The spontaneous fruits it produces in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> with other parts of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, are the crab-apple, the sloe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> bullace, the hazel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a>, the acorn, hips, and haws, with the berries of the bramble, the juniper, wood strawberries, cranberries, and bilberries.\n\nNorthumberland raises a good number of excellent horses and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> cattle, and affords pasture for numerous flocks of sheep; both the cattle and sheep are of a large breed, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a> is coarser than that which the more southern counties produce. The hills and mountains abound with a variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAME\">game</a>, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> deer, foxes, hares, rabbits, heathcock, grouse, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTRIDGE\">partridge</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-QUAIL\">quail</a>, plover, teal, and woodcock: indeed, this is counted one of the best sporting counties in Great Britain. The sea and rivers are well stocked with fish; especially the Tweed, in which a vast number of salmon is caught and carried to Tynemouth, where being pickled, they are conveyed by sea to London, and sold under the name of Newcastle salmon.\n\nThe Northumbrians were anciently stigmatized as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a>, barbarous people, addicted to cruelty, and inclined to rapine. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> is, before the union of the two crowns of England and Scotland, the borderers on each side were extremely licentious and ungovernable, trained up to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> from their infancy, and habituated to plunder by the mutual incursions made into each kingdom; incursions which neither truce nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> could totally prevent. People of a pacific disposition, who professed to earn their livelihood by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, would not on any terms remain in a country exposed to the first violence of a bold and desperate enemy; therefore the lands lay uncultivated, and in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> deserted by every body but lawless adventurers, who subsisted by theft and rapine. There was a tract 50 miles in length and six in breadth, between Berwick and Carlisle, known by the name of the debatable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, to which both nations laid claim, though it belonged to neither; and this was occupied by a set of banditti who plundered on each side, and what they stole in one kingdom, they sold openly in the other: nay, they were so dexterous in their occupation, that by means of hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> applied to the horns of the cattle which they stole, they twisted them in such a manner, that, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> owners <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> them in the market, they did not know their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>. Wardens were appointed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> the marches or borders in each kingdom; and these offices were always conferred on noblemen of the first character for influence, valour, and integrity. The English border was divided into three marches, called the east, west, and middle marches; the gentlemen of the country were constituted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a> wardens, who held <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> courts, regulated the watches, disciplined the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a>, and took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> for assembling them in arms at the first alarm: but in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of peace between the two nations, they were chiefly employed in suppressing the insolence and rapine of the borderers. Since the union of the crowns, however, Northumberland is totally changed, both with respect to the improvement of the lands, and the reformation of the inhabitants. The grounds, being now secure from incursion and insult, are settled by creditable farmers, and cultivated like other parts of the kingdom. As hostilities have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> ceased, the people have forgotten the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of arms; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> themselves in the more eligible avocations of peace, in breeding sheep and cattle, manuring the grounds, working at the coal pits, and in different branches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> and manufacture. In their persons they are generally tall, strong, bold, hardy, and fresh coloured; and though less polished than their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, not quite so civilized as their southern\nNorthwick's northern neighbours. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONALTY\">commonalty</a> are well fed, lodged, and clothed; and all of them remarkably distinguished by a kind of shibboleth or whurle, being a particular way of pronouncing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> R, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they hawked it up from the windpipe, like the cawing of rooks. In other respects, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> they speak is an uncoast mixture of the English and Scottish dialects. There is no material distinction between the fashionable people of Northumberland and those of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> in other parts of the kingdom; the same form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> produce the same effects in all countries. The gentlemen of Northumberland, however, are distinguished for their industry, knowledge of rural affairs, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a>. The number of inhabitants is reckoned 157,101; of houses 22,740.\n\nA great number of Roman monuments have been found in this county; but the most remarkable curiosity of that kind consists in the remains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HADRIAN\">Hadrian</a>'s wall and the wall of Severus. See ADRIAN, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> (A), and SEVERUS'S WALL.\n\nThe most noted towns in Northumberland, are Newcastle, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MORPETH\">Morpeth</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALNWICK\">Alnwick</a>, Berwick, Hexham, and North Shields.

In the southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Norway, the country is craggy, abrupt, and mountainous, diversified sometimes with fertile and even delightful spots.

The range of the thermometer is of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> having risen to 88\u00b0, and in the winter fallen to \u201440\u00b0: in general it is between 80\u00b0 and \u201422\u00b0.\n\nRespecting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of Norway it is difficult to attain to certainty. An author of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> (Coxe) seems to think it amounts to 750,000; but he appears to have over-rated it considerably.\n\nThe Norwegian peasants are free, well clothed, well lodged, spirited, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>, frank, open, and undaunted. They are said to have a very considerable resemblance to the peasants of Switzerland. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is too thin for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a>: corn is therefore obtained from the neighbouring flats; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> employment of the peasants of Norway is grazing. The following extract from Mr Coxe, being a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> near Christiana, is not beside our purpose, and may not perhaps be disagreeable to our readers.\n\n\"As we approached Christiana, the country was more wild and hilly, but still very fertile and agreeable; and about two miles from the town we came to the top of a mountain, and burst upon as fine a view as ever I beheld. From the point on which we stood in raptures, the grounds laid out in rich enclosures, gradually sloped to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>; below us appeared Christiana, situated at the extremity of an extensive and fertile valley, forming a semicircular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> along the shore of a most beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>, which, being enclosed by hills, uplands, and forests, had the appearance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> lake. Behind, before, and around, the inland mountains of Norway rose on mountains covered with dark forests of pines and fir, the inexhaustible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> of the north. The most distant summits were capped with eternal snow. From the glow of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, the warmth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, the variety of the productions, and the mild beauties of the adjacent scenery, I could scarcely believe that I was nearly in the 60th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of northern latitude.\"\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Norway, extending above 300 leagues, is studded with a multitude of small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, affording habitation to fishermen and pilots, and pasture to a few cattle. They form an infinite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of narrow channels, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> of rocks, which renders Norway inaccessible to the naval power of its enemies.\nAttempts of this kind are the more dangerous, as the shore is generally bold, steep, and impeding; so that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to the rocks the depth of the sea amounts to 100, 200, or 300 fathoms. The perils of the north sea are moreover increased by sudden storms, sunk rocks, violent currents, and dreadful whirlpools. The most remarkable vortex on this coast is called Mofkoe-fjord, from the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> Mofkoe, belonging to the district of Lofoten in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NORDLAND\">Nordland</a>. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>, the stream runs up between Lofoden and Mofkoe with the most boisterous rapidity; but in its ebb to the sea, it roars like a thousand cataracts, so as to be heard at the distance of many leagues. The surface exhibits different vortices; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> in one of these any ship or vessel is absorbed, it is whirled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the bottom, and dashed in pieces against the rocks. These violent whirlpools continue without intervals, except for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, at high and low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, in calm weather; for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> gradually returns as the flood or ebb advances. When its fury is heightened by a storm, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> vessel ought to venture within a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> of it. Whales have been frequently absorbed within the vortex, and howled and bellowed hideously in their fruitless endeavours to disengage themselves. A bear, in attempting to swim from Lofoten to Mofkoe, was once hurled into this whirlpool, from whence he struggled in vain for deliverance, roaring so loud as to be heard on shore; but notwithstanding all his efforts, he was borne down and destroyed. Large trees being absorbed by the current are sucked down, and rise again all shattered into splinters. There are three vortices of the same kind near the islands of Ferroe.\n\nNorway is divided into the four governments of Aggerhus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERGEN\">Bergen</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRONTHEIM\">Drontheim</a>, and Wardhus, besides that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAHUS\">Bahus</a>, which is now subject to Sweden. The province of Aggerhus comprehends the south-east part of Norway, extending in length about 300 miles. Its chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> are Christiana, the see of a bishop, suffragan to the metropolitan see of Drontheim, where the sovereign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> is held, in presence of the viceroy and the governor of the province; Aggerhus, about 15 miles to the south-west of Christiana; Fredericksthall or Frederikstad, in the siege of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> XII. of Sweden lost his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; Saltzberg, Tonberg, Alleen, Hammar, and Hollen.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of Bergen lies in the most southerly and westerly part of Norway, including the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of the same name, which is an episcopal see, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of considerable trade; and Staffanger, situated in the bay of Buckenfor, about 80 miles to the southward of Bergen. The third province, called Drontheim or Trondheim, extends about 500 miles along the coast; and is but thinly peopled. The chief town, Drontheim, seated on a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> at the mouth of the river Nider, is the only metropolitan see in Norway; and carries on a considerable trade in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASTS\">masts</a>, deals, tar, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>. Leetfrund, Stronden, Scoerdale, Opdal, Romildal, and Solendael, are likewise places of some traffic. The northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of Drontheim, called the sub-government of Salten, comprehends the towns Melanger and Scheen. The province of Wardhus, extending to the North Cape, and including the islands, is divided into two parts; namely, Finnmark and Norwegian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAPLAND\">Lapland</a>. The chief town, which is very insignificant, stands upon an island called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARD\">Ward</a>, from whence the place and the government derive their name, Norway.\n\nThe province of Bahus, though now yielded to the Swedes, is reckoned part of Norway, being a narrow tract of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, about 90 miles in length, lying on the coast of the Categate.\n\nThe great chain of Norway mountains, running from north to south, called indifferently Rudfield, Snudefield, Skarsfield, and Scoreberg, is known in different parts by other appellations; such as Dofrefield, Lamfied, Sagufield, Filefield, Halnefield, Hardangerfield, Joklefield, Bygglefield, Hicklefield, and Hangfield. The height and breadth of this extensive chain likewise vary in different parts. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> the mountain Hardanger, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> must travel about 70 English miles, whereas Filefield may be about 50 over. This last rises about two miles and a half in perpendicular height; but Dofrefield is counted the highest mountain of Norway, if not of Europe. The river Drivane winds along the side of it in a fertile course, so as to be met <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> times by those who travel the winter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to the other side of the chain. The bridges are thrown over roaring cataracts, and but indifferently fastened to the steep rocks on either side; so that the whole exhibits a very dreadful appearance, sufficient to deter the traveller from hazarding such a dangerous passage; for which reason, people generally choose the road over Filefield, which is much more tedious. This, however, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> road used by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a>. The way is distinguished by posts fixed at the distance of 200 paces from each other, that, in snowy or dark weather, the traveller may not be bewildered. For the convenience of resting and refreshing, there are two mountain stoves or houses maintained on Filefield, as well as upon other mountains, at the expense of the public, and furnished with fire, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a> utensils. Nothing can be more dismal and dreary than those mountains covered with eternal snow, where neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, tree, nor living creature is to be seen, but here and there a solitary rein deer, and perhaps a few wandering Laplanders.\n\nIn travelling from Sweden to Nordenfields, there is only one way of avoiding this chain of mountains; and that is, where it is interrupted by a long deep valley, extending from Romfdale to Guldbranddalen. In the year 1612, a body of 1000 Scots, commanded by Sinclair, and sent over as auxiliaries to the Swedes, were put to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> in this defile, by the peasants of Guldbrand, who never gave quarter.\n\nBesides this chain, there is a great number of detached mountains over all the country, that form valleys and ridges, inhabited by the peasants. Some of these are of incredible height, and others exhibit very remarkable appearances. In sailing up Joering Creek on the left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the sight is astonisbed with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> of mountains, resembling the prospect of a city, with old Gothic towers and edifices. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of Oerfkong is the high mountain Skopfhorn, the top of which represents the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of a fortification, with regular walls and bastions. In the district of Hilgeland appears a very high range of mountains, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> pinnacles or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CRESTS\">crests</a>, known by the appellation of the Seven <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SISTERS\">Sisters</a>, discernible a great way off at sea. To the southward of this range, though in the same district, rises the famous mountain Torghatten, so called because the summit resembles a man's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> with a hat on, under which appears a single eye, formed by an aperture through the mountain.\nNorway. mountain, 150 ells high, and 3000 ells in length. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> may be seen through this surprising cavity, which is passible by the foot of travellers. On the top of the mountain we find a reservoir of water, as large as a moderate fish pond; in the lower part is a cavern, through which a line 400 fathoms in length, being let down, did not reach the bottom. At Herroe in Sundmoer is another cavern called Doffeen, supposed to reach under the sea to Scotland; which, however, is no more than an idle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>. In the year 1752, two clergymen entered this subterranean cavity, and proceeded a considerable way, until they heard the feet dashing over their heads; the passage was as wide and high as an ordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, the sides perpendicular, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> vaulted. They descended one flight of natural stairs; but arriving at another, they were afraid to penetrate farther; they had gone so far, however, that two candles were consumed in their progress and return. A cavern of a very curious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, serving as a conduit to a stream of water, penetrates through the sides of the mountain Limur. In the district of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RAKE\">Rake</a>, in the neighbourhood of Frederichshall, are three cavities in a rock; one of which is so deep, that a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> dropped down, does not reach the bottom in less than two minutes; and then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> it produces is pleasant and melodious, not unlike the sound of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>.\n\nThe vast mountains and rugged rocks that deform the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of this country are productive of numberless inconveniences. They admit of little arable ground; they render the country in some parts impassable, and everywhere difficult to travellers; they afford shelter to wild beasts, which come from their lurking holes, and make terrible havoc among the flocks of cattle; they expose the sheep and goats, as well as the peasants, to daily accidents of falling over precipices; they occasion sudden torrents, and falls of snow, which descend with incredible impetuosity, and often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEEP\">sweep</a> away the labours of the husbandman; and they are subject to dreadful disruptions, by which huge rocks are rent from their sides, and, hurling down, overwhelm the plains below with inevitable ruin. The peasants frequently build their houses on the edge of a steep precipice, to which they must climb by ladders, at the hazard of their lives; and when a person dies, the corpse must be let down with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a>, before it can be laid in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COFFIN\">coffin</a>. In winter the mail is often drawn up the sides of steep mountains. Even in the king's road, travellers are exposed to the frequent risks of falling over those dreadful rocks; for they are obliged to pass over narrow pathways, without rails or rising on the sides, either thored up with rotten planks, or suspended by iron bolts fastened in the mountains. In the narrow pass of Naeroe is a remarkable way of this kind, which, above 600 years ago, the famous King Sverre caused to be made for the passage of his cavalry; and even this would have been found impassable by any other horses than those of Norway, which are used to climb the rocks like goats. Another very difficult and dangerous road is that between Shogstadt and Vang-in-Volders, along the side of a steep mountain, in some places so narrow, that if two travellers on horseback should meet in the night, they would find it impracticable either to pass each other, or turn back. In such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> their lives could not be saved, unless one of them should alight, and throw his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> headlong into the lake below, and then cling to the rock, until the other could pass. When a sheep or goat makes a false step to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a> of a rock, from whence it can neither ascend nor descend, the owner hazards his own life to preserve that of the animal. He directs himself to be lowered down from the top of the mountain, sitting on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> stick, tied to the end of a long rope; and when he arrives at the place where the creature stands, he fastens it to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a>, and it is drawn up with himself. Perhaps the other end of the rope is held by one person only; and there are some instances in which the assistant has been dragged down by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of his friend, so that both have perished. When either man or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a> has had the misfortune to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> over very high precipices, they have not only been suffocated by the repercussion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, but their bodies have been always burst before they reached the ground. Sometimes entire crests of rocks, many fathoms in length and breadth, have fallen down at once, creating such a violent agitation of the air, as seemed a prelude to the world's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a>. At Steenbroe in Laerdal, a stupendous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, larger than any castle in the universe, appears to have been fevered and tumbled from the mountain in large, sharp, and ragged fragments, through which the river rears with hideous bellowing. In the year 1731, a promontory on Sundmoer, called Ramsfjeld, that hung over Nordal Creek, suddenly gave way, and plunged into the water; which swelled to such a degree, that the church of Strand, though half a league on the other side of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>, was overflowed; the creek, however, was not filled up; on the contrary the fishermen declare they find no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in the depth, which is said to exceed 900 fathoms.\n\nThe remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> of Norway are these: The Nied, issuing from Tydalmen, on the borders of Sweden, runs westward into the lake Selboe; and afterwards, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> to the northward, passes by the city of Drontheim, to which it anciently gave the name of Nidero; and Nidqo: Sule <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELY\">Ely</a>, that descending from Sulefield, runs with a rapid course through Nordale into the sea; Gulen, which rises near Sifferfeld in the north; and running 20 leagues westward, through Aalen, Hlotaalen, Storen, and Meihus, discharges itself into the sea, about a league to the west of Drontheim. In the year 1344, this river buried itself under ground; from whence it again burst forth with such violence, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> thrown up by the eruption filled the valley, and formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAM\">dam</a>; which, however, was soon broken and washed away by the force of the water. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">Divers</a> churches, 48 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> houses, with 250 persons, were destroyed on this occasion.\u2014Otteren, a large river, taking its rise from the mountain Agde, runs about 30 leagues through Seesterdale and Efde, and discharges itself into the cataract of Wiland. The river Syre rises near the mountain Lang, and winds its course through the vale of Syre into the lake of Lande in the diocese of Christiania; thence it continues its way to the sea, into which it discharges itself through a narrow strait formed by two rocks. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> augments its impetuosity, so that it shoots like an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARROW\">arrow</a> into the sea, in which it produces a very great agitation. Nid and Sheen are two considerable rivers, issuing out of Tillemark. Their water-falls have been diverted, with infinite labour, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> cut through the rocks, for the convenience of floating down the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>. Tyreford or Dramme, is in the neighbourhood of Ho-\nNorway nifosse, joined by two rivers from Osdale and Hadsland, and disembogues itself into the sea near Bragernes. Loven rises in the highest part of Nummedal, and runs through Konnerberg to the sea near Laurvig. Glaamnen is the largest river of Norway, distinguished by the name of Stor Elvin, or the great river. It derives its origin from the mountain Dofre, from whence it winds all along the plains of Oesterdalen and Soloe; then joins the Vorme, another considerable river rising out of Mioss and Guldbranddalen. These being joined, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a> the lake Oeyern; and thence issuing, run on to Sarp near Fredericksfadt.\n\nNorway abounds with fresh-water <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> of which are Ryfvan in Nordland, Snalen, Selboe, the Greater and Lesser Mioss, Shirevand, Sperdille, Rand, Vefta, Saren, Modum, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUND\">Lund</a>, Norfoe, Huidfoe, Farifvand, and Oeyevand: all these are well stocked with fish, and navigable for large vessels. Wars have been formerly carried on upon these inland seas; in some of which are small floating islands, or parcels of earth, with trees on them, separated from the main land, and probably preserved in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> masses by the roots of trees, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>, and grass, interwoven in the soil. In the year 1722, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> seat of Borge, near Fredericksfadt, being a noble edifice, with lofty towers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLEMENTS\">battlements</a>, suddenly sunk into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABYSS\">abyss</a> 100 fathoms deep, which was instantaneously filled by a piece of water 300 ells in length and about half as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>. Fourteen persons, with 200 head of cattle, perished in this catastrophe, which was occasioned by the river Glaamnen precipitating itself down a waterfall near Sarp, and undermining the foundation. Of all the waterfalls in Norway this of Sarp is the most dangerous for its height and rapidity. The current drives 17 miles; and roars with such violence, that the water, being dashed and comminuted among the rocks, rises in the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, where a beautiful rainbow may be always seen when the sun shines. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> times this cataract was made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of for the execution of traitors and other malefactors: they were thrown down alive, that they might be dashed in pieces on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of rocks, and die in a dreadful commotion, analogous to those they had endeavoured to excite in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>.\n\nGreat part of Norway is covered with forests of wood, which constitute the principal article of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> in this country. They chiefly consist of fir and pine, for which great sums are received from foreigners, who export an immense number of masts, beams, planks, and boards. Besides, an incredible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> is consumed at home in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> houses, ships, bridges, piles, moles, and fences; over and above the vast demand for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a> to the foundries, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> uses.\u2014Nay, in some places, the trees are felled for no other purpose but to clear the ground and to be burned into ashes for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a>. A good quantity of timber is yearly exported to Scotland and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>; but this is inconsiderable when compared to the vast exports from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRAMMEN\">Drammen</a>, Frederickshall or Fredericksfadt, Christiana, Skeen, Arendal, Christiania, Chriffian's Bay, and Drontheim. The masts and large beams are floated down the rivers, and the rest is divided into boards at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a>. These works supply a vast number of families with a comfortable subsistence.\u2014A tenth part of all sawed timber belongs to his Danish majesty, and makes a considerable branch of his revenue. The forests in Norway are so vast and thick, that the people seem to think Norway there can never be a scarcity of wood, especially as the soil is peculiarly adapted for the production of timber; they therefore destroy it with a wasteful hand; insomuch that more wood rots in Norway than is burned in the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of Denmark. The best timber grows in the provinces of Saltan, Helleland, Komfdale, Guldbranddalen, Oesterdalen, Soloe, Valders, Hallingdale, Sogniford, Telemark, and the lordship of Nedenes.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> of Norway is very different in different parts of the kingdom. At Bergen the winter is so moderate, that the seas are always open and practicable both to mariners and fishermen, except in creeks and bays, that reach far up into the country towards Filefield, when the keen north-east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> blows from the land. On the east side of Norway, from the frontiers of Sweden to Filefield, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> generally sets in about the middle of October with great severity, and lasts till the middle of April; during which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> the waters are frozen to a very considerable thickness, and the face of the country is covered with snow. In the year 1719, 7500 Swedes, who intended to attack Drontheim, perished in the snow on the mountain of Ruden or Tydel, which separates Jempleteland in Sweden from the diocese of Drontheim. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of 200 Norwegian fledge-men under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> Emahus, found them all frozen to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> on the ridge of the mountain, where they had been surprised by a storm accompanied with snow, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> cold. Some of these unhappy victims appeared fitting, some lying, and others kneeling in a posture of praying. They had cut in pieces their muklets, and burned the little wood they afforded.\u2014The generals Labarre and Zoega lost their lives; and of the whole corps, consisting originally of 10,000, no more than 250 survived this dreadful catastrophe.\n\nThe cold is still more intense in that part of Norway called Finnmark, situated in the frigid zone near the polar circle. But if the winter is generally cold, the summer is often excessively hot in Norway. The rays of the sun are reverberated from the sides of the mountains so as to render the weather close and sultry in the valleys; besides, the sun's absence below the horizon is so short, that the atmosphere and mountains have not time to cool. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> is so great, that vegetation is remarkably quick. Barley is sown, grows, ripens, and is reaped, in the space of six weeks or two months. The longest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> at Bergen consists of 19 hours; the sun rising at half an hour after two, and setting at half an hour after nine. The shortest day does not exceed five hours; for the sun rises at nine in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, and sets at three in the afternoon.\u2014In the beginning of the year the daylight increases with remarkable celerity; and, at the approach of winter, decreases in the same proportion. In summer one may read and write at midnight by the light of the sky. Christian V., while he resided at Drontheim, used to sup at midnight without candles. In the district of Tromfen, at the extremity of Norway, the sun is continually in view at midsummer. It is seen to circulate day and night round the north pole, contracting its orbit, and then gradually enlarging it, until at length it leaves the horizon. In the depth of winter, therefore, it is for some weeks invisible; and all the light perceived at noon is a faint glimmering for about an hour and a half, proceeding from the reflection of the sun's rays from the highest mountains.\nNorway. mountains. But the inhabitants of these provinces are supplied with other lights that enable them to follow their employments in the open air. The sky being generally serene, the moonlight is remarkably bright, and, being reflected from the mountains, illuminates the valleys. They are also afflicted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-AURORA_BOREALIS\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol3.html#article-AURORA\">aurora</a> borealis, which is very frequent in the northern parts of Europe.\n\nThe air of Norway is generally pure and salubrious. On the sea coasts, indeed, it is rendered moist by vapours and exhalations; but in the midland parts of the country, towards the mountains, the climate is so dry, that meat may be kept for many years without being worm-eaten or damaged in the least. The inhabitants have no idea of sickness, except what is occasioned by excesses. It is said, that in the vale of Guldbrand the inhabitants live to such extreme old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, that they become weary of life, and cause themselves to be removed to a less salubrious climate, whereby they may have a chance of dying sooner. In consumptions, however, the moist air on the sea side is found to be most agreeable to the lungs in respiration. Norway, being a mountainous country intersected by creeks, abounding with lakes, rivers, and snow, must be subject to frequent rains; and from sudden thaws the inhabitants are sometimes exposed to terrible dilatations. Vast masses of snow falling from precipices overwhelm men, cattle, boats, houses, nay even whole villages. About two centuries ago, a whole parish was covered and destroyed by an immense mass of snow; and several domestic utensils, as teapots, knives, and basins, have been at different times brought to light by a rivulet that runs under the snow, which has been gradually hardened and increased by repeated frosts and annual accretions.\n\nThe winds that chiefly prevail on the western coast are those that blow from the south; whereas, on the other side of Fifefield, the winds that produce and continue the hard frosts are always northerly. In the summer, there is a kind of regular trade-wind on the coast of Bergen. In the forenoon the sea begins to be cooled with a westerly breeze, which continues till midnight. Then the land breeze begins from the east, and blows till about ten in the morning. The coast is likewise subject to sudden squalls and storms. Hurricanes sometimes rise at sea; and in these latitudes the phenomenon called a water-spout is not uncommon. One of these in the neighbourhood of Ferro is said to have sucked up with the water some last of herrings, which were afterwards dropped on Kolter, a mountain 1200 feet high.\n\nThe fresh water of Norway is not very light or pure; but on the contrary, is generally turbid, and deposits a sediment of adventitious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, being sometimes impregnated with ochre and particles of iron.\u2014Nevertheless it is agreeable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, and remarkably salubrious; as appears from the good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> people, who drink little or no other liquor.\n\nThe soil of Norway varies in different places according to the situation of rock or valley. The mountains, here, as in every other country, are bare and barren; but the earth washed down from them by the rains enriches and fertilizes the valleys. In these the soil generally consists of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> mould, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, loam, chalk, and gravel, lying over one another in unequal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a>, and sometimes in three or four successions: the mould that lies uppermost is very fine and mellow, and fit to nourish all sorts of vegetables. There is also clay found in different parts of this kingdom, of which the inhabitants begin to make earthen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WARE\">ware</a>; but bricks and tiles are not used in building. The face of the country is in many places deformed by large swamps and marshes, very dangerous to the traveller. Near Leefoe in the diocese of Christiania, a wooden causeway is extended near a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> over a morass; and if a horse or any other animal should make a false step, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> sink at once into the abyss, never to rise again.\n\nIn a cold country like Norway, stony with rocks and mountains, interspersed with bogs, and covered with forests, we cannot expect to find <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> in perfection. The ploughed lands, in respect to mountains, woods, meadows, and wastes, do not exceed the proportion of 1 to 80; so that the whole country does not produce corn to maintain above half the number of its inhabitants. The peasants are discouraged from the practice of husbandry by the frequency of accidents that seem peculiar to the climate. Even in the fruitful provinces of Guldbrandsfjeld, Oesterdale, and Soloe, as well as in the other places, when the corn appears in the most flourishing condition, the whole hope of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a> is sometimes destroyed in one night by a sudden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROST\">frost</a> that nips the blade and extinguishes the vegetation. The kingdom is moreover visited by some unfavourable years, in which the sun seems to have lost his genial power; the vegetables are blighted; the trees bud and bloom, yet bear no fruit; and the grain, though it rises, will yet produce nothing but empty ears and straw. This calamity, however, rarely occurs; and in general the cultivated parts of Norway yield plentiful crops of excellent rye, barley, and oats. The most fruitful provinces are Nordland, Inderbarre, and Numedale, in the diocese of Drontheim; Sognfjord and Vaas, in that of Bergen; Jeddere, Ryefylk, Raabygdalag, the lordship of Nedenes, in the diocese of Christiania; Hedemark in the diocese of Aggerhus; Hadeland, Toten, Romerige, Ringerige, and Guldbrandsfjeld: these territories not only produce grain enough for their own consumption, but likewise support their neighbours, and even supply part of Sweden.\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEAT\">Peat</a> is likewise propagated in this country, together with wheat, buckwheat, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-HOPS\">hops</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>, but not to any considerable advantage. The meadows are well stored with pasturage for sheep and cattle, and the fields are productive of those vegetables which are common in other northern countries. Within these 50 years the people of Norway have bestowed some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> on the culture of gardens, which in former times was so neglected, that the cities and towns were supplied with leeks, cabbage, and roots, from England and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>. At present, however, the Norwegians raise their own culinary and garden roots and vegetables, which thrive there as well as in any other country. The scarcity being a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> that prevails along the sea coast, Nature has scattered upon it a variety of herbs efficacious in the cure of that distemper; such as angelica, rofe-wort, gentian, cretis, trefoil, forrel, scurvy-grafts, and a plant called erich's grafs, that grows in great plenty on the islands of Nordland: from whence the people of the continent fetch away <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> loads of it, to be preserved in barrels as a succedaneum for cabbage. There are also a few noxious vegetables little known in any country but Norway.\nIn Guldbranddalle is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of grass called *selfnape*, the root of which is so poisonous, that any beast which eats of it dies immediately, the belly bursting; nay, the carnivorous fowls that prey upon the carcals of the beast meet with the same fate: children have been more than once poisoned by this root, which nevertheless is sometimes used externally as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMULET\">amulet</a> for arthritic disorders. Another vegetable pernicious to the cattle is the *Gramen offfragum Norwegienfe*, which is said to mollify the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> of the cattle which feed upon it. Among the noxious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> of Norway we may also reckon the *gle-glas*, fatal to sheep and goats; the *tour-gras*, which affects horses and cows with a fort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETHARGY\">lethargy</a>; and the plant *torboe*, or little-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, which produces nearly the same effect on horses, but is not at all prejudicial to cows, sheep, or any ruminating animals. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERB\">herb</a> *turte*, not unlike angelica, operates nearly in the same manner: yet the bears are said to feed upon it with peculiar relish; and when their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> begins to fall off by feeding upon this plant, they cure themselves by eating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> of animals.\n\nThe common fruit trees thrive tolerably well in Norway, the inhabitants of which have plenty of cherries, apples, and pears. Some kinds of plums attain maturity; which is seldom the case with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a>, apricots, and peaches. But even the apples and pears that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIPEN\">ripen</a> here are summer fruit; that which grows till the winter seldom coming to perfection. Great variety of agreeable berries is produced in different parts of this kingdom; such as the hagebar, a kind of floes; an infusion of which in wine makes a pleasant cooling liquor; juniper berries, corinths <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, foelbar or sunberries, raifberries, goofeberries, blackberries, strawberries, &c. with many other species that seem to be natives of Norway and Sweden. Among those are the transebar, the produce of the myrtillus repens, red and auster, found in the spring in perfection under the snow, and much relished by the reindeer; crakebeer, resembling bilberries, deemed a powerful anticoagulant; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGER\">ager</a>-beer, larger and blacker than bilberries, of a pleasant acid, ripened by cold, and used as cherries for an infusion in wine; and finally tytlebeer, a red pleasant berry growing on a short stem, with leaves like those of box; they are plucked off by handfuls, and sent to Denmark to be preferred for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, where they are eaten by way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESSERT\">dessert</a>.\n\nOf the trees that grow wild in Norway, the principal are the fir and the pine. The first yield an annual revenue of 1,000,000 of rixdollars, if we include the advantages resulting from the saw mills and the masts; one of which last has been known to sell for 200 rixdollars. The red fir tree, which grows on the mountains, is so rich in turpentine as to be almost incorruptible. Some of the houses belonging to the Norway peasants, built of this timber, are supposed to be above 400 years standing. In Guldbranddalle the house is still to be seen standing in which King Olaf lodged five nights, above 700 years ago, when he travelled round the kingdom to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the people to the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>. Even 100 years after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> of the fir tree has been cut down, the peasants burn the roots for tar, which is a very profitable commodity. In the fens, the resin of the fir tree is by nature transformed into a substance which may be called *Norway frankincense*. The buds or pine apples of this tree, boiled in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STALE\">stale</a> beer, make an excellent medicine for the scurvy; less unpleasant to the taste, though as efficacious, as tar-water. The pine tree is more tall and beautiful than the fir, though inferior to it in strength and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>; for which reason the planks of it are sold at an inferior price, and the peasants waste it without remorse. Norway likewise produces some forests of oak, which is found to be excellent for ship-building. Here also grow plenty of elm trees; the bark of which, being powdered, is boiled up with other food to fatten hogs, and even mixed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> among their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>; also the ash, from which the peasants distill a balm used in certain disorders, and which is used both externally and internally. Many other trees flourish in this country, an enumeration of which would prove too tedious. Hazels grow here in such abundance, that 100 tons of the nuts are annually exported from Bergen alone.\n\nA great diversity of stones is found in Norway, some of which are of a surprising figure. Several mountains consist chiefly of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> pebble, which decays with age; nay, it sometimes dissolves, and drops into the sea, and the cement being thus loosened, a terrible dilution ensues. In some places the gray and black pebbles are intermixed with iron, copper, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, silver, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>. The ground in certain districts is covered with the fragments of rocks that have been precipitated from the summits of mountains, and broken by their fall into innumerable shivers. Between 20 and 30 years ago, in the neighbourhood of Bergen, a man was suddenly overwhelmed with such a mass, which formed a kind of vault around him. In this dreadful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a> he remained alive for several weeks. By his loud cries the place of his confinement was discovered: but it was found impossible to remove the huge stones by which he was inclosed. All that his friends could do for him was, to lower down meat and drink through some crevices; but at length the stones fell in, and crushed him to death.\n\nIn Norway are inexhaustible quarries of excellent marble, black, white, blue, gray, and variegated; together with some detached pieces of alabaster, several kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAR\">spar</a>, chalk-stone, cement-stone, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SAND_STONE\">sand-stone</a>, millstone, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAKING\">baking</a>-stone, flate, talc, magnets, and wine-stone, a production natural to Norway and Sweden, of a brown <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, fetid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, in texture resembling crystal, and deriving its name from a supposed efficacy in curing a distemper incident to swine. Here also is found the amianthus or stone-flax, of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INCOMBUSTIBLE\">incombustible</a> cloth may be made. Norway, however, affords no flints, but plenty of pyrites or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTZ\">quartz</a>, beautiful crystals, granites, amethysts, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGATE\">agate</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>-stones, and eagle-stones. Gold has formerly been found in a small quantity in the diocese of Christianland, and coined into ducats. There is at present a very considerable silver mine wrought at Kongsherg on the account and at the risk of his Danish majesty: the ore is surprisingly rich, but interrupted in such a manner, that the vein is often lost. Many masses of pure silver have been found; and, among the rest, one piece weighing 560 pounds, preserved in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">museum</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPENHAGEN\">Copenhagen</a>. Such is the richness of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>, that the annual produce amounts in value to a ton and a half in gold. About 5000 people are daily employed, and earn their subsistence, in these stupendous works.\nNorway. works (a). Other silver mines are prosecuted at Jarlberg, but not to the same advantage; and here the ore is mixed with lead and copper. In many parts of this country copper mines have been discovered; but the principal, and perhaps the richest in all Europe, is at Rorasaas, about 100 English miles from Drontheim. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> yields annually about 1100 ship pounds of pure copper; the founderies belonging to it consume yearly about 14,000 lasts of coal, and 500 fathoms of wood. The next in importance is the copper work at Lykken, about 20 miles from Drontheim. A third mine is carried on at Indet or Quickne, at the distance of 30 miles from the same place; and here they precipitate the copper from its mercurium, by means of iron. There is a fourth copper work at Silboe, about 30 miles distant from Drontheim, though the least considerable of the four. Other copper mines of less note are worked in different parts of the kingdom. Iron is still in greater plenty, and was the first metal wrought in this country. Many hundred thousand quintals are annually exported, chiefly in bars, and part of it in stoves, pots, kettles, and cannon; the national profit arising from this metal is estimated at 300,000 rixdollars. There is a species called moor-iron, found in large lumps among the morasses: of this the peasants make their own domestic tools and utensils, such as knives, scythes, and axes. The lead found mixed in the silver ore is an article of small importance in Norway; yet some mines of this metal have been lately opened in the district of Soloe by the proprietors of the copper work at Oudal. A vitriol work has been begun near Kongberg: the mines yield great plenty of sulphur; which, however, the Norwegians will not take the trouble to melt and depurate, because immense quantities are found at a cheaper rate in the island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ICELAND\">Iceland</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">Alum</a> is found between the slate flakes near Christiania in such plenty, that works have been set up for refining this mineral, though they have not yet brought it to any degree of transparency. His Danish majesty has established <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> works in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> of Valoe, about six English miles from Tonberg, where this mineral is extracted in large quantities from the sea water.\n\nBesides the animals common to other countries, Norway is said to contain many of the uncommon and dubious kind; such as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KRAKEN\">kraken</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MERMAID\">mermaid</a>, sea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENT\">serpent</a>, &c. See these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>.\n\nMany Danish, English, Scotch, Dutch, and German families have now settled in Norway; and indeed form no inconsiderable part of the trading people: but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> inhabitants are the descendants of those ferocious Normanni, who harried almost all the coasts of Europe with piratical armaments in the 8th, 9th, and 10th centuries.\n\n\"Our first certain knowledge of the inhabitants of this country (says Pennant *) was from the defoliation they brought on the southern nations by their piratical invasions. Their country had before that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> the name of Nortmanland, and the inhabitants Normans, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> which included other adjacent people. Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> were ravaged by them in 845; and they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> their invasion till they effected the conquest of England, under their leader Canute the Great. They went up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEINE\">Seine</a> as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, burnt the town, and forced its weak monarch to purchase their absence at the price of fourteen thousand marks. They plundered Spain, and at length carried their excursions through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, and even into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>. They used narrow vessels, like their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> the Sitones; and, besides oars, added the improvement of two sails; and victualled them with salted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, biscuit, cheese, and beer. Their ships were at first small; but in after times they were large enough to hold 100 or 120 men. But the multitude of vessels was amazing. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> of Harold Blageland consisted of 700. A hundred thousand of these savages have at once sailed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCANDINAVIA\">Scandinavia</a>, so justly styled Officina gentium, aut certe velut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VAGINA\">vagina</a> nationum. Probably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, more than ambition, caused them to displace their country of its exuberant numbers. Multitudes were destroyed; but multitudes remained, and peopled more favourable climates.\n\n\"Their king, Olaus, was a convert to Christianity in 904; Bernard an Englishman had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of baptizing him, when Olaus happened to touch at one of the Scilly islands. He plundered with great spirit during several years; and in 1066 received the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of martyrdom from his pagan subjects. But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> zeal first gave the rest of Europe a knowledge of their country and the sweets of its commerce. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANSE\">Hanse</a> towns poured in their missionaries, and reaped a temporal harvest. By the year 1204, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> obtained from the wise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> Suer every encouragement to commerce; and by that means introduced wealth and civilization into his barren kingdom. England by every method cherished the advantages resulting from an intercourse with Norway, and Bergen was the emporium. Henry III. in 1217, entered into a league with its monarch Haquin; by which both princes stipulated for free access for their subjects into their respective kingdoms, free trade, and security to their persons. In 1269, Henry entered into another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> with Magnus; in which it was agreed, that no goods should be exported from either kingdom except they had been paid for; and there is, besides a humane provision on both sides, for the security of the persons and effects of the subjects who should suffer shipwreck on their several coasts.\"\n\nThe inhabitants now speak the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> that is used in Denmark, through their original tongue is the dialect now spoken in Iceland. They profess the Lutheran <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, under an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> established at Drontheim.\n\n(a) Mr Coxe tells us, that he visited those mines, but at present yield little more than 50,000l. The expenses generally exceed the profits; and government gains only by the number of miners employed. The mines of cobalt, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of Prussian blue, are much more productive. The latter goes through 270 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, and the number of men employed is 365. It is supposed, that, at this period (1793), it may produce to government a profit of 16,000l. a-year.\nDrontheim, with four suffragans; namely, of Bergen, Staffanger, Hammer, and Christiana. By the union of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALMAR\">Calmar</a>, the two kingdoms of Norway and Denmark were united under one monarch; and then the people of both nations enjoyed considerable privileges: but the Danish government soon became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a>; and Norway was ruled despotically by a viceroy, who resided in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, and presided in the supreme court, to which appeals were made from the subordinate courts of judicature. A great change has, however, taken place since the present amiable and accomplished prince of Denmark had part of the government; and more may be expected from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> and affability when the power shall come wholly into his own hands.\n\nThe Norwegians are generally well formed, tall, sturdy, and robust, brave, hardy, honest, hospitable, and ingenious; yet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a>, rash, quarrelsome, and litigious. The same character will nearly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> the inhabitants of every mountainous country in the northern climates. Their women are well shaped, tall, comely, remarkably fair, and obliging. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> of Norway have been chiefly removed by the kings of Denmark, in order to prevent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a> and opposition to the court; or are long ago degenerated into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of peasants: some families, however, have been lately raised to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>. Every freeholder in Norway enjoys the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of primogeniture and power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDEMPTION\">redemption</a>; and it is very usual to see a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a> inhabiting the same house which has been possessed 400 years by his ancestors. The adels-gods, or freehold, cannot be alienated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> or otherwise from the right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a>, called adels-mand: if he is not able to redeem the estate, he declares his incapacity every 10th year at the sessions; and if he, or his heirs to the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>, should acquire wealth enough for that purpose, the possessor pro tempore must resign his possession.\n\nThe mountaineers acquire surprising strength and dexterity by hard living, cold, laborious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, climbing rocks, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SKATING\">skating</a> on the snow, and handling arms, which they carry from their youth to defend themselves against the wild beasts of the forest. Those who dwell in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> parts of Norway exercise the employments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>, and become very expert mariners.\n\nThe peasants of Norway never employ any handicraftsmen for necessaries to themselves and families: they are their own hatters, shoemakers, tailors, tanners, weavers, carpenters, smiths, and joiners: they are even expert at ship-building; and some of them make excellent violins. But their general turn is for carving in wood, which they execute in a surprising manner with a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a> of their own forging. They are taught in their youth to wrestle, ride, swim, skate, climb, shoot, and forge iron. Their amusements consist in making verses, blowing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">horn</a>, or playing upon a kind of guitar, and the violin: this last kind of music they perform even at funerals. The Norwegians have evinced their valour and fidelity in a thousand different instances. The country was always disturbed by intestine quarrels, which raged from generation to generation. Even the farmers stand upon their puntillo, and challenge one another to single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> with their knives. On such occasions they hook themselves together by their belts, and fight until one of them is killed or mortally wounded. At weddings and public feasts they drink to intoxication, quarrel, fight, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> generally ensues. The very common people are likewise passionate, ambitious of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> and independence, and vain of their pedigree. The nobility and merchants of Norway fare sumptuously; but the peasant lives with the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a> and frugality, except at festivals: his common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> is made of oatmeal, rolled into broad thin cakes, like those used in Scotland. In time of scarcity, they boil, dry, and grind the bark of the fir tree into a kind of flour which they mix with oatmeal; the bark of the elm tree is used in the same manner. In those parts where a fishery is carried on, they knead the roes of cod with their oat meal. Of these last, mixed with barley meal, they make hasty pudding and soup, enriched with a pickled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERRING\">herring</a> or salted mackerel. Fresh fish they have in plenty on the sea coast. They hunt and eat grouse, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTRIDGE\">partridge</a>, hare, red deer, and reindeer. They kill cows, sheep, and goats, for their winter stock: these they pickle, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>, or dry for use. They make cheese of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, and a liquor called syre of their four whey: this they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> drink mixed with water; but they provide a store of strong ale for Christmas, weddings, christenings, and other entertainments. From their temperance and exercise, joined to the purity and elasticity of their air, they enjoy good health, and often attain to a surprising degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGEVITY\">longevity</a>. Nothing is more common than to see a hearty Norwegian turned of 100. In the year 1733, four couples danced before his Danish majesty at Frederikshald; their ages, when joined, exceeded 800 years. Nevertheless the Norwegians are subject to various diseases; such as the scab, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEPROSY\">leprosy</a>, the scurvy, the catarrh, the rheumatism, gout, and epilepsy. The dress of the Norway peasants consists of a wide loose jacket made of coarse cloth, with waistcoat and breeches of the same. Their heads are covered with flapped <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HATS\">hats</a>, or caps ornamented with ribbons. They wear shoes without outer soles, and in the winter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> buskins. They have likewise snow shoes and long skates, with which they travel at a great pace, either on the land or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>. There is a corps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> thus accoutred, who can outmatch the swiftest horses. The Norwegian peasant never wears a neckcloth, except on extraordinary occasions: he opens his neck and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> to the weather, and lets the snow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> into his bosom. His body is girt round with a broad leather belt, adorned with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> plates, from which depends a brass chain that sustains a large knife, gimlet, and other tackle. The women are dressed in close laced jackets, having leather girdles decorated with ornaments of silver. They likewise wear silver chains round their necks, to the ends of which are fixed gilt medals. Their caps and handkerchiefs are almost covered with small plates of silver, brass, and tin, large rings, and buttons. A maiden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDE\">bride</a> appears with her hair plaited, and, together with her clothes, hung full of such jingling trinkets.\n\nThe churches, public edifices, and many private houses in Norway, are built of stone: but the people in general live in wooden houses, made of the trunks of fir and pine tree laid upon each other, and joined by mortises at the corners. These are counted more dry, warm, and healthy, than stone or brick buildings. In the whole diocese of Bergen, one hardly fees a farm house with a chimney or window: they are generally lighted by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> hole in the top of the house, which lets in the light, and lets out the smoke. In summer\nNorway, this hole is left quite open; in the winter, it is covered with what they call a fiau; that is the membrane of some animal, stretched upon a wooden frame that fits the hole, and transmits the rays of light. It is fixed or removed with a long pole occasionally. Every person that enters the house, upon business or courtship, takes hold of this pole, according to ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>. The ceiling is about eight feet high in the middle; and, being arched like a cupola, the smoke of the fire underneath rolls about, until it finds a vent at the hole, which is called liur. Under this opening stands a thick table with benches, and a high seat at the upper end for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the family: he has likewise a small cupboard for his own use, in which he locks up his most valuable effects. The boards of the roof are coated with the bark of the birch trees, which is counted incorruptible: this again is covered with turf, which yields a good crop of grass for goats and sheep, and is often mowed as hay by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a>.\n\nThe Norwegians carry on a considerable trade with foreign nations. The duty on the produce of their own country exported, amounts annually to 100,000 rix-dollars. These commodities are, copper wrought and unwrought; iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> into cannon, floves, and pots, or forged into bars; lead, in small quantity; masts, timber, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> boards, planks, marble, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILLSTONES\">millstones</a>, herring, cod, ling, salmon, lobsters, flounders, cow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIDES\">hides</a>, goat skins, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a> skins, the furs of bears, wolves, foxes, beavers, ermines, martens, &c., down, feathers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, tallow, train <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, tar, juniper and other sorts of berries, and nuts; salt, alum, glaas, vitriol, and pot ashes. All other commodities and articles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> the Norwegians import from different nations. The nature of the ground does not admit of much improvement in agriculture: nevertheless, the farmers are not deficient in industry and skill to drain marshes, and render the ground arable and fit for pasture. Many are employed in grazing and breeding cattle; but a much greater number is engaged in felling wood, floating timber, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> charcoal, and extracting tar from the roots of the trees which have been cut down in the silver, copper, and iron mines; in the navigation and fishery. A considerable number of people earn a comfortable livelihood by hunting, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a>-catching. Every individual is at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to pursue the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAME\">game</a>, especially in the mountains and commons; therefore every peasant is expert in the use of fire arms; and there are excellent marksmen among the mountains, who make use of the bow to kill those animals, whose skins, being valuable, would be damaged by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> of fire arms.\n\nNorway can produce above 14,000 excellent seamen. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of this country amounts to 30,000 effective men; and the annual revenue exceeds 800,000 rix-dollars.\n\nNorway <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-RAT\">Rat</a>.

In its infancy, in the reign of Etheldred, it was plundered and burnt by Sueno the Dane, when he invaded England with a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>. Afterwards it recovered; and in the reign of Edward the Confessor was a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, having 1320 burgheers. But it suffered again much in the reign of William I. by being the seat of a civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, which Ralph <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of the East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">Angles</a> raised against that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>. So much was it impaired by the siege it then underwent, that there were scarce 360 burgheers left in it, as appears from Doomsday book. From that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> forward it began by little and little to recover, especially after Bishop Herbert translated the episcopal see hither from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THETFORD\">Thetford</a> in the reign of William Rufus in 1096; and built a beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a>, of which he himself laid the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, with this inscription, Dominus Herbertus posuit primum lapidem, in nomine Patrii, Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, Amen, i.e. \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> (Bishop) Herbert laid the first stone, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\" And by a licence from Pope Paschal, declared it the mother <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Norfolk and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUFFOLK\">Suffolk</a>. After this, as Malmesbury has it, it became a town famous for merchandise and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of inhabitants. Yet it was miserably harassed in the reign of Henry II. by Hugh Bigod earl of Norfolk, who was an adherent of Henry's son, called the junior king. In the time of Edward I. it was walled round by the citizens, who had presented a petition to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to do it. Henry IV. allowed them, instead of bailiffs, which they had before, to elect a mayor yearly, and made the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> a county of itself. In the year 1348, near 18,000 persons were carried off by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>; and in 1505, the city was almost consumed by fire. For the flourishing state to which the city is now arrived, they are much indebted to the Flemings, who fled hither from the tyranny of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Alva and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INQUISITION\">inquisition</a>, and taught them the manufacture of those striped and flowered damasks, camlets, druggets, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> crape, for which the place is now so noted, and which have been computed to yield sometimes 200,000l. a-year. In the year 1583, the citizens, by the help of an engine, conveyed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> to the highest parts of the city, which is pleasantly seated along the side of a hill, extending a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> and a half in length from north to south; but the breadth is much less, and it contracts itself by degrees towards the south. It is now one of the most considerable cities in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> for wealth, populousness, neat buildings, beautiful churches, (of which it had once 38, but now only 36), and the industry and civility of the inhabitants. The cathedral is a very venerable structure, with a curious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a>, adorned with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a> in little images, carved to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, and a lofty steeple 105 yards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>. The wall of flint stone, beautified with 40 towers and 12 gates, finished in 1309, is now much decayed. The city, though there is a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of waste ground within the walls, was computed, about 60 years ago, to contain 8000 houses and 50,000 inhabitants. Besides the cathedral already mentioned, the most remarkable buildings are, the duke of Norfolk's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, one of the largest in England; the castle, which is now the county gaol, and stands in the heart of the city, with a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOAT\">moat</a> round it, over which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> of one very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a>; the town <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a>; the guild hall, formerly the church belonging to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONASTERY\">monastery</a> of Black Friars; the house of correction; the shire house, where the assizes are held; a lofty market <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>, built after the manner of piazza; the bishop's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>; the king's school, founded by Edward VI. the boys of which are nominated by the mayor for the time being, with the consent\nNorwich. consent of the majority of aldermen. There having been formerly many thatched houses, an order was made, that all houses that should hereafter be built should be covered with tiles. The city is interspersed with gardens, orchards, and trees, which make it both pleasant and healthful. It has four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>, in which a great number of old men and women, boys and girls, are maintained; and a dozen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>. Here are two churches for the Dutch and French Flemings; who have particular privileges, and are very numerous. Some of the churches are thatched, and all of them crafted with flint stone curiously cut; which is the more wonderful, as Norwich stands in a clay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> flint within 20 miles of it. It is now governed by a mayor, recorder, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEWARD\">steward</a>, two sheriffs, 24 aldermen, 60 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, with a town clerk, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>-bearer, and other inferior officers. The mayor is chosen on May-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> by the freemen, and sworn in on the Tuesday before Midsummer-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVE\">eve</a>. The sheriffs are also chosen annually, on the first Tuesday in August, one by the freemen, the other by the aldermen, and sworn in on Michaelmas day. The freemen of the several wards choose each their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALDERMAN\">alderman</a>. The common council is chosen in Mid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENT\">Lent</a>. The mayor is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> of the peace and quorum, during his year (as are also the recorder and steward) within the city and liberties; and after his mayoralty, he is a justice during life. The trade and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> of the city are very considerable. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YARMOUTH\">Yarmouth</a> they export large quantities of their manufactures, most of which are sent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>; and import a great deal of wine, coal, fish, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, &c. All the city and country round are employed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-WORSTED\">worsted</a> manufacture, brought hither, as already observed, by the Flemings, in which they not only consume the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a> of their own county, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINNING\">spinning</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEAVING\">weaving</a>, &c. but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> many thousand packs of yarn which they receive from other parts of England, as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORKSHIRE\">Yorkshire</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMORELAND\">Westmoreland</a>. There are eight wardens of the weavers chosen annually, and sworn to take care that there be no frauds committed in spinning, weaving, or dying the stuffs. It is computed that there are not less than 120,000 people employed in and about the city in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> and woollen manufactures. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a> are thought to be the greatest in England, and furnished with a surprising plenty and variety of goods and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>. At a small village to the north of the city, called St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">Faith</a>'s, not less than 40,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of Scotch cattle are said to be yearly bought up by the Norfolk graziers, and fattened in their meadows and marshes. Its markets are on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. It has a great number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAIRS\">fairs</a>, lends two members to parliament, and gives the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of earl to the duke of Gordon.\n\nFew cities or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> seem to have suffered more than Norwich has done at various periods, and few seem to have felt it less; for though quite burnt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> by Sueno as above, it was of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> in Edward the Confessor's time; nor did it long feel the evils of the insurrection and siege in William the Conqueror's time, for it was rebuilt in Stephen's reign, and made a corporation.\n\nThe city of Norwich has long been famous for its manufactures; which are not, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of some, at present in so flourishing a state as formerly. In addition to the manufacture of camlets, druggets, and crapes, it is also remarkable for baize, ferges, shalloons, stockings, and woollen cloths.\n\nThe inhabitants of Norwich are generally so employed in their manufactures within doors, that the city has the appearance of being deserted, except on Sundays and holidays, when the streets swarm with people.\n\nCaister, near Norwich, was the Venta Icenorum, or capital city of the Iceni, the broken walls of which contain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of about 30 acres. In those walls may still be perceived the remains of four gates and a tower. Several Roman urns, coins, and other relics of antiquity, have been found in this place.","sp":72,"ep":73},{"h":"NOSE","t":"the organ of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>. See ANATOMY. The uses of the nose are, its giving us the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of smelling; its serving in the great office of respiration, and in modelling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>; in receiving the abundant humours from the eyes, and in adding to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>.\n\nThe nose was by the augurs particularly attended to in forming conjectures concerning future good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> ill success. The tingling of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> or left side of it, for instance, was thought to have different significations as it happened to different sexes, or persons in different conditions.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARY\">Tartary</a>, the greatest beauties are those who have the least noses. Ruybrock mentions the wife of the great Jenghiz Khan as a celebrated beauty, because she had only two holes for a nose.

In most other countries, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a> excepted, great noses are an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>.\n\nIn what the beauty of the nose consists, different nations have different opinions: and the following reflections of Sir Joshua Reynolds on this subject, are perhaps the most philosophical account of the beauty of form that is to be found in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. \"I suppose (says Sir Joshua) it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be easily granted, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> can judge whether any animal be beautiful in its kind, or deformed, who has seen only one of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>: that is as conclusive in regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>; so that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> a man born <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> was to recover his sight, and the most beautiful woman was brought before him, he could not determine whether she was handsome or not; nor, if the most beautiful and most deformed were produced, could he any better determine to which he should give the preference, having seen only those two. To distinguish beauty, then, implies the having seen many individuals of that species. If it is asked, how is more skill acquired by the observation of greater numbers? I answer, that, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of having seen many, the power is acquired, even without seeking after it, of distinguishing between accidental blemishes and excrescences, which are continually varying the surface of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a>'s works, and the invariable general form which Nature most frequently produces, and always seems to intend in her productions.\n\n\"Thus amongst the blades of grass or leaves of the same tree, though no two can be found exactly alike, yet the general form is invariable: a naturalist, before he chose one as a sample, would examine many, since, if he took the first that occurred, it might have, by accident...\"\naccident or otherwise, such a form as that it would scarce be known to belong to that species; he selects, as the painter does, the most beautiful, that is, the most general form of nature.\n\n\"Every species of the animal as well as the vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> may be said to have a fixed or determinate form, towards which nature is continually inclining, like various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> terminating in the centre; or it may be compared to pendulums vibrating in different directions over one central point; and as they all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> the centre, though only one passes through any other point, so it will be found that perfect beauty is oftenest produced by nature than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFORMITY\">deformity</a>: I do not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> than deformity in general, but than any one kind of deformity. To instance in a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a feature: the line that forms the ridge of the nose is beautiful when it is straight; this then is the central form, which is oftener found than either concave, convex, or any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> form that shall be proposed. As we are then more accustomed to beauty than deformity, we may conclude that to be the reason why we approve and admire it, as we approve and admire customs and fashions of dress for no other reason than that we are used to them; so that though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> cannot be said to be the cause of beauty, it is certainly the cause of our liking it: and I have no doubt, but that if we were more used to deformity than beauty, deformity would then lose the idea now annexed to it, and take that of beauty; as if the whole world should agree that yes and no should change their meanings, yes would then deny, and no would affirm.\n\n\"Whoever undertakes to proceed further in this argument, and endeavours to fix a general criterion of beauty respecting different species, or to show why one species is more beautiful than another, it will be required from him first to prove that one species is really more beautiful than another. That we prefer one to the other, and with very good reason, will be readily granted; but it does not follow from thence that we think it a more beautiful form; for we have no criterion of form by which to determine our judgement. He who says a swan is more beautiful than a dove, means little more than that he has more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> in seeing a swan than a dove, either from the flatnesses of its motions, or its being a more rare <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a>; and he who gives the preference to the dove, does it from some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of innocence that he always annexes to the dove; but if he pretends to defend the preference he gives to one or the other, by endeavouring to prove that this more beautiful form proceeds from a particular gradation of magnitude, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNDULATION\">undulation</a> of a curve, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of a line, or whatever other conceit of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> he shall fix on as a criterion of form, he will be continually contradicting himself, and find at last that the great mother Nature will not be subjected to such narrow rules. Among the various reasons why we prefer one part of her works to another, the most general, I believe, is habit and custom: custom makes, in a certain sense, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, and black white; it is custom alone determines our preference of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of the Europeans to the Ethiopians; and they, for the same reason, prefer their own colours to ours. I suppose nobody will doubt, if one of their painters was to paint the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GODDESS\">goddess</a> of beauty, but that he would represent her black, with thick lips, flat nose, and woolly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>; and it seems to me he would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> very unnaturally if he did not; for by what criterion will any one dispute the propriety of his idea? We indeed say, that the form and colour of the European is preferable to that of the Ethiopian; but I know of no other reason we have for it, but that we are more accustomed to it. It is absurd to say, that beauty is possessed of attractive powers, which irresistibly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> the corresponding mind with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> and admiration, since that argument is equally conclusive in favour of the white and the black <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>.\n\n\"The black and white nations must, in respect of beauty, be considered as of different kinds, at least a different species of the same kind; from one of which to the other, as I observed, no inference can be drawn.\n\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">Novelty</a> is said to be one of the causes of beauty: that novelty is a very sufficient reason why we should admire, is not denied; but because it is uncommon, is it therefore beautiful? The beauty that is produced by colour, as when we prefer one bird to another, though of the same form, on account of its colour, has nothing to do with this argument, which reaches only to form. I have here considered the word beauty as being properly applied to form alone. There is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of fixing this confined sense; for there can be no argument, if the sense of the word is extended to every thing that is approved. A rose may as well be said to be beautiful, because it has a fine smell, as a bird because of its colour. When we apply the word beauty, we do not mean always by it a more beautiful form, but something valuable on account of its rarity, usefulness, colour, or any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>.

Very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> spots of it are seen in gravelly soils, and particularly on the tops of hills, and on open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWNS\">downs</a>, and often it is found on gravel walks.\n\n\"It is met with in some of the old authors, under the name of nofoch, as in Paracelsus and others; and the alchemists fancied there was something wonderful in it, and that it would afford a menstruum for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>. Nofoch is said to be a word <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a> to Jaculum aliquicis stellae, vel patris ejus repurgatione dejectum quid in terram; flores aeris; fragmentum nimbis; as this substance was believed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> from the sky with the meteors that we often see, and call falling-stars. Hence the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> people in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a> have called it sky-fall; and in England it is known by the name of witches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> with some of the gelatinous liverworts.\n\n\"Paracelsus, Helmont, and others, ranked it with the terniabin, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANNA\">manna</a>, and thought it dropped, as that did, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>. It is described, and the chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> thereof given, by M. Geoffroy, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> for 1703, and is there said to yield, besides an acid phlegm, a portion of concrete volatile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> and some fixed salt. The distilled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> from it was believed by some to possess singular virtues, in allaying pains of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>; but there is certainly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> room to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> any extraordinary qualities to it.\n\n\"Since the days of Paracelsus it has been considered as a vegetable production; but the botanists have had difficulty to assign its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> or genus in their several systems. Our own countryman, Dr Merret, seems to have been among the first authors who ranked it among vegetables, and he calls it Lichen humiditate intumeens, ficcitate evanescens (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">Pin</a>. page. 71.) Others have retained it among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> of that genus to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; as does the celebrated Dr Haller, in his Historia Stirp. Helvetiae, who calls it Lichen gelatinosus, plicatus, undulatus; lacinis crinitis, granulosus; No 2041, as there are several of the liverworts that have a gelatinous texture and appearance; though they differ much from the nofoch, in not being so instantly dried up. It was put into Ray's Synopsis, by Dr Dillenius, under the name of Ulva terrefricta pinguis et fugax, p. 64.; but he afterwards changed that name for tremella, in his Historia Muscorum, where he calls it tremella terrefricta pinguis pinguis et fugax, p. 52. tab. 10. f. 14., and reduces the lavers to the same genus. Michel, an Italian botanist, famous for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the Cryptogamia clasps of plants, makes it a fungus, as Magnol and Dr Morison had done before him, and describes and figures it, in his Nova Plantarum Genera, under the name of Linbia terrefricta gelatinosa, membranacea, vulgarisima, p. 126. t. 67. f. 1. He describes the seeds as lying in the form of little strings of beads, coiled up within the plant, or rather in the folds thereof, and only to be discovered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>. Linnaeus mentions it, first under the name of Byflis gelatinosa fugax terrefricta, in his Flora Lapponica, No 520; but he afterwards adopted Dillenius's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a>, though he does not make it a layer. Linnaeus has called it, in all his subsequent works, tremella (nofoch) plicata, undulata, under which name it stands in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">Species</a> Plantarum, p. 1157, and in Hudson's Flora Anglicana, p. 463, as also in a numerous set of other authors who follow his system.\"\n\nAnother writer in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> gives this account of it. \"This substance is very rarely seen between the middle of April and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of October. It is most frequently to be found in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> pasture lands, where the ground is inclined to wet, and on the moors and commons in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of England. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> we always meet with it is after a very wet night, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> suddenly clears up, and a sharp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROST\">frost</a> ensues. The frogs that then happen to be out are immediately seized by the frost, and turned into this jelly-like substance. For as I have had occasion sometimes to go out very early, I have found several parts of the frog not yet dissolved among the jelly, such as feet, legs, and thighs, yet in a little time afterwards the change was fully completed. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of jelly produced from one single frog is almost beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a>, even to five or six times its bulk when in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> state.\n\n\"I communicated this discovery to an acquaintance, who has since had frequent opportunities of observing and examining this production; and we are fully assured, that whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> the learned may have of it, it certainly proceeds from the above-mentioned cause wherever found.\n\n\"Most people that I have conversed with on the subject, are of opinion that this jelly falls from the stars, or out of the higher regions of the air; which notion, however absurd, many are credulous enough to believe.\"\n\nNaturalists had for some years begun to doubt whether these gelatinous substances were of a vegetable or animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, when at length Mr J. Pratt of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> printed in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1776, page 402, threw such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on the subject as to us, at least, is perfectly satisfactory.\n\n\"From a child I remember seeing the meteors <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> in the air, which appearance, by my comrades, was called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a>-shooting, believing the stars no larger than their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> magnitude. This jelly-like substance mentioned in your magazine, was believed to be the drops of these meteors, and took the name of star-shot, which passed for certain with me till I had arrived at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 24, when I was engaged in business that required me frequently passing over both meadows and pasture-grounds, where in spring and autumn I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> many portions of this supposed alga or nofoch, but never more than one or two contiguous, mostly near the water, when the meadows were or had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> before flooded. My conjectures were various, until I saw a crow pecking at something in a field, which I heard to cry; when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> to the place, I found a frog of the common size, which the crow (of the carrion kind) would soon have killed and gorged, had I not disturbed her, and chafed her away.\n\n\"About this time I found in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEADOW\">meadow</a> the bowels of a frog indigested, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> as the chitterlings of a calf or pig; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> I write upon, though not translucid. I took it up, and placed it in a paper exposed to the air; leaving it in some grass where I found it, till my return that way in three days' time,\"\nNOS\n\nNostradamus, when I saw it changed to that tremulous jelly-like substance, the alga or star-shot. I was much pleased with this discovery, and took it home in my pocket wrapped in a paper, where I showed it to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of young persons of which I was a member, who agreed with my sentiments of its being the indigestible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a frog digested by some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> of prey.\n\n\"To corroborate my sentiments of this alga being the bowels of a frog, I luckily saw some of it lying by the side of a brook, where I lighted and took it up, and to my great surprise found attached to the jelly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, heart, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a>, and one leg of the frog, which had been (I presume) digested by some carrion crow, who frequented the flooded grounds to pick up <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a> and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMIN\">vermin</a>. There was also some of it found on an apple tree at Wyton Magna, near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEICESTER\">Leicester</a>, where I then lived, which, no doubt, was digested by some owl.\"\n\nDr Darwin, in his Poem on the Loves of the Plants, is of the same opinion with Mr Platt, that these gelatinous substances are of an animal nature, and that the different appearances they put on are owing to various circumstances, viz. the different birds who feed on frogs, the quantity they devour at a time, and the state of digestion before they are voided.","sp":74,"ep":76},{"h":"NOSTRADAMUS","t":"MICHEL, an able physician and a celebrated astrologer, was a Proven\u00e7al, and descended of a noble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and born Dec. 14, 1503, at St Remy, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVIGNON\">Avignon</a>. By his grandfather he was initiated in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>. He afterwards completed his course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> at Avignon; and, going thence to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTPELLIER\">Montpellier</a>, he there applied himself to physic, till being forced away by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a> in 1525, he took his route towards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOULOUSE\">Toulouse</a>, and paffed on till he came to Bordeaux. This course held him five years, during which he undertook the cure of all such patients as were willing to put themselves under his care. After this he returned to Montpellier, and was created <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> in 1529, and then revisited the same places where he had practised physic before. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGEN\">Agen</a> he contracted an acquaintance with Julius Caesar Scaliger, which induced him to make some stay in that town, and there he entered into matrimony; but having buried his wife, and two children which she brought him, he quitted Agen after a residence of about four years. He returned into Provence, and fixed himself first at Marfeilles; but his friends having provided an advantageous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a> for him at Salon, he transported himself thither in 1544. In 1546, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIX\">Aix</a> being afflicted with the plague, he went thither at the solicitation of the inhabitants, and was of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>; particularly by a powder of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>: so that the town in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> gave him a considerable pension for several years after the contagion ceased. Returning afterwards to Salon, he became a recluse, and made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of his leisure to apply himself to his studies. He had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> followed the trade of a conjurer occasionally; and now he began to think himself inspired, and miraculously illuminated with a prospect into futurity. As fast as these illuminations had discovered to him any future event, he entered it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, in simple prose, but by enigmatical sentences, as he declared himself; but reviving them afterwards, he thought the sentences would appear more respectable, and would favour more of a prophetic spirit, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they were expressed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>. Nostradamus. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> determined him to throw them all into quatrains, and he afterwards ranged them into centuries. When this was done, he hesitated about making them public, till reflecting that the time of many events which he had foretold was very near at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, he determined to print them. This he did with a dedication addressed to his son Caesar, an infant only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> months old, in the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a>, dated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1, 1555. This first edition, which is included in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> centuries, was printed by Rigault at Lyons. He prefixed his name in Latin, but gave to his son Caesar the name as it is pronounced, Notrada-me.\n\nThe public were divided in their sentiments of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>: many looked upon the author as a simple visionary or a fool; while he was accused of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> art, or black <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGIC\">magic</a>, by others, and treated as an impious person, who held a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a>: at the same time there were not wanting such, and those in great numbers, who believed him to be really and truly endowed with the supernatural gift of prophecy. Lastly, some were found who remained in suspense, and refrained from giving any judgment at all upon the point. However, Henry II. and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> Catharine of Medicis his mother, were resolved to see our prophet; and, receiving orders to that effect, he presently repaired to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>. He was very graciously received at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>; and, besides the extraordinary respect that was paid to him, received a present of 200 crowns. He was sent afterwards to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOIS\">Blois</a>, to make a visit to his majesty's children there, and report what he should be able to discover concerning their destinies. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> doubt he exerted himself to the utmost on the occasion; but what his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> was is not known; however, it is certain, he returned to Salon loaded with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> and presents. Animated with his success, he augmented his work from 300 quatrains to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of a complete millade, and published it with a dedication to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> in 1558. That <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> dying the next year of a wound which he received, as is well known, at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOURNAMENT\">tournament</a>, the book of our prophet was immediately consulted; and in the 37th quatrain of the first century this unfortunate event was found predicted in the following verse:\n\nLe lion jeune le vieux surmontera,\nEn champ bellique par singulier <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUEL\">duel</a>,\nDans <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAGE\">cage</a> d'or les yeux lui crevera,\nDeux classes une puis mourir, mort cruelle.\n\nSo remarkable a prediction added new wings to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>; and he was honoured shortly after with a visit from Emanuel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Savoy and the princess Margaret of France his consort. From this time Nostradamus found himself even overburdened with visitors, and his fame made every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> new acquisitions. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> IX., coming to Salon, was eager above all things to have a sight of him. Nostradamus, who then was in waiting as one of the retinue of the magistrates, being instantly presented to his majesty, complained of the little esteem his countrymen had for him; whereupon the monarch publicly declared, that he should hold the enemies of Nostradamus to be his enemies, and desired to see his children. Nor did that prince's favour stop here; in passing, not long after, through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARLES\">Arles</a>, he sent for Nostradamus, presented him with a purse of 200 crowns,\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, together with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREVET\">brevet</a>, constituting him his physician in ordinary, with the same appointment as the reft.\n\nBut our prophet enjoyed these honours only for the space of fifteen months, for he died <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 2, 1566, at Salon. Besides his \"Centuries,\" we have the following compositions of his: A Treatise de Fardemens et de Senteurs, 1552.\u2014A Book of singular Receipts, pour Entretenir la Sant\u00e9 du Corps, 1556.\u2014A piece des Confitures, 1557.\u2014A French Translation of the Latin of Galen's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAPHRASE\">Paraphrase</a>, exhorting Menodolas to Study, especially to that of Physic, 1552.

Lastly, After his death there came out The eleventh and twelfth Centuries of his Quatrains, added to the former ten, which had been printed three times in two separate parts.

In 1678 he went to Rome, with the permission of the French king, to improve his skill; but he found nothing there comparable to what he himself had done. Pope Innocent XI. resolved to see Le Nostre, and gave him a pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> audience; at the conclusion of which Le Nostre said, \"I have seen the two greatest men in the world, your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a>, and the king my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>.\" \"There is a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>,\" answered the pope: \"The king is a great victorious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>; and I am a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> of the servants of God.\" Le Nostre, charmed with this answer, and forgetting who he was with, clasped the pope on the shoulder, saying, \"Reverend father, you look extremely well, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> live to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> all the sacred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>.\" The pope laughed at his prediction.

Cicero, who was at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a>, placed notarii, or expert shorthand writers, in different parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, to take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the speech; and this was the first public occasion which we find recorded of employing shorthand writers among the Romans. It is unnecessary to observe, that hence proceeded the name of notary still in use.\n\nThere were three kinds of notes for shorthand writing used by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, either for dispatch or secrecy. The first and most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> was that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIEROGLYPHICS\">hieroglyphics</a>, which are rather images or representations of things than of words. (See Hieroglyphics.) The Chinese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> are of this kind, and may with greater propriety be called nota than liter\u00e6, as appears from what hath been already advanced.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of notes were called singulares, from their expressing words by single letters. Servius Ursatus has compiled a very copious collection of such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABBREVIATIONS\">abbreviations</a>, of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> there are several editions.\n\nThe third kind of notes were called nota Tironian\u00e6, from Tiro the freed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of Cicero, who was excellently skilled in this art; and it is to him that we are indebted for the preservation of Cicero's letters, of which a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> still remain, and one entire book of them written to Tiro himself.\n\nFrom books it appears, that notes were very frequent among the Romans, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in use to the 10th and 11th centuries. We have indeed but few books remaining that are written in shorthand; but this is not surprising, when such was the unhappy situation of early ages, that either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> condemned them to the flames as the works of impious magicians or necromancers, or they were left to be devoured by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMIN\">vermin</a>, through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> and stupidity, which was so very great, that some people, as Trithemius affirms, looked upon notes in those days as the elements of the Armenian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. It is probable, however, that there are writings of this sort still extant, which might contribute to enrich the republic of letters.\n\nThere are several MSS. and instruments written in these kind of nota, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> library at Paris. In the year 1747, the learned and ingenious Monf. Charpentier, engraved and published at Paris a capitulary, and 54 charters of Louis the Pious, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> and king of France, written in these nota Tironian\u00e6. To this work the learned editor hath prefixed an Alphabetum Tironianum, together with a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> and variety of notes or marks for the different parts of speech, and rules for acquiring the art of writing in these kind of notes. Valerius Probus, in his book De Literis Antiquis, explains many of the characters used by the shorthand writers; and there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DICTIONARY\">dictionary</a> of them set forth by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JANUS\">Janus</a> Gruterus. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STENOGRAPHY\">Stenography</a>.","sp":77,"ep":77},{"h":"NOTARI","t":"persons employed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> to take, by nota, trials and pleadings in their courts of judicature, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> to write as amanuenses from the mouth of an author. These notarii were of servile condition. Under the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTINIAN\">Justinian</a>, they were formed into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> or corporate body. Notarii were also appointed to attend the prefects, to transcribe for them. There were likewise notarii domici, who were employed in keeping...\nkeeping the accounts of the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>; and when the empire became Christian, there were notaries for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, who attested the acts of archbishops, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>, and other spiritual dignitaries. We find ecclesiastical notaries at Rome, under Pope Julius IV. and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Antioch, about the year 370. From these notaries is derived the office of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> to the bishops; afterwards almost every advocate was admitted a notary.\n\n**NOTARY (Notarius),** signifies a person, usually some scrivener, who takes notes, or frames short draughts of contracts, obligations, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a> parties, or other writings. At present we call him a notary public, who publicly attests deeds or writings, in order to make them authentic in another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>: but he is principally employed in business concerning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>; as making protests of bills of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a>, &c.

He is worthy of being mentioned only as he was progenitor to that sovereign whose overthrow conferred upon Alexander the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Great.\n\n**NOTION,** a word which in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> is considered as of the same import with idea. This, however, is improper. Notion comprehends the meaning of idea, but it denotes much more. We have a notion of spirit, of power, of solidity; but of these things we can have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>. Ideas are relics of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>; but there are objects of knowledge which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> under the cognizance of no sense; of these objects, however, we may have very distinct notions either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> or relative.

It extends in length 48 miles, 25 in breadth, and 110 in compass; containing 560,000 acres, 8 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a>, 9 market <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, 168 parishes, 450 villages, about 25,611 houses, and 140,350 inhabitants. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> county in England enjoys a pleasanter and healthier <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. As for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, it differs widely in different parts of the county. Towards the west, where lies the forest of Sherwood, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a>; and therefore that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the county is called by the inhabitants the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">Sand</a>; but the south and east parts, watered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENT\">Trent</a> and the rivulets that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into it, are clayey; and for that reason are called by the inhabitants the Clay. The latter is fruitful both in corn and pasture; but the former produces little besides wood, coal, and some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>. The county has a variety of commodities and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>, tallow, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, cheese, coal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARL\">marl</a>, cattle, malt, liquorice, stockings, glass, earthen wares, and strong ale. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> are the Trent and Idle. The Trent, whose name is supposed to be derived from the French or Latin word signifying thirty, either because it receives thirty smaller rivers, or has thirty different sorts of fish in it, is inferior to no river in England, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVERN\">Severn</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a>, and Humber. It enters the county on the south-west, and passes through it to the north-east, where it enters Lincolnshire, and after a long course falls at last into the Humber. The Idle rises in Sherwood forest, and after traversing the northern part of the county, falls into the Trent upon the borders of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.\n\nThe spacious forest of Sherwood lies in the west part of the county, and indeed takes up the greatest part of it. It was formerly so thick, that it was hardly passable; but now it is much thinner. It feeds an infinite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of deer and stags; and has some towns in it, of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANSFIELD\">Mansfield</a> is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a>. It abounds in coal, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> lies through it for thirty miles together. Since the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> Edward I., the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> and gentry have had grants of it. It was governed by a great number of officers under the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Chesterfield, chief forester; whose ancestor, Sir John Stanhope, had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> of it, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to destroy and kill at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, reserving only a hundred deer in the whole walk. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEWCASTLE\">Newcastle</a> is now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEWARD\">steward</a> and keeper. The principal town is\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTTINGHAM\">NOTTINGHAM</a>,** which gives name to the county. It is a handsome town, and a county of itself by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a>. The name is derived from the Saxon word Snottengham, which signifies cavern, from the caves and apartments anciently dug in the rocks on which the town stands. These, being soft, easily yield to the spade and pickaxe;\nwhence the townsmen have excellent cellars for the vast quantities of malt liquors made here, and sent, as well as their malt, to most parts of England. The situation of the town is very pleasant, having meadows on one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and hills of a gentle easy ascent, on the other. It is well supplied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>, both wood and coal, from the forest; and with fish by the Trent, which runs about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> to the south of it, and has been made navigable for barges; so that they receive by it not only great quantities of cheese from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARWICKSHIRE\">Warwickshire</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFFORDSHIRE\">Staffordshire</a>; but all their heavy goods from the Humber, and even from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HULL\">Hull</a>. Over the Trent is a stately <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> of 19 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a>, where the river is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and deep, having received the addition of the Dove, the Derwent, the Irwell, and the Soar, three of them great rivers of themselves, which fall into it after its passing by Burton in Staffordshire.\n\nThe town is of great antiquity, and it had formerly a strong castle, in which the Danes, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the heptarchy, held out a siege against Buthred king of Mercia, Alfred, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ETHELRED\">Ethelred</a> his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, king of the West Saxons.\n\nSoon after the Conquest, William either repaired this fortress, or built a new one on the same spot, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> year of his reign, probably to secure a retreat on his expedition against Edwin earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHESTER\">Chester</a> and Morcar earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHUMBERLAND\">Northumberland</a>, who had revolted. He committed the custody of it to William Peverell, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> son, who has some been considered as the founder. It stands on a steep rock, at the foot of which runs the river Leen.\n\nDeering, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of Nottingham, seems very justly to explode the story of the place called Mortimer's Hole, having been made as a hiding place for him; and from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of it, shows that it was meant as a private passage to the castle, to relieve it with men or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> in a siege. He says that it is one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> aircafe, without any room, or even a place to sit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> on. It was by this passage that Edward III. got into the castle and surprised Mortimer and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>; and from hence, and his being carried away through it, it has its name.\n\nEdward IV. greatly enlarged the castle, but did not live to complete the buildings he began. Richard III. finished them.\n\nIt was granted by James I. to Francis earl of Rutland, who pulled down many of the buildings; but it was still of so much strength, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I. in 1642, pitched on it as the place for beginning his operations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>. He set up his standard, first on the walls of the castle, but in two or three days removed it to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> on the north side of the castle, without the wall, on a round spot; after which it was for many years called Standard close, and since, from the name of one who rented it, Nevil's close. Where the standard was fixed, there stood a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> for a considerable time. It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> that it was erected on a place called Derrymount, a little further north than the close <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned; this is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> hill, raised on purpose for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>-mill, which formerly was there. The castle was afterwards sequestrated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, and the trees in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARK\">park</a> cut down.\n\nThis castle was so strong that it was never taken by storm. After the civil war, Cromwell ordered it to be demolished. On the Restoration, the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUCKINGHAM\">Buckingham</a>, whose mother was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> of this Nottingham earl of Rutland, had it restored to him, and sold it to William Cavendish, marquis and afterwards duke of Newcastle. In 1674, he began the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, but died in 1676, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> was not far advanced. However, he had the building of it so much at heart, that he left the revenue of a considerable estate to be applied to that purpose, and it was finished by Henry his son. The expense was about \u00a34,000. It is one of the seats of the present duke of Newcastle.\n\nIn the park, west of the castle, and facing the river Leen, are some remains of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> building (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it may be so called) cut and framed in the rock. Dr Stukeley gives it, as he does most things, to the Britons. Many other ancient excavations have been found in other parts of the rocks.\n\nThe frames for knitting stockings were invented by one William Lea of this county, about the beginning of the 17th century; but not meeting with the encouragement he expected (a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> too common with the first inventors of the most useful arts) he went with several of his workmen to France, on the invitation of Henry IV. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of that king, and the troubles which ensued, prevented <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> being given to the work. Lea died there, and most of his men returned to England. Other attempts were made to steal the trade, without better success, and it has flourished here ever since, and is now carried on to a very considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>. It is noted for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>-races on a fine course on the north side of the town. The corporation is governed by a mayor, recorder, six aldermen, two coroners, two sheriffs, two chamberlains, and twenty-four common-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> men, eighteen of the senior council, and six of the junior; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>-bearer, and two pinders, one for the fields and the other for the meadows. The town being within the jurisdiction of the forest, the former of these pinders is town-woodward, and attends the forest courts. It has three neat churches, the chief of which is St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>'s; and an almshouse, endowed with \u00a3100 a-year, for twelve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> people; with a noble townhouse, surrounded with piazzas. A considerable trade is carried on in glats and earthen wares, and frame stockings, besides the malt, and malt liquors, mentioned above.\n\nMarshal Tallard, when a prisoner in England, was confined to this town and county. In the duke of Newcastle's park there is a ledge of rocks hewn into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, houses, chambers, dove-houses, &c. The altar of the church is natural rock; and between that and the castle there is a hermitage of the like workmanship. Upon the side of a hill there is a very extraordinary fort of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, where you enter at the garret, and ascend to the cellar, which is at the top of the house. Here is a noted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a> founded by John Plumtree Esq. in the reign of Richard II. for thirteen poor old widows. There are four handsome bridges over the Trent and Lind. To keep these in repair, and for other public purposes, the corporation has good estates. This town and Winchelsea both give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of earl to the noble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of Finch. Here <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> king of Scots, when a prisoner in England, resided; and under ground is a vault, called Mortimer's hole because Roger Mortimer, earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> is said to have concealed himself in it, when he was taken and hanged by order of Edward III.

He does not appear to have had the good of the church much at heart; for with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>, knowledge, and eloquence, he might have been peculiarly serviceable to her, had he not with cowardice shrunk from his duty when he dreaded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a>. His ambition to be made a bishop likewise misled him; and what occasioned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOSTASY\">apostasy</a> of most of the first heretics, also occasioned his.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> was a separation from the new bishop, and from those who professed to believe, what Novatian strenuously denied, that the church could receive those again who had been guilty of idolatry. He soon got a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of followers among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAITY\">laity</a>, and some even among the clergy. Novatus, a priest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a>, was one of his party, and having been a party-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> himself against St Cyprian, brought his adherents with him. He got himself consecrated bishop of Rome in a most infamous and clandestine manner, by three weak men whom he had most grossly imposed upon, and one of whom did <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENANCE\">penance</a> for having been concerned in what was so contrary to order, decency, and the rules of the church.\n\nHis designs, however, in this disgraceful affair did not succeed, for he was not acknowledged as bishop of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a>; Cornelius being confirmed in it, whilst he was condemned and excommunicated.

(See Romance.) That the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of those absurd things, which, under this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>, are daily issuing from the press, deserve all the contempt with which they can be treated, is a position which we feel not ourselves inclined to controvert; but we cannot admit that any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> is in itself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDEL\">infidel</a>, merely because numbers have attempted it without success. The heroic poems of Blackmore are universally\nNovel, verfally known to be contemptible performances; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we had before us all the heroic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> that has ever been written, how many thousands of volumes should we have as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> as either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARTHUR\">Arthur</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> Arthur, Elize, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Alfred? Yet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> critic has hitherto dared to maintain, that heroic poetry is an infipid species of writing.\n\nBut to the novel objections have been urged of more importance than its infipidity. It has been often affirmed, with learned solemnity, that the perusal of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOVELS\">novels</a> tends to corrupt the youth of both sexes; to produce effeminacy in men and extravagant notions of the happiness of love in women; that it diverts the minds of the former from more serious and useful studies, and exposes the latter to the arts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEDUCTION\">seduction</a>. That there are too many novels to which this objection is applicable in its full force, is a fact which we are afraid cannot be denied: but when it is admitted, let not these performances be again accused of infipidity; for were they infipid, they could have no such consequences. It is by laying fast hold of the heart that they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> it astray. That a novel might be written so as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> the heart in behalf of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, as much as any one has ever warped it to the side of vice, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> which no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> ever venture to call in question who has any knowledge of human nature; and therefore we are decidedly of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that there may be novels worthy at once of the perusal of inexperienced youth and hoary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>. A critic*, by no means too indulgent to works of fancy, and among whose failings laxity of morals has never been numbered, thus expresses himself on the subject of novel-writing:\n\n\"Their familiar histories may perhaps be made of greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> than the solemnities of professed morality, and convey the knowledge of vice and virtue with more efficacy than axioms and definitions. But if the power of example is so great, as to take possession of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> by a kind of violence, and produce effects almost without the intervention of the will, care ought to be taken, that, when the choice is unrestrained, the best examples only should be exhibited; and that what is likely to operate so strongly, should not be mischievous or uncertain in its effects.\"\n\nWe have said, that the novel professes above all things to exhibit the nature of love and its consequences. Whether this be essential to such performances may perhaps be reasonably questioned: but it has been made an important part of the drama in most novels, and, we think, with great propriety. It is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of the novelist to give a true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of life, diversified only by accidents that daily happen in the world, and influenced by passions and qualities which are really to be found in conversing with mankind. To accomplish this object, he conceives a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> or heroine, whom he places in a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of life, endues with certain qualities of body and mind, and conducts, through many vicissitudes of fortune, either to the summit of happiness or to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABYSS\">abyss</a> of misery, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> which he wishes to excite in his readers. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> novel, this hero or heroine is never placed on a throne, or buried in a cottage; because to the monarch and the cottager no difficulties occur which can deeply interest the majority of readers. But among the virtuous part of the intermediate orders of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, that affection which we call love seldom fails, at some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of life, to take possession of the hearts of both sexes; and wherever it has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, it must be productive of happiness or of misery. In the proper management of this passion consists much of the difficulty of the novel-writer. He must exhibit his hero as feeling all the pangs and pleasures of love, as sometimes animated with hope, and sometimes ready to sink into despair, but always exerting himself to obtain the gratification of his wishes. In doing this, care should be taken, either that he never transgresses the laws of virtue, or at least that he never transgresses them with impunity.\n\n\"It is justly considered as the greatest excellency of art to imitate nature; but it is necessary to distinguish those parts of nature which are most proper for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>: greater care is still required in representing life, which is so often discoloured by passion or deformed by wickedness. If the world be promiscuously described, I cannot perceive (says the great critic already quoted) of what use it can be to read the account; or why it may not be as safe to turn the eye immediately upon mankind, as upon a mirror which shows all that presents itself without discrimination. It is therefore not a sufficient vindication of a character, that it is drawn as it appears; for many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> ought never to be drawn: nor of a narrative, that the train of events is agreeable to observation; for that observation which is called knowledge of the world will be found much more frequently to make men cunning than good. The purpose of these writings is surely not only to show mankind, but to provide that they may be seen hereafter with less hazard; to teach the means of avoiding the snares which are laid by Treachery for Innocence, without ensuring any with for that superiority with which the betrayer flatters his vanity; to give the power of counteracting fraud, without the temptation to practice it; to initiate youth by mock encounters in the art of necessary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>; and to increase <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> without impairing virtue.\n\n\"Many writers, for the sake of following nature, mingle good and bad qualities in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> personages, that they are both equally conspicuous; and as we accompany them through their adventures with delight, and are led by degrees to interest ourselves in their favour, we lose the abhorrence of their faults, because they do not hinder our pleasures, or perhaps regard them with some kindness for being united with so much merit.\u2014There have been men indeed splendidly wicked, whose endowments threw a brightness on their crimes, and whom scarce any villany made perfectly detestable, because they never could be wholly divested of their excellencies: but such have been in all ages the great corrupters of the world; and their resemblance ought no more to be preserved than the art of murdering without pain.\n\n\"In narratives, where historical veracity has no place, there should be exhibited the most perfect idea of virtue; of virtue not angelical, nor above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> (for what we cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> we shall never imitate), but the highest and purest that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> can reach, which, exercised in such trials as the various revolutions of things shall bring upon it, may, by conquering some calamities and enduring others, teach us what we may hope, and what we can perform. Vice (for vice is neces-\nNovel. ceflary to be shown) should always disfigure; nor should the graces of gaiety, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of courage, be so united with it, as to reconcile it to the mind. Wherever it appears, it should raise hatred by the malignity of its practices, and contempt by the meanness of its stratagems; for while it is supported by either parts or spirit, it will seldom be heartily abhorred.\"\n\nIf these observations be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a>, and to us they appear unanswerable, Richardson's Lovelace is a character which ought never to have been drawn. In the graces of gaiety and the dignity of courage, in liberality without profusion, in perseverance and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, he everywhere appears as the first of men; and that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> with which he protects the virtue of his Rosebud, if any intrusion is to be drawn from it, can only lead the admirers of Richardson to believe that another Clarissa might be in perfect safety were she to throw herself upon the honour of another Lovelace. Yet in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of this splendid character there is not one principle upon which confidence can securely rest; and Lovelace, whilst he is admired by the youth of both sexes, and escapes the contempt of all mankind, must excite in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> of the cool moralist sentiments of abhorrence and detestation.\n\nA French critic, speaking of this character, says, \"By turns I could embrace and fight with Lovelace. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a>, his gaiety, his drollery, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARM\">charm</a> and amuse me; his genius confounds me and makes me smile; his wickedness astonishes and enrages me; but at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> I admire as much as I detest him.\" Surely this is not the character which ought to be presented to the inexperienced and ardent mind.\n\nThe most perfect characters which we at present recollect in any novel are Richardson's Graslinson and Fielding's Allworthy. The virtues of the former are perhaps tinged with moral pedantry, if we may use the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>; and the latter suffered himself to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> imposed upon by the arts of the hypocrite and the philosophical coxcomb; but without some defects they would not be human virtues, and therefore no objects of human imitation. Clarissa is an excellent character: she has as much perfection as can be expected in woman, whilst the exhibits, at the same time, some obvious defects.\n\nAs it is the object of the novelist to interest the heart, and to communicate instruction through the medium of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, like a tragedy or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMEDY\">comedy</a>, should be one, exhibiting a hero or heroine, whose success every incident should contribute to forward or to retard. In this respect no work of fancy has ever surpassed the Tom Jones of Fielding. It is constructed upon principles of the soundest criticism, and contains not a single event which does not in some way contribute towards the winding up of the piece. A living author, deeply read in Grecian literature, and far from being prejudiced in behalf of any modern, has been heard to say, that had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> seen Tom Jones, he would have pronounced it a poem perfect in its kind.\n\nAgainst this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> another critic of name has entered his protest, and strenuously maintained that nothing can be a poem which is not written in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>. We shall judge of the truth of this conclusion by comparing it with the principles from which it is deduced. Having laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> as a maxim incontrovertible, that \"the end of poetry is pleasure, to which use itself must be subservient,\" he very justly infers from this idea, that poetry should neglect no advantage that fairly offers itself, of appearing in such a dress or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> as is most taking and agreeable to us. It follows (he says), from the same idea of the end which poetry would accomplish, that not only rhythm, but numbers properly so called, is essential to it, and that it cannot obtain its own purpose unless it be clothed in verse.\"\n\nHe then proceeds to ask, \"What, from this conclusion, are we to think of those novels or romances, as they are called, which have been so current of late through all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>? As they propose pleasure for their end, and prosecute it, besides, in the way of fiction, though without metrical numbers, and generally indeed in harsh and rugged prose, one easily sees what their pretensions are, and under what idea they are ambitious to be received. Yet as they are wholly destitute of measured sounds (to say nothing of their other numberless defects), they can at most be considered but as hasty, imperfect, and abortive poems; whether spawned from the dramatic or narrative species, it may be hard to say.\n\nUnsmiling things one knows not what to call,\nTheir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>'s so equivocal.\n\nHowever, such as they are, those novelties have been generally well received: Some for the real merit of their execution; others, for their amusing subjects; all of them for the gratification they afford, or at least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a>, to a vitiated, pallid, and sickly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, that lack <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> of learned minds, and sure prognostic of expiring letters. But whatever may be the temporary success of these things (for they vanish as fast as they are produced), good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> will acknowledge no work of art but such as is composed according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of its kind.\"\n\nOf this severe criticism the author himself has given us, what amounts to a complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUTATION\">confutation</a>. He tells us, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> looked for so much force and spirit of expression in whatever they dignified with the name of poem, as sometimes to make a question \"whether comedy were rightly referred to this class, because it differed only in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> prose?\" Their doubt (he justly adds) might have been spared or at least resolved, if they had considered that comedy adopts as much of this force and spirit of words as is consistent with the nature and dignity of that pleasure which it pretends to give: For the name of poem will belong to every composition whose primary end is to please, provided it be so constructed as to afford all the pleasure which its kind or fort will permit.\"\n\nIf this decision be just, and we readily admit it, a well composed novel is entitled to the appellation of a poem, though it be written in prose and in a style not remarkable for elevation. The business of the novelist is to interest the heart by a display of the incidents of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> life. In doing this, he must exhibit scenes that are probable, and record speeches that are natural. He is not at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to invent, but only to select, objects, and to cull from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of mankind those individuals upon which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> ought most to be employed. The more closely he adheres to this rule, the more deeply does he interest us in his narrative; because every reader feels at once that it is possible he may at some time or other be in circumstances nearly resembling those of the hero of the tale. But the business of life\nLife is not transacted in pompous language, nor the speeches of real lovers made in verse either rhymed or blank.

Of all the circumstances that raise emotions, not excepting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, nor even Elements of greatness, says <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Kames*, novelty hath the most powerful influence. A new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> produces instantaneously an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a> termed wonder, which totally occupies the mind, and for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> excludes all other objects. Conversation among the vulgar never is more interesting than when it turns upon strange objects and extraordinary events. Men tear themselves from their native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> in search of things rare and new; and novelty converts into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> the fatigues and even perils of travelling. To what cause shall we ascribe these singular appearances? To curiosity undoubtedly; a principle implanted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> for a purpose extremely beneficial, that of acquiring knowledge; and the emotion of wonder raised by new and strange objects, inflames our curiosity to know more of such objects. This emotion is different from admiration: novelty, wherever found, whether in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, is the cause of wonder; admiration is directed to the person who performs anything wonderful.\n\nDuring infancy, every new object is probably the occasion of wonder, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>; because, during infancy, every object at first sight is strange as well as new: but as objects are rendered familiar by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, we cease by degrees to wonder at new appearances, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they have any resemblance to what we are acquainted with; for a thing must be singular as well as new, to raise our wonder. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> multiplying words, we would be understood to comprehend both circumstances when we hereafter talk of novelty.\n\nIn an ordinary train of perceptions, where one thing introduces another, not a single object makes its appearance unexpectedly: the mind thus prepared for the reception of its objects, admits them one after another without perturbation. But when a thing breaks in unexpectedly, and without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of any connection, it raises an emotion, known by the name of surprisal. That emotion may be produced by the most familiar object, as when one unexpectedly meets a friend who was reported to be dead; or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, lately a beggar. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, a new object, however strange, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not produce the emotion, if the spectator be prepared for the sight: an elephant in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> will not surprisal a traveller who goes to see one; and yet its novelty will raise his wonder: an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> would be much surprisal to stumble upon an elephant feeding at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> in the open fields; but the creature itself, to which he was accustomed, would not raise his wonder.\n\nSurprisal thus in several respects differs from wonder: unexpectedness is the cause of the former emotion; novelty is the cause of the latter. Nor differ they less in their nature and circumstances, as will be explained by and by. With relation to one circumstance they perfectly agree; which is, the shortness of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>: the instantaneous production of these emotions in perfection, may contribute to that effect, in conformity to a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, That things soon decay which soon come to perfection: the violence of the emotions may also contribute; for an ardent emotion, which is not susceptible of increase, cannot have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> course. But their short duration is occasioned chiefly by that of their causes: we are soon reconciled to an object, however unexpected; and novelty soon degenerates into familiarity.\n\nWhether these emotions be pleasant or painful, is not a clear point. It may appear strange, that our own feelings and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> qualities should afford any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> for a doubt: but when we are engrossed by any emotion, there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> for speculation; and when sufficiently calm for speculation, it is not easy to recall the emotion with accuracy. New objects are sometimes terrible, sometimes delightful: the terror which a tiger inspires is greatest at first, and wears off gradually by familiarity: on the other hand, even women will acknowledge that it is novelty which pleases the most in a new fashion. It would be rash, however, to conclude, that wonder is in itself neither pleasant nor painful, but that it assumes either quality according to circumstances. An object, it is true, that hath a threatening appearance, adds to our terror by its novelty; but from that experiment it doth not follow, that novelty is in itself disagreeable;\ndifagreeable; for it is perfectly consistent, that we be delighted with an object in one view, and terrified with it in another. A river in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a> swelling over its banks, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> and delightful object; and yet it may produce no small degree of fear when we attempt to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> it: courage and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a> are agreeable; and yet, when we view these qualities in an enemy, they serve to increase our terror. In the same manner, novelty may produce two effects clearly distinguishable from each other: it may, directly and in itself, be agreeable; and it may have an opposite effect indirectly, which is, to inspire terror; for when a new object appears in any degree dangerous, our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of its powers and faculties affords ample scope for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> to dress it in the most frightful colours. The first sight of a lion, for example, may at the same instant produce two opposite feelings, the pleasant emotion of wonder, and the painful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> of terror: the novelty of the object produces the former directly, and contributes to the latter indirectly. Thus, when the subject is analyzed, we find that the power which novelty hath indirectly to inflame terror, is perfectly consistent with its being in every circumstance agreeable. The matter may be put in the clearest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, by adding the following circumstance. If a lion be first seen from a place of safety, the spectacle is altogether agreeable without the least mixture of terror. If, again, the first sight puts us within reach of that dangerous animal, our terror may be so great as quite to exclude any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of novelty. But this fact proves not that wonder is painful: it proves only, that wonder may be excluded by a more powerful passion. Every man may be made certain from his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, that wonder raised by a new object that is inoffensive, is always pleasant; and with respect to offensive objects, it appears, from the foregoing deduction, that the same must hold as long as the spectator can attend to the novelty.\n\nWhether surprise be in itself pleasant or painful, is a question not less intricate than the former. It is certain that surprise inflames our joy when unexpectedly we meet with an old friend; and not less our terror when we stumble upon anything noxious. To clear that question, the first thing to be remarked is, that in some instances an unexpected object overpowers the mind, so as to produce a momentary stupification: where the object is dangerous, or appears so, the sudden alarm it gives, without preparation, is apt totally to unhinge the mind, and for a moment to suspend all its faculties, even thought itself; in which state a man is quite helpless: and if he move at all, is as like to run upon the danger as from it. Surprise carried to such a height, cannot be either pleasant or painful; because the mind, during such momentary stupification, is in a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, if not totally, inensible.\n\nIf we then inquire for the character of this emotion, it must be where the unexpected object or event produceth least violent effects. And while the mind remains sensible of pleasure and pain, is it not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to suppose, that surprise, like wonder, should have an invariable character? It would appear, however, that surprise has no invariable character, but affirms that of the object which raises it. Wonder being an emotion invariably raised by novelty; and being distinguishable from all other emotions, ought naturally to possess one constant character. The unexpected appearance of an object, seems not equally entitled to produce an emotion distinguishable from the emotion, pleasant or painful, that is produced by the object in its ordinary appearance: the effect it ought naturally to have, is only to swell that emotion, by making it more pleasant or more painful than it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> is. And that conjecture is confirmed by experience, as well as by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> which is built upon experience: when a man meets a friend unexpectedly, he is said to be agreeably surprised; and when he meets an enemy unexpectedly, he is said to be disagreeably surprised. It appears, then, that the sole effect of surprise is to swell the emotion raised by the object. And that effect can be clearly explained: a tide of connected perceptions glide gently into the mind, and produce no perturbation; but an object breaking in unexpectedly, founds an alarm, rouses the mind out of its calm state, and directs its whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the object, which, if agreeable, becomes doubly so. Several circumstances concur to produce that effect: on the one hand, the agitation of the mind and its keen attention prepare it in the most effectual manner for receiving a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>: on the other hand, the object, by its sudden and unforeseen appearance, makes an impression, not gradually as expected objects do, but as at one stroke with its whole force. The circumstances are precisely similar where the object is in itself disagreeable (A).\n\nThe pleasure of novelty is easily distinguished from that of variety: to produce the latter, a plurality of objects is necessary; the former arises from a circumstance found in a single object. Again, where objects, whether co-existent or in succession, are sufficiently diversified, the pleasure of variety is complete, though every single object of the train be familiar; but the pleasure of novelty, directly opposite to familiarity, requires no diversification.\n\nThere are different degrees of novelty, and its effects are\n\n---\n\n(A) What Marshal Saxe terms le c\u0153ur humain, is no other than fear occasioned by surprise. It is owing to that cause that an ambush is generally so destructive: intelligence of it beforehand renders it perfectly harmless. The Marshal gives from Caesar's Commentaries two examples of what he calls le c\u0153ur humain. At the siege of Amiens by the Gauls, Caesar came up with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, which did not exceed 7000 men; and began to entrench himself in such hurry, that the barbarians judging him to be afraid, attacked his entrenchments with great spirit. During the time they were filling up the ditch, he issued out with his cohorts, and by attacking them unexpectedly struck a panic that made them fly with precipitation, not a single man offered to make a stand. At the siege of Alesia, the Gauls infinitely superior in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, attacked the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of circumvallation, in order to raise the siege. Caesar ordered a body of his men to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> out silently, and to attack them on the one flank, while he with another body did the same on the other flank. The surprise of being attacked when they expected a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> only, put the Gauls into disorder, and gave an easy victory to Caesar.\nNovelty.\n\nThe lowest degree is found in objects surveyed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> time after a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>; and that in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> an object takes on some appearance of novelty, is certain from experience: a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of many parts variously adorned, or an extensive field embellished with trees, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a>, and other ornaments, will appear new oftener than once: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of an object so complex is soon lost, of its parts at least, or of their arrangement. But experience teaches, that, even without any decay of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a>, absence alone will give an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of novelty to a once familiar object; which is not surprising, because familiarity wears off gradually by absence: thus a person with whom we have been intimate, returning after a long interval, appears like a new acquaintance. And distance of place contributes to this appearance, not less than distance of time: a friend, for example, after a short absence in a remote country, has the same air of novelty as if he had returned after a longer interval from a place nearer home: the mind forms a connexion between him and the remote country, and befalls upon him the singularity of the objects he has seen. For the same reason, when two things equally new and singular are presented, the spectator balances between them; but when told that one of them is the product of a distant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the world, he no longer hesitates, but clings to it as the more singular: hence the preference given to foreign luxuries, and to foreign curiosities, which appear rare in proportion to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> distance.\n\nThe next degree of novelty, mounting upward, is found in objects of which we have some information at second hand; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, though it contribute to familiarity, cannot altogether remove the appearance of novelty when the object itself is presented: the first sight of a lion occasions some wonder, after a thorough acquaintance with the correctness pictures and flatness of that animal.\n\nA new object that bears some distant resemblance to a known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, is an instance of a third degree of novelty: a strong resemblance among individuals of the same species, prevents almost entirely the effect of novelty, unless distance of place or some other circumstance concur; but where the resemblance is faint, some degree of wonder is felt, and the emotion rises in proportion to the faintness of the resemblance.\n\nThe highest degree of wonder arises from unknown objects that have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> to any species we are acquainted with. Shakespeare in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIMILE\">simile</a> introduces that species of novelty:\n\nAs glorious to the sight\nAs is a winged messenger from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>\nUnto the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> up-turned wond'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> eye\n\nOf mortals, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> back to gaze on him,\nWhen he belrides the lazy pacing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a>,\nAnd fails upon the bosom of the air.\n\nRomeo and Juliet.\n\nOne example of that species of novelty deserves peculiar attention; and that is, when an object altogether new is seen by one person only, and but once. These circumstances heighten remarkably the emotion: the singularity of the spectator concurs with the singularity of the object, to inflame wonder to its highest pitch.\n\nIn explaining the effects of novelty, the place a being occupies in the scale of existence, is a circumstance that must not be omitted. Novelty in the individuals of a low class is perceived with indifference, or with a very slight emotion: thus a pebble, however singular in its appearance, scarcely moves our wonder. The emotion rises with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of the object; and, other circumstances being equal, is strongest in the highest order of existence; a strange insect affects us more than a strange vegetable; and a strange quadruped more than a strange insect.\n\nHowever natural novelty may be, it is a matter of experience, that those who relish it the most are careful to conceal its influence. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">Love</a> of novelty, it is true, prevails in children, in idlers, and in men of shallow understanding: and yet, after all, why should one be ashamed of indulging a natural propensity? A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a> will afford a satisfactory answer. No man is ashamed of curiosity when it is indulged to acquire knowledge. But to prefer anything merely because it is new, shows a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> which one ought to be ashamed of: vanity is commonly at the bottom, which leads those who are deficient in taste to prefer things odd, rare, or singular, in order to distinguish themselves from others. And in fact, that appetite, as above mentioned, reigns chiefly among persons of a mean taste, who are ignorant of refined and elegant pleasures.\n\nOf this taste we have some memorable instances in men of the highest and the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>. Lucian tells the following story of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a> I, which is as disgraceful to him, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> to his subjects. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> had ramfacked the world for two curiosities; one was a camel from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACTRIA\">Bactria</a> all over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>; the other a man, half black half white. These he presented to the people in a public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>, thinking they would give them as much satisfaction as they did him; but the black monster, instead of delighting them, affrighted them; and the party-coloured man raised the contempt of some and the abhorrence of others. Ptolemy, finding the Egyptians preferred symmetry and beauty to\n\nA third may be added not less memorable. In the year 846, an obstinate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> was fought between Xamire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Leon and Abdoulrahman the Moorish king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>. After a very long conflict the night only prevented the Arabians from obtaining a complete victory. The king of Leon, taking advantage of the darkness, retreated to a neighbouring hill, leaving the Arabians masters of the field of battle. Next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, perceiving that he could not maintain his place for want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, nor be able to draw off his men in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of a victorious army, he ranged his men in order of battle, and, without losing a moment, marched to attack the enemy, resolving to conquer or die. The Arabians, astonished to be attacked by those who were conquered the night before, lost all heart: fear succeeded to astonishment, the panic was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>, and they all turned their backs without almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>.\nNovelty to the most astonishing productions of art or nature without them, wisely removed his two enormous titles out of sight; the neglected camel died in a little time, and the man he gave for a song to the musician Thespis.\n\nOne <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> cause of wonder, hinted above, is, that this emotion is intended to stimulate our curiosity. Another, somewhat different, is, to prepare the mind for receiving deep impressions of new objects. An acquaintance with the various things that may affect us, and with their properties, is essential to our well-being: nor will a slight or superficial acquaintance be sufficient; they ought to be so deeply engraved on the mind, as to be ready for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> upon every occasion. Now, in order to a deep impression, it is wisely contrived, that things should be introduced to our acquaintance with a certain pomp and solemnity productive of a vivid emotion. When the impression is once fairly made, the emotion of novelty being no longer necessary, vanishes almost instantaneously; never to return, unless where the impression happens to be obliterated by length of time or other means; in which case the second introduction hath nearly the same solemnity with the first.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGNING\">Designing</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> is nowhere more eligible than in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the human frame. If new objects did not affect us in a very peculiar manner, their impressions would be so slight as scarce to be of any use in life: on the other hand, did objects continue to affect us as deeply as at first, the mind would be totally engrossed with them, and have no room left either for action or reflection.\n\nThe final cause of surprize is still more evident than of novelty. Self-love makes us vigilantly attentive to self-preservation; but self-love, which operates by means of reason and reflection, and impels not the mind to any particular object or from it, is a principle too cool for a sudden emergency; an object breaking in unexpectedly, affords no time for deliberation; and in that case, the agitation of surprize comes in seasonably to rouse self-love into action: surprize gives the alarm; and if there be any appearance of danger, our whole force is instantly summoned to shun or to prevent it.","sp":83,"ep":86},{"h":"NOVEMVIRI","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> magistrates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> lasted but for one year.

It was formerly called Great Novgorod, to distinguish it from other Russian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> of a similar appellation; and now presents to the attentive and intelligent traveller a striking instance of fallen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>. According to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NESTOR\">Nestor</a>, the earliest of the Russian historians, it was built at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> with Kiev, namely, in the middle of the 5th century, by a Slavonian horde, who, according to Procopius, issued from the banks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOLGA\">Volga</a>. Its antiquity is clearly proved.\nNovgorod proved by a passage in the Gothic historian Jornandes, in which it is called Civitas Nova, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> new town. We have little insight into its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> before the ninth century, when Ruric the first great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Rusia reduced it, and made it the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> of his vast dominion. The year subsequent to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, which happened in 879, the seat of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> was removed, under his son Igor, then an infant, to Kiof; and Novgorod <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, for above a century, under the jurisdiction of governors nominated by the great dukes, until 979, when Svatolaf, the son of Igor, created his third son Vladimir duke of Novgorod: the latter, succeeding his father in the throne of Rusia, ceded the town to his son Yaroslav, who in 1036 granted to the inhabitants very considerable privileges, that laid the foundation of that extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> which they afterwards gradually obtained. From this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> Novgorod was for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time governed by its own dukes: these sovereigns were at first subordinate to the great dukes, who resided at Kiof and Volodimir; but afterwards, as the town increased in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> and wealth, they gradually usurped an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> independency. Its independency, however, was not perpetual. It continued, indeed, in a flourishing state until the middle of the 15th century: but the great dukes of Rusia, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> had reigned over this town, and who still retained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of dukes of Novgorod, having transferred their residence from Kiof to Volodimir, and afterwards to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSCOW\">Moscow</a>, laid claim to its feudal sovereignty; a demand which the inhabitants sometimes put off by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, sometimes by resistance, but were sometimes compelled to acknowledge. At length, however, the great duke became absolute sovereign of Novgorod, though the ostensible forms of government were still preserved. It even then, however, continued to be the largest and most commercial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Rusia; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of which we have as late as the year 1554, from the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of Richard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">Chancellor</a>, who passed through it in 1554 in his way to Moscow. \"Next unto Moscow, the city of Novgorod is reputed the chiefest of Rusia; for although it be in majesty inferior to it, yet in greatness it goeth beyond it. It is the chiefest and greatest mart town of all Muscovy; and albeit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>'s seat is not there, but at Moscow, yet the commodiousness of the river, falling into that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> which is called Sinus Finicus, whereby it is well frequented by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>, makes it more famous than Moscow itself.\" An idea of its population during this period, when compared with its present declined state, is manifest from the fact, that in 1568 above 15,000 persons died of an epidemical disorder; more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of its present inhabitants. In its most flourishing condition it contained at least 400,000 souls.

As Novgorod was built after the manner of the ancient towns in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, in the Asiatic style, this rampart, like that of the Slavonogorod at Moscow, probably enclosed several interior circles. Without it was a vast extensive suburb, which reached to the distance of six miles, and included within its circuit all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONVENTS\">convents</a> and churches, the ancient ducal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> and other structures, that now make a splendid but solitary appearance, as they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> scattered in the adjacent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>.\n\nNovgorod stretches on both sides of the Volkof, a beautiful river of considerable depth and rapidity, and somewhat broader than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINDSOR\">Windsor</a>.

On the contrary, a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of Pagan priests is maintained for them in every village, who have soldiers in pay to assist them in the affairs of their religion. This is a very singular instance of toleration among Mahometans, and what we should little have expected from such barbarous and languid wretches as those who have the supreme power in Sennaar, had not our observing traveller informed us, that these men themselves knew almost nothing of the religion which they profess, and are in their hearts rather Pagans than Mahometans.\n\nThe idolatry of the Nuba is described as a mixture of Sabism and statue worship: but what is very uncommon, their worship is chiefly paid to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, while they pay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> either rising or setting, advancing to the meridian or receding from it. It is an old observation, that the worship of every people is tinged by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> dispositions; and this is verified in the Nuba. \"That their worship is performed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> and satisfaction, is obvious (says our author) every night that the moon shines. Coming out from the darkness of their huts, they say a few words upon seeing her brightness, and testify great joy, by motions of their feet and hands, at the first appearance of the new moon.\" This is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> what we should have expected from their gentleness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a>. They worship likewise a tree and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>; but our author could never discover what tree or stone; only he learned that neither of them exists in Sennaar, but in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> where the Nuba are born. Such of them as are natives of the villages where he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> them, become, like their masters, nominal Mahometans.\u2014The rest practice the idolatrous worship of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, and are much under the influence of their priests, from fear rather than from affection. They are immoderately fond of swine's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a>, and maintain great herds of small hogs, marked with black and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> spots. Few of the Nuba advance higher than to be soldiers and officers in their own corps; and the Mek maintains about 12,000 of them near Sennaar to keep the Arabs in subjection. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> so violent as that which they inhabit, there is very little need of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>; and it is happy for them that such is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, for in the whole country there is not a single tree, or turf, or any thing resembling it.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> known to the Europeans are Dangola and Sennar.\n\nIt is famous for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of horses the most powerful and docile in the world. These animals are generally about fifteen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>; and by Mr Bruce, who has given the most scientific account of them, they are said to be the breed which was introduced into Nubia at the Saracen conquest, and has been preserved unmixed to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. Our author represents this as a much nobler animal than the Arabian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>. \"What <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> (says he) the Nubian horse would make in point of fleetness is very doubtful, his make being so entirely different from that of the Arabian; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> beautiful symmetry of parts, great size and strength, the most agile, nervous, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> movements, great endurance of fatigue, docility of temper, and seeming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to men beyond that of any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> animal, can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> anything for a stallion, the Nubian is above all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> the most eligible in the world.\" He thinks, and justly thinks, that an attempt should at least be made to import them into this kingdom. \"The expense (he says) would not be great, though there might be some trouble and application necessary: but if adroitly managed, there would not be much even of that. The Nubiens are very jealous in keeping up the pedigree of their horses, which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, but a vast proportion of the former to the latter.\" Our author never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> which we call gray, i.e., dappled; but he has seen some bright bays, and some inclined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAN\">roan</a>. All noble horses in Nubia are said to be descended of one of the five upon which Mahomet and his four immediate successors, Abu Bekr, Omar, Atmen, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALI\">Ali</a>, fled from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECCA\">Mecca</a> to Medina the night of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEGIRA\">Hegira</a>. No one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> pay much regard to this legendary tale, or believe that the strength and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of this breed of horses is owing to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> communicated to the first of them by the prophet and his apostles. Mr Bruce accounts for their excellence upon rational principles. \"The best horses of the Arabian breed are found (he says) in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of Mowelli and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNECY\">Annecy</a>, which is about 36\u00b0 north latitude. Dangola, which is in 20\u00b0 latitude, seemed to him to be the centre of excellence for this noble animal.\" Hence he infers, that the bounds in which the horse is in greatest perfection, are between the 20th and 36th degrees of latitude, and between 30 degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> east from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a> and the banks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUPHRATES\">Euphrates</a>. If to the effects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> we add the manner of feeding the Nubian horses, we shall perhaps have the true cause of their superiority over all others. \"They are kept fat upon dora, and suffered to eat nothing green but the short roots of grass that are to be found by the side of the Nile, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> has withered it. This is dug out where it is covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and appears blanched, and laid in small heaps once a day on the ground before them.\"","sp":89,"ep":89},{"h":"NUBIAN DESERT","t":"a vast tract of barren rocks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> sands, extending from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYENE\">Syene</a> in Upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> to Geon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of Berber in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUBIA\">Nubia</a>.

Its breadth from east to west has not, as far as we know, been precisely ascertained. Through this horrid region, where nothing is to be seen which has the breath of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, mult all travellers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> from Sennar to Egypt; in danger every moment of perishing by thirst, being overwhelmed by moving columns of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, suffocated by a hot and poisonous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, or cut in pieces by troops of wandering Arabs. The last European of whom we have heard that made the journey and lived to give an account of it, is Mr Bruce; and the person must have neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> who can read unmoved his manly narrative.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> single traveller, nor even a caravan, can enter with safety into this desert, but under the protection of a Hybear; whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> and office are thus explained by Mr Bruce: \"A Hybear is a guide, from the Arabic word Hubbar, which signifies to inform, instruct, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a>, because they are used to do this office to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARAVANS\">caravans</a> travelling through the desert in all directions. They are men of great consideration, knowing perfectly the situation and properties of all kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> to be met with on the route, the distance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELLS\">wells</a>, whether occupied by enemies or not; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> so, the way to avoid them with the least inconvenience. It is also necessary that they should know the places occupied by the Siroom, and the seasons of its blowing (see Siroom), as well as those occupied by moving sands.\"\u2014Under the conduct of one of these men, Mr Bruce, with infinite fortitude and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, passed through the desert in the year 1772, surmounting dangers at which one shudders in his closet. Of these, the following, which we shall give in the nervous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of the author, may serve as an instance.\n\n\"We were here (at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> called Wezhi al Helleb)\nNUC\n\nat once surprized and terrified by a sight surely one of the most magnificent in the world. In that vast expanse of desert, from W. and to NW. of us, we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of prodigious pillars of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> at different distances, at times moving with great celerity, at others stalking on with a majestic slowness. At intervals we thought they were coming in a very few minutes to overwhelm us; and small quantities of sand did actually more than once reach us. Again they would retreat so as to be almost out of sight; their tops reaching to the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a>. There the tops often separated from the bodies; and these once disjointed, dispersed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and did not appear more. Sometimes they were broken in the middle as if struck with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> cannon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a>. About noon they began to advance with considerable swiftness upon us, the wind being very strong at north. Eleven, of them ranged alongside of us about the distance of three miles. The greatest diameter of the largest appeared to me at that distance as if it would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> 10 feet. They retired from us with a wind at SE. leaving an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> upon my mind to which I can give no name; though surely one ingredient in it was fear, with a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of wonder and astonishment.\n\nIf it be true, as the author of A Philosophical Inquiry into the Origin of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">Ideas</a> of the Sublime and Beautiful affirms, that \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> raised by the sublime is astonishment, and that astonishment is that state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> in which all its motions are suspended with some degree of horror,\" surely a more sublime spectacle was never presented to mortal eyes, than that which was on this occasion presented to Mr Bruce. It must have been awfully majestic; but few, we believe, would choose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of contemplating such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of magnificence at the hazard of that dreadful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> with which at every moment it threatened our traveller and his attendants. He, indeed, had firmness of mind to stand still and admire it; but his companions shrieked out; while some of them exclaimed that it was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of judgement, and others that it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELL\">hell</a> or the world set on fire. But for a more particular account of this phenomenon, as well as of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the desert and the proper way of passing it, we must refer to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> from which this short sketch is taken.","sp":89,"ep":90},{"h":"NUCLEUS","t":"in general, denotes the kernel of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> even any seed enclosed within a husk.

Its effects are indeed so beneficial, that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> is little surprising among a people so totally ignorant of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> causes as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> Egyptians, for it is acknowledged, by the most enlightened travellers, to stop the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>, and announce a speedy and plentiful inundation of the country. These effects are thus rationally accounted for by Mr Bruce.\n\n\"In February and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> is on its approach to the zenith of one extremity of Egypt, and of course has a very considerable influence upon the other. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a> having now fallen low, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> in certain old cisterns, which, though they still exist, are suffered to accumulate all the filth of the river, becomes putrid, and the river itself has lost all its finer and volatile parts by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of a vertical fun; so that instead of being subject to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>, it grows daily more and more inclined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a>. About St John's day it receives a plentiful mixture of the fresh and fallen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> from Ethiopia, which dilutes and refreshes the almost corrupted river; and the fun near at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> exerts its influence upon the water, which is now become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> enough to be exhaled, though it has still with it a mixture of the corrupted fluid. It is in February, March, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> April only, that the plague begins in Egypt.\" Our philosophical traveller does not believe it an endemic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>; but affirms very sufficient reasons for thinking that it comes from Constantinople with merchandise or with passengers at the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the year when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> absence of dews, has attained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of putridity proper to receive it. In this state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, the infection continues to rage till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of St John's day, when it is suddenly checked by the dews occasioned by a refreshing mixture of rain water, which is poured into the Nile at the beginning of the inundation. The first and most remarkable sign of the change effected in the air, is the sudden stopping of the plague. Every person, though shut up from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> for months before, buys, sells, and communicates with his neighbour without any sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>; and as far as our author could learn upon fair inquiry, it was never known that one fell sick of the plague after the anniversary of St John. He admits that some have died of it after that period; but of them the disease had got such hold, under the most putrid influence of the air, that they could not recover. To corroborate this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, which attributes so much to the benign influence of the falling dew, he observes, that immediately after St John's day, the clothes of the many thousands who have died during the late continuance of the plague are publicly exposed in the market <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>; and that all these, though consisting of furs, cotton, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, and woollen cloths, which are the stuffs most retentive of infection, imbibing the moist air of the evening and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, are handled, bought, put on and worn, without any apprehension of danger, and without a single accident being known to have happened to any one professed of this happy confidence.","sp":90,"ep":90},{"h":"NUDITIES","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>, those parts of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> which are not covered with any drapery; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> those parts where the carnation appears.","sp":90,"ep":90},{"h":"NULLITY","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">Law</a>, signifies any thing that is null <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> void; thus there is a nullity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, where persons marry within the degrees, or where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> marry without consent of their parents or guardians.","sp":90,"ep":90},{"h":"NUMA POMPILIUS","t":"the fourth son of Pompilius Pompo, an illustrious Sabine. He had married Tatia, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> Tatius, and together with her remained in his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, preferring the tranquillity of a private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> to the splendour of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>. Upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his wife, with whom he had lived thirteen years, he gave himself up entirely to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>; and, leaving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Cures, confined himself to the country, wandering from solitude to solitude, in search only of those woods and fountains which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> had made sacred. His recluse life gave rise to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a>, which was very early received among the Sabines, that Numa lived in familiarity with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NYMPH\">nymph</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGERIA\">Egeria</a>. Upon the death of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMULUS\">Romulus</a>, both the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>...\nNuma senate and people strongly solicited him to be their king. They despatched Julius Proculus and Valerius Volefus, two senators of distinction, to acquaint Numa with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>, and make him an offer of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. The Sabine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> rejected at first their proposal; but being at last prevailed upon by the arguments and entreaties of the deputies, joined with those of his father and of Martius his near relation, he yielded; and having offered sacrifices to the gods, set out for Rome, where he was received by all ranks of people with loud shouts of joy. Spurius Vettius, the interrex for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, having assembled the curiae, he was elected in due form, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> was unanimously confirmed by the senate.\n\nThe beginning of his reign was popular; and he dismissed the 300 bodyguards which his predecessor had kept around his person, and observed, that he did not distrust a people who had compelled him to reign over them. He was not, like Romulus, fond of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> expeditions, but he applied himself to tame the ferocity of his subjects, to inculcate in their minds a reverence for the Deity, and to quell their dissensions by dividing all the citizens into different classes. He established different orders of priests, and taught the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> not to worship the Deity by images; and from his example <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> graven <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> painted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a> appeared in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a> or sanctuaries of Rome for the space of 160 years. He encouraged the report that was spread of his paying regular visits to the nymph Egeria, and made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of her name to give sanction to the laws and institutions which he had introduced. He established the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> of the vestals, and told the Romans that the safety of the empire depended upon the preservation of the sacred ancyle or shield, which, as was generally believed, had dropped from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>. He dedicated a temple to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JANUS\">Janus</a>, which, during his whole reign, remained shut as a mark of peace and tranquillity at Rome. After a reign of 42 years, in which he had given every possible encouragement to the useful arts, and in which he had cultivated peace, Numa died in the year of Rome 82. Not only the Romans, but also the neighbouring nations, were eager to pay their last offices to a monarch whom they revered for his abilities, moderation, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>. He forbade his body to be burnt according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of the Romans; but he ordered it to be buried near Mount Janiculum, with many of the books which he had written. These books were accidentally found by one of the Romans, about 400 years after his death; and as they contained nothing new or interesting, but merely the reasons why he had made innovations in the form of worship and in the religion of the Romans, they were burnt by order of the senate. He left behind him one daughter called Pomponia, who married Numa Marcius, and became the mother of Ancus Marcius the fourth king of Rome. Some say that he had also four sons; but this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> is ill founded. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> laws of King Numa, mentioned by different authors, are, 1. That the gods should be worshipped with corn and a salted cake. 2. That whoever knowingly killed a free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, should be held as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARRICIDE\">parricide</a>. 3. That no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARLOT\">harlot</a> should touch the altar of Juno; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> she did, that she should sacrifice a ewe-lamb to that goddes, with dishvelled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>. 4. That whoever removed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>-mark should be put to death. 5.

The baseness and injustice of the Romans during this war were truly disgraceful to them, and altogether unworthy of a great and powerful people. The inhabitants obtained some advantages over the Roman forces, till Scipio Africanus was empowered to finish the war and to see the destruction of Numantia. He began the siege, with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of 60,000 men, and was bravely opposed by the beleaguered, who were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more than 4000 men able to bear arms. Both armies behaved with uncommon valour, and the courage of the Numantines was soon changed into despair and fury. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> began to fail, and they fed upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> of their horses, and afterwards on that of their dead companions, and at last they were obliged to draw lots to kill and devour one another. The melancholy situation of their affairs obliged them to surrender to the Roman general. Scipio demanded them to deliver themselves up on the morrow; they refused, and when a longer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> had been granted to their petitions, they retired and set fire to their houses and destroyed themselves, so that not even one remained to adorn the triumph of the conqueror. Some historians, however, deny that; and assert, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of Numantines delivered themselves into Scipio's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, and that 50 of them were drawn in triumph at Rome, and the rest sold as slaves. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of Numantia was more glorious than that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Corinth, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> was much inferior to them.

And this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> is necessary to be considered, because upon it the true sense, and the possibility or impossibility, of some questions depend.\n\nNumber is unlimited in respect of increase; because we can never conceive a number so great but still there is a greater. However, in respect of decrease, it is limited; unity being the first and least number, below which therefore it cannot descend.\nKinds and distinctions of Numbers. Mathematicians, considering number under a great many relations, have established the following distinctions.\n\nBroken numbers are the same with fractions.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> numbers are those which express the quantity of units, as 1, 2, 3, 4, &c., whereas ordinal numbers are those which express order, as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, &c.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">Compound</a> number, one divisible by some other number besides unity; as 12, which is divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6. Numbers, as 12 and 15, which have some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> besides unity, are said to be compound numbers among themselves.\n\nCubic number is the product of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> number by its root; such is 27, as being the product of the square number 9 by its root 3. All cubic numbers, whose root is less than 6, being divided by 6, the remainder is the root itself; thus 27 \u00f7 6 leaves the remainder 3, its root; 215, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a> of 6, being divided by 6, leaves no remainder; 343, the cube of 7, leaves a remainder 1, which added to 6, is the cube root; and 512, the cube of 8, divided by 6, leaves a remainder 2, which added to 6, is the cube root.\n\nHence the remainders of the divisions of the cubes above 216, divided by 6, being added to 6, always give the root of the cube so divided till that remainder be 5, and consequently 11, the cube root of the number divided. But the cubic numbers above this being divided by 6, there remains nothing, the cube root being 12. Thus the remainders of the higher cubes are to be added to 12 and not to 6, till you come to 18, when the remainder of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> must be added to 18; and so on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a> infinitum.\n\nDeterminate number is that referred to some given unit, as a ternary or three: whereas an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">indeterminate</a> one is that referred to unity in general, and is called quantity.\n\nHomogeneous numbers are those referred to the same unit; as those referred to different units are termed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a>.\n\nWhole numbers are otherwise called integers.\n\nRational number is one commensurable with unity; as a number, incommensurable with unity, is termed irrational, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SURD\">surd</a>.\n\nIn the same manner, a rational whole number is that whereof unity is an aliquot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>; a rational broken number, that equal to some aliquot part of unity; and a rational mixed number, that consisting of a whole number and a broken one.\n\nEven number, that which may be divided into two equal parts without any fraction, as 6, 12, &c. The sum, difference, and product, of any number of even numbers, is always an even number.\n\nAn evenly even number, is that which may be measured, or divided, without any remainder, by another even number, as 4 by 2.\n\nAn unevenly even number, when a number may be equally divided by an uneven number, as 20 by 5.\n\nUneven number, that which exceeds an even number, at least by unity, or which cannot be divided into two equal parts, as 3, 5, &c.\n\nThe sum or difference of two uneven numbers makes an even number; but the factum of two uneven ones makes an uneven number.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> an even number be added to an uneven one; or if the one be subtracted from the other, in the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the sum, in the latter the difference, is an uneven number; but the factum of an even and uneven number is even.\n\nThe sum of any even number of uneven numbers is an even number; and the sum of any uneven number of uneven numbers is an uneven number.\n\nPrimitive or prime numbers are those divisible only by unity, as 5, 7, &c. And prime numbers among themselves, are those which have no common measure besides unity, as 12 and 19.\n\nPerfect number, that whose aliquot parts added together make the whole number, as 6, 28; the aliquot parts of 6 being 3, 2, and 1, = 6; and those of 28, being 14, 7, 4, 2, 1, = 28.\n\nImperfect numbers, those whose aliquot parts added together make either more or less than the whole. And these are distinguished into abundant and defective: an instance in the former case is 12, whose aliquot parts 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, make 16; and in the latter case 16, whose aliquot parts 8, 4, 2, and 1, make but 15.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">Plane</a> number, that arising from the multiplication of two numbers, as 6, which is the product of 3 by 2; and these numbers are called the sides of the plane.\n\nSquare number is the product of any number multiplied by itself; thus 4, which is the factum of 2 by 2, is a square number.\n\nEven square number added to its root makes an even number.\n\nFigurate numbers, are such as represent some geometrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, in relation to which they are always considered; as triangular, pentagonal, pyramidal, &c. numbers.\n\nFigurate numbers are distinguished into orders, according to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the scale of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>, being all produced one from another, viz. by adding continually the terms of any one, the successeive sums are the terms of the next order, beginning from the first order which is that of equal units 1, 1, 1, 1, &c.; then the 2d order consists of the successeive sums of those of the 1st order, forming the arithmetical progression 1, 2, 3, 4, &c.; those of the third order are the successeive sums of those of the 2d, and are the triangular numbers 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, &c.; those of the 4th order are the successeive sums of those of the 3d, and are the pyramidal numbers 1, 4, 10, 20, 35, &c.; and so on as below:\n\n| Order | Names          | Numbers |\n|-------|----------------|---------|\n| 1     | Equals         | 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, &c. |\n| 2     | Arithmeticals  | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &c. |\n| 3     | Triangulars    | 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, &c. |\n| 4     | Pyramidal     | 1, 4, 10, 20, 35, &c. |\n| 5     | 2d Pyramidal  | 1, 5, 15, 35, 70, &c. |\n| 6     | 3d Pyramidal  | 1, 6, 21, 56, 126, &c. |\n| 7     | 4th Pyramidal | 1, 7, 28, 84, 210, &c. |\n\nThe above are all considered as different sorts of triangular numbers, being formed from an arithmetical progression whose common difference is 1. But if that common difference be 2, the successeive sums will be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of square numbers; if it be 3, the series will be pentagonal numbers, or pentagons; if it be 4, the series will be hexagonal numbers, or hexagons; and so on. Thus:\n\nArithmeticals.\nAnd the reason of the names triangles, squares, pentagons, hexagons, &c. is, that those numbers may be placed in the form of these regular figures or polygons.\n\nBut the figurate numbers of any order may also be found without computing those of the preceding orders; which is done by taking the successive products of as many of the terms of the arithmeticals, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &c. in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> order, as there are units in the number which denominates the order of figurates required, and dividing those products always by the first product: thus, the triangular numbers are found by dividing the products \\(1 \\times 2\\), \\(2 \\times 3\\), \\(3 \\times 4\\), \\(4 \\times 5\\), &c. each by the first product \\(1 \\times 2\\); the first pyramids by dividing the products \\(1 \\times 2 \\times 3\\), \\(2 \\times 3 \\times 4\\), \\(3 \\times 4 \\times 5\\), &c. by the first \\(1 \\times 2 \\times 3\\). And, in general, the figurate numbers of any order \\(n\\) are found by substituting successively 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &c. instead of \\(x\\) in this general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x(x+1)}{2} + \\frac{x(x+1)(x+2)}{6}\n\\]\n\nwhere the factors in the numerator and denominator are supposed to be multiplied together, and to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till the number in each be less by 1 than that which expresses the order of the figurates required. See MacLaurin's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUXIONS\">Fluxions</a>, art. 351, in the notes; also Simpson's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALGEBRA\">Algebra</a>, p. 213; or Malcolm's Arithmetic, p. 396, where the subject of figurates is treated in a very extensive and perspicuous manner. Hutton's Mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DICTIONARY\">Dictionary</a>.\n\nPolygonal or polygonous numbers, the sums of arithmetical progressions beginning with unity: where the common difference is 1, are called triangular numbers; where 2, square numbers; where 3, pentagonal numbers; where 4, hexagonal numbers; where 5, heptagonal numbers, &c.\n\nPyramidal numbers, the sums of polygonous numbers, collected after the same manner as the polygons themselves, and not gathered out of arithmetical progressions, are called first pyramidal numbers; the sums of the first pyramidal are called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> pyramidal, &c.\n\nIf they arise out of triangular numbers, they are called triangular pyramidal numbers; if out of pentagons, first pentagonal pyramidal.\n\nFrom the manner of summing up polygonal numbers, it is easy to conceive how the prime pyramidal numbers are found, viz.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(a-2)n^3 + 3n^2 - (a-5)n}{6}\n\\]\n\nexpresses all the prime pyramidal.\n\nThe number <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> has a very curious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, its products always composing either 9 or some lesser product of it. We have already given an account of this, with the examples from Hume, under the article Nine; and we need not repeat them. Did our limits permit us, we could instance in a variety of other properties numbers both curious and surprising. Such speculations are indeed by some men considered as trifling and useless; but perhaps they judge too hastily; for few employments are more innocent, none more ingenious, nor, to those who have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for them, more amusing.\n\nNumbers were by the Jews, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Greeks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, expressed by letters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a>: hence we may conceive how imperfect and limited their arithmetic was, because the letters could not be arranged in a series, or in different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, conveniently enough for the purposes of ready calculation. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of the cipher, or arithmetical figures, which we now make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of, has given us a very great advantage over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> in this respect.\n\nMankind, we may reasonably suppose, first reckoned by their fingers, which they might indeed do in a variety of ways. From this digital arithmetic, very probably, is owing the number 10, which constitutes the whole set of arithmetical figures.\n\nThe letters chiefly employed by the Romans to express numbers were, M, for 1000; D, for 500; C, for 100; L, for 50; V, for five; X, for 10; and I, for one.\u2014M, probably signified 1000, because it is the initial of mille; D stands for 500, because it is the diminution of mille; C signifies 100, as being the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> of the word centum; L stands for 50, because it is the half of C, having formerly been wrote thus L; V signifies 5, because V is the fifth vowel; X stands for 10, because it contains twice X or V in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> form; I stands for one, because it is the first letter of initium. These however are fanciful derivations. See NUMERAL LETTERS.\n\nThe Jewish cabalists, the Grecian conjurors, and the Roman augurs, had a great veneration for particular numbers, and the result of particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> of them. Thus three, four, six, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a>, nine, ten, are full of divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a>, and of great efficacy.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">Golden</a> NUMBER.

See POETRY.\u2014It is of these numbers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a> speaks in his ninth Eclogue, when he makes Lycidas say, Numeros memini, si verba tenerem; meaning, that although he had forgot the words of the verses, yet he remembered the feet and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of which they were composed.\n\nRhetorical or profane numbers are a sort of simple unaffected harmony, less glaring than that of verse, but such as is perceived and affects the mind with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>.\n\nThe numbers are that by which the style is said to be easy, free, round, flowing, &c. Numbers are things absolutely necessary in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, and even in all speech. Hence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, Tully, Quintilian, &c. lay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> abundance of rules as to the best manner of intermixing dactyls, spondees, anaepeta, &c. in order to have the numbers perfect. The substance of what they have said, is reducible to what follows: 1. The style becomes numerous by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> disposition and temperature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and short syllables, so as that the multitude of short ones neither render it too halting, nor that of long ones too...\nNumbers too slow and languid; sometimes, indeed, long and short syllables are thrown together designedly without any such mixture, to paint the flowness or celerity of anything by that of the numbers; as in these verses of Virgil:\n\n\"Illi inter se se magna vi brachia tollunt;\nand\nRadit iter liquidum, celere neque commovet alas.\"\n\n2. The style becomes numerous, by the intermixing words of one, two, or more syllables; whereas the too frequent repetition of monosyllables renders the style pitiful and grating. 3. It contributes greatly to the numerousness of a period, to have it cloathed by magnificent and well-founded words. 4. The numbers depend not only on the nobleness of the words in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>, but of those in the whole tenor of the period. 5. To have the period flow easily and equally, the harsh concurrence of letters and words is to be studiously avoided, particularly the frequent meeting of rough <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSONANTS\">consonants</a>; the beginning the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYLLABLE\">syllable</a> of a word with the last of the preceding; the frequent repetition of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> or syllable; and the frequent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the like ending words.

It has also been supposed, that D, being formed by dividing the old M in the middle, was therefore appointed to stand for 500, that is, half as much as the M stood for when it was whole; and that L being half a C, was, for the same reason, used to denote 50. But what reason is there to suppose, that 1000 and 100 were the numbers which letters were first used to express?

But they presently found, that if more were added, it would soon be necessary to tell the strokes one by one: for this reason, then, when they came to 5, they expressed it by joining two strokes together in an acute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> thus, V; which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> appear the more probable, if it be considered that the progression of the Roman numbers is from 5 to 5, i.e., from the fingers on one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> to the fingers on the other.\u2014Ovid has touched upon the original of this in his Fastorum, lib. iii. and Vitruvius has made the same remark.\n\nAfter they had made this acute angle V. for five, they added the single stroke to it to the number of 4, thus, VI. VII. VIII. VIII. and then as the strokes could not be further multiplied without confusion, they doubled their acute angle by prolonging the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> beyond their intersection thus, X., to denote two fives, or ten. After this they doubled, trebled, and quadrupled, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> acute angle thus, XX. XXX. XXXX. they then, for the same reason which induced them first to make a single and then to double it, joined two single strokes in another form, and instead of an acute angle, made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> angle L, to denote fifty. When this 50 was doubled, they then doubled the right angle thus R, to denote 100, and having numbered this double right angle four times, thus LLL, LLLL, LLLLL, when they came to the fifth number, as before, they reverted it, and put a single stroke before it thus IX, to denote 900; and when this 900 was doubled, they also doubled their double right angle, setting two double right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> opposite to each other, with a single stroke between them, thus XIX to denote 1000: when this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> for 1000 had been four times repeated, then they put down XXX for 3000, XXXX for 4000, XXXIX for 5000, and LXXXIX for 100,000, XXXL for 500,000, and LXXXIX for 1 million.\n\nThat the Romans did not originally write M for 1000, and C for 100, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, as they are written above, we are expressly informed by Paulus Manutius; but the corners of the angles being cut off by the transcribers for dispatch, these figures were gradually brought into what are now numeral letters.\u2014When the corners of LXX were made round, it stood thus CXX, which is so near the Gothic m, that it soon deviated into that letter; so IX having the corner made round, it stood thus IX, and then easily deviated into D. It also became a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> C by the same means; the single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTANGLE\">rectangle</a> which denoted 50, was, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> L; the double acute angle was an X; the single acute angle a V consonant; and a plain single stroke, the letter I; and thus these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> letters, M, D, C, L, X, V, I, became numerals.\n\nNUMERAL Characters of the Arabs, are those figures which are now used in all the operations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a> in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. We have elsewhere shown that the Arabs derived the use of them most probably from\nNUMERAL from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, (See Arithmetic, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a>. 5.) This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, however, though very generally received, has been controverted with some ingenuity. A writer in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">Gentleman</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a>, at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> when that miscellany was in its highest reputation, thus endeavours to prove that the Arabs derived their notations from the Greeks. \"I maintain (says he) that the Indians received their numeral characters from the Arabians, and the Arabians from the Greeks, as from them they derived all their learning, which in some things they improved, but for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> have altered. The numerical figures which they received from the Greeks are proofs of this alteration; which is so great, that without particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> one can scarce discover in them the vestiges of their origin. But when we compare them carefully and without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>, we find in them manifest traces of the Greek figures. The Greek numerical figures were no other than the letters of their alphabet. A small stroke was the mark of unity. The B, being abridged of its two extremities, produced the 2. If you incline the \u03b3 a little on its left side, and cut off its foot, and make the left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">horn</a> round towards the left side, you will produce a 3; the \u0394 makes the 4, by raising the right leg perpendicularly, and lengthening it a little below the base, and lengthening the base on the left side. The \u03a3 forms the 5; by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the lowest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a> towards the right, which before was turned towards the left side. The number 6 forms the 6 by having its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> taken off, and its body rounded. \u0396, by taking away the base, makes the 7. If we make the top and bottom of H round, we shall form an 8. The \u0398 is the 9 with very little alteration. The cypher \u03c9 was only a point, to which one of the figures was added to make it stand for ten times as much. It was necessary to mark this point very strongly; and in order to form it better, a circle was made, which was filled up in the middle; but that circumstance was afterwards neglected. Theophanes, an historian of Constantinople, who lived in the ninth century, says expressly, that the Arabians retained the Greek figures, having no characters in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> to represent all the numbers. The Greeks observed in their numbers the decuple progression, which the Arabians have retained. Certain characters are found in the Greek alphabet, which are not used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a>, but only in calculation, and for this reason they are styled Epiphanes, that is to say, notes, marks, in order to distinguish them from letters. The number 6 derives its form from one of these epiphanes, which was called \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2. This epiphane forms the letter F among the \u00c6olians and among the Latins. This was called the Digamma, so styled from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, which seems to have been one \u0393 placed upon another.\n\nThat this reasoning is plausible will hardly be questioned; but whether it be conclusive our readers must determine. It has not convinced ourselves; but through the whole of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> we wish to state candidly the different opinions held on every subject of curiosity and usefulness.","sp":94,"ep":95},{"h":"NUMERATION","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Notation, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">Arithmetic</a>, the art of expressing in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> proposed in words, or of expressing in words any number proposed in characters.

Dr Shaw has rendered it probable, that the river which formerly went under the denominations of Malwa, Malgana, Mulucha, and Molochah, is the same with that now called Mulloolah by the Algerines; in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, the kingdom of Numidia must have extended upwards of 500 miles in length; its breadth, however, cannot be so well ascertained; but supposing it to have been the same with that of the present kingdom of Algiers, in the narrowest part it must have been at least 40 miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and in the widest upwards of 100.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> included two districts; one inhabited by the Maffyli, and the other by the Massiflyli; the latter being also called in after times, Mauritania Caesariensis, and the former Numidia Propria. The country of the Maffyli, or, as some call it, Terra Metagoria, was separated from the proper territory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a> by its eastern boundary the river Tufca, and from the kingdom of the Massiflyli, or Mauritania Caesariensis, by the river Ampfla. It seems to correspond with that part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Constantine lying between the Zaine and the Med al Kheer, which is above 130 miles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, and more than 100 broad. The sea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of this province is for the most part mountainous and rocky, answering to the appellation given to it by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-ABULFEDA\">Abulfeda</a>, viz. El Edwaa, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> or lofty. It is far from being equal in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> to the ancient country of the Maffyli, which, Strabo informs us, was yet inferior to the country of the Maffyli. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> was Cirta, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of very considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>.\n\nThe most celebrated antiquarians agree, that the tract, Peopled by extending from the isthmus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUEZ\">Suez</a> to the lake Triton, the defendants, was chiefly peopled by the descendants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIZRAIM\">Mizraim</a>, and that the posterity of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Put, or Phut, spread themselves all over the country between that lake and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATLANTIC_OCEAN\">Atlantic ocean</a>. To this notion <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a> gives great countenance: for he tells us, that the Libyan Nomades, whose territories to the west were bounded by the Triton, agreed in their customs and manners with the Egyptians; but that the Africans, from that river to the Atlantic ocean, differed in almost all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> from them. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a> mentions a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> called Putea near Adrametum; and Pliny, a river of Mauritania Tingitana, known by the name of Fu, or Phut; and the district adjacent to this river was called Regio Phutenis, which plainly alludes to the name of Phut. That word signifies scattered, or dispersed, which very well agrees with what Mela and Strabo relate of the ancient Numidians; so that we may, without any scruple, admit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABORIGINES\">aborigines</a> of this country to have been the descendants of Phut.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of Numidia, during many of the early ages, is buried in oblivion. It is probable, however, that as the Phoenicians were masters of a great part of known...\nNamibia, the country, these transactions had been recorded, and generally known to the Carthaginians. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> Juba probably reigned here as well as in Africa Propria, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not in Mauritania, and other parts of Libya, when Dido began to build Byrsa. It appears from Justin, that about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of Herodotus, the people of this country were called both Africans or Libyans and Numidians. Justin likewise intimates, that about this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the Carthaginians vanquished both the Moors or Mauritians and the Numidians; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of which they were excused from paying the tribute which had hitherto been demanded of them.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the first Punic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, the African troops carried on a bloody contest against their masters the Carthaginians; and the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> in this rebellion, according to Diodorus Siculus, were a part of the Numidian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> named Mactanians. This so incensed the Carthaginians, that after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANNIBAL\">Hannibal</a> had either killed or taken prisoners all the mercenaries, he sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> to ravage the country of those Numidians. The commandant of that detachment executed his orders with the utmost cruelty, plundering the district in a terrible manner, and crucifying all the prisoners without distinction that fell into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>. This filled the rest with such indignation and resentment, that both they and their posterity ever afterwards bore an implacable hatred to the Carthaginians.\n\nIn the time of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> Punic war, Syphax king of the Massylii entered into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, and gave the Carthaginians a considerable defeat. This induced Gala, king of the Massylii, to conclude a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> with the Carthaginians, in consequence of which his son Massinissa marched at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of a powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> to give Syphax <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>. The contest ended in favour of Massinissa; 30,000 of the Massylii were put to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, and Syphax driven into Mauritania; and the like bad success attended Syphax in another engagement, where his troops were entirely defeated and dispersed.\n\nGala dying whilst his son Massinissa was acting at the head of the Numidian troops sent to the assistance of the Carthaginians in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, his brother Defalces, according to the established rules of succession in Numidia, took possession of the Massylian throne. That <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> dying soon after his accession, Caputa his eldest son succeeded him. But he did not long enjoy his high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>; for one Mezetulus, a person of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> blood, but an enemy to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of Gala, found means to excite a great part of his subjects to revolt. A battle soon took place between him and Caputa; in which the latter was slain with many of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, and his army entirely defeated. But though Mezetulus thus became possessed of the sovereignty, he did not think proper to assume the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of king, but styled himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">guardian</a> to Lacumaces, the surviving son of Defalces, whom he graced with the royal title. To support himself in his usurpation, he married the dowager of Defalces, who was Hannibal's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIECE\">niece</a>, and consequently of the most powerful family in Carthage. In order to attain the same end, he sent ambassadors to Syphax, to conclude a treaty of alliance with him. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time Massinissa, receiving advice of his uncle's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a>'s slaughter, and of Mezetulus's usurpation, immediately passed over to Africa, and went to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of Bocchar king of Mauritania to solicit succours. Bocchar, sensible of the great injustice done Massinissa, gave him a body of 4000 Moors to escort him to his dominions. His subjects, having been apprised of his approach, joined him upon the frontiers with a party of 500 men. The Moors, in pursuance of their orders, returned home, as soon as Massinissa reached the confines of his kingdom. Notwithstanding which, and the small body that declared for him having accidentally met Lacumaces at Thapsus with an escort going to implore Syphax's affluence, he drove him into the town, which he carried by assault after a faint resistance. However, Lacumaces, with many of his men, found means to escape to Syphax. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> of this exploit gained Massinissa great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, insomuch that the Numidians flocked to him from all parts, and amongst the rest, many of his father Gala's veterans, who pressed him to make a speedy and vigorous push for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> dominions. Lacumaces having joined Mezetulus with a reinforcement of Massylians, which he had prevailed upon Syphax to send to the assistance of his ally, the usurper advanced at the head of a numerous army to offer Massinissa battle; which that prince, though much inferior in numbers, did not decline. Hereupon an engagement ensued; which notwithstanding the inequality of numbers, ended in the defeat of Lacumaces. The immediate consequence of this victory of Massinissa was a quiet and peaceable possession of his kingdom; Mezetulus and Lacumaces, with a few that attended them, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> into the territories of Carthage. However, being apprehensive that he should be obliged to sustain a war against Syphax, he offered to treat Lacumaces with as many marks of distinction as his father Gala had Defalces, provided that prince would put himself under his protection. He also promised Mezetulus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a>, and restitution of all the effects forfeited by his treasonable conduct, if he would make his submission to him. Both of them readily complied with the proposal, and immediately returned home; so that the tranquillity and repose of Numidia would have been settled upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> and lasting foundation, had not this been prevented by Adrribal, who was then at Syphax's court. He intimated to that prince, who was disposed to live amicably with his neighbours, \"That he was greatly mistaken, if he imagined Massinissa would be satisfied with his hereditary dominions. That he was a prince of much greater capacity and ambition, than either his father Gala, his uncle Defalces, or any of his family. That he had discovered in Spain marks of a most rare and uncommon merit. And that, in fine, unless his rising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> was extinguished before it came to too great a head, both the Massylian and Carthaginian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> would be infallibly consumed by it.\" Syphax, alarmed by these suggestions, advanced with a numerous body of forces into a district which had long been in dispute between him and Gala, but was then in possession of Massinissa. This brought on a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> between these two princes; wherein the latter was totally defeated, his army dispersed, and he himself obliged to fly to the top of Mount Balbus, attended only by a few of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>. Such a decisive battle at the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a>, before Massinissa was fixed in his throne, could not but put Syphax into possession of the kingdom of the Massylii. Massinissa in the mean time made nocturnal incursions from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> upon Mount Balbus, and plundered all the adjacent country, particularly that part of the Carthaginian territory contiguous to Numidia. This district he not only thoroughly pillaged, but likewise laid waste with fire and sword, carrying off from thence\nNumidia, an immense booty, which was bought by some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>, who had put into one of the Carthaginian ports for that purpose. In fine, he did the Carthaginians more damage, not only by committing such dreadful devastations, but by massacring and carrying into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a> vast numbers of their subjects on this occasion, than they could have sustained in a pitched battle, or one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> of a regular war. Syphax, at the preluding and reiterated instances of the Carthaginians, sent Bocchar, one of his most active commanders, with a detachment of 4000 foot, and 2000 horse, to reduce this pestilent gang of robbers, promising him a great reward if he could bring Massinissa either alive or dead. Bocchar, watching an opportunity, surprised the Massylians, as they were straggling about the country without any order or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>; so that he took many prisoners, dispersed the rest, and pursued Massinissa himself, with a few of his men, to the top of the mountain where he had before taken post. Considering the expedition as ended, he not only felled many head of cattle, and the other booty that had fallen into his hands, to Syphax, but likewise all the force, except 500 foot and 200 horse. With this detachment he drove Massinissa from the summit of the hill, and pursued him through several narrow passes and defiles, as far as the plains of Clupea. Here he surrounded him, that all the Massylians, except four, were put to the sword, and Massinissa himself, after having received a dangerous wound, escaped with the utmost difficulty. As this was effected by crossing a rapid river, in which attempt two of his four attendants perished in the fight of the detachment that pursued him, it was rumoured all over Africa, that Massinissa also was drowned; which gave inexplicable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> to Syphax and the Carthaginians. For some time he lived undiscovered in a cave, where he was supported by the robberies of the two horsemen that had made their escape with him. But having cured his wound by the application of some medicinal herbs, he boldly began to advance towards his own frontiers, giving out publicly that he intended once more to take possession of his kingdom. In his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> he was joined by about 40 horse, and, soon after his arrival amongst the Massylii, so many people flocked to him from all parts, that out of them he formed an army of 6000 foot and 4000 horse. With these forces, he not only reinstated himself in the possession of his dominions, but likewise laid waste the borders of the Massylii. This so irritated Syphax, that he immediately assembled a body of troops, and encamped very commodiously upon a ridge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> between Cirta and Hippo. His army he commanded in person; and detached his son Vermina, with a considerable force, to take a compass, and attack the enemy in the rear. In pursuance of his orders, Vermina set out in the beginning of the night, and took post in the place appointed him, without being discovered by the enemy. In the mean time Syphax decamped, and advanced towards the Massylii, in order to give them battle. When he had posted himself on a rising ground that led to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>, and concluded that his son Vermina must have formed the ambuscade behind them, he began the fight. Massinissa being advantageously posted, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> distinguishing themselves in an extraordinary manner, the dispute was long and bloody. But Vermina unexpectedly falling upon their rear, and by this means obliging them to divide their forces, which were scarce able before to oppose the main body under Syphax, they were soon thrown into confusion, and forced to betake themselves to a precipitate flight. All the avenues being blocked up, partly by Syphax and partly by his son, such a dreadful slaughter was made of the unhappy Massylii, that only Massinissa himself, with 60 horse, escaped to the Lesser Syrtis. Here he remained, betwixt the confines of the Carthaginians and Garamantes, till the arrival of Laelius and the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> on the coast of Africa. What happened immediately after this junction with the Romans, belongs to the article ROME.\n\nIt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be sufficient therefore in this place to observe, that, by the affluence of Laelius, Massinissa at last reduced Syphax's kingdom. According to Zonaras, Massinissa and Scipio, before the memorable battle of Zama, by a stratagem deprived Hannibal of some advantageous posts; which, with a solar eclipse happening during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the action, and not a little intimidating the Carthaginian troops, greatly contributed to the victory the Romans obtained. At the conclusion therefore of the second Punic war, he was amply rewarded by the Romans for the important services he had done them. As for Syphax, after the loss of his dominions, he was kept in confinement for some time at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBA\">Alba</a>; from whence being removed in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> Scipio's triumph, he died at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIBUR\">Tibur</a> in his way to Rome. Zonaras adds, that his corpse was decently interred; that all the Numidian priors were released; and that Vermina, by the affluence of the Romans, took peaceable possession of his father's throne. However, part of the Massylian kingdom had been before annexed to Massinissa's dominions, in order to reward that prince for his singular fidelity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to the Romans.\n\nThis seems to be countenanced by the epitomizer of Livy, who gives us sufficiently to understand, that Syphax's family, for a considerable time after the conclusion of the second Punic war, reigned in one part of Numidia. For he intimates, that Archobarzanes, Syphax's grandson, and probably Vermina's son, hovered with a powerful army of Numidians upon the Carthaginian frontiers a few years before the beginning of the third Punic war. This he seems to have done, either in order to cover them, or to enable the Carthaginians to make an irruption into Massinissa's territories. Cato, however, pretended that these forces, in conjunction with those of Carthage, had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> to invade the Roman dominions, which he urged as a reason to induce the conscript fathers to destroy the African republic.\n\nNothing is further requisite, in order to complete the history of this famous prince, than to exhibit to our readers view some points of his conduct towards the decline, and at the close, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; the wise dispositions made after his death by Emilianus, in order to the regulation of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> affairs; and some particulars relating to his character, genius, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of body, drawn from the most celebrated Greek and Roman authors.\n\nBy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> a line of circumvallation around the Carthaginian army under Adruba, posted upon an eminence, Massinissa cut off all manner of supplies from them; which introduced both the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a> and famine into their camp. As the body of Numidian troops employed\nNumidia. ployed in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCKADE\">blockade</a> was not near so numerous as the Carthaginian forces, it is evident, that the line here mentioned must have been extremely strong, and consequently the effect of great labour and art. The Carthaginians, finding themselves reduced to the last extremity, concluded a peace upon the following terms, which Massinissa dictated to them: 1. That they should deliver up all deserters. 2. That they should recall their exiles, who had taken refuge in his dominions. 3. That they should pay him 5000 talents of silver within the space of 50 years. 4. That their soldiers should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> under the jugum, each of them carrying off only a single garment. As Massinissa himself, though between 80 and 90 years of age, conducted the whole enterprise, he must have been extremely well versed in fortification, and other branches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> art. His understanding likewise he must have retained to the last. This happened a short time before the beginning of the third Punic war. See CARTHAGE.\n\nSoon after, the consuls landed an army in Africa, in order to lay siege to Carthage, without impairing to Massinissa their design. This not a little chagrined him, as it was contrary to the former practice of the Romans; who, in the preceding war, had communicated their intentions to him, and consulted him on all occasions. When, therefore, the consuls applied to him for a body of his troops to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> with their forces, he made answer, \"That they should have a reinforcement from him when they stood in need of it.\" It could not but be provoking to him to consider, that after he had extremely weakened the Carthaginians, and even brought them to the brink of ruin, his pretended imperious friends should come to reap the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of his victory, without giving him the least intelligence of it.\n\nHowever, his mind soon returned to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> bias, which was in favour of the Romans. Finding his end approaching, he sent to \u00c6milianus, then a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBUNE\">tribune</a> in the Roman army, to desire a visit from him. What he proposed by this visit, was to invest him with full powers to dispose of his kingdom and estate as he should think proper, for the benefit of his children. The high idea he had entertained of that young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a>'s abilities and integrity, together with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> and affection for the family into which he was adopted, induced him to take this step. But, believing that death would not permit him to have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> conference with \u00c6milianus upon this subject, he informed his wife and children in his last moments, that he had empowered him to dispose in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> manner of all his possessions, and divide his kingdom amongst his sons. To which he subjoined, \"I require, that whatever \u00c6milianus may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a>, shall be executed as punctually as if I myself had appointed it by my will.\" Having uttered these words, he expired, at about 90 years of age.\n\nThis prince, during his youth, had met with strange reverses of fortune. However, says Appian, being supported by the Divine protection, he enjoyed an uninterrupted course of prosperity for a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of years. His kingdom extended from Mauritania to the western confines of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYRENAICA\">Cyrenaica</a>; from whence it appears, that he was one of the most powerful princes of Africa. Many of the inhabitants of this vast tract he civilized in a wonderful manner, teaching them to cultivate their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, and to reap those natural advantages Numidia, which the fertility of some parts of their country offered them. He was of a more robust habit of body than any of his contemporaries, being blest with the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> and vigour; which was doubtless owing to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a>, and the toils he incessantly sustained. We are informed by Polybius, that sometimes he stood upon the same spot of ground from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> till evening, without the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, and at others <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> as long in a fitting posture. He would remain on horseback for several days and nights together, without being sensible of the least fatigue. Nothing can better evince the strength of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, than his youngest son, named Sembabal, Silenba, or Stembanus, who was but four years old at his decease. Though 93 years of age, he performed all the exercises used by young men, and always rode without a saddle. Pliny tells us, that he reigned above 60 years. He was an able commander, and much facilitated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of Carthage. Plutarch from Polybius observes, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> after a great victory won over the Carthaginians, Massinissa was seen sitting at the door of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENT\">tent</a>, eating a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>. Suidas relates, that to the last he could mount his horse without any assistance. According to Appian he left a numerous well disciplined army, and an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of wealth, behind him.\n\nMassinissa, before his death, gave his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> to his eldest son Micipha; but left the distribution of all his other effects and possessions amongst his children entirely to \u00c6milianus. Of 54 sons that survived him, only three were legitimate, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>, Micipha, Gulufa, and Maftanabal. \u00c6milianus, arrived at Cirta after he had expired, divided his kingdom, or rather the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of it, amongst these three, though to the others he gave considerable possessions. To Micipha, who was a prince of a pacific disposition, and the eldest son, he assigned Cirta, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>, for the place of his residence, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of the others. Gulufa, the next to him, being a prince of military genius, had the command of the army, and the transacting of all affairs relating to peace or war committed to his care. And Maftanabal, the youngest, had the administration of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, an employment suitable to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, allotted him. They enjoyed in common the immense treasures Massinissa had amassed, and were all of them dignified by \u00c6milianus with the royal title. After he had made these wise dispositions, that young nobleman departed from Cirta, taking with him a body of Numidian troops, under the conduct of Gulufa, to reinforce the Roman army that was then acting against the Carthaginians.\n\nMaftanabal and Gulufa died soon after their father, as appears from the express testimony of Sallust. We find nothing more remarkable of these princes, besides what has been already related, than that the latter continued to assist the Romans in the third Punic war, and that the former was pretty well versed in the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. Micipha therefore became sole possessor of the kingdom of Numidia. In his reign, and under the consulship of M. Plautius Hypsaeus and M. Fulvius Flaccus, according to Orofus, a great part of Africa was covered with locusts, which destroyed all the produce of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and even devoured dry wood. But at last they were all carried by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> into the African sea, out of which being thrown in vast heaps upon the shore, a plague ensued which swept away an infinite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>\nNumidia, number of animals of all kinds. In Numidia only 800,000 men perished, and in Africa Propria 200,000; amongst the rest, 30,000 Roman soldiers quartered in and about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UTICA\">Utica</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the latter province. At Utica, in particular, the mortality raged to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, that 1500 dead bodies were carried out of one gate in a day. Micipha had two sons, Adherbal and Hiempfal, whom he educated in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, together with his nephew Jugurtha. That young prince was the son of Maftanabal; but his mother having been only a concubine, Maftanifa had taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> great notice of him. However, Micipha considering him as a prince of the blood, took as much care of him as he did of his own children.\n\nJugurtha possessed several eminent qualities, which gained him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> esteem. He was very handsome, endued with great strength of body, and adorned with the finest intellectual endowments. He did not devote himself, as young men <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> do, to a life of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> and pleasure. He used to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> himself, with persons of his age, in running, riding, hurling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JAVELIN\">javelin</a>, and other manly exercises, suited to the martial genius of the Numidians; and though he surpassed all his fellow sportsmen, there was not one of them but loved him. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a> was his only delight; but it was that of lions and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> beasts. Sallust, to finish his character, tells us, that he excelled in all things, and spoke very little of himself.\n\nSo conspicuous an assemblage of fine talents and perfections, at first charmed Micipha, who thought them an ornament to his kingdom. However, he soon began to reflect, that he was considerably advanced in years, and his children in their infancy; so mankind naturally thirsted after power, and that nothing was capable of making men run greater lengths than a vicious and unlimited ambition. These reflections soon excited his jealousy, and determined him to expose Jugurtha to a variety of dangers, some of which, he entertained hopes, might prove fatal to him. In order to this, he gave him the command of a body of forces which he sent to assist the Romans, who were at that time besieging <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMANTIA\">Numantia</a> in Spain. But Jugurtha, by his admirable conduct, not only escaped all those dangers, but likewise won the esteem of the whole army, and the friendship of Scipio, who sent a high character of him to his uncle Micipha. However, that general gave him some prudent advice in relation to his future conduct; observing, no doubt, in him certain sparks of ambition, which, if lighted into a flame, he apprehended might one day be productive of the most fatal consequences.\n\nBefore this last expedition, Micipha had endeavoured to find out some method of taking him off privately; but his popularity amongst the Numidians obliged that prince to lay aside all thoughts of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. After his return from Spain the whole nation almost adored him. The heroic bravery he had shown there, his undaunted courage, joined to the utmost calmness of mind, which enabled him to preserve a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> medium between a timorous foresight and an impetuous rashness, a circumstance rarely to be met with in persons of his age, and above all the advantageous testimonials of his conduct given by Scipio, attracted an universal esteem. Nay, Micipha himself, charmed with the high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> the Roman general had entertained of his merit, changed his behaviour towards him; resolving, if possible, to win his affection by kindness. He therefore adopted him, and declared him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> with his two sons to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>. Finding, some few years afterwards, that his end approached, he sent for all three to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> side; where, in the presence of the whole court, he desired Jugurtha to recollect with what extreme tenderness he had treated him, and consequently to consider how well he had deserved at his hands. He then entreated him to protect his children on all occasions; who, being before related to him by the ties of blood, were now by their father's bounty become his brethren. In order to fix him the more firmly in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, he likewise complimented him upon his bravery, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, and consummate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>. He further intimated, that neither arms nor treasures constitute the strength of a kingdom; but friends, who are neither won by arms nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, but by real services and an inviolable fidelity. \"Now, where (continued he) can we find better friends than in brothers? And how can that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> who becomes an enemy to his relations, repose any confidence in, or depend upon strangers?\" Then addressing himself to Adherbal and Hiempfal, \"And you (said he) I enjoin always to pay the highest reverence to Jugurtha. Endeavour to imitate, and if possible surpass, his exalted merit, that the world may not hereafter observe Micipha's adopted son to have reflected greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> than his own children.\" Soon after, Micipha, who, according to Diodorus, was a prince of an amiable character, expired. Though Jugurtha did not believe the king to speak his real sentiments with regard to him, yet he seemed extremely pleased with so gracious a speech, and made him an answer suitable to the occasion. However, that prince at the same time was determined within himself to put in execution the scheme he had formed at the siege of Numantia, which was faggoted to him by some factious and abandoned Roman officers, with whom he there contracted an acquaintance. The purport of this scheme was, that he should extort the crown by force from his two cousins, as soon as their father's eyes were closed; which they insinuated might easily be effected by his own valour, and the venality of the Romans. Accordingly, a short time after the old king's death, he found means to affliliate Hiempfal in the city of Thirnida where his treasures were deposited, and drive Adherbal out of his dominions. That unhappy prince found himself obliged to fly to Rome, where he endeavoured to engage the conscript fathers to espouse his quarrel; but, notwithstanding the justice of his cause, they had not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> enough effectually to support him. Jugurtha's ambassadors, by distributing vast sums of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> amongst the senators, brought them so far over, that a majority palliated his inhuman proceedings. This encouraged those ministers to declare, that Hiempfal had been killed by the Numidians on account of his excessive cruelty; that Adherbal was the aggressor in the late troubles; and that he was only chagrined because he could not make that havoc among his countrymen he would willingly have done. They therefore entreated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> to form a judgement of Jugurtha's behaviour in Africa from his conduct at Numantia, rather than from the suggestions of his enemies. Upon which, by far the greatest part of the senate discovered themselves prejudiced.\nprejudiced in his favour. A few, however, that were not lost to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>, nor abandoned to corruption, inflicted upon bringing him to condign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>. But as they could not prevail, he had the best part of Numidia allotted him, and Adherbal was forced to rest satisfied with the other.\n\nJugurtha finding now by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> that everything was venal at Rome, as his friends at Numantia had before informed him, thought he might pursue his towering projects without any obstruction from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>. He therefore, immediately after the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of Micipha's dominions, threw off the mask, and attacked his cousin by open force. As Adherbal was a prince of a pacific disposition, and almost in all respects the reverse of Jugurtha, he was by no means a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a> for him. The latter therefore pillaged the former's territories, stormed several of his fortresses, and overran a good part of his kingdom without opposition. Adherbal, depending on the friendship of the Romans, which his father in his last moments assured him would be a stronger support to him than all the troops and treasures in the universe, despatched deputies to Rome to complain of these hostilities. But whilst he lost his time in sending thither fruitless deputations, Jugurtha overthrew him in a pitched battle, and soon after shut him up in Cirta. During the siege of this city, a Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> arrived there, in order to persuade both parties to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>; but finding Jugurtha untractable, the commissioners returned home without so much as conferring with Adherbal. A second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPUTATION\">deputation</a>, composed of senators of the highest distinction, with \u00c6milius Scaurus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> of the senate, at their head, landed some time after at Utica, and summoned Jugurtha to appear before them. That prince at first seemed to be under dreadful apprehensions, especially as Scaurus reproached him with his enormous crimes, and threatened him with the resentment of the Romans if he did not immediately raise the siege of Cirta. However, the Numidian, by his address, and the irresistible power of gold, as was afterwards suspected at Rome, to mollify Scaurus, that he left Adherbal at his mercy. In fine, Jugurtha had at last Cirta surrendered to him, upon condition only that he should spare the life of Adherbal. But the merciless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>, in violation of the laws of nature and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a>, when he had got possession of the town, ordered him to be put to a most cruel death. The merchants likewise, and all the Numidians in the place capable of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> arms, he cauled without distinction to be put to the sword.\n\nEvery person at Rome inspired with any sentiments of humanity, was struck with horror at the news of this tragic event. However, all the venal senators still concurred with Jugurtha's ministers in palliating his enormous crimes. Notwithstanding which, the people, excited thereto by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIUS\">Caius</a> Memmius their tribune, who bitterly inveighed against the venality of the senate, resolved not to let so flagrant an instance of villany go unpunished. This disposition in them induced the conscript fathers likewise to declare their intention to chastise Jugurtha. In order to this, an army was levied to invade Numidia, and the command of it given to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a> Calpurnius Belfia, a person of good abilities, but rendered unfit for the expedition he was to go upon by his insatiable avarice. Jugurtha being informed of the great preparations making at Numidia, Rome to attack his dominions, sent his son thither to avert the impending storm. The young prince was plentifully supplied with money, which he had orders to distribute liberally amongst the leading men. But Belfia, proposing to himself great advantages from an invasion of Numidia, defeated all his intrigues, and got a decree passed, ordering him and his attendants to depart <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> in ten days, unless they were come to deliver up the king himself, and all his territories, to the republic by way of dedition. Which decree being notified to them, they returned without so much as having entered the gates of Rome; and the consul soon after landed with a powerful army in Africa. For some time he carried on the war there very briskly, reduced several strong holds, and took many Numidians prisoners. But upon the arrival of Scaurus, a peace was granted Jugurtha upon advantageous terms. That prince coming from Vezza, the place of his residence, to the Roman camp, in order to confer with Belfia and Scaurus, and the preliminaries of the treaty being immediately after settled between them in private conferences, every body at Rome was convinced that the prince of the senate and the consul had to their avarice sacrificed the republic. The indignation therefore of the people in general displayed itself in the strongest manner. Memmius also fired them with his speeches. It was therefore resolved to despatch the praetor Caecilius, a person they could confide in, to Numidia, to prevail upon Jugurtha to come to Rome, that they might learn from the king himself which of their generals and senators had been seduced by the pestilent influence of corruption. Upon his arrival there, he found means to bribe one Bebius Salca, a man of great authority amongst the plebeians, but of insatiable avarice, by whose assistance he escaped with impunity. Nay, by the efficacy of gold, he not only eluded all the endeavours of the people of Rome to bring him to justice, but likewise enabled Bomilcar, one of his attendants, to get Malissa, an illegitimate son of Micipha, assassinated in the streets of Rome. That young prince was advised by many Romans of probity, wellwishers to the family of Mafinissa, to apply for the kingdom of Numidia; which coming to Jugurtha's ears, he prevented the application by this execrable flattery. However, he was obliged to leave Italy immediately.\n\nJugurtha had scarce set foot in Africa, when he received advice that the senate had annulled the shameful peace concluded with him by Belfia and Scaurus. Soon after, the consul <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBINUS\">Albinus</a> transported a Roman army into Numidia, flattering himself with the hopes of reducing Jugurtha to reason before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> of his consulship. In this, however, he found himself deceived; for that crafty prince, by various artifices so annulled and imposed upon Albinus, that nothing of moment happened that campaign. This rendered him strongly suspected of having betrayed his country, after the example of his predecessors. His brother Aulus, who succeeded him in the command of the army, was still more unsuccessful; for after rising from before Suthul, where the king's treasuries were depolished, he marched his forces into a desile, out of which he found it impossible to extricate himself. He therefore was obliged to submit to the ignominious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> of passing under the jugum, with all his men, and to quit Numidia entirely in ten days' time,\nNumidia, time, in order to deliver his troops from immediate destruction. The avaricious disposition of the Roman commander had prompted him to besiege Suthul, the possession of which place he imagined would make him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of all the wealth of Jugurtha, and consequently paved the way to such a scandalous treaty. However, this was declared void as soon as known at Rome, as being concluded without the authority of the people. The Roman troops retired into Africa Propria, which they had now reduced into the form of a Roman province, and there took up their winter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>.\n\nIn the mean time Caius Marius Limetanus, tribune of the people, excited the plebeians to inquire into the conduct of those persons by whose affluence Jugurtha had found means to elude all the decrees of the senate. This put the body of the people into a great ferment; which occasioned a prosecution of the guilty senators, that was carried on, for some time, with the utmost heat and violence. Lucius Metellus the consul, during these transactions, had Numidia assigned him for his province, and consequently was appointed general of the army destined to act against Jugurtha. As he perfectly disdained wealth, the Numidian found him superior to all his temptations; which was a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> to him. To this he joined all the other virtues which constitute the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>; so that Jugurtha found him in all respects inaccessible. That prince therefore was now forced to regulate his conduct according to the motions of Metellus, with the greatest caution; and to exert his utmost bravery, in order to compensate for that hitherto so favourable expedient which now began to fail him. Marius, Metellus's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a>, being likewise a person of uncommon merit, the Romans reduced Vacca, a large opulent city, and the most celebrated mart in Numidia. They also defeated Jugurtha in a pitched battle; overthrew Bomilcar, one of his generals, upon the banks of the Muthullus; and, in fine, forced the Numidian monarch to take shelter in a place rendered almost inaccessible by the rocks and woods with which it was covered. However, Jugurtha signalized himself in a surprising manner, exhibiting all that could be expected from the courage, abilities, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of a consummate general, to whom despair administers fresh strength, and suggests new lights. But his troops could not make head against the Romans; they were again <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-WORSTED\">worsted</a> by Marius, though they obliged Metellus to raise the siege of Zama. Jugurtha therefore, finding his country everywhere ravaged, his most opulent cities plundered, his fortresses reduced, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> burnt, vast numbers of his subjects put to the sword and taken prisoners, began to think seriously of coming to an accommodation with the Romans. His favourite Bomilcar, in whom he reposed the highest confidence, but who had been gained over to the enemy by Metellus, observing this disposition, found it no difficult <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> to persuade him to deliver up his elephants, money, arms, horses, and deserters, in whom the main strength of his army consisted, into the hands of the Romans. Some of these last, in order to avoid the punishment due to their crime, retired to Bocchus king of Mauritania, and fitted in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. But Metellus ordering him to repair to Thalala, a city of Numidia, there to receive farther directions, and he refusing a compliance with that order, hostilities were renewed with greater fury than ever. Fortune now seemed to declare in favour of Jugurtha: he retook Vacca, and massacred all the Roman garrison, except Turpilius the commandant. However, soon after, a Roman legion seized again upon it, and treated the inhabitants with the utmost severity. About this time, one of Matanabal's sons, named Gauda, whom Micipha in his will had appointed to succeed to the crown in case his two legitimate sons and Jugurtha died without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>, wrote to the senate in favour of Marius, who was then endeavouring to supplant Metellus. That prince having his understanding impaired by a declining state of health, fell a more easy prey to the base and infamous adulation of Marius. The Roman, soothing his vanity, assured him, that as he was the next heir to the crown, he might depend upon being fixed upon the Numidian throne, as soon as Jugurtha was either killed or taken; and that this must in a short time happen, when once he appeared at the head of the Roman army with an unlimited commission. Soon after, Bomilcar and Nabdaifa formed a design to assassinate Jugurtha, at the instigation of Metellus; but this being detected, Bomilcar and most of his accomplices suffered death. The plot however had such an effect upon Jugurtha, that he enjoyed afterwards no tranquillity or repose. He suspected persons of all denominations, Numidians as well as foreigners, of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> designs against him. Perpetual terrors sat brooding over his mind; insomuch that he never got a wink of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> but by stealth, and often changed his bed in a low plebeian manner. Starting from his sleep, he would frequently snatch his sword, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> out into the most doleful cries: So strongly was he haunted by a spirit of fear, jealousy, and distraction!\n\nJugurtha having destroyed great numbers of his friends on suspicion of their having been concerned in the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a>, and many more of them deserting to the Romans and Bocchus king of Mauritania, he found himself, in a manner, destitute of counsellors, generals, and all persons capable of assailing him in carrying on the war. This threw him into a deep melancholy, which rendered him dissatisfied with every thing, and made him fatigue his troops with a variety of contradictory motions. Sometimes he would advance with great celerity against the enemy, and at others retreat with no small advantages from them. Then he resumed his former courage; but soon after despaired either of the valour or fidelity of the forces under his command. All his movements therefore proved unsuccessful, and at last he was forced by Metellus to a battle. That part of the Numidian army which Jugurtha commanded, behaved with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>; but the other fled at the first onset. The Romans therefore entirely defeated them, took all their standards, and made a few of them prisoners. But few of them were slain in the action; since, as Sallust observes, the Numidians trifled more to their heels than to their arms for safety in this engagement.\n\nMetellus pursued Jugurtha and his fugitives to Thala. His march to this place being through vast deserts, was extremely tedious and difficult. But being supplied with leatheren bottles and wooden vessels of all sizes taken from the huts of the Numidians, which were filled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> brought by the natives, who had submitted to him, he advanced towards that city.\ncity. He had no sooner begun his march, than a most copious shower of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, a thing very uncommon in those deserts, proved a great and seasonable refreshment to his troops. This so animated them, that upon their arrival before Thala, they attacked the town with such vigour, that Jugurtha with his family, and treasures deposited therein, thought proper to abandon it. After a brave defence, it was reduced; the garrison, consisting of Roman deserters, setting fire to the king's palace, and consuming themselves, together with every thing valuable to them, in the flames. Jugurtha, being now reduced to great extremities, retired into Gaetulia, where he formed a considerable corps. From thence he advanced to the confines of Mauritania; and engaged Bocchus king of that country, who had married his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>, to enter into an alliance with him. In consequence of which, having reinforced his Gaetulian troops with a powerful body of Mauritanians, he turned the tables upon Metellus, and obliged him to keep close within his entrenchments. Sallust informs us, that Jugurtha bribed Bocchus's ministers to influence that prince in his favour; and that having obtained an audience, he infamously, that should Numidia be subdued, Mauritania must be involved in its ruin, especially as the Romans seemed to have vowed the destruction of all the thrones in the universe. In support of what he advanced, he produced several instances very apposite to the point in view. However, the same author seems to intimate, that Bocchus was determined to assist Jugurtha against his enemies by the flight the Romans had formerly shown him. That prince, at the first breaking out of the war, had sent ambassadors to Rome, to propose an offensive and defensive alliance to the republic; which, though of the utmost consequence to it at the juncture, a few of the most venal and infamous senators, who were abandoned to corruption, prevented from taking effect. This undoubtedly wrought more powerfully upon Bocchus in favour of Jugurtha, than the relation he stood in to him: For both the Moors and Numidians adapted the number of their wives to their circumstances, so that some had 10, 20, &c. to their share; their kings therefore were unlimited in this particular, and of course all degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> resulting to them from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> had little force. It is observable, that the posterity of those ancient nations have the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> prevailing amongst them at this day.\n\nSuch was the situation of affairs in Numidia, when Metellus received advice of the promotion of Marius to the consulship. But, notwithstanding this injurious treatment, he generously endeavoured to draw off Bocchus from Jugurtha, though this would facilitate the reduction of Numidia for his rival. To this end ambassadors were despatched to the Mauritanian court, who intimated to Bocchus, \"That it would be highly imprudent to come to a rupture with the Romans without any cause at all; and that he had now a fine opportunity of concluding a most advantageous treaty with them, which was much preferable to a war.\" To which they added, that whatever dependence he might place upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>, he ought not to run the hazard of losing his dominions by embroiling himself with other states, when he could easily avoid this; that it was much easier to begin a war than to end it, which it was in the power of the victor alone to do; that, in fine, he would by no means consult the interest of his subjects if he followed the desperate fortunes of Jugurtha.\" To which Bocchus replied, \"That for his part there was nothing he wished for more than peace; but that he could not help pitying the deplorable condition of Jugurtha; that if the Romans, therefore, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> that unfortunate prince the same terms they had offered him, he would bring about an accommodation.\" Metellus, let the Mauritanian monarch know, that it was not in his power to comply with what he desired. However, he took care to keep up a private negotiation with him till the new consul Marius's arrival. By this conduct he served two wise ends. First, He prevented Bocchus from coming to a general action with his troops; which was the very thing Jugurtha desired, as hoping that this, whatever the event might be, would render a reconciliation between him and the Romans impracticable. Secondly, This inaction enabled him to discover something of the genius and disposition of the Moors; a nation of whom the Romans, till then, had scarcely formed any idea; which, he imagined, might be of no small service, either to himself or his successors, in the future prosecution of the war.\n\nJugurtha, being informed that Marius, with a numerous army, was landed at Utica, advised Bocchus to retire, with part of the troops, to some place of difficult access, whilst he himself took post upon another inaccessible spot with the remaining corps. By this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, he hoped the Romans would be obliged to divide their forces, and consequently be more exposed to his efforts and attacks. He likewise imagined, that seeing no formidable body appear, they would believe the enemy in no condition to make head against them; which might occasion a relaxation of discipline, the usual attendant of a too great security, and consequently produce some good effect. However, he was disappointed in both these views. For Marius, far from suffering a relaxation of discipline to take place, trained up his troops, which consisted chiefly of new levies, in perfect manner, that they were soon equal in goodness to any consular army that ever appeared in the field. He also cut off great numbers of the Getulian marauders, defeated many of Jugurtha's parties, and had like to have taken that prince himself near the city of Cirta. These advantages, though not of any great importance, he gains intimidated Bocchus, who now made overtures for an accommodation; but the Romans, not being sufficiently satisfied of his sincerity, paid no great attention to them. In the meantime Marius pushed on his conquests, reducing several places of less note, and at last resolved to besiege Capfa. That this enterprise might be conducted with the greater secrecy, he suffered not the least hint of his design to transpire, even amongst any of his officers. On the contrary, in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> them, he detached A. Manlius, one of his lieutenants, with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>-armed cohorts, to the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LARES\">Lares</a>, where he had fixed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">magazine</a>, and deposited the military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>. Before Manlius left the camp, that he might the more effectually amuse him, he intimated, that himself with the army should take the same route in a few days: but instead of that, he bent his march towards the Tana\u00efs, and in six days time arrived upon the banks of that river. Here he pitched his tents for a short time, in order to refresh his troops; which having done, he advanced to Capfa, and made himself master of it.\nAs the situation of this city rendered it extremely commodious to Jugurtha, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of operations, ever since the commencement of the war, it had exceedingly favoured, he levelled it with the ground after it had been delivered up to the soldiery to be plundered. The citizens likewise, being more strongly attached to that prince than any of the other Numidians, on account of the extraordinary privileges he indulged them with, and of course bearing a more implacable hatred to the Romans, he put to the sword or sold for slaves. The true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> of the consul's conduct on this occasion seems here to be aligned; though we are told by Sallust, in conformity to the Roman genius, that neither avarice nor resentment prompted him to so barbarous an action, but only a desire to strike a terror into the Numidians.\n\nThe Numidians, ever after this exploit, dreaded the very name of Marius; who now, in his own opinion, had eclipsed the glory of all his predecessor's great achievements, particularly the reduction of Thala, a city, in strength and situation, nearly resembling Capta. Following his blow, he gradually presented himself before most of the places of strength in the enemy's country; many of which either opened their gates, or were abandoned, at his approach, being terrified with what had happened to the unfortunate citizens of Capta. Others taken by force, he laid in ashes; and in short, filled the greatest part of Numidia with blood, horror, and confusion. Then, after an obstinate defence, he reduced a castle that seemed impregnable, seated not far from Mulucha, where Jugurtha kept part of his treasures. In the mean time, Jugurtha not being able to prevail upon Bocchus, by his repeated solicitations, to advance into Numidia, where he found himself greatly perplexed, was obliged to have recourse to his usual method of bribing the Mauritanian ministers, in order to put that prince in motion. He also promised him a third part of his kingdom, provided they could either drive the Romans out of Africa, or get all the Numidian dominions confirmed to him by treaty.\n\nSo considerable a cession could not fail of engaging Bocchus to support Jugurtha with his whole power. The two African monarchs therefore, having joined their forces, surprized Marius near Cirta as he was going into winter quarters. The Roman general was so pusillanimous on this occasion, that the barbarians thought themselves certain of victory, and doubted not but they should be able to extinguish the Roman name in Numidia. But their incursion and too great security enabled Marius to give them a total defeat; which was followed four days after by so complete an overthrow, that their numerous army, consisting of 90,000 men, by the accession of a powerful corps of Moors, commanded by Bocchus's son Volux, was entirely ruined. Sylla, Marius's lieutenant, most eminently distinguished himself in the last action, which laid the foundation of his future greatness. Bocchus, now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> upon Jugurtha's condition as desperate, and not being willing to run the risk of losing his dominions, showed a disposition to clap up a peace with Rome. However, the republic gave him to understand, that he must not expect to be ranked amongst its friends, till he had delivered up into the consul's hands Jugurtha, the inveterate enemy of the Roman name. The Mauritanian monarch, having entertained a high idea of an alliance with that state, resolved to satisfy it in this particular; and was confirmed in his resolution by one Dabir, a Numidian prince, the son of Maflugrada, and defended by his mother's side from Masinissa. Being closely attached to the Romans, and extremely agreeable to Bocchus on account of his noble disposition, he defeated all the intrigues of Aspar, Jugurtha's minister. Upon Sylla's arrival at the Mauritanian court, the affair there seemed to be entirely settled. However, Bocchus, who was for ever projecting new designs, and, like the rest of his countrymen, in the highest degree perfidious, debated within himself, whether he should sacrifice Sylla or Jugurtha, who were both then in his power. He was a long time fluctuating with uncertainty, and combated by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRARIETY\">contrariety</a> of sentiments. The sudden changes which displayed themselves in his countenance, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and his whole person, evidently shewed how strongly his mind was agitated. But at last he returned to his first design, to which the bias of his mind seemed naturally to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> him. He therefore delivered up Jugurtha into the hands of Sylla, to be conducted to Marius; who, by that successful event, happily terminated this dangerous war. The kingdom of Numidia was now reduced to a new form: Bocchus, for his important services, had the country of the Maflafyli, contiguous to Mauritania, assigned him: which, from this time, took the name of New Mauritania. Numidia Propria, or the country of the Maflyli, was divided into three parts; one of which was given to Hiempfal, another to Mandrefal, both descendants of Masinissa; and the third the Romans annexed to Africa Propria, or the Roman province adjacent to it. What became of Jugurtha after he had graced Marius's triumph, at which ceremony he was led in chains, together with his two sons, through the streets of Rome, we have already laid before our readers. See JUGURTHA.\n\nJugurtha's two sons survived him, but spent their lives in captivity at Venufa. However, one of them, named Oxyntas, was, for a short time, released from Jugurtha's confinement by Aponius, who besieged Accerri in the war between the Romans and the Italian allies. That general brought this prince to his army, where he treated him as king, in order to draw the Numidian forces off from the Roman service. Accordingly those Numidians no sooner heard that the son of their old king was fighting for the allies, than they began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> by companies; which obliged Julius Caesar the consul to part with all his Numidian cavalry, and send them back into Africa. Some few years after this event, Pompey defeated C\u00e6lius Domitius Ahenobarbus, and Hiarbas one of the kings of Numidia, killing 17,000 of their men upon the spot. Not satisfied with this victory, that general pursued the fugitives to their camp, which he soon forced, put Domitius to the sword, and took Hiarbas prisoner. He then reduced that part of Numidia which belonged to Hiarbas, who seems to have succeeded Mandrefal above-mentioned; and gave it to Hiempfal, a neighbouring Numidian prince, descended from Masinissa, who had always opposed the Marian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a>.\n\nSuetonius informs us, that a dispute happened between Hiempfal and one Mafintha, a noble Numidian, whom, it is probable, he had in some respect injured, when Julius Caesar first began to make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> in the world. The same author adds, that Caesar warmly espoused\nespoused the cause of Massintha, and even grossly insulted Juba, Hiempsal's son, when he attempted to vindicate his father's conduct on this occasion. He pulled him by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a>, than which a more unpardonable affront could not be offered to an African. In short, he screened Massintha from the insults and violence of his enemies; from whence a reason may be assigned for Juba's adhering so closely afterwards to the Pompeian faction.\n\nIn consequence of the indignity Caesar had offered Juba, and the disposition it had occasioned, that prince did Caesar great damage in the civil wars betwixt him and Pompey. By a stratagem he drew <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CURIO\">Curio</a>, one of his lieutenants, into a general action, which it was his interest at that time to have avoided. He caused it to be given out all over Africa Propria and Numidia, that he was retired into some remote country at a great distance from the Roman territories. This coming to Curio's ears, who was then besieging Utica, it hindered him from taking the necessary precautions against a surprise. Soon after, the Roman general receiving intelligence that a small body of Numidians was approaching his camp, he put himself at the head of his forces in order to attack them, and, for fear they should escape, began his march in the night, looking upon himself as sure of victory. Some of their advanced posts he surprised asleep, and cut them to pieces; which still farther animated him. In short, about daybreak he came up with the Numidians, whom he attacked with great bravery, though his men were then failing, and vastly fatigued by their forced and precipitate march. In the mean time, Juba, who immediately after the propagation of the rumour above mentioned, had taken care to march privately, with the main body of the Numidian army, to support the detachment sent before to decoy Curio, advanced to the relief of his men. The Romans had met with a great resistance before he appeared; so that he easily broke them, killed Curio, with a great part of his troops, upon the spot, pursued the rest to their camp, which he plundered, and took many of them prisoners. Most of the fugitives, who endeavoured to make their escape on board the ships in the port of Utica, were either slain by the pursuers, or drowned. The remainder fell into the hands of Varus, who would have saved them; but Juba, who arrogated to himself the honour of this victory, ordered most of them to be put to the sword.\n\nThis victory infused new life and vigour into the Pompeian faction, who thereupon conferred great honours upon Juba, and gave him the title of king of all Numidia. But Caesar and his adherents declared him an enemy to the state of Rome, adjudging to Bocchus and Bogud, two African princes entirely in their interest, the sovereignty of his dominions. Juba afterwards, uniting his forces with those of Scipio, reduced Caesar to great extremities, and would in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> have totally ruined him, had he not been relieved by Publius Sittius. That general, having formed a considerable corps, consisting of Roman exiles, and Mauritanian troops sent him by Bocchus, according to Dio, or, as Caesar will have it, Bogud, made an irruption into Gaetulia and Numidia, whilst Juba was employed in Africa Propria. As he ravaged these countries in a dreadful manner, Juba immediately returned with the best part of his army, to preserve them from utter destruction. However, Caesar knowing his horse to be Numidia, afraid of the enemy's elephants, did not think proper to attack Scipio in the absence of the Numidian, till his own elephants, and a fresh reinforcement of troops, hourly expected, arrived from Italy. With this accession of strength, he imagined himself able to give a good account, both of the Roman forces with which he was to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPE\">cope</a>, and the barbarians. In the mean time Scipio despatched reiterated expostles to Juba to hasten to his assistance; but could not prevail upon him to move out of Numidia, till he had promised him the possession of all the Roman dominions in Africa, if they could from thence expel Caesar. This immediately put him in motion; so that, having sent a large detachment to make head against Sittius, he marched with the rest of his troops to assist Scipio. However, Caesar at last overthrew Scipio, Juba, and Labienus, near the town of Thapsus, and forced all their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPS\">camps</a>. As Scipio was the first furnished and defeated, Juba fled into Numidia without waiting for Caesar's approach; but the body of the Numidians detached against Sittius, having been broken and dispersed by that general, none of his subjects there would receive him. Abandoned therefore to despair, he fought death in a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> with Petreius, and, having killed him, caused himself to be dispatched by one of his slaves.\n\nAfter this decisive action, and the reduction of Africa Propria, Caesar made himself master of Numidia; reduced to which he reduced to a Roman province, appointing the form of Crispus Sallustius to govern it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of proconsul, with private instructions to pillage and plunder the inhabitants, and, by that means, put it out of their power ever to shake off the Roman yoke. However, Bocchus and Bogud still preferred a sort of sovereignty in the country of the Massiflyi and Mauritania, since the former of those princes, having deserted Caesar, sent an army into Spain, to assist the Pompeians; and the latter, with his forces, determined victory to declare for Caesar at the ever memorable battle of Munda. Bogud, afterwards siding with Antony against Octavius, sent a body of forces to assist him in Spain; at which time the Tingitanians revolting from him, Bocchus, with an army composed of Romans in the interest of Octavius, who palled over from Spain into Africa, and his own subjects, confessed himself of Mauritania Tingitana. Bogud fled to Antony; and Octavius, after the conclusion of the war, honoured the inhabitants of Tingi with all the privileges of Roman citizens. He likewise confirmed Bocchus king of Mauritania Caesariensis, or the country of the Massiflyi, in the possession of Tingitana, which he had conquered, as a reward for his important services. In this he imitated the example of his great predecessor Julius Caesar, who divided some of the fruitful plains of Numidia among the soldiers of P. Sittius, who had conquered great part of that country, and appointed Sittius himself sovereign of that district. Sittius, as has been intimated above, having taken Cirta, killed Sabura, Juba's general, entirely dispersed his forces, and either cut off or taken prisoners most of the Pompeian fugitives that escaped from the battle of Thapsus, highly deserved to be distinguished in so eminent a manner. After Bocchus's death, Mauritania and the Massiflyi Numidia were in all respects considered as Roman provinces.","sp":95,"ep":104},{"h":"NUMISMATOGRAPHIA","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> used for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUN\">NUN</a>\n\ndescription and knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> coins and medals, whether of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, silver, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>.

As to the consecration of virgins, it had some things peculiar in it; it was usually performed publicly in the church by the bishop. The virgin made a public profession of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>, and then the bishop put upon her the accustomed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of sacred virgins. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of this habit was a veil, called the sacrum velamen; another was a kind of mitre or coronet worn upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>.

Its fortifications are a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> wall, flanked with towers mounting cannon, and a deep ditch. The magistrates, and most of the inhabitants, are Lutherans. There are a great many churches and chapels in it.

The trade of this city, though upon the decline, is still very great, many of its manufactures being still exported to all parts of the world; among which may be reckoned a great variety of curious toys in ivory, wood, and metal, already mentioned. The city has also distinguished itself in the arts of painting and engraving.

Afterwards the nurse will begin to set it up and dance it by degrees. The child must be kept as dry as possible.\n\nThe clothing should be very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, and not much longer than the child, that the legs may be got at with ease, in order to have them often rubbed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> with a warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a>, and in particular the inside of them.\n\nRubbing a child all over takes off scurf, and makes the blood circulate.

Let her always keep the child's legs loose. The oftener the posture is changed, the better.\n\nTossing a child about, and exercising it in the open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> in fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, is of the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>.

Upon his affuming this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> he was much more honourably received, cared for, and respected, than former ministers had been. But he was soon detected, reprimanded, and reproached in the severest manner, sent back to the port, and ordered to return to Batavia with all the circumstances of disgrace imaginable; notwithstanding which, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> was so great, that, instead of being punished as he deserved, he was immediately afterwards promoted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Formosa, of which he took possession the year following.\n\nHe entered upon the administration of affairs in that island with the same disposition that he had shown while ambassador, and with the most implacable resentment against\nagainst the Japanese; neither was it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before an opportunity offered, as he thought, of revenging himself to the full. Two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> Japanese ships, with upwards of 500 men on board, came into the port; upon which he took it into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> to disarm and unite them, in the same manner as the Dutch vessels are treated at Japan. The Japanese did all they could to defend themselves from this ill usage; but at last, for want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, they were forced to submit. Governor Nuyts went still farther. When they had finished their affairs at Formosa, and were desirous of proceeding, according to their instructions, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>, he put them off with fair words and fine promises till the monsoon was over. They began then to be very impatient, and desired to have their cannon and sails restored, that they might return home; but the governor had recourse to new artifices, and, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of false promises, endeavoured to hinder them from making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the season proper for that voyage.\n\nThe Japanese, however, soon perceived his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>; and at length, by a bold attempt, accomplished what by fair means and humble entreaty they could not obtain; for, by a daring and well concerted effort, they took him prisoner, and made him and one of the council sign a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> for securing their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, free departure, and indemnity, which was afterwards ratified by the whole council.

Among the rest, one Carvilius Ruga, a man of distinction, imagined that he was bound by his oath to divorce his wife, whom he passionately loved, because she was barren, which was the first instance of a divorce at Rome from its foundation, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> laws of the kings allowed it; it afterwards, however, became shamefully frequent. This is also a striking instance of the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> paid to oaths among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>; it is remarked indeed by all writers, that they paid a most profound respect to them; and on that we know they founded their hopes of success in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>.\nOath.\n\nOur neighbours, or the security of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> is concerned, to invoke him with reverence to witness the truth of our assertions, or the sincerity of our intentions; because of our truth in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, and of our sincerity in all, none but he can be the witness.\n\nThe text of Scripture upon which the Quakers chiefly rest their argument for the unlawfulness of all swearing under the gospel, is our Saviour's prohibition (Mat. v. 34): \"I say unto you, swear not at all.\" But whoever shall take the trouble of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> over his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEXT\">context</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> perceive, that it is only in ordinary conversation, and by no means in courts of justice, that our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> prohibits his followers from swearing at all. There is no evidence whatever, that swearing by heaven, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, or by their own heads, was the form of a judicial oath in use among the Jews. On the contrary, we are told by Maimonides*, that \"if any man swear by heaven, or by earth, yet this is not an oath;\" which surely he could not have said, had such been the forms of judicial swearing. Indeed they could not have admitted such forms into their courts without expressly violating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of Moses, who commands them to \"Fear the Lord (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEHOVAH\">Jehovah</a>) their God, to serve him, and to swear by his name.\" But the Jews, as everyone knows, had such a reverence for the name Jehovah, that they would not pronounce it on flight occasions, and therefore could not swear by that name in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> conversation. Hence, to gratify their propensity to common swearing, they invented such oaths as, by heaven, by earth, by Jerusalem, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of thy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, &c. and by this contrivance they thought to avoid the guilt of profaning the name Jehovah. These, however, being appeals to intangible objects, either had no meaning, or were in fact, as our Saviour justly argues, oaths by that God whose creatures they were; so that the Jew who swore them was still guilty of profaneness towards the very Jehovah whose name his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> would not permit him to pronounce. But what puts it beyond all doubt that the use of judicial oaths is not wholly prohibited in the gospel, is the conduct of our Saviour himself as well as of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a> St Paul. When <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> was simply asked by the high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>, what it was which certain false witnesses testified against him? we are told by the evangelists, that \"he held his peace:\" but being adjured by the living God to declare whether he was the Christ, the Son of God, or not, he immediately answered the high priest, without objecting to the oath (for such it was) upon which he was examined. \"St Paul, in his Epistle to the Romans +, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">Moral <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>.\n\nPaley says, 'God is my witness,' that, without ceasing, I make mention of you in my prayers;\" and to the Corinthians, still more strongly, \"I call God for a record upon my soul, that, to spare you, I came not as yet to Corinth.\" Both these expressions are of the nature of oaths; and the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews speaks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of swearing judicially without any mark of censure or disapprobation: \"Men verily swear by the greater; and an oath, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a>, is to them an end of all strife.\"\n\nBut though a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> has an undoubted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to require the security of an oath upon occasions of real importance, we do not hesitate to say, that, in our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, it is something worse than bad policy to multiply oaths, and to hold out to the people temptations to perjure themselves. The security which an oath affords, depends entirely upon the reverence which attaches to it in the mind of him by whom it is given; but that reverence is much weakened by the frequency of oaths, and by the careless manner in which they are too often administered. An excellent moralist + observes, with Mr Paley, truth, that \"the levity and frequency with which oaths are administered, has brought about a general inadversity to the obligation of them, which both in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> view is much to be lamented; and it merits (continues he) public consideration, whether the requiring of oaths on so many frivolous occasions, especially in the customs, and in the qualification for petty offices, has any other effect than to make them cheap in the minds of the people. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a> cannot travel regularly from the ship to the consumer without coining half a dozen oaths at least; and the same facility for the due discharge of his office, namely that of an oath, is required from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> warden and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a>, from a petty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTABLE\">constable</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> justice of England. Let the law continue its own functions, if they be thought requisite; but let it spare the solemnity of an oath: and where it is necessary, from the want of something better to depend upon, to accept a man's own word or own account, let it annex to prevarication penalties proportioned to the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the offence.\"\n\nThat these pernicious consequences of frequent oaths are not felt only in England, we have the evidence of another respectable writer, whose acuteness well qualified him to observe, whilst his station in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> furnished him with the best opportunities of observing, the effects of repeated swearing upon the morals of Scotchmen. \"Cuffonhouse oaths (says Lord Kames)* Sketcher have become so familiar among us, as to be swallowed of the Hi without a wry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>; and is it certain that bribery and forgery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERJURY\">perjury</a> in electing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> members are not approaching to the same cool state? Men creep on to vice by degrees. Perjury, in order to support a friend, has become customary of late years; witness fictitious qualifications in the electors of parliament-men, which are made effectual by perjury: yet such is the degeneracy of the present times, that no man is the worse thought of upon that account. We must not flatter ourselves, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> will reach no farther: a man who boggles not at perjury to serve a friend, will in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> become such an adept, as to commit perjury in order to ruin a friend when he becomes an enemy.\"\n\nBesides the frequency of oaths, we have mentioned the irreverent manner in which they are too often administered as one of the causes which make them cheap in the estimation of the people. In this view, the form of the oath, and the ceremonies with which it is required to be taken, are of considerable importance. \"The forms of oaths in Christian countries (says Mr Paley) are very different; but in none I believe worse contrived either to convey the meaning, or to impress the obligation of an oath, than in England. In that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> the juror, after repeating the promise or affirmation which the oath is intended to confirm, adds, 'to help me God;' or more frequently the substance of the oath is repeated to the juror by the officer or magistrate who administers it; adding in the conclusion, 'to help you God.' The energy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> resides in the particle...\"\nparticle fo; fo, i.e. hac lege, 'upon condition of my speaking the truth, or performing this promise, may God help me, and not otherwise.' The juror, whilst he hears or repeats the words of the oath, holds his right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> upon a Bible, or other book containing the four gospels. The conclusion of the oath sometimes runs, 'ita me Deus adjuvet, et hoc sancta evangelia,' or 'to help me God, and the contents of this book;' which last clause forms a connexion between the words and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the juror, which before was wanting. The juror then kisses the book.\"\n\nThis obscure and elliptical form, the excellent author justly observes, is ill calculated to impress the juror with reverence; and he seems to think great preference due to the form of judicial oaths in Scotland. In that country the juror holds up his right hand towards heaven, and swears by Almighty God, and as he shall answer to God at the great day of judgement, \"that he will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so far as he knows, or it shall be asked of him.\" This, if administered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> and reverence, is an oath sufficiently solemn and well calculated to have the proper effect upon the mind of the juror, as it brings immediately into his view the Author of his being, and the awful day of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> retribution when every man shall receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done, whether it be good or evil. But when the magistrate, as is too often the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, repeats this solemn invocation without rising from his seat at the name of the Supreme Being, and in a tone of carelessness which may convey to the ignorant juror an opinion that he has himself no serious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> that there ever will be a great day of judgement, the form, however excellent, makes not its full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>.\n\nBut let us suppose the oath to be administered with the greatest dignity and reverence, the words of the promise itself appear to us by no means unexceptionable. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> on life and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, we should be glad to know what this oath binds the witness to declare. Is he to tell all that he knows touching the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> in question? or only all that shall be asked of him? If he be obliged, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of his oath, to tell all that he knows, the clause\u2014\"or it shall be asked of you\" is superfluous, and calculated to mislead. If he be bound to tell nothing more of the truth than what shall be asked of him, the word or should be changed into and; he should swear \"to tell the truth, &c. so far as he knows, and it shall be asked of him.\" The court, we believe, considers the witness as bound to declare everything which he knows touching the matter in question. The greater part of witnesses, on the other hand, consider themselves as bound no farther by their oath than to give true answers to such questions as shall be asked of them. They would do well, however, to remember that as oaths are designed for the security of the public, they must be interpreted in the sense in which the public intends them, otherwise they afford no security. But the sense of the public is the law; and as it belongs to the court to declare what the mind of the law is, the witness, who has any doubt concerning the extent of the obligation imposed on him by the words of this oath, should apply to the court for a solution of that doubt, which will be a safe guide to him respecting the evidence which he is to give. Should the court, in resolving the doubts of a witness, give an opinion concerning the sense of any other part of the oath contrary to what he apprehends to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of the law in imposing it, he is bound to disregard such opinion; because it is only where he himself is doubtful that the court has a right to interfere, and because in all moral questions men must be finally determined by their own judgement and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>.\n\nThere is one case, and but one, in which, whatever sense be put upon the words of the oath, no witness is obliged to declare the whole truth. It is when such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> would tend to accuse himself of some legal crime; for as the laws of Scotland and England constrain no man to become his own accuser, they must be considered as imposing the oath of testimony with this tacit reservation. The exception, however, must be confined to legal crimes. A point of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>, Moral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">Pride</a> of delicacy, or of reputation, may make a witness back-lost, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARD\">ward</a> to disclose some circumstance with which he is acquainted; but is no excuse for concealment, unless it could be shown, that the law which imposes the oath, intended to allow this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> to such motives. The exception is also withdrawn by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> between the magistrate and the witness, when an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMPLICE\">accomplice</a> is admitted to give evidence against the partners of his crime.\" But these are a fort of witnesses to whom a sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a> will always listen with a very cautious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>.\n\nOaths are either affirmary or promissory. Affirmatory oaths are required both to confirm our veracity in evidence, and to give security to the public that we believe certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> conceived to be of public importance. An oath in evidence binds the juror to declare what he knows to be true, and nothing but what he knows to be true. An oath required to assure the public of our belief in the truth of any proposition, cannot, without the guilt of perjury, be taken by any man, who, at the time of swearing, has the slightest doubt whether the proposition be really true. Such an oath, however, though it unquestionably requires the sincerity of the juror's belief at the time when it is given, cannot oblige him to continue in that belief as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as he may live; for belief is not in any man's power: it is the necessary consequence of evidence, which compels the assent of the mind according as it appears to preponderate on the one side or on the other. No man, therefore, can be justly accused of perjury for holding opinions contrary to those which he may formerly have sworn to believe; because his belief at the time of emitting his oath may have been the necessary result of the evidence which then appeared before him; and his change of opinion may have resulted with the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> from superior evidence which had been since thrown into the opposite scale, and made it preponderate. On this account, we cannot help thinking, that all affirmatory oaths, except such as are necessary to confirm testimony respecting facts, ought either to be abolished or expressed with great caution. Of truths intuitively certain or capable of rigid demonstration, no man of common sense can entertain a doubt; and therefore the public never requires from individuals the solemnity of an oath as an assurance of their believing such truths. But with respect to the truth of propositions which admit of nothing superior to moral evidence on either side, a man of the most\nsteady virtue may think differently at different periods of his life; and in such cases, the effect of an oath, if it have any effect, can only be either, to shut the man's eyes against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, or to make his integrity be carelessly questioned by those who shall observe his change of belief.\n\nPromissory oaths cannot, without the guilt of perjury, be given by him, who, at the time of swearing, knows that it will not be in his power to fulfil the promise, or who does not seriously intend to fulfil it. A promissory oath cannot, without great guilt, be given by any man, who at the time of swearing believes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of the promise to be in itself unlawful; for if he seriously <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> to fulfil his oath, he calls upon Almighty God to witness his intention to commit a crime. Promissory oaths give to the public greater security than a simple promise; because the juror having the thoughts of God and of religion more upon his mind at the same time than at the other, offends with a higher hand, and in more open contempt of the divine power, knowledge, and justice, when he violates an oath, than when he breaks a promise. Yet it is certain that promissory oaths, though more solemn and sacred, cannot be binding, when the promise without an oath would not be so in an inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>; for the several cases of which, see Promise and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">Allegiance</a>.\n\nCoronation Oath.

There is a very excellent one now at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, built by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TRUSTEES\">trustees</a> of Dr Radcliffe, at the expense of nearly 30,000l.

In Scotland there is an observatory at Glasgow belonging to the university: there is one erected on the Calton hill at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>; but it is in very bad repair, (see Edinburgh); and there is an excellent one at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>.\n\n5. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRAMINS\">Bramins</a> observatory at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENARES\">Benares</a>. Of this Sir Robert Barker gives the following account, (Phil. Trans. CCCLXX. vol. lxvii. p. 598.). \"Benares in the East Indies, one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> seminaries of the Bramins or priests of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> Gentooos of Hindostan, continues still to be the place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> of people; and there are many public charities, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a>, and pagodas, where some thousands of them now reside. Having frequently heard that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Bramins had a knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, and being confirmed in this by their information of an approaching eclipse both of the sun and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, I made inquiry, when at that place in the year 1772, among the principal Bramins, to endeavour to get some information relative to the manner in which they were acquainted of an approaching eclipse. The most intelligent that I could meet with, however, gave me but little satisfaction. I was told, that these matters were confined to a few, who were in possession of certain books and records; some containing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>; and others the tables of astronomical observations, written in the Sanscrit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, which few understood but themselves: that they would take me to a place which had been constructed for the purpose of making such observations as I was inquiring after, and from whence they supposed the learned Bramins made theirs. I was then conducted to an ancient building of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, the lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of which, in its present situation, was converted into a stable for horses, and a receptacle for lumber; but by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>-yards and apartments, it appeared that it must once have been an edifice for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of some public body of people. We entered this building, and went up a staircase to the top of a part of it, near to the river Ganges, that led to a large terrace, where, to my surprise and satisfaction, I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> a number of instruments yet remaining, in the greatest preservation, stupendously large, immovable from the spot, and built of stone, some of them being upwards of 20 feet in height; and although they are said to have been erected 200 years ago, the graduations and divisions on the several arcs appeared as well cut, and as accurately divided, as if they had been the performance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>. The execution in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of these instruments exhibited a mathematical exactness in the fixing, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a>, fitting of the several parts, in the necessary and sufficient supports to the very large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> that composed them, and in the joining and fastening each into the other by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>.\n\n\"The situation of the two large quadrants of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> marked A in the plate, whose radius is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> feet two inches, by their being at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> with the gnomon...\"\ngnomons at twenty-five degrees elevation, are thrown into such an oblique situation as to render them the most difficult, not only to construct of such a magnitude, but to secure in their position for so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, and affords a striking instance of the ability of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a> in their construction: for by the shadow of the gnomon thrown on the quadrants, they do not appear to have altered in the least from their original position; and so true is the line of the gnomon, that, by applying the eye to a small iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> of an inch diameter at one end, the sight is carried through three others of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a>, to the extremity at the other end, distant 38 feet 8 inches, without obstruction; such is the firmness and art with which this instrument has been executed. This performance is the more wonderful and extraordinary, when compared with the works of the artificers of Hindoostan at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, who are not under the immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of an European mechanic; but arts appear to have declined equally with science in the east.\n\n\" <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">Lieutenant</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> Archibald Campbell, at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> chief engineer in the East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">Company</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a>, made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PERSPECTIVE\">perspective</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> of the whole of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> that could be brought within his eye at one view; but I lament he could not represent some very large quadrants, whose radii were about 20 feet, they being on the side from whence he took his drawing. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, however, is, that they are exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of circles of different radii, the largest of which I judged to be 20 feet, constructed very exactly on the sides of stone walls, built perpendicular, and situated, I suppose, in the meridian of the place: a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> is fixed at the centre or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of the quadrant, from whence, the Bramin informed me, they stretched a wire to the circumference when an observation was to be made; from which, it occurred to me, the observer must have moved his eye up or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the circumference, by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADDER\">ladder</a> or some such contrivance, to raise and lower himself, until he had discovered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTITUDE\">altitude</a> of any of the heavenly bodies in their passage over the meridian, so expressed on the arcs of these quadrants: these arcs were very exactly divided into nine large sections; each of which again into ten, making ninety lesser divisions or degrees; and those also into twenty, expressing three minutes each, of about two-tenths of an inch at sundown; so that it is probable they had some method of dividing even these into more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> divisions at the time of observation.\n\n\"My time would only permit me to take down the particular dimensions of the most capital instrument, or the greater equinoctial sun <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAL\">dial</a>, represented by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> A, which appears to be an instrument to express solar time by the shadow of a gnomon upon two quadrants, one situated to the east, and the other to the west of it; and indeed the chief part of their instruments at this place appear to be constructed for the same purpose, except the quadrants, and a brass instrument that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be described hereafter.\n\n\"Figure B is another instrument for the purpose of determining the exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> of the day by the shadow of a gnomon, which stands perpendicular to, and in the centre of, a flat circular stone, supported in an oblique situation by means of four upright stones and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> piece; so that the shadow of the gnomon, which is a perpendicular iron rod, is thrown upon the division of the circle described on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the flat circular stone.\n\n\"Figure C is a brass circle, about two feet diameter, moving vertically upon two pivots between two stone pillars, having an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> round horizontally on the centre of this circle, which is divided into 360 parts; but there are no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a> divisions on the index to subdivide those on the circle. This instrument appears to be made for taking the angle of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a> at setting or rising, or for taking the azimuth or amplitude of the sun at rising or setting.\n\n\"The use of the instrument, figure D, I was at a loss to account for. It consists of two circular walls; the outer of which is about forty feet diameter, and eight feet high; the wall within about half that height, and appears intended for a place to stand on to observe the divisions on the upper circle of the outer wall, rather than for any other purpose; and yet both circles are divided into 360 degrees, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> being subdivided into twenty lesser divisions, the same as the quadrants. There is a door-way to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> into the inner circle, and a pillar in the centre, of the same height with the lower circle, having a hole in it, being the centre of both circles, and seems to be a socket for an iron rod to be placed perpendicular into it. The divisions on these, as well as all the other instruments, will bear a nice <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPASSES\">compasses</a>.\n\n\"Figure E is a smaller equinoctial sun dial, constructed upon the same principle as the large one A.\n\n\"I cannot quit this subject without observing, that the Bramins, without the assistance of optical glasses, had nevertheless an advantage unexperienced by the observers of the more northern climates.

But, when once it was agreed that every thing capable of ownership should have an owner, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> reason suggested, that he who could first declare his intention of appropriating anything to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of such his intention, actually took it into possession, should thereby <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> property of it; according to that rule of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW_OF_NATIONS\">law of nations</a>, recognized by the laws of Rome, Quod nullius est, id ratione naturali occupanti conceditur.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of occupancy, so far as it concerns real property, hath been confined by the laws of England within a very narrow compass; and was extended only to a single instance; namely, where a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> was tenant pour autre vie, or had an estate granted to himself only (without mentioning his heirs) for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of another man, and died during the life of celui que vive, or him by whose life it was holden: in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> he that could first enter on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, might lawfully retain the possession so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as celui que vive lived, by right of occupancy.\n\nThis seems to have been recurring to first principles, and calling in the law of nature to ascertain the property of the land, when left without a legal owner. For it did not revert to the grantor, who had parted with all his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, so long as celui que vive lived; it did not descend to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> of the fee; for all estates must be of the absolute entire fee, and not of any particular estate carved out of it, much less of so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> a remnant as this: it did not belong to the grantee; for he was dead; it did not descend to his heirs; for there were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> words of inheritance in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a>: nor could it vest in his executors; for no executors could succeed to a freehold. Belonging therefore to nobody, like the hereditas jacea of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, the law left it open to be seized and appropriated by the first person that could enter upon it, during the life of celui que vive, under the name of an occupant. But there was no right of occupancy allowed, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVERSION\">reversion</a> of the lands; for the reversee hath an equal right with any other man to enter upon the vacant possession; and where the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> and a subject's interfere, the king's shall always be preferred. Against the king therefore there could be no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> occupant, because nullum tempus occurrit regi. And, even in the case of a subject, had the estate pour autre vie granted to a man and his heirs during the life of celui que vive, there the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> might, and still may, enter and hold possession, and is called in law a special occupant; as having a special exclusive right, by the terms of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> grant, to enter upon and occupy this hereditas jacea, during the residue of the estate granted; though some have thought him so called with no very great propriety; and that such estate is rather a defeasible freehold. But the title of common occupancy is now reduced almost to nothing by two statutes; the one, 29 Car. II. c. 3. which enacts, that where there is no special occupant, in whom the estate may vest, the tenant pour autre vie may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVISE\">devise</a> it by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, or it shall go to the executors, and be affects in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> for payment of debts: the other that of 14 Geo. II. c. 20. which enacts, that it shall vest not only in the executors, but, in case the tenant dies intestate, in the administrators also; and go in course of a distribution like a chattel interest.\n\nBy these two statutes the title of common occupancy is utterly extinct and abolished: though that of special occupancy, by the heir at law, continues to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; such heir\nOccupancy heir being held to succeed to the ancestor's estate, not by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>, for then he must take an estate of inheritance, but as an occupant, specially marked out and appointed by the original grant. The doctrine of common occupancy may, however, be usefully remembered on the following account, amongst others: That, as by the common law no occupancy could be of incorporeal hereditaments, as of rents, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITHES\">tithes</a>, advowsons, commons, or the like, (because, with respect to them, there could be no actual entry made, or corporal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEISIN\">seisin</a> had;) and therefore by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of the grantee pour autre vie a grant of such hereditaments was entirely determined): to now, it is apprehended, notwithstanding those statutes, such grant would be determined likewise; and the hereditaments could not be devisable, nor vest in the executors, nor go in a course of distribution. For the statutes must not be construed so as to create any new estate, or to keep that alive which by the common law was determined, and thereby to defeat the grantor's reversion; but merely to dispose of an interest in being, to which by law there was no owner, and which therefore was left open to the first occupant. When there is a residue left, the statutes give it to the executors, &c. instead of the first occupant; but they will not create a residue on purpose to give it to the executors. They only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> to provide an appointed instead of a casual, a certain instead of an uncertain, owner, of lands which before were nobody's; and thereby to supply this defectum universus, and render the disposition of the law in all respects entirely uniform; this being the only instance wherein a title to a real estate could ever be acquired by occupancy.\n\nFor there can be no other case devised, wherein there is not some owner of the land appointed by the law. In the case of a sole corporation, as a parson of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, when he dies or resigns, though there be no actual owner of the land till a successor be appointed, yet there is a legal, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POTENTIAL\">potential</a>, ownership, subsisting in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of law; and when the successor is appointed, his appointment shall have a retrospect and relation backwards, so as to entitle him to all the profits from the instant that the vacancy commenced. And, in all other instances, when the tenant dies intestate, and no other owner of the lands is to be found in the common course of descents, there the law vests an ownership in the king, or in the subordinate lord of the fee, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESCHEAT\">escheat</a>.\n\nSo also, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, where the laws of other nations give a right by occupancy, as in lands newly created, by the rising of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> in a river, or by the alluvion or dereliction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>; in these instances, the law of England affirms them an immediate owner. For Bracken tells us, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> an island arise in the middle of a river, it belongs in common to those who have lands on each side thereof; but if it be nearer to one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> than the other, it belongs only to him who is proprietor of the nearest shore: which is agreeable to, and probably copied from, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CIVIL_LAW\">civil law</a>. Yet this seems only to be reasonable, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> of the river is equally divided between the owners of the opposite shores: for if the whole soil is the freehold of any one man, as it must be whenever a several fishery is claimed, there it seems <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> (and so is the usual practice) that the islets, or little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, arising in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the river, shall be the property of him who oweth the pircary and the soil. However, in case a new island rise in the sea, though the civil law gives it to the first occupant, yet our's gives it occupancy to the king. And as to lands gained from the sea; either by alluvion, by the washing up of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, so as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to make terra firma; or by dereliction, as when the sea shrinks back below the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> mark; in these cases the law is held to be, that if this gain be by little and little, by small and imperceptible degrees, it shall go to the owner of the land adjoining.\n\nFor de minimis non curat lex: and besides, these owners being often losers by the breaking in of the sea, or at charges to keep it out, this possible gain is therefore a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> consideration for such possible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> or loss. But if the alluvion or dereliction be sudden and considerable, in this case it belongs to the king: for, as the king is lord of the sea, and so owner of the soil while it is covered with water, it is but reasonable he should have the soil when the water has left it dry. So that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of ground gained, and the time during which it is gained, are what make it either the king's or the subject's property. In the same manner, if a river, running between two lordships, by degrees gains upon the one, and thereby leaves the other dry; the owner who loses his ground thus imperceptibly has no remedy: but if the course of the river be changed by a sudden and violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>, or other hasty means, and thereby a man loses his grounds, he shall have what the river has left in any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> as recompense for this sudden loss. And this law of alluvions and derelictions, with regard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, is nearly the same in the imperial law; from whence indeed those our determinations seem to have been drawn and adopted: but we ourselves, as islanders, have applied them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> increases; and have given our sovereign the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a> he enjoys, as well upon the particular reasons before mentioned, as upon this other general ground of prerogative, which was formerly remarked, that whatever hath no other owner is vested by law in the king.

She was one of the most illustrious ladies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Rome; her virtues and her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> were equally conspicuous.\u2014Prideaux says she was much handsomer than Cleopatra. She married Claudius Marcellus, and after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> M. Antony. Her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> with Antony was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a>, to reconcile her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> and him together. Antony proved for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> attentive to her; but when he had been Cleopatra, he neglected and despised her; and when he attempted to withdraw him from this illegal amours by going to meet him at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, she was rebuked and totally banished from his presence. This affront was highly resented by her brother; and though Octavia endeavoured to pacify him by palliating Antony's behaviour, yet he resolved to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> her cause by arms. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIUM\">Actium</a> and the death of Antony, Octavia, forgetful of her own injuries, took into her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> all the children of her husband, and treated them with extraordinary tenderness. Marcellus, her son by her first husband, was married to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIECE\">niece</a> of Augustus, and openly intended as a successor to his uncle. His sudden death plunged all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> into the greatest grief. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a>, whom Augustus patronized, undertook of himself to pay a melancholy tribute to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of a young man whom Rome had looked upon as her future father and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a>. He was desired to repeat his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> in the presence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> and his sister. Octavia burst into tears even when the poet began; but when he mentioned Tu Marcellus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERIS\">eris</a>, she swooned away. This tender and pathetic encomium upon the merit and the virtues of young Marcellus she liberally rewarded; and Virgil received 10,000 sesterces, according to some 78L. 2s. 6d. for every one of the verses. Octavia had two daughters by Antony, Antonia <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> and Antonia <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a>.\u2014The elder married L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, by whom she had Cn. Domitius, who was the father of the emperor Nero by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGRIPPINA\">Agrippina</a> the daughter of Germanicus. Antonia Minor, who was as virtuous and as beautiful as her mother, married Drusus the son of Tiberius, by whom she had Germanicus, and Claudius who reigned before Nero.\n\nThe death of Marcellus constantly preyed upon the mind of Octavia, who died of grief or melancholy, about 11 years before the Christian era. Her brother paid great regard to her memory, and pronounced her funeral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORATION\">oration</a> himself. The Roman people also showed their regard to her virtues, by willing to pay her divine honours.\u2014A daughter of the emperor Claudius by Messalina. She was betrothed to Silanus, but by the intrigues of Agrippina, she was married to the emperor Nero in the 16th year of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. She was soon after divorced under pretence of barrenness; and the emperor married Poppea, who exercised her enmity upon Octavia by procuring her to be banished into Campania. She was afterwards recalled by the people; but Poppea, who was determined on her ruin, caused her again to be banished to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, where she was ordered to kill herself by opening her veins. Her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> was cut off and carried to Poppea.\n\nOctavianus, or Octavius Caesar, was nephew of Julius Caesar the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DICTATOR\">dictator</a>, being the son of Accia his sister by Octavius a senator, and afterwards became the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> emperor of Rome. He was born in the year of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> 691, during the consulship of Cicero. His uncle Julius Caesar adopted him, and left him the greatest part of his fortune. When he was but 20 years of age, he was raised to the consulship. His youth and inexperience were ridiculed by his enemies; notwithstanding which obstacle, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and valour raised his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>. He made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> against his opponents on pretence of avenging the assassination of his uncle. He engaged in five civil wars with great success, viz. The wars of Mutina, Perusia, Philippi, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, and Actium; the first and last of which were against M. Antony; the second against L. Antony, brother of the triumvir; the third was against Brutus and Cassius; and the fourth against Sext. Pompey, son of Pompey the Great. He united his forces with Antony's at the battle of Philippi; and had he not been supported by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> and bravery of his colleague, he would doubtless have been totally ruined in that engagement. In this triumvirate with Antony and Lepidus, he obtained the western parts of the Roman empire; and, like his other colleagues, more firmly to establish his power, he proscribed his enemies and cut them off. The triumvirate lasted for 10 years. He had given his sister Octavia in marriage to Antony, to make their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> more lasting; but when Cleopatra had charmed this unfortunate man, Octavia was repudiated. Augustus immediately took up arms to avenge the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WRONGS\">wrongs</a> of his sister; but perhaps more eager to remove a man whose power and existence kept him in continual fear and constant dependence. Both parties met at Actium to decide the fate of Rome. Antony was supported by all the power of the east, and Augustus by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>. Cleopatra fled from the battle with 60 ships; and her flight ruined the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of Antony, who followed her into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>. The conqueror soon after went into Egypt likewise, besieged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, and honoured with a magnificent funeral his unfortunate colleague and the celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>, whom the fear of being led in the victor's triumph at Rome had driven to commit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUICIDE\">suicide</a>. After he had established peace all over the world, he shut the gates of the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JANUS\">Janus</a>, A.U.C. 753. He was twice determined to lay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the supreme power and\nOctavianus immediately after the victory obtained over Antony, and on account of his ill <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>; but his two faithful friends Mecenas and Agrippa dissuaded him, and contended, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he did he would leave it to be the prey of the most powerful, and expose himself to the greatest dangers. He died at Nola in the 76th year of his age, after he had held the sovereign power for 57 years.\u2014He was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> emperor, and consulted the good of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> with the greatest anxiety and care. He visited all the provinces except <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARDINIA\">Sardinia</a>, and his consummate prudence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> occasioned many salutary laws. He is, however, accused of licentiousness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADULTERY\">adultery</a>; but the goodness of his heart, the fidelity of his friendship, and the many good qualities which the poets whom he patronized have perhaps truly celebrated, made some, though in the eye of strict <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and true morality but little, amends for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> foibles. He was ambitious of being esteemed handsome; and as he was publicly reported to be the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a> according to his mother's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a>, he wished his flatterers to represent him with the figure and attributes of that god. Like Apollo, his eyes were clear, and he affected to have it thought that they possessed some divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRRADIATION\">irradiation</a>, and was well pleased if, when he fixed his eyes upon any body, they held down their eyes as if overcome by the glaring brightness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>. He distinguished himself by his learning; he was a complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, and wrote some tragedies, besides <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> and other works, which are now lost. He married four times; but he was unhappy in all these connexions; and his only daughter Julia disgraced herself and her father by the debauchery and licentiousness of her manners. He recommended at his death his adopted son Tiberius as his successor. He left his fortune partly to him and to Drusus, and made donations to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> and Roman people. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Augustus was conferred upon him by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> after the battle of Actium and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> destruction of the Roman republic. The title <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> afterwards, being given to his successors in the empire.

According to the account given of this conqueror by Snorro, the ancient historian of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a>, and his commentator Torlaus, Odin was a Scythian, who withdrew himself, with many others in his train, by flight, from the vengeance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, under the conduct of Pompey; and having officiated as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, he assumed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> worship, as well as the civil government, of the nations which he conquered. Having subdued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>, and Norway, he retired to Sweden, where he died. There is nothing certain in this account; but it is probable, that the god, whose prophet or priest this Scythian pretended to be, was named Odin, and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of succeeding ages confounded the deity with his priest, composing out of the attributes of the one, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the other, the character of the northern conqueror.

The Hebrews had several kinds of offerings, which they presented at the temple. Some were free-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> offerings, and others were of obligation. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITHES\">tithes</a>, the sin offerings, were of obligation; the peace offerings, vows, offerings of wine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, and other things, which were made to the temple or to the ministers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>, were offerings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>. The Hebrews called all offerings in general corban. But the offerings of bread, salt, fruits, and liquors, as wine and oil, which were presented to the temple, they called mincha. The sacrifices are not properly offerings, and are not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> included under that name. See CORBAN and SACRIFICE.\n\nThe offerings of grain, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>, bread, cakes, fruits, wine, salt, and oil, were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in the temple. Sometimes these offerings were alone, and sometimes they accompanied the sacrifices. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">Honey</a> was never offered with the sacrifices; but it might be offered alone in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of first fruits. Now these were the rules that were observed in the presenting of those offerings, called in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> mincha, or kerbon mincha; in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEPTUAGINT\">Septuagint</a>, offerings of sacrifice; and the same by St Jerome, oblationem sacrificii; but by our translators, meat offerings (Lev. ii. i., &c.). There were five sorts of these offerings: 1. Fine flour or meal. 2. Cakes of several sorts, baked in an oven. 3. Cakes baked upon a plate. 4. Another sort of cakes, baked upon a gridiron, or plate with holes in it. 5. The first fruits of the new corn, which were offered either pure and without mixture, or roasted or parched in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> or out of the ear.\n\nThe cakes were kneaded with oil olive, or fried with oil in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAN\">pan</a>, or only dipped in oil after they were baked. The bread offered to be presented upon the altar, was to be without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAVEN\">leaven</a>; for leaven was never offered upon the altar, nor with the sacrifices. But they might make presents of common bread to the priests and ministers of the temple. See CAKE, &c.\n\nThe offerings now mentioned were appointed on ac-\nOfferings. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> of the poorer sort, who could not go to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of sacrificing animals. And even those that offered living victims were not excused from giving meal, wine, and salt, which was to go along with the greater sacrifices. And also those that offered only oblations of bread or of meal, offered also oil, incense, salt, and wine, which were in a manner the feasting of it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> in waiting received the offerings from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of him that offered them; laid a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of them upon the altar, and reserved the rest for his own subsistence: that was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> as a minister of the Lord. Nothing was burnt quite up but the incense, of which the priest kept back nothing for his own share.\n\nWhen an Israelite offered a loaf to the priest, or a whole cake, the priest broke the loaf or the cake into two parts, setting that part aside that he referred to himself, and broke the other into crumbs; poured oil upon it, salt, wine, and incense; and spread the whole upon the fire of the altar. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> these offerings be accompanied by an animal for a sacrifice, it was all thrown upon the victim, to be consumed along with it.\n\nIf these offerings were the ears of new corn, either of wheat or barley, these ears were parched at the fire or in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>, and rubbed in the hand, and then offered to the priest in a vessel; over which he put oil, incense, wine, and salt, and then burnt it upon the altar, first having taken as much of it as of right belonged to himself.\n\nThe greatest part of these offerings were voluntary, and of pure devotion. But when an animal was offered in sacrifice, they were not at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to omit these offerings. Everything was to be supplied that was to accompany the sacrifice, and which served as a feasting to the victim. There are some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> in which the law requires only offerings of corn, or bread: for example, when they offered the first fruits of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARVEST\">harvest</a>, whether they were offered solemnly by the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, or by the devotion of private persons.\n\nAs to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of meal, oil, wine, or salt, which was to go along with the sacrifices, we cannot easily see that the law had determined it. Generally the priest threw an handful of meal or crumbs upon the fire of the altar, with wine, oil, and salt in proportion, and all the incense. All the rest belonged to him, the quantity depended upon the liberality of the offerer. We observe in more places than one, that Moses appoints an affaron, or the tenth part of an ephah of meal, for those that had not wherewithal to offer the appointed sin offerings (Lev. v. 11, xiv. 21.). In the solemn offerings of the first fruits for the whole nation, they offered an entire sheaf of corn, a lamb of a year old, two tenths or two affarons of fine meal mixed with oil, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an hin of wine for the libation. (Lev. xxiii. 10, 11, 12, &c.).\n\nIn the sacrifice of jealousy (Numb. v. 15.), when a jealous husband accused his wife of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDELITY\">infidelity</a>, the husband offered the tenth part of a fatum of barley-meal, without oil or incense, because, it was a sacrifice of jealousy, to discover whether his wife was guilty or not.\n\nThe offerings of the fruits of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, of bread, of wine, oil, and salt, are the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> of any that have come to our knowledge. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIN\">Cain</a> offered to the Lord of the fruits of the earth, the first fruits of his labour (Gen. iv. 3, 4.). <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABEL\">Abel</a> offered the firstlings of his flocks, and of their fat. The heathen have nothing more ancient in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, than these sorts of offerings made to their gods.

To avoid all profane talk and intricate debates on sacred topics. To endeavour to get the better of the intrusions of indolence of mind and body, those certain harbingers of enfeebling age. Rather to wear out, than to rust out. To rise early, and as often as possible to go to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> before midnight. Not to nod in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>, nor to indulge repose too frequently on the couch in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. To waste as little of life in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> as may be, for we shall have enough in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>. Not to give up walking; nor to ride on horseback to fatigue. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">Experience</a>, and a late medical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, determine to ride five miles every day: Nothing contributes more to the preservation of appetite, and the prolongation of life.

To continue the practice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a>, pursued for more than fifty years, in books on all subjects; for variety is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> of the mind as well as of life. Other people's thoughts, like the best conversation of one's companions, are generally better and more agreeable than one's own. Frequently to think over the virtues of one's acquaintance, old and new. To admit every cheerful ray of sunshine on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>. To avoid retrospection on a past friendship, which had much of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> in it; for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> often comes when she is not invited. To try to think more of the living and less of the dead; for the dead belong to a world of their own. To live within one's income, be it large or little. Not to let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> of any sort run away with the understanding. Not to encourage romantic hopes nor fears. Not to drive away hope, the sovereign balm of life, though he is the greatest of all flatterers. Not to be under the dominion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> or enthusiasm. Not willingly to undertake any thing for which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a> of the mind or the body are not strong enough. Not to run the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of competition, or to be in another's way. To avoid being jostled too much in the street, being overcome by the noise of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a>, and not to be carried even by curiosity itself into a large crowd. To strive to embody that dignified sentiment, \"to write injuries in dust, but kindliness in marble.\" Not to give the reins to constitutional impatience, for it is apt to hurry on the first expressions into the indecency of swearing. To recollect, that he who can keep his own temper may be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of another's. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> one cannot be a stoic, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> and forbearing, on every trying occasion, yet it may not be impossible to pull the check-string against the moroseness of spleen or the impetuosity of peevishness. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">Anger</a> is a short madness. Not to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> in love, now on the precipice of three score, nor expect to be fallen in love with. A connexion between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> and winter is an improper one. Love, like fire, is a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a>, but a bad master. Love is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, when the animal spirits are gone. To contrive to have as few vacant hours upon one's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> as possible, that idleness, the mother of crimes and vices, may not pay its visit. To be always doing of something, and to have something to do. To fill up one's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, and to have a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> to fill up: for time is the materials that life is made of.

To make the best and the most of everything. Not to indulge too much in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, nor yet to undermine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>. The gout, rheumatism, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DROPSY\">dropsy</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of the Spectator, seem to be hovering over the dishes. Wine, the great purveyor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> among the senses, offers his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, when love takes his leave. It is natural to catch hold of every help, when the spirits begin to droop. Love and wine are good cordials, but are not proper for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEVERAGE\">beverage</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. Resolve not to go to bed on a full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a> and a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> are the best receipts for a good night's rest, and the parents of undisturbing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a>. Not to be enervated by the flatulence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>. Let the second or third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>'s thought be to consider of the employment for the day; and one of the last at night to inquire what has been done in the course of it. Not to let one's tongue run at the expense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. Not to be too communicative nor unrevealed. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> tongue, with an open countenance, are the safest passports through the journey of the world. To correct the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of too much talking, and refrain the narrativeness of the approaching climacteric. To take the good-natured side in conversation. However, not to praise everybody, for that is to praise nobody. Not to be inquisitive, and eager to know secrets, nor be thought to have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> full of other people's affairs. Not to make an enemy, nor to lose a friend. To aim at the esteem of the public, and to leave a good name behind. Not to be singular in dress, in behaviour, in notions, or expressions of one's thoughts. Never to give bad advice, and to strive not to let a bad example. Seldom to give advice till asked, for it appears like giving something that is superfluous to one's self. Not to like or dislike too much at first sight. Not to wonder, for all wonder is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> that possession falls short of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a>. The longing of twenty years may be disappointed in the unanticipated gratification of a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>.\nhour. Whilst we are willing, we see the best side; after we have taken possession, the worst. Refuse to attend to the arguments on both sides, and to hear every body against everybody. The mind ought not to be made up, but upon the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>. To be affectionate to relations, which is a kind of self-love, in preference to all other acquaintance. But not to omit paying the commanding respect to merit, which is superior to all the accidental chain of kindred. Not to debilitate the mind by new and future compositions. Like the spider, it may spin itself to death. The mind, like the field, must have its fallow season. The leisure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> has created <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> acquaintance, and pleased all it has wished to please. To resolve not to be too free of promises, for performances are sometimes very difficult things. Not to be too much alone, nor to read, nor meditate, or talk too much on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> that may awaken tender sensations, and be too pathetic for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>. To enjoy the present, not to be made too unhappy by reflection on the past, not to be oppressed by invisible gloom on the future. To give and receive comfort, those necessary alms to a distrested mind. To be constantly thankful to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">providence</a> for the plenty hitherto possessed, which has preserved one from the dependence on party, persons, and opinions, and kept one out of debt. The appearance of a happy situation, and opportunities of taking many worldly felicities (for content has seldom perverted itself into discontent), has induced many to conclude, that one must be pleased with one's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> in life; and it occasions many to look with the eye of innocent envy. To resolve more than ever to shun every public station and responsibility of conduct. To be satisfied with being master of one's self, one's habits, now a second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and one's time. Determined not to solicit, unless trampled upon by fortune, to live and die in the harness of trade, or a profession. To take care that pity (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> is not here meant) does not find out one in the endurance of any calamity. When pity is within call, contempt is not far off. Not to wish to have a greater hold of life, nor to quit that hold. The possible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENURE\">tenure</a> of existence is of too short a possession for the long night that is to succeed: therefore not a moment to be lost. Not to lose sight even for a single day, of these good and proverbial daughters\u2014diet\u2014merryman\u2014and quiet. Resolved to remember and to recommend, towards tranquillity and longevity, the three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORAL\">oral</a> maxims of Sir Hans Sloane\u2014\"Never to quarrel with one's self\u2014one's wife\u2014or one's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>.\" Lastly, Not to put one's self too much in the power of the elements, those great enemies to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> frame; namely, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>\u2014the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>\u2014the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>\u2014and the night <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>.\n\nOld <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">Man</a> of the Mountain.

By his means the famous statute against profaners was revived, and guarded against by severer penalties; he was one of the leaders of the reforming party; was at great expense in procuring and dispersing copies of Wickliffe's writings among the people, as well as by maintaining a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of his disciples as itinerant preachers. In the reign of Henry V. he was accused of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a>; the growth of which was attributed to his influence. Being a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, the king delayed his prosecution that he might reason with him himself; but not being able to reclaim him to the church of Rome, he in great displeasure resigned him to its censure. He was apprehended and condemned for heresy; but escaping from the Tower, lay concealed for four years in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, until the rumour of a pretended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> was raised against him, and a price set upon his head: he was at last seized and executed in St Giles's Fields; being hung alive in chains upon a gallows, and burned by a fire placed underneath. He wrote \"Twelve Conclusions, addressed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">Parliament</a> of England.\"\n\nOldenburg, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>. The origin of this illustrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, we are told, is this:\n\nOn the death of Christopher king of Denmark, &c., in 1443, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>, there was a great contest about the succession; and a variety of factions were raised, particularly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a>, for the promotion of different persons; and various animosities and numerous discords were excited by the several parties, in order each to obtain their own ends.\n\nAs soon as these intrigues were known in Denmark, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> resolved to proceed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of a king; for it did not appear expedient to commit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of affairs to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> dowager, at a time when they had every thing to fear from the two neighbouring crowns. At this time a lord of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, and ambition, sought the queen in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, the more easily to pave his way to the throne. This is a fact mentioned by Pontanus and Meurinus, though neither takes notice of his name. But as for a great number of years there was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> precedent for electing a king out of the body of nobility, though agreeable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, the queen entered into the views of the senate, and declared she would give her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> to no prince who should not be judged deserving of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> by the supreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>.\n\nThe advantages which would have accrued from annexing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUCHY\">duchy</a> of Sleswick and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLSTEIN\">Holstein</a> to the crown, made the senate first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> their eyes on Adolphus. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> required no long deliberation; all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the conveniences resulting from such an union, and gave their assent. Immediately an embassy was despatched with the offer to Adolphus; but that prince consulting the good of his subjects, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> would have been absorbed in the superior weight of Denmark, declined it, with a moderation and disinterestedness, altogether uncommon among princes. However, that he might not be wanting in respect to the senate, he proposed to them his nephew Christian, second son to Theodoric, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> of Oldenburg, a prince bred up at the court of Adolphus from his infancy. The proposition was so agreeable to the senate, that, without loss of time, the ambassadors were sent to Theodoric, to demand either of his sons he should pitch upon for their king. Theodoric's answer to the ambassadors was remarkable: \"I have three sons, says he, of very opposite qualities. One is passionately fond of pleasure and women; another breathes nothing but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, without regarding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> of the cause; but the third is moderate in his disposition, prefers\nOldenburg prefers peace to the din of arms, yet stands unrivalled in valour, generosity, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a>.\" He said he painted these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> for the senate's information, desiring they would choose which of the young princes they believed would render the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> happiest. It was a matter which would admit of no hesitation; with one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> the senate declared for that prince whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PANEGYRIC\">panegyric</a> the father had so warmly drawn; and under these happy auspices commenced the origin of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> of the house of Oldenburg, at this day seated on the throne of Denmark.","sp":133,"ep":136},{"h":"OLD-WIFE","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Wrangle.

Philip <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> sooner became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, than he became the subject of this his favourite. The king had abilities, it is true, but they lay dormant; and whilst he spent his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> in little inactivity, the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> was under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of Olivarez. The count's management, indeed, was sufficiently dexterous in accomplishing his own designs; for by the best framed excuses, and on the most plausible pretexts, he removed all such as he thought stood in his way; nor did he stop there, but sometimes persecuted his rivals even to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, of which Don Rodrigo Calderona was a melancholy instance, an instance which at that time excited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> compassion. This minister, in short, had a genius of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> kind; added to which, he had a disposition which spurned all controul.\n\nHe had persecuted the late ministry for their pusillanimity in the management of affairs; he therefore thought it necessary, and it was certainly prudent, to pursue new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>. His self-sufficiency, though unbounded, was concealed under the veil of assumed meekness, and he was careful to make it appear that he was wholly taken up with the things of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>. His politics were of a refined perhaps, but not of a very useful tendency; for his imprudence, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> his wrong notions on the subject, made him renew a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, contrary to the universal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> and the people. By the same imprudence, or by something worse, he provoked England, and obliged her to endeavour to humble the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> and lessen the authority of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a>. Thus far he had been of little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>.\nservice to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, having only provoked the resentment of the most powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, particularly England, France, Holland, &c., to conspire for its ruin. It is remarkable that Olivarez, notwithstanding this, never lost his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>; and indeed things so turned about in the end, that though Spain for a whole year was put to the severest trials, it acquired a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> which sufficiently, in the general opinion, overbalanced some little losfs. Olivarez too was particularly fortunate in making the peace; in which transaction he gained a very considerable advantage over Richelieu, so that things appeared to be still in a very favourable train. Fortune, however, was not always quite so indulgent to the schemes of this minister: he again drew Spain into a war with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANTUA\">Mantua</a>, contrary to the sentiments of the wisest men; from which is justly dated its declension, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not its ruin.\n\nOn the whole, Olivarez seems to have been always averse to peace; and with such a restless disposition, it is undoubtedly wonderful that he held his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and with so few complaints as he did.\n\nIt was certainly owing to his ambition and obstinacy, that an almost general war was excited about the year 1627, and which, as we have said, proved so fatal to Spain. So averse, indeed, does he appear to have been to peace, that he used every means in his power to prevent the restoration of it in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>; and for this very purpose he sent Feria into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a>, whom he knew to be a man of such a temper and abilities as suited his purposes; for he was naturally averse to quiet. He endeavoured to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the alliances of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Mantua by various stratagems; but they did not succeed: the schemes of Olivarez and the intrigues of Feria being totally defeated. Our minister had soon after this another cause of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a>, on Richelieu's being created a duke and peer of France, and unanimously admitted among the Venetian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>; which could not fail to be a severe stroke on Olivarez, who considered him as his implacable enemy.\n\nThe people at length began to see and be displeased with his conduct; and with reason, had they known it all, for it was in many instances cruel and detestable. Indeed the differences which at that time had so long subsisted between France and Spain were the effect of the private animosity between him and Richelieu. Things, however, so turned about, and Spain was so unusually successful, that the faults of the minister were overlooked for the time; but this unexpected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> had no other effect than that of making him far more insolent than ever. He was, in every instance, one of the most headstrong and obstinate men in the world: he had set his heart on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of Cafal in Italy, and he was determined on it at whatever hazard; this foolish enterprise was, however, unaccountably defeated, and the Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> experienced a total defeat.\n\nThe revolt of the Catalans, whom he wished to deprive of their privileges, was the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of his folly: he had privately employed the marquis de los Velez to extinguish this rebellion; but the cruelty of the measures used for this purpose only inflamed it more. The revolution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, another disastrous event, was also the result of his obstinacy and rigour.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of ill fortune, which ought to have opened the eyes of the Catholic king and his ministers, seemed to infatuate both. The great secret by which Olivarez had governed his matters was being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>, or at least the confidant, of his pleasures. While he affected to deceive the world with a specious appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, he was not only immersed in vice himself, but encouraged and promoted it in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, to the scandal of his subjects, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> of his affairs. At this time, of all others the most improper, Olivarez produced a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASTARD\">bastard</a> of his, hitherto called Julian; he had taken to little care of this son, that, not able to subsist in Spain, he had passed over to the Indies, where, in very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> stations, he had scarcely got <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>. On him he now bestowed the name of Don Henrico de Guzman; and bringing him with great pomp and splendour to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, either flattered or forced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTABLE\">constable</a> of Castile to give him his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>; in consideration of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> he was to devolve upon him his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUCHY\">duchy</a> of St Lucar. In the beginning of his administration, by some accident or other, he presented to the king a memorial, in relation to an affair upon which his majesty had already received one from Don Balthasar de Zuniga: upon comparing them, they contradicted each other flatly. The king ordered a person of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> to inquire thoroughly into this business; in consequence of which Don Balthasar's memorial appeared to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, and that of Olivarez the reverse of it. The king was very angry; but the count regained his favour, by procuring for him the fair actress Calderone. By this woman he had a son, of whom no great notice was taken; but now, to obscure the folly of the count duke, this youth, scarce in the 14th year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, was produced, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Don Juan of Austria, and declared <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERALISSIMO\">generalissimo</a> of the army against Portugal; while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, Don Balthasar, was left under the tuition, or rather in the custody of the counsellors of Olivarez; at which conduct the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> was chagrined, the people enraged, and the world in general affronted.\n\nHis schemes now began to be entirely broken and defeated everywhere and in every kind; he fell under the displeasure of the queen, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>, the grandees, and the people all at once, and experienced the disgrace he had long merited. His ill fortune, which came upon him with the force of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a>, did not, however, wholly overpower him; he was indeed obliged to conceal himself, in order to avoid the rage of the populace: but he had still confidence enough to offer an apology for his conduct, which possessed no inconsiderable share of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>, well tempered with spirit and masterly reasoning.

For this purpose, at the recommendation of his favourite, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a> made choice of Affalli, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> of the marquis Affalli, who had married a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIECE\">niece</a> of Olympia. Olympia indeed was slightly consulted on the affair, and showed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> disapprobation of the appointment. The pope, however, no sooner got him fixed in his new office, than he showed his own weakness by repenting of it. Olympia too was displeased, and by her solicitations procured the disgrace of Affalli, before had enjoyed either the honours or emoluments of his office. Panzirollo, however, soon managed matters so as to turn the scales: he prevailed on the pope again to countenance and honour Affalli; and, what was more, had influence sufficient to persuade him to disgrace Olympia, and to banish her court. She had indeed abused her authority in a most scandalous manner, and had gained such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> ascendant over the pope, that in everything his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> had been subservient to her dictates.\u2014Her avarice and ambition were unbounded: she disposed of all benefices, which were kept vacant till she fully informed herself of their value: she rated an office of 1000 crowns for three years, at one year's revenue, and if for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, at 12 years purchase, one half of which sum she required to be paid in advance: she gave audience upon public affairs, enacted new laws, abrogated those of former popes, and sat in council with Innocent, with bundles of memorials in her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>. It was generally said that they lived together in a criminal correspondence, and that she had charmed him by some secret incantation. In the Protestant countries the loves and intrigues of Innocent and Donna Olympia were represented upon the stage; and fevere sarcasms were daily put into the hands of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASQUIN\">Pasquin</a> at Rome.\u2014As she had usurped such an absolute authority, the new cardinal nephew <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of ruining her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>; he therefore seconded the endeavours of Panzirollo.\u2014He intimated to the pope, that his reputation had suffered greatly among the Catholics by her scandalous proceedings, and that his nuncios were treated with disrespect and contempt at the courts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>, France, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>. Upon these representations, Innocent at length, but with great reluctance, banished Olympia, and was reconciled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> Camillo and the princess Roffano; though some authors affirm that her banishment was no more than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> retreat, and that she still in private directed the affairs of the pope. A woman of Olympia's character, however, with such unbounded ambition, such an extravagant lust for power, and such an ambitious desire of wealth, and who had once possessed so great an ascendancy over such a man as Innocent, was not to be so easily put off. She was banished in 1650; but in 1653, she again assumed the supreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of affairs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as before her disgrace. She again accomplished the disgrace of Affalli, and procured the promotion of Azzolini to the office of secretary of the briefs. In 1654, his holiness resigned himself entirely into the hands of this affuming woman; who, observing his infirmities daily increasing, redoubled her rapacity, disposing of benefices to the highest bidders in all parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>. She was again, however, in hazard of being displaced by a new favourite, viz. the cardinal de Retz; and had not the pope's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> prevented it, it would in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> quickly have taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. During his last illness he received nothing but from the hands of Donna Olympia, who was at great pains to prolong his life, watched continually at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> side, and prevented the ambassadors or others from disturbing him with discourses upon business. She is said, during the last ten days of his life, when he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of reason, to have amassed about half a million of crowns. She did not find the succeeding pope (Alexander VII.) so easy to be played upon as his weak predecessor: a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of memorials were sent in against her, and his holiness was well disposed to attend to them: he ordered her to retire from Rome, and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> began to examine witnesses reflecting her conduct. She was cut off, however, before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> was finished, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>, which, in 1656, afflicted Rome and its neighbourhood. Her estate was not confiscated as was generally expected; and the prince Pamphilio was allowed to succeed her. The pope only referred for his own relations about a million of crowns.\n\nOlympia, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">Ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">Geography</a>, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURNAME\">surname</a> Pifatius (Strabo); so called from the territory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PISA\">Pisa</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIS\">Elis</a>; described by Strabo, \"as the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> Olympus, before which stands a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROVE\">grove</a> of wild olive trees, in which is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STADIUM\">stadium</a>, or foot-course, so called because the eighth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>; and by which the Alpheus, coming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCADIA\">Arcadia</a>, runs.\" Olympia, however, was famous not merely for the temple of Jupiter, but also for a temple of Juno, 63 feet long, with columns round it of the Doric order; and a Metroum or temple of the mother of the gods, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> Doric edifice; with holy treasuries. There, and the porticoes, a gymnastum, prytaneum, and many more buildings, chiefly in the enclosure, with the houses of the priests and other inhabitants, made Olympia no inconsiderable place. The stadium was in the grove of wild olive trees, before the great temple; and near it was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPODROME\">hippodrome</a> or course for the races of horses and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARIOTS\">chariots</a>. The Alpheus flowed by from Arcadia with a copious and very pleasant stream, which was received on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> by the Sicilian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>.\n\nThe temple of Jupiter was of the Doric order, 68 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> to the pediment, 95 wide, and 230 long; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CELL\">cell</a> encompassed with columns. It was erected with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> not of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> baked, but of Pentelic marble; the slabs disposed as tiles; the way to it up a winding staircase. The two pediments were enriched with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>; and one had over the centre a statue of Victory gilded; and underneath a votive buckler of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>. At each corner was a gilded vase. Above the columns were fixed 21 gilded bucklers, offered at the conclusion of the Achaean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> by the Roman general Mummius. The gates in the two fronts were\nOlympia, were of brafs, and over them were carved the labours of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>. Within the cell were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> colonnades, between which was the approach to the image.\n\nThe Jupiter of Olympia was accounted alone sufficient to immortalize its maker, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PHIDIAS\">Phidias</a>. It was of ivory and gold, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> crowned with olive. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> was a statue of Victory; in the left a flowered sceptre, composed of various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, on which was an eagle. The sandals were of gold, as also the vestment, which was curiously embossed with lilies and animals. The throne was gold inlaid with ebony and ivory, and studded with jewels, intermixed with paintings and exquisite figures in relievo. The pillars between the feet contributed to its support. Before it were walls, serving as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FENCE\">fence</a>, decorated principally with the exploits of Hercules; the portion opposite to the door of a blue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. It was the office of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> descended from Phidias, called ph\u0153druntres or the polibiers, to keep the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> bright and clean. The veil or curtain was cloth rich with the purple dye of Phoenicia and with Assyrian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMBROIDERY\">embroidery</a>, an offering of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> Antiochus, and was let down from above by looening the strings. The image impressed on the spectator an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that it was higher and wider than it measured. Its magnitude is such, that though the temple was very large, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a> seemed to have erred in the proportions. The god, fitting, nearly touched the ceiling with his head; suggesting an idea, that if he were to rise up, he would destroy the roof. A part of the pavement before it was of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> marble, enclosed in a rim of Parian or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, where they poured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> to preserve the ivory.\n\nThe altar of Jupiter Olympius was of great antiquity, and composed of ashes from the thighs of the victims, which were carried up and confused in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> with wood of the white poplar tree. The ashes also of the prytaneum, in which a perpetual fire was kept on a hearth, were removed annually on a fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and spread on it, being first mingled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> from the Alpheus. The cement, it was affirmed, could be made with that fluid only; and therefore this river was much respected, and esteemed the most friendly of any to the god. On each side of the altar were stone steps. Its height was 22 feet. Girls and women, when allowed to be at Olympian, were suffered to ascend the bafe- ment, which was 125 feet in circumference. The people of Elis sacrificed daily, and private persons as often as they chose.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">Religion</a> flourished at Olympia, and many deities were worshipped besides Jupiter. Paulanias has enumerated above 60 altars of various shapes and kinds. One of the unknown gods stood by the great altar. The people of Elis offered on all these monthly; laying on them boughs of olive; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> incense, and wheat mixed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>; and pouring libations of such liquors as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITUAL\">ritual</a> prescribed. At the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> sometimes a form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a> was used, and they sung hymns composed in the Doric dialect.\n\nOlympia was situated on an eminence, between two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> called Offa and Olympus. Though its ancient splendour is gone, the place reminds the traveller of what it once was. It is in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOREA\">Morea</a>, being now a small place called Longinico, 50 miles south of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEPANTO\">Lepanto</a>, in E. Long. 22\u00b0 5' N. Lat. 37\u00b0 40'.","sp":139,"ep":141},{"h":"OLYMPIAD","t":"the space of four years, whereby the Greeks reckoned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>.\u2014The first Olympiad fell, according to the accurate and learned computation of some of the moderns, exactly 776 years before the first year of Christ, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 775 before the year of his birth, in the year of the Julian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> 3938, and 22 years before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Rome. The games were exhibited at the time of the full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> next after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> solstice; therefore the Olympiads were of unequal length, because the time of the full moon differs 11 days every year, and for that reason they sometimes began the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> after the solstice, and at other times four weeks after. The computation by Olympiads ceased, at some supposal, after the 304th, in the year 440 of the Christian era. It was universally adopted not only by the Greeks, but by many of the neighbouring countries; though still the Pythian games served as an epoch to the people of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DELPHI\">Delphi</a> and to the Boeotians; the Nemean games to the Argives and Arcadians; and the Isthmian to the Corinthians and the inhabitants of the Peloponnesian isthmus. To the Olympiads <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> is much indebted. They have served to fix the time of many momentous events; and indeed before this method of computing time was observed, every page of history is mostly fabulous, and filled with obscurity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> true chronological account can be properly established and maintained with certainty.","sp":141,"ep":141},{"h":"OLYMPIAS","t":"a celebrated woman, who was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Epirus, and who married <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACEDONIA\">Macedonia</a>, by whom she had Alexander the Great. Her haughtiness, and more probably her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDELITY\">infidelity</a>, obliged Philip to repudiate her, and to marry Cleopatra, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIECE\">niece</a> of King Attalus. Olympias was sensible of this injury, and Alexander showed his disapprobation of his father's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, by retiring from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> to his mother. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> of Philip, which soon followed this disgrace, and which some have attributed to the intrigues of Olympias, was productive of the greatest extravagancies. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> paid the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to her husband's murderer. She gathered his mangled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>, placed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, and laid his ashes near those of Philip. The administration of Alexander, who had succeeded his father, was in some instances offensive to Olympias; but when the ambition of her son was concerned, she did not scruple to declare publicly that Alexander was not the son of Philip, but that he was the offspring of an enormous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENT\">serpent</a> who had supernaturally introduced himself into her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>. When Alexander was dead, Olympias seized the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of Macedonia; and, to establish her usurpation, she cruelly put to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> Arrideus, with his wife Eurydice, as also Nicanor the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASSANDER\">Cassander</a>, with 100 leading men of Macedon, who were inimical to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>.

The conqueror ordered her to be accused, and to be put to death. A body of 200 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> were ordered to put the bloody commands into execution, but the splendour and majesty of the queen disarmed their courage; and she was at last massacred by those whom she had cruelly deprived of their children, about 316 years before the Christian era.","sp":141,"ep":141},{"h":"OLYMPIC GAMES","t":"were solemn games among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Greeks, so called from Olympian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>, to whom they were dedicated; and by some said to be\nfirst instituted by him, after his victory over the sons of Titan; others ascribe their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>, not the son of Alcmena, but one of much greater antiquity; others to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PELOPS\">Pelops</a>; and others to Hercules the son of Alcmena. By whomsoever they were instituted, we know that, at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> rather early, they had fallen into disuse. The wars which prevailed among the Greeks, for a while, totally interrupted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> ceremonies and exhibitions with which they had been accustomed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> gods and heroes; but the Olympic games were restored on the following occasion. Amidst the calamities which afflicted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> threatened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PELOPONNESUS\">Peloponnesus</a>, Iphitus, a descendant of Oxylos, to whom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Eleia had fallen in the general partition of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a>, applied to the Delphic oracle. The priests of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a>, ever disposed to favour the views of kings and legislators, answered agreeably to his wish, that the festivals anciently celebrated at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLYMPIA\">Olympia</a>, on the Alpheus, must be renewed, and an armistice proclaimed for all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> willing to partake of them, and desirous to avert the vengeance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>. Fortified by this authority, and assisted by the advice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LYCURGUS\">Lycurgus</a>, Iphitus took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, not only for restoring the Olympic solemnity, but for rendering it perpetual. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INJUNCTION\">injunction</a> of the oracle was speedily diffused through the remotest parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> by the numerous votaries who frequented the sacred shrine. The armistice was proclaimed in Eleia for exhibiting shows and performing sacrifices. In the heroic ages, feats of bodily strength and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> were destined to the honour of deceased warriors; hymns and sacrifices were offered for the gods; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> texture of Grecian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, easily confounding the expressions of respectful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> and pious veneration, enabled Iphitus to unite both in his new institution.\n\nThe festival, which lasted five days, began and ended with a sacrifice to Olympian Jove. The intermediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> was chiefly filled up by the gymnastic exercises, in which all freemen of Grecian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a> were invited to contend, provided they had been born in lawful wedlock, and had lived untainted by any infamous immoral stain. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the entertainment was made in the gymnasium of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIS\">Elis</a>, a spacious edifice, surrounded by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> range of pillars, with an open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> in the middle. Adjoining were various apartments, containing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a>, and other conveniences for the combatants. The neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> was gradually adorned with porticoes, shady walks and groves, interfering with feats and benches; the whole originally destined to relieve the fatigues and anxiety of the candidates for Olympic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>; and frequented in later times, by sophists and philosophers, who were fond to contemplate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, and communicate knowledge, in those delightful retreats. The order of the athletic exercises, or combats, was established by Lycurgus, and corresponded almost exactly to that described by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>, in the 23rd book of the Iliad, and eighth of the Odyssey. Iphitus, we are told, appointed the other ceremonies and entertainments; settled the regular return of the festival at the end of every fourth year, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>; and gave to the whole solemnity that form and arrangement, which it preserved with little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> above a thousand years; a period exceeding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of the most famous kingdoms and republics of antiquity. Among the benefactors of Olympia, at a much later period, was reckoned Herod, who was afterwards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Judea. Seeing, on his way to Rome, the games neglected or dwindling into insignificance from the poverty of the Eleans, he displayed vast munificence as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a>, and provided an ample revenue for their future support and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>.\n\nThe care and management of the Olympics belonged for the most part to the Eleans; who on that account enjoyed their possessions without molestation, or fear of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> or violence. They appointed a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of judges, who were to take care that those who offered themselves as competitors should perform their preparatory exercises; and these judges, during the solemnity, sat naked, having before them a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of victory, formed of wild olive, which was presented to whomsoever they adjudged it. Those who were conquerors were called Olympionikes, and were loaded with honours by their countrymen. At these games women were not allowed to be present; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> any woman was found, during the solemnity, to have passed the river Alpheus, she was to be thrown headlong from a rock. This, however, was sometimes neglected; for we find not only women present at the celebration, but also some among the combatants, and some rewarded with the crown. The preparations for these festivals were great. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> person was permitted to enter the lists, if he had not regularly exercised himself ten months before the celebration at the public gymnasium of Elis. No unfair dealings were allowed; whoever attempted to bribe his adversary was subjected to a severe fine; and even the father and relations were obliged to swear that they would have recourse to no artifice which might decide the victory in favour of their friends. No criminals, nor such as were connected with impious and guilty persons, were suffered to present themselves as combatants. The wrestlers were appointed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a>. Some little balls <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> were thrown into a silver urn, and such as drew the same letter were obliged to contend one with the other. He who had an odd letter remained the last; and he often had the advantage, as he was to encounter the last who had obtained the superiority over his adversary. In these games were exhibited running, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAPING\">leaping</a>, wrestling, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOXING\">boxing</a>, and the throwing of the quoit, which was called altogether \u03c0\u03c5\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1, or quinquarium. Besides these, there were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> and chariot races, and also contentions in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, eloquence, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FINE_ARTS\">fine arts</a>. The only reward that the conqueror obtained was a crown of olive. This, as some suppose, was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of the labours of Hercules, which were accomplished for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> good of mankind, and for which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> claimed no other reward but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of having been the friend of mankind. So small and trifling a reward stimulated courage and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, and was the source of greater honours than the most unbounded treasures. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a> of the conquerors, called Olympionikes, were erected at Olympia in the sacred wood of Jupiter.\n\nTheir return home was that of a warlike conqueror; they were drawn in a chariot by four horses, and everywhere received with the greatest acclamations. Their entrance into their native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> was not through the gates; to make it more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> and more solemn, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> was made in the walls. Painters and poets were employed in celebrating their names; and indeed the victories\nOlympus, victories severally obtained at Olympia are the subjects of the most beautiful odes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PINDAR\">Pindar</a>. The combatants were naked. A scarf was originally tied round their waist; but when it had entangled one of the adversaries, and been the cause that he lost the victory, it was laid aside, and no regard was paid to decency. The Olympic games were observed every fifth year, or, to speak with greater exactness, after a revolution of four years, and in the first month of the fifth year, and they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for five successive days. As they were the most ancient and most solemn of all the festivals of the Greeks, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not appear wonderful, that they drew so many people, not only inhabitants of Greece, but of the neighbouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> and countries.\n\nSuch is the account of Grecian writers, who have, doubtless, often ascribed to positive institution many inventions and usages naturally resulting from the progressive manners of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>. When we come to examine the Eleusinian games in their more improved state, together with the innumerable imitations of them in other provinces of Greece, there will occur reasons for believing, that many regulations, referred by an easy solution to the legislative wisdom of Iphitus or Lycurgus, were introduced by time or accident, continued through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, improved by repeated trials, and confirmed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of their utility. Yet such an institution as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLYMPIAD\">Olympiad</a>, even in its least perfect form, must have been attended with manifest advantages to society. It is sufficient barely to mention the suspension of hostilities which took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, not only during the celebration of the festival, but a considerable time both before and after it. Considered as a religious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>, at which the whole Grecian name was invited, and even enjoined, to assist, it was well adapted to facilitate intercourse, to promote knowledge, to soften <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>, and to hasten the progress of civilization and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>. Greece, and particularly Peloponnesus, was the centre from which the adventurous spirit of its inhabitants had diffused innumerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> through the surrounding nations. To these widely separated communities, which, notwithstanding their common origin, seemed to have lost all connexion and correspondence, the Olympiad served as a common bond of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> and point of reunion. The celebrity of this festival continually attracted to it the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> most distinguished for genius and enterprise, whose fame would have otherwise been unknown and lost in the boundless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of Grecian territory. The remote inhabitants, not only of European Greece, but of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, being assembled to the worship of common gods, were formed to the sense of a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>, and excited to the pursuit of national honour and prosperity. Strangers of similar dispositions might confirm in Elis the sacred and indissoluble ties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a>. If their communities were endangered by any barbarous power, they might here solicit assistance from their Grecian brethren. On other occasions they might explain the benefits which, in peace or war, their respective countries were best qualified to communicate. And the Olympic festival might thus serve the purpose of resident ambassadors, and other institutions alike unknown to antiquity.","sp":141,"ep":143},{"h":"OLYMPUS","t":"the name of several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>.\u2014One bounding Bithynia on the south.\u2014Another in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Cyprus, on whose top was a temple of Venus, which women were not permitted either to enter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> to\n\nfee (Strabo).\u2014A third, Olympus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALATIA\">Galatia</a> (Livy).\u2014A fourth, of Lycia, with a noble cognominal town, near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> (Strabo, Cicero), extinct in Pliny's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, there remaining only a citadel: the town was destroyed by P.

Few systems of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> are more absurd than Mohammed's; yet, though he disclaimed miracles, it was supported, as we are told by latter writers, by a variety of them, which, however, unfortunately for the creed they were contrived to support, are too trifling, absurd, and contradictory, to deserve the smallest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>.\n\nThey tell us, but upon grounds too vague and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">indeterminate</a> to command <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a>, that Omar was miraculously converted to this faith: a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> he is reported to have been, before this event, truly respectable, and in particular a violent opponent of the Arabian prophet. Mohammed, it seems, felt this opposition, and regretted it; he therefore, with the fervour, and as it happened, with the success of a true prophet, according to his followers' account, prayed for the conversion of this his dangerous antagonist. Omar, it is said, had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> sooner read the 20th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of the Koran than he was convinced: upon which he instantly repaired to Mohammed and his followers, and declared his conversion. It is said, that at one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> he intended to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> the prophet; and various causes are assigned for the prevention of this shocking piece of sacrilege. After his wonderful conversion, the Mohammedan writers inform us that he was named Al Faruk, or the \"divider;\" because, say they, when a certain Moflem was condemned by Mohammed for his iniquitous treatment of a Jew, and appealed afterwards from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> of the prophet to Omar, he cut him in two with his scimitar, for not acquiescing in the decision of so upright a judge: which circumstance when Mohammed heard, he gave him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURNAME\">surname</a> of Al Faruk, or \"the divider;\" because, by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, he had shown himself capable of perfectly distinguishing between truth and falsehood. Al Kodai affirms, that 39 of Omar's adherents followed his example the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> he professed himself a votary of Mohammed.\nThe conversion of Hamza and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OMAR_EBN_AL_KHATTAB\">Omar Ebn Al Khattab</a> happened in the year preceding the first flight of the Moles into Ethiopia, or the fourth year of Mohammed's mission, according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-ABULFEDA\">Abulfeda</a>. He was unquestionably a great acquisition to the prophet, and enabled him to carry on his schemes to far more purpose than he could possibly have done without him, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> his enemy. Omar at length found his services in the cause he had undertaken sufficiently honoured and amply rewarded; for on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Abu Beir, who had succeeded the impostor himself, he was promoted to the regal and pontifical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> first assigned him was the caliph of the caliph of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a> of God; or in other words the successor of the successor of Mohammed: but the Arabs considering that this title, by the addition to be annexed to it at the accession of every future caliph, would be too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, they, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> consent, saluted him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEVERS\">believers</a>; which illustrious title, at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a> conferred on Omar, descended afterwards to all the successors of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>. Our readers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not expect us to follow the caliph with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> exactness through the transactions of his reign. This would indeed swell our article beyond all proportion. We shall therefore confine ourselves to some of the leading facts.\n\nHis arms appear to have been particularly successful; the Persians he conquered, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a> submitted to his power; nor does he appear to have been checked in a single instance. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, however, of his success, an attempt was made to assassinate him. The fact is thus related: Wathak Ebn Mofafer, a resolute young Arab, was procured by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Ghafsan, and sent to Medina for this very purpose. Some time after his arrival, observing Omar to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> asleep under a tree on which he had placed himself, so as not to be discovered by any person, he drew his dagger, and was upon the point of stabbing him, when, lifting up his eyes, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> a lion walking round about him, and licking his feet. Nor did the lion cease to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> the caliph till he awoke; but then instantly went away. This phenomenon struck Wathak with a profound reverence for Omar, whom he now revered as the peculiar care of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>. He therefore came <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> from the tree, on which the lion had forced him to remain, kissed the caliph's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, confessed his crime, and embraced the Mohammedan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>; being so strongly affected with the wonderful deliverance he had been an eye witness of. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, however, was at length ended by assassination; for about two years after the conclusion of the Nohawandian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, in which the Arabs probably still farther extended their conquests, though no account of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> operations during that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> has reached us, that is, in the 23rd year of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEGIRA\">Hegira</a>, according to Abu Jaafar Al Tabari, the caliph Omar Ebn Al Khattab was assassinated by a Persian slave; of which horrid fact the Arab writers have handed down the following particulars: Abu Luluah, a Persian of the Magian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>, whose name was Firuz, one of Al Mogheira Ebn Al Shabab's slaves, was obliged by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> to pay daily two dirhems, in conformity to the Mohammedan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, for the free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of this religion. Firuz resenting this treatment, complained of it to the caliph, and desired that some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> at least of the tribute exacted of him might be remitted; but this favour being refused by Omar, the Persian threatened his destruction; which he soon after effected, by stabbing him thrice in the belly with a dagger, while he was in the mosque at Medina performing his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> devotions. The Arabs then present perceiving that the villain had imbrued his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> in the blood of their sovereign, immediately rushed upon him; but he made so desperate a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, that he wounded 13 of the assailants, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> of them mortally. At last one of the caliph's attendants threw his vest over him, and seized him; upon which he stabbed himself and soon after expired.\n\nAccording to Theophanes, this Firuz was an apostate or renegade, and consequently had before embraced the Mohammedan religion; but this assertion is by no means probable; because on his becoming a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> to Islamism, he must have been unmindful of his master, and on his relapsing into Magism, he would have been put to death by the caliph's order: neither of which particulars are consistent with what we find related by the Arab historians, and even by our Greek chronicographer himself. Omar languished three days and then died, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of Dhul'Hajja, and the 23rd year of the Hegira, which began in the year of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> 643. Authors are not agreed with regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of his caliphate. The Arab historians, whom we are inclined to follow, say that he reigned between 10 and 11 years. Theophanes affirms, that he was murdered in the 12th year of his caliphate, and Dionysius Telmarchus extends the length of his reign to 12 complete years. Only one of the wounds given him by Firuz was mortal, and that he received under his navel. At his death he was 63 years old; which, as we are told by an Arab author, was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of Mohammed himself, Abu Beir, and Ayesha, one of the prophet's wives, when they died. When Omar fell in the mosque, Abd'alrahman Ebn Awf, one of Mohammed's first converts, supplied his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> during the remainder of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>; and three days before his death, Sahib Ebn Tarif, at his command, officiated for him. His body was interred in Ayesha's apartment, near that of the prophet Mohammed. We are informed by Eutychius, that during his caliphate he performed the pilgrimage to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECCA\">Mecca</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> times. His extensive conquests made the Moles empire one of the most powerful and formidable monarchies in the world. His disposition is represented to us, with evident partiality indeed, as one of the best possible, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a> has always been highly extolled.","sp":143,"ep":144},{"h":"OMB","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, afterwards called Arsinoe and Crocodilopolis, was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of one of the nomes into which that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> was divided, and is remarkable, in the annals of idolatry, for the hatred of its inhabitants to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> of their neighbours the citizens of Tentyra.\n\nThe genius of paganism was so complying with respect to the objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> worship, that although each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, each city, and almost every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, had its own tutela\u2014god, we know not a single instance, out of Egypt, of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of Pagans persecuting another for worshipping gods different from theirs. The Jews and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> were indeed persecuted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, not however for worshipping the true God, but because, together with him, they would not worship <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>, Juno, and all the rabble of heathen divinities.\n\nThe reason of the almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> tolerance of ideologues to one another, and of the intolerance of all to\nthe Jews and Christians, is very obvious. Not a single Pagan, a very few philosophers perhaps excepted, ever thought of paying his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a> to the Supreme and self-existent Being, but to inferior divinities, to whom it was supposed that the care of particular persons, families, cities, and nations was configned by the God of the universe. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> was, that, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> person denied the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> of his neighbour's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of worship, an intercommunity of gods was everywhere admitted, and all joined occasionally in adoring the gods of the various nations. By the Jews and Christians this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a> was rejected as in the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> impious; and it could not well be maintained between the citizens of Ombi and those of Tentyra.\n\nThat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a> were worshipped in Egypt is universally known (See Polytheism); and Diodorus the Sicilian informs us, in a passage quoted by Eul\u00e6us*, that \"the cities and nomes of Egypt being at one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> prone to rebellion, and to enter into conspiracies against monarchical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, one of their most politic kings contrived to introduce into the neighbouring nomes the worship of different animals; so that while each reverenced the deity which itself held sacred, and despised that which its neighbours had consecrated, they could hardly be brought to join cordially in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> to the disturbance of the government.\"\n\nIn this distribution of gods he conferred upon Ombi the crocodile, and upon Tentyra, the mortal enemy of that monster, the ichneumon. The consequence of which was, that while the Ombites worshipped the crocodile, the Tentyrites took every opportunity of slaughtering him, insomuch that, according to Strabo, the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of an inhabitant of Tentyra put the crocodile to flight. This, we confess, is a very improbable fact; but it is certain that the mutual hatred of those cities, on account of their hostile gods, rose to such a height, that whenever the inhabitants of the one were engaged in the more solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> of their religion, those of the other were sure to embrace the opportunity of setting fire to their houses, and rendering them every injury in their power to inflict. And what may, to a superficial thinker, appear extraordinary, though it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> excite no wonder in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> of him who has studied mankind, this animosity <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> between the inhabitants of the two cities <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> after the crocodile and ichneumon had lost their divinity.\n\nThe conduct of the Egyptian monarch was admirably calculated for preventing the nation from combining against the government; and it extended its influence over the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. Diodorus informs us, that he assigned to each nome an animal to worship, which was hated, killed, and sometimes fed upon by the inhabitants of the neighbouring nome; and we know upon higher authority than his, that the Israelites could not offer sacrifices in Egypt, because the bullock was deemed sacred over the whole country.","sp":144,"ep":145},{"h":"OMBRE","t":"a celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAME\">game</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDS\">cards</a>, borrowed from the Spaniards, and played by two, by three, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> by five persons, but generally by three.

The three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> cards are called *matadores*; which have this privilege, that they are not obliged to attend an inferior trump when it leads; but for want of a small trump, the person may renounce trumps, and play any other card; and when these are all in the same hand, the others pay three of the greater counters a-piece; and with these three for a foundation, he may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> as many matadores as he has cards in an uninterrupted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of trumps; for all which the others are to pay one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTER\">counter</a> a-piece. He who hath the first hand is called *ombre*, and has his choice of playing the game, of naming the trump, and of taking in as many and as few cards as he pleases; and after him the second, &c. But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he does not name the trump before he looks on the cards he has taken in, any other may prevent him, by naming what trump he pleases. He that has the first hand should neither take in, nor play, unless he has at least three sure tricks in his hand; for, as he wins the game who wins most tricks, he that can win five of the nine has a sure game: which is also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> if he wins four, and can so divide the tricks as that one person may win two, and the other three.\n\nIf a person plays without discarding or changing any cards, this is called *playing sans prendre*; and if another win more tricks than he, he is said to *win codille*. The over-fights in the course of the game are called *beats*. And if the ombre wins all the nine tricks, it is called *winning the vote*.\n\nIn ombre by five, which many, on account of its not requiring to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, prefer to that by three, only eight cards a-piece are dealt; and five tricks must be won, otherwise the ombre is beatified. Here the person who undertakes the game, after naming the trump, calls a king to his assistance; upon which the person in whose hand the king is, without discovering himself, is to assist him as a partner, and to share his fate. If, between both, they can make five tricks, the ombre wins two counters, and the auxiliary king only one; but when the counters are even, they divide them equally. If the ombre venture the game without calling in any king, this too is called *playing sans prendre*; in which case the other four are all against him, and he must win five tricks alone, or be beatified. The rest is much the same as by three.\n\n**OMBRE de soleil**, \"Shadow of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>,\" in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HERALDRY\">Heraldry</a>, is when the sun is borne in armor, so as that the eyes,\neyes, nose, and mouth, which at other times are represented, do not appear; and the colouring is thin, so that the field can appear through it.","sp":145,"ep":146},{"h":"OMBRIA","t":"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> name of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, in the territory of the pope, now called Spoleto and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERUGIA\">Perugia</a>.","sp":146,"ep":146},{"h":"OMBRO","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> LOMBRO, a town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUCHY\">duchy</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUSCANY\">Tuscany</a>, and territory of the Sienoises, situated near the Tuscan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, a little south of the lake of Caffignione, 45 miles south-west of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIENNA\">Sienna</a>.","sp":146,"ep":146},{"h":"OMBROMETER","t":"an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> that falls.

Hence Tully says, \"Pythagorei non solum voces deorum observantur,\" sed etiam hominum, quae vocent omnia,\" \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGOREANS\">Pythagoreans</a> attend to the discourse not only of gods, but also of men, which they call omens.\" This sort of omen was supposed to depend much upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> of the person concerned in the event; whence the phrases accept omen, arripiat omen. Such were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> omens; but they were afterwards derived from things as well as from words. Thus Paternus, speaking of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of Sulpicius on the rostrum, says it was velut omen imminentis proscriptio, \"the omen of an impending proscription.\" Suetonius says of Augustus, that he believed implicitly in certain omens; and that, si mane fisci calcus perpetram, ac sinistris pro dextero induceretur, ut dirum, \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> his shoes were improperly put on in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, especially if the left <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOE\">shoe</a> was put upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> foot, he held it for a bad omen.\" Omen was used in a still larger sense, to signify an augury; as in the following line of Tully: \"Sic aquilae clarum fix-\n\nmavit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> omen?\" \"thus Jove confirmed the bright omen of the eagle?\" It was lastly used, in the most generic sense of all, for a portent or prodigy; as in the third book of the Aeneid, where a myrtle torn up by \u00c6neas dropped blood. Upon this appearance, says the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a>,\n\nMihi frigidus horror\nMembra quatit, gelidique coit formidine sanguis.\nAnd the same thing being repeated upon his breaking a branch from another tree, he prayed to the gods to avert the omen.\n\nMulta movens animo Nymphas venerabat agrestes,\nGradivumque patrem, Getici qui praedit feris,\nIste fecundantem vitum, omneque levaret (A).\n\nThe portentous or supernatural omens were either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> or internal. Of the former sort were those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> of blood so frequently occurring in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMAN_HISTORY\">Roman <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, which were much of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> with this adventure of \u00c6neas, which he calls monstra deum. Of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> sort were those sudden confusions, which, seizing upon men without any visible cause, were imputed to the agency of the god <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAN\">Pan</a>, and hence called panic fears. But indeed there was hardly anything, however trivial, from which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> did not draw omens. That it should have been thought a direful omen when any thing befell the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>, altars, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a> of the gods, need excite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> wonder; but that the meeting of a eunuch, a negro, a bitch with whelps, or a snake lying in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, should have been looked upon as portending bad fortune, is a deplorable influence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> weakness, and of the pernicious influence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> on the mind.\n\nIt is more than probable that this practice of making ordinary events ominous of good or bad fortune took its rise in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> of almost every superstition of paganism; but wherever it may have arisen, it spread itself over the whole inhabited globe, and at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> prevails in a greater or less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> among the vulgar of all nations.\n\nIn England, it is reckoned a good omen, or a sign of future <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> shines on a couple coming out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> after having been married. It is also esteemed a good sign if it rains whilst a corpse is burying:\n\nHappy is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDE\">bride</a> that the sun shines on;\nHappy is the corpse that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> rains on.\n\nTo\n\n(A) Instead of translating these short quotations, we shall here give Dryden's version of the whole of this English reader, who alone can wish for a translation, together with its effects on the mind of the hero. It is as follows:\n\nNot far, a rising hillock stood in view;\nSharp myrtles on the sides and corners grew.\nThere, while I went to crop the Sylvan scenes,\nAnd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> our altar with their leafy greens,\nI pull'd a plant (with horror I relate)\nA prodigy so strange, and full of fate:\nThe rooted fibres rose; and from the wound\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> bloody drops distill'd upon the ground.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MUTE\">Mute</a> and amaz'd, my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> with terror <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>;\n\nFear shrunk my finews, and congeal'd my blood.\nMann'd once again, another plant I try;\nThat other gush'd with the same fanguine dye.\nThen, fearing guilt for some offence unknown,\nWith prayers and vows the Dryads I atone,\nWith all the fetters of the woods, and most\nThe god of arms, who rules the Thracian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>:\nThat they, or he, these omens would avert,\nRelease our fears, and better signs impart.\nTo <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> glass is extremely unlucky; the party to whom it belongs will lose his best friend.\n\nIf, going a journey on business, a sow crosses the road, you will probably meet with a disappointment, if not a bodily accident, before you return home. To avert this, you must endeavour to prevent her crossing you; and if that cannot be done, you must ride round on fresh ground. If the sow is attended with her litter of pigs, it is lucky, and denotes a successful journey.\n\nIt is unlucky to see first one magpie, and then more; but to see two, denotes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> or merriment; three, a successful journey; four an unexpected piece of good news; five, you will shortly be in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>. To kill a magpie, will certainly be punished with some terrible misfortune.\n\nIf, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, the youngest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> should be married before her elder <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SISTERS\">sisters</a>, they must all dance at her wedding without shoes: this will counteract their ill luck, and procure them husbands.\n\nIf you meet a funeral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESSION\">procession</a>, or one passes by you, always take off your hat: this keeps all evil spirits attending the body in good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>.\n\nIf, in eating, you miss your mouth, and the viands <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, it is very unlucky, and denotes approaching sickness.\n\nIt is lucky to put on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOCKING\">stocking</a> the wrong side outwards: changing it alters the luck.\n\nWhen a person goes out to transact any important business, it is lucky to throw an old shoe after him.\n\nIt is unlucky to present a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, scissors, razor, or any sharp or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, to one's mistress or friend, as they are apt to cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> and friendship. To avoid the ill effects of this, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a>, a farthing, or some trifling recompense, must be taken. To find a knife or razor, denotes ill luck and disappointment to the party.\n\nIn the Highlands of Scotland, it is thought unlucky if a person setting out upon a journey stumble over the threshold, or be obliged to return for anything forgotten. If a sportsman see any person stepping over his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUN\">gun</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> rod, he expects but little success in that day's diversion. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SNEEZING\">Sneezing</a> is also deemed ominous. If one sneeze when making a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, a little of the straw or heath is taken out and thrown into the fire, that nothing may disturb the rest of the person who is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> in the bed. Among the same people, success in any enterprise is believed to depend greatly upon the first creature that presents itself after the enterprise is undertaken. Thus, upon going to slumber, it is reckoned lucky to meet a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, but very unfortunate to see a hare, if the escape; and upon meeting any creature deemed unlucky, the best means of averting the omen is to roll a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> towards it. The Greeks attributed the same efficacy to the rolling of a stone, though they greatly preferred killing the ominous animal, that the evil portended might fall on its own head*.\n\nThe motions and appearances of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a> were not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> ago considered as certain signs by which the skilful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGHLANDER\">Highlander</a> might attain to the knowledge of futurity. On the evening before new year's day, if a black cloud appeared in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the horizon, it was thought to prognosticate a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>, a famine, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of some great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> in that part of the country over which it should appear to set; and in order to ascertain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> threatened by the omen, the motions of this cloud were often watched through the whole night, if it happened to continue so long visible above the horizon.\n\nBy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEVERS\">believers</a> in this superstition there are days, as well as words and events, which are deemed ominous of good or bad fortune. The first day of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, midsummer, and new year's day, are reckoned the most fortunate days in the year for accomplishing any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULL\">Mull</a>, ploughing, sowing, and reaping, are always begun on Tuesday, though the most favourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> for these purposes be in this way frequently lost. That day of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> on which the third of May falls, is deemed unlucky throughout the whole year. In Morven, none will upon any account dig <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEAT\">peat</a> or turf for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> on Friday; and it is reckoned unlucky to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> the people or cattle belonging to any family, and doubly so if the number be taken on Friday. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> is also much attended to by the vulgar Highlanders. It is alleged, that during the increase things have a tendency to grow and stick together: and hence, in the isle of Sky, fences, which are there made of turf, are built only at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>; whilst turf or peat for fuel are never, even in the most favourable weather, either made or stacked up but while the moon is in its wane. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> prevails in some places, that if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> take fire during the increase of the moon, the family to which it belongs will prosper in the world; but that if the fire happen while the moon is in the decrease, the family will from that time decline in its circumstances, and sink into poverty.\n\nIn attributing such influence to the moon, the superstitious Highlanders have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to agree with the philosophic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a>, who in his Georgics gives the following sage instructions to the husbandman:\n\nIpsa dies alios alio dedit ordine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUNA\">Luna</a>\nFelices, operum.

It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of the utmost importance to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, as the regal ships to and from Guatemala are sent to it in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>. The town was first established in 1751, under the command of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DON\">Don</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> Antonio de Palma. At that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> the inhabitants were about 20 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> men, 60 mulattoes and free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a>, and 200 slaves to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Spain; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> force consisted of about 30 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, besides officers. The fort was originally composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> confined in boarded coffers, and faced with half-burnt bricks. It was defended by 12 fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> 24 pounders mounted, four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> guns of different bores, and some field-pieces. The Spaniards sensible of the importance of the place, afterwards fortified it at an incredible expense, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> of which the walls are built having been raised from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and brought from the distance of 20 leagues. The outworks were not completely finished in the year 1779, though 1000 men had then been employed upon them for 20 years.\n\nTowards the end of that year an expedition was undertaken against this fortress, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of one formed by the Spaniards against the British logwood cutters in the bay of Honduras and on the Moquito shore. The latter, finding themselves hard pressed by their enemies, applied to General Duilling, governor of Jamaica for assistance; who accordingly sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> to their relief under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Dalrymple, with necessary supplies of arms, ammunition, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>. Before their arrival, however, the Spaniards had taken possession of St George's Key, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> settlement of the British in these parts, which they plundered, and took a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of prisoners; but those who escaped, being joined by a body of their countrymen, retook it, and forced the enemy to retire. In the meantime Captain Dalrymple, who had been informed of the loss of the place, was hastening to the relief of the inhabitants, and in his way fell in with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMIRAL\">Admiral</a> Parker, who was in quest of some regal ships; but which, retreating into the harbour of Omoa, were too strongly protected by the fort there to be attacked by sea. As the Spaniards, however, had now been compelled to abandon St George's Key, it was proposed to unite the British forces by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> and sea, and to attempt the conquest of this fortress. As the force under Captain Dalrymple was too inconsiderable to attempt the fort by land, it was augmented by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINES\">marines</a> of the squadron and a strong party of the settlers; though, after all, it did not exceed the number of the garrison who opposed them.\n\nThe troops were landed at about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> miles distance from the fort in the dusk of the evening, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> directly forward, in order to surprise and carry it by escalade in the night time. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>, however, being found, they were obliged to explore their way through narrow foot-paths, morasses, and over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> so steep with precipices, that they were obliged, in order to avoid them, to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of lights made of the cabbage tree. In consequence of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-IMPEDIMENTS\">impediments</a> they were yet at a considerable distance from the fort, when the approach of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> discovered them to the enemy. An engagement ensued, in which the Spaniards were quickly routed and driven into the town: from whence as they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to fire upon the British, it was found necessary to set fire to it, though very much against the inclination of the assailants.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time the squadron took the opportunity, while the town was in flames, to come into the bay, and approach the fort with an intention to batter it; but the garrison returned the fire so briskly, that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> could be made by that of the squadron, which was detained by want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> from approaching sufficiently near. The troops then, being masters of the ground adjacent to the fort, erected several batteries in such situations as were most proper for annoying it; but though they carried on their operations with great vigour, it was still found that heavier artillery than any they possessed would be requisite, the walls being no less than 18 feet in thickness; in consequence of which they resolved still to attempt the place by escalade.\n\nThe attempt was made on the 21st of October, early in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>. The troops entered the ditch, which fortunately for them happened to be dry, and fixed their scaling ladders against the walls, which were near 30 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>. Two seamen mounted first; and, with admirable courage and presence of mind, stood by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADDER\">ladder</a> which they had mounted, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> it till others ascended;\ned; and boldly presented their pieces against a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> party drawn up to receive them, though they prudently retained their fire till their comrades came up.\n\nThe squadron, now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> near, kept up a heavy and continual fire upon the fort, while the Spaniards were struck with such surprize at the execellive celerity and boldness of the assailants, that they remained motionless and unable to oppose their enemies, notwithstanding the exhortation and example of their officers. From this panic they never recovered; and while the seamen and soldiers continued to scale the walls with amazing quickness, the Spaniards never made any effort to defend themselves. About 100 of them escaped over the walls on the opposite side of the fort; the remainder surrendered at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a>.\n\nThe whole of this transaction reflected the highest lustre both on the conduct and courage of the British; and an instance of heroism is related in a British sailor to which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> affords nothing superior. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, having scaled the walls, had armed himself with a cutlass in each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. Thus armed, he met with a Spanish officer unarmed, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> roused from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>. The generous tar scorned to take advantage of his condition, and therefore presented him with one of his own cutlasses saying, \"You are now on a footing with me!\" The officer, however, was too much struck with admiration at his conduct to accept the offer, and took care to make the circumstance sufficiently known.\n\nThe value of the booty taken on this occasion amounted to three millions of dollars; but the loss most sensibly felt by the Spaniards was that of 250 quintals of quicksilver, a commodity indispensably necessary in extracting the precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> from their ores. They offered therefore to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RANSOM\">ransom</a> it at any price; but though the retention of it was far from affording a profit equal to that offered by the Spaniards, the British commanders absolutely refused to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> with it, on account of the advantages the enemy would derive from having the metal in their possession. For the same reason they refused to accept of any ransom for the fort, though the governor offered to lay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> 300,000 dollars for it. The Spanish military and the inhabitants were treated with the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>; their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> effects remaining untouched; and this generosity must have appeared to greater advantage, when contrasted with the behaviour of their own countrymen at Honduras, where the British were treated with remarkable severity. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> plate and ornaments were restored, on condition that the terms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a> should be faithfully kept.\n\nIn a short time, however, it appeared that it would have been better to have accepted of a ransom for the fort, as from circumstances at that time it could not be retained in the possession of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. A garrison was indeed left for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> on the departure of the British squadron; but as it was very inconsiderable, on account of the small number of men that could be spared, the Spaniards quickly determined to make an attempt to regain the fort. For this purpose a body of 2000 men were collected, who invested it on the 25th of November. The British defended it with the utmost bravery; keeping up a constant fire on the enemy, and obliging them to retire for shelter, and take up their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> behind a hill. Here they made preparations for an assault, in which their numbers left the success, as they supposed, by no means dubious.\n\nThe garrison was therefore summoned to surrender, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> of the honours of war and a safe conveyance to Great Britain, denouncing at the same time the utmost vengeance in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of a refusal; which being refused, the necessary preparations were made for an escalade.\n\nThe condition of the garrison was now such as could afford very little hope of being able to make any effectual resistance. They were but 85 in number, most of whom were become incapable of duty either from illness or excessive fatigue. They were now also obliged to make one sentinel answer for five, by shifting his place, and challenging as many times. There was no surgeon to attend the sick and wounded; nor had they even any water but what came from a floop of war that lay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABREAST\">abreast</a> of the fort. In this desperate situation, they resolved, notwithstanding the menaces of the Spanish commander to render the place as unserviceable as they could. For this purpose they spiked up all the guns; destroying the stores and ammunition that could not be carried off; they even locked the gates of the fort, after which they embarked without the loss of a single man. All this was performed in defiance of the large force that besieged them; and the exploit, when duly considered, must appear not less a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of astonishment than the extraordinary manner in which the fort had been taken.

Omphale had been informed of the great exploits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>, and wished to see so illustrious a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a>. Her wish was soon gratified. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> of Eurytus, Hercules fell sick, and was ordered to be held as a slave, that he might recover his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of his senses. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a> was commissioned to sell him, and Omphale bought him, and restored him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>. The hero became enamoured of his mistress, and the queen favoured his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, and had a son by him, whom some call Agelaus, and others Lamon. From this son were descended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GYGES\">Gyges</a> and Croesus; but this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> is different from the account which makes these Lydian monarchs.\nmonarchs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> from Alcaeus, a son of Hercules, by one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> servants of Omphale. Hercules is represented by the poets as so desperately enamoured of the queen, that, to conciliate her esteem, he spins by her side among her women, while she covers herself with the lion's skin, and arms herself with the club of the hero, and often strikes him with her sandals, for the uncouth manner with which he holds the distaff, &c. Their fondness was mutual. As they once travelled together, they came to a grotto on Mount Timolus, where the queen drest herself in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of her lover, and obliged him to appear in a female garment. After they had supped, they both retired to rest in different rooms, as a sacrifice on the morrow to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACCHUS\">Bacchus</a> required.

(See Heliopolis.) It was remarkable for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> and learning of its priesthood, and for the spacious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> in which they cultivated the studies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>. The priests of On were esteemed more noble than all the other priests of Egypt. They were always privy counsellors and ministers of state; and therefore, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARAOH\">Pharaoh</a> resolved to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> prime minister, he very wisely gave him in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> of On, thereby incorporating him into the most venerable caste in Egypt. Bishop Warburton thinks that the superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> of the priests of On was chiefly owing to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> antiquity and great learning. That they were much given to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of astronomy, we know from the testimony of Strabo; and indeed nothing is more probable than that they should be attached to the study of that system over which their god, the Sun, presided, not only in his exalted, but also in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> capacity. The learned prelate affirms, that \"whether they received the doctrine from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> invented it at hazard (which last supposition he thinks more probable, though we are of a very different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>), it is certain they taught that the Sun is in the centre of its system, and that all the other bodies move round it in perpetual revolutions. This noble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> (he continues) came with the rest of the Egyptian learning into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> (being brought thither by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a>, who received it from Oenuphis*; a* Plut.de priest of On); and after having given the most illustrious of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>, it sunk into obscurity, and P. 632. suffered a total eclipse throughout a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> succession of learned and unlearned ages; till these times restored its ancient splendour, and immovably fixed it on the unerring principles of science.\"\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> it be true, as some philosophers allege, that Moses appears from the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENESIS\">Genesis</a> to have been acquainted with the true solar system, this account of the origin of that system is extremely probable.

But there can be no doubt of his knowing as much of that science as the priests of On; for we know that he was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; and therefore, if he held the sun to be in the centre of the system, it is morally certain that the same thing was held by that priesthood.","sp":150,"ep":150},{"h":"ONALASHKA","t":"one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> of the Northern Archipelago, visited by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Cook in his last voyage.

He begins with observing, that, by the continual waste of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> body, aliment are required for our support. These aliment, however, require certain preparations in the body itself; and when by any means we become altered that these preparations cannot be effected, the best aliment then prove insufficient for the support of the body. Of all the causes by which this morbid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> is brought on, none is more common than too copious evacuations; and of all evacuations, that of the semen is the most pernicious when carried to excess. It is also to be observed, that though excess in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> venery is productive of very dangerous disorders, yet an equal evacuation by self-pollution, which is an unnatural way, is productive of others still more to be dreaded. The consequences enumerated by Dr Tissot are as follow:\n\n1.

The strength entirely fails, and the growth in young persons is considerably checked. Some are afflicted with almost continual watching, and others dole almost perpetually. Almost all of them become hypochondriac or hysterical, and are afflicted with all the evils which attend these disorders. Some have been known to spit calcareous matters; and others are afflicted with coughs, slow fevers, and consumptions.\n\n3.

There are not only to be seen pimples on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, which are one of the most common symptoms; but even blotches, or suppurative pustules, appear on the face, nose, breast, and thighs; and sometimes fleshy excrescences arise on the forehead.\n\n5. The organs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> are also affected; and the semen is evacuated on the slightest irritation, even that of going to stool.

The functions of the intestines are sometimes totally destroyed; and some patients complain of coliciveness, others of diarrhoea, piles, and the running of a fetid matter from the fundament.\n\nWith regard to the cure, the first step is to leave off those practices which have occasioned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>; which our author affirms is no easy matter; as, according to him, the foul itself becomes polluted, and can dwell on no other idea; or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he does, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a> of the parts of generation themselves quickly recall ideas of the same kind. This irritability is no doubt much more to be dreaded than any pollution the foul can have received; and by removing it, there <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be no occasion for exhortations to discontinue the practice. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> means for diminishing this irritability are, in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, to avoid all stimulating, acrid, and spiced meats. A low diet, however, is improper, because it would further reduce the body, already too much emaciated.

These three doctors flourished 12 years before Christ, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">chronology</a> of Gauz; who adds, that Onkelos was contemporary with Gamaliel the elder, St Paul's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, who was the grandson of Hillel, who lived 28 years after Christ, and did not die till 18 years before the destruction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>.

The Talmudists tell us that he assisted at the funeral of Gamaliel, and was at a prodigious expense to make it most magnificent.

The latter constitute an order in the class of amphibious animals. They are covered with scales, breathe by means of lungs, and are destitute of feet and fins.\n\nThe hideous aspect of some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, and the poisonous properties of others, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> contributed to prevent any deliberate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of their structure, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, and modes of existence. Hence, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, who at best had very imperfect notions of classification, sometimes indicate different species under the same name, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> bestow different appellations on the same species, and moreover blend their vague descriptions with the embellishments or absurdities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a>.\n\nAmong the moderns, few naturalists have directed their researches to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of serpents. \"It must be acknowledged,\" observes Dr Rusell, \"that it offers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> attractive allurements; and that those who from other avocations, can only spare transient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to subjects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> history, are more likely to prefer objects less disgusting, and experiments accompanied with less cruelty and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> danger. Even the eager and resolute naturalist has to contend with many difficulties in this path of research. He cannot, at once, divest himself of the abhorrence, next to innate, of these reptiles; nor can he soon acquire a dexterity in handling them, with that calmness requisite for his own safety. The search for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, for birds, or even insects, is comparatively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASTIME\">pastime</a>, or pleasurable occupation; but in the actual pursuit of the disgusting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of serpents, he stands in need of assistants, who are not at all times to be procured; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he rely solely on the diligence of such as he may employ, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> find himself exposed to the chagrin of incessant disappointment.\"\n\nSeba has indeed presented us with a numerous catalogue; but his species are too multiplied, and his descriptions too concise. Cateby was more solicitous to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> his serpents, than to unfold their discriminating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>. The descriptions of Gronovius are, for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> well and accurately detailed; but they are unprovided with the specific names.\n\nLinnaeus, availing himself of the works to which we Linnaeus have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> alluded, of the discoveries of Garden, and of his own disinterment, published his method of distinguishing the species by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of scaly plates on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a>, and beneath the tail. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">Experience</a> has indeed proved, that these do not always constitute an infallible criterion, and that more obvious marks, such as the relative size of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, the length of the body and tail, &c., must sometimes be referred to: it must, however, be allowed, that the celebrated Swedish naturalist paved the way to a far more accurate nomenclature of serpents than had yet appeared, and that the value of his scientific distinctions is greatly enhanced by the interesting notices on the same subject which are inserted in his Amanuensis Academicus, and in the first and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> volumes of his Adolphian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">Museum</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> de la C\u00e9p\u00e9de has in some respects improved La C\u00e9p\u00e9de's Linnaean arrangement, and exhibited a more complete catalogue than any of his predecessors. Dr Shaw Shaw has likewise displayed his usual sagacity in the second part of the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of his General Zoology, which is allotted to his exposition of the serpent tribes. To these we may add, Owen on the natural history of Owen, serpents, Klein's Tentamen Herpetologiae, Blumenbach's Klein, &c., Beytr\u00e4ge zur Naturgeschichte der Schlangen, Schneider's Allgemeine Betrachtungen \u00fcber die Eintheilung und Kennzeichen der Schlangen, Merian's Beytr\u00e4ge zur Geschichte der Amphibien, Laurenti's Specimen Medicum, continens Synopsis Reptilium, Bonaterrae Ophiologie, in the Encyclop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique, Latreille's Histoire Naturelle des Reptiles, Ruffell's Account of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> Serpents, &c., &c.\n\nAnatomy and Physiology of Serpents.\n\nThe body of serpents is very long when compared Body, with its thickness; and is sometimes quite cylindrical, or rounded, sometimes compressed on the sides, sometimes flat on the under surface, and sometimes attenuated towards the tail. It is usually covered with scales; but sometimes naked, either rough, or slippery to the touch,\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> is that part of the body which reaches from the nape to the vent. It is fleshy, annulated, tuberculated, or wrinkled; and comprehends the back, sides, belly, anus, organs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>, and scales. The back is the upper part of the trunk, commencing at the nape and terminating immediately above the vent. In most species it is rounded, but in some carinated or furrowed. The sides are the lateral portions of the trunk, from the extremity of the jaws to the vent. The belly, or abdomen, is the lower part of the body, from the head to the tail, the want of a diaphragm precluding a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>. The anus is an opening, usually transverse, placed at the extremity of the lower surface of the trunk, forming the line of demarcation between the latter and the tail, and affording a passage to the liquid and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> excrements. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENIS\">penis</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a>, and the ovary of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a>, are also situated in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> vent, from which they are extended only during the season of pairing. The scales, properly so called, are round, oval, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a>, and attenuated at the extremities, rhomboidal, smooth, or carinated. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> undivided plates on the belly and head, are termed scutes, and the smaller or divided plates beneath the tail, are called squamae subcaudales or scutella, subcaudal scales or platelets.\n\nThe tail is attenuated, obtuse, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, in the form of a triangular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a>, flattened or compressed at the sides.\n\nAs serpents have neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a> nor breast, the structure of their skeleton is much less complex than that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> of the head are from eight to ten. The skull, which is sometimes flat and sometimes convex, is very hard and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a>, and exhibits four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> sutures, which are with difficulty separated. The bones of the trunk consist of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of vertebrae, incased in one another, and articulated with the ribs. The caudal vertebrae are disposed in the same manner, and provided with similar processes; but they are unconnected with ribs, and gradually diminish in size as they approach to the end of the tail. In most quadrupeds, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> in the back-bone seldom exceed thirty or forty; whereas in serpents they often amount to 145, from the head to the vent, and 25 more from that to the tail. The number of these joints must give the back-bone a surprising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of pliancy, which is still increased by the manner in which one is locked into the other. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> and quadrupeds, the flat surfaces of the bones are laid one against the other, and bound tight by sinews; but in serpents the bones play one within the other, like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> and socket, so that they have free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>.\n\nThe remarkable strength and agility, manifested by serpents, depend on the vigorous muscles with which they are provided. Several of these are inserted along and beneath the skull, and about the upper and lower jaws. Four, which are denominated lateral, have their origin behind the head, and descend, by each side, to the extremity of the tail. Each vertebra has also its corresponding intercostal muscle, which serves the same purpose as in other animals.\n\nThe internal organs, or viscera of individuals of this order of animals, nearly correspond to those of others, and, consequently, need not long detain us.\n\nThe brain is divided into five small portions, which are round, and somewhat elongated. The two first are placed...\nplaced between the eyes, and give origin to the olfactory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a>; other two are situated in the middle region of the skull; and the last, which is a little farther back, appears to be the commencement of the spinal marrow. The tracheal artery, composed of distinct and cartilaginous rings, has its origin at the top of the gullet, and communicates with the lungs, under the heart. The lungs are not lobed, but consist of a cellular and membranous substance, abundantly furnished with blood vessels. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OESOPHAGUS\">oesophagus</a> is formed of a single membrane, extends to the orifice of the stomach, is of an equal diameter throughout, and susceptible of an extraordinary degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a>. The stomach, which is of a larger capacity, is formed of two concentric tunics, which closely adhere, and which are internally covered with folds or wrinkles. The heart has two ventricles, and is small in proportion to the size of the body. As the circulation of the blood is independent of the lungs, the animal is enabled to remain for a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. It cannot, however, make this element its constant residence; because occasional supplies of fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> are necessary to preserve in its blood those qualities which are necessary to motion and vitality. In serpents, therefore, as well as in viviparous quadrupeds, respiration is essential to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> they do not perform by a rapid succession of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> dilatations and contractions of the lungs; but, having this viscus remarkably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> in proportion to their bodies, they are able to fill it with a considerable provision of air; and, as they expire very slowly, some time will elapse before they are obliged to inspire again. The intestinal canal is narrow, sinuous, and internally divided by many transverse partitions. The kidneys are particularly large, and composed of small continuous glands, blended with excretory vessels.\n\nThat animals of the serpent kind possess the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> senses, can scarcely admit of dispute. We have indeed remarked, that most of the species appear to want an external auditory passage; but it is certain that they are often directed to birds, by listening to their notes; and many indicate a degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> to the sounds of musical instruments. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>, with a few remarkable exceptions, is neither very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> nor acute; but, in most, that of sight is quick and penetrating. The soft and nervous texture of the tongue and palate would induce a suspicion, that they enjoy the sense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> in a pre-eminent degree; yet, as they generally swallow their food in large portions, they seldom avail themselves of the delicacy of these organs. Being unprovided with feet, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, or feelers, their sense of touch is probably very imperfect; and even when they twine very closely round an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, the interposition of their scales will render their feeling of its surface vague and obtuse.\n\nThe sexual union of serpents usually takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the sunny days of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> and ardent, and varies in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> to several days, according to the species, but terminates without any permanent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a>. The females of some are oviparous, and of others viviparous. The eggs of the former vary in respect of size, colour, and number, according to the species and constitution of the individual; and they are deposited, not in continuous succession, but at intervals, and sometimes with the appearance of much suffering on the part of the female. Segerus relates, that he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> a female snake, after twisting herself, and rolling on the ground in an unusual manner, bring forth an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>. He immediately took her up, and facilitated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a> of thirteen more, the laying of all which consumed an hour and a half; for, after depositing each, she retired for some time. When he remitted his affiance, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> was more slow and difficult; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> animal seemed to receive his good offices with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>, which she expressed by gently rubbing her head against his hands. The mother never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HATCHES\">hatches</a> these eggs, but leaves them exposed in some warm situation, as in holes with a southern aspect, on dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, under moss or foliage, on a dung-hill, near an oven, &c. The outer covering of the egg is a thin but compact membrane, and the young serpent is spirally rolled in its albuminous liquid. The viviparous species differ considerably, both with respect to their periods of gestation, and the number of their offspring. Thus, vipers which go about three months with young, generally breed twice a year, and produce from twenty to twenty-four; while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a>-worm, which is pregnant about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, brings forth sometimes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a>, and sometimes ten at a birth. When young serpents are hatched or produced, they are abandoned to the resources of their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTINCT\">instinct</a>, and often perish before they have acquired sufficient experience to flun the snares which are laid for them by quadrupeds, birds, and reptiles.\n\nIn regard to the different stages of growth of the different species, little precise information seems to have been obtained: and, though some arrive at a very large size, their dimensions have, no doubt, been much exaggerated. The young of the viper, at the moment of parturition, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> from twelve to fifteen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>; and two or three years elapse before they are capable of reproducing their kind. Adanson however concludes, from ocular observation, that the largest serpent in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENEGAL\">Senegal</a> may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> from forty to fifty feet in length, and from a foot to a foot and a half in breadth. Leguat affirms us, that he saw one in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAVA\">Java</a>, that was fifty feet long. Carli affirms, that they grow to upwards of forty feet. Mr Wentworth, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> who had large concerns in the Berbice, informs us, that he one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> sent out a folder, with an Indian, to kill wild fowl for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>; and they accordingly went some miles from the fort. In pursuing their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAME\">game</a>, the Indian, who generally marched before, beginning to tire, went to rest himself on the fallen trunk of a tree, as he supposed it to be; but, when he was just going to sit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, the huge monster began to move, and the poor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a>, perceiving that he had approached a Boa, dropped down in an agony. The folder, perceiving what had happened, levelled at the serpent's head, and by a lucky aim <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> it dead. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> his fire, however, until he was assured that the animal was killed; and then going up to rescue his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>, he found him killed by the fright. The animal was brought to the fort, and was found to measure thirty-five feet. Mr W. caused the skin to be stuffed, and sent it as a present to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a>. We are told, that when Regulus led his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> along the banks of the Bagrada, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, an enormous serpent disputed his passage across the river. If we can give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to Pliny, this reptile was 120 feet long, and had destroyed many of the folderies, when it was overcome in turn by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTERING\">battering</a> engines. Its spoils were carried\nIn regard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, some serpents are apparently silent, and others have a peculiar cry; but hissing is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> which they most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> utter, either as a call to their kind, or a threat to their enemies. In countries where they abound, they are generally silent in the middle of the day; but, in the cool of the evening, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> from their retreats with continued hissings.\n\nThe masses of food which serpents are enabled to swallow, would appear quite miraculous, did we not reflect on the lax structure of their jaws, their power of crushing their victims, and the viscid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>, or saliva, which lubricates the crude morsel in its passage down an extensible oesophagus. In spite of all these circumstances, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of aliment is sometimes so voluminous, that it sticks in the gullet; when only partly immersed in the stomach, and the animal lies stretched and nearly motionless, in its retreat, till the swallowed portion be digested, and the extruded half introduced, to undergo the same process. But, though serpents thus occasionally gorge themselves with food, as their blood is colder than that of most other terrestrial animals, and circulates slowly, their powers of digestion are feeble and tardy, so that they can endure weeks, and even months of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a>. Nay, so tenacious are they of the vital principle, that they exist and grow in mephitic marshes, continue to breathe, for a considerable time, in the exhausted receiver of an air-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>, and frequently exhibit symptoms of life after one part of the body has been fevered from the other. Vipers are often kept in boxes, for six or eight months, without any food whatever; and there are little serpents sometimes sent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a>, which live for several years in glaases, and never eat at all.\n\nThe natural term of the existence of serpents, is not accurately known; but it has been conjectured, that some of the larger kinds may complete a century. The first failure of their strength is the almost immediate forerunner of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a>; for, when deprived of the requisite elasticity of frame to spring on their prey, and of the requisite force to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> their enemies, they shrink into their recesses, and die of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>, or are easily devoured by the ichneumon, stork, and other powerful assailants.\n\nIn the more northerly and temperate regions of the globe, the serpent tribes, towards the end of autumn, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into a state of torpor, more or less profound, according to the greater or less intensity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>; and in this condition they remain, nearly lifeless, till the approach of spring reanimates their stiffened frame.\n\nSoon after its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESUSCITATION\">resuscitation</a>, the serpent works itself out of its old epidermis, by rubbing itself against the ground, or by wedging itself between any two substances that are sufficiently close to each other. The exuvia come off entire, being loosened first about the head; and are always found turned inside out. It is some time before the scales acquire a sufficient degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> to defend the animal against external injury; and, during this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, it generally confines itself to its retreat.\n\nGeneric and Specific Exposition of the Order.\n\nGen. I. Crotalus. Rattle-Snake.\n\nScuta on the abdomen, scuta and squamae beneath the tail, rattle terminating the Generic characters.\n\nThe animals of this genus inhabit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, where they prey on the smaller birds, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIZARDS\">lizards</a>, and insects. They are furnished with poisonous fangs, and have a broad head, covered with large scales. Their snout is obtusely rounded.\n\nBanded Rattle-Snake, Common Rattle-Snake, or Boi-Horridus.\n\nThe characters are, 167 abdominal, and 23 sub-caudal scuta. The ordinary length of this species is from three to four or five feet, and the greatest thickness that of a man's arm. The prevailing colour is a yellowish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>, marked with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> bands of a deeper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>, and two or three longitudinal stripes from the head down the neck; the under parts are of a dingy brown, with many dusky variegations and freckles. The mouth is capable of great dilatation. The tongue is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, slender, bipartite, and inclosed in a kind of fleath, from which the snake darts forth the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> point, and vibrates it with great velocity. The rattlesnake is viviparous, producing in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> about twelve young, which, by September, acquire the length of about twelve inches. The, it is said to preserve from danger, like the viper in Europe, by receiving them into its mouth, and swallowing them. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of this afflention, we shall quote the words of M. de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUVAIS\">Beauvais</a>, who, during his residence in America, bestowed particular attention on the history of amphibious reptiles.\n\nAmong the information which I endeavoured to obtain in my travels with respect to serpents in general, there was one point which greatly excited my curiosity. Several persons, and one among the rest to whom I owe a debt of gratitude for civilities and marks of friendship, which will for ever engraven on my heart, had informed me, that the female rattlesnake concealed its young ones in its body; that when they were alarmed by any noise, or by the approach of man, they took refuge in the body of their mother, into which they entered by her mouth. This fact had been already ascertained with respect to the viper of Europe; but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the unfavourable and repulsive dispositions inspired by this kind of reptile, and in order to render it still more hideous, an absurd interpretation was given to this fact. It was pretended, that this serpent eats its little ones after having given them birth. Curious to verify this fact related of the boiquirra, I was constantly occupied with this idea, and began to despair of ever making the observation, when, at a moment in which I thought the least of it, accident furnished me the means. Having fallen sick among the Indians, I found myself obliged to remain a few days with one of them in the neighbourhood of Pine-log. During my convalescence, I took a walk every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> in the neighbourhood, and one day when I was following a pretty broad path, I perceived, at a distance, a serpent lying across the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>. I had a stick in my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and drew near to kill it; but what was my surprise, when, in the moment that I was about to give the blow\nCrotalus, the reptile perceived me, coiled up itself, and opened its large mouth, into which five serpents, which I had not till then observed, because they were lying along its body, rushed into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> which I had conceived opened for myself. I retired to one side, and hid myself behind a tree. The reptile had crawled a few paces, but hearing no further noise, and not perceiving me, stretched itself out afresh. In a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an hour the young ones came out again. Satisfied with this observation, I advanced anew towards the animal, with intention to kill it and examine the interior of its stomach: but it did not permit me to approach so near as it did the first time, the young ones entered with still greater precipitation into their retreat, and the boiura fled into the grass. My satisfaction and astonishment were so great, that I did not think of following it.\"\n\nThe rattle consists of a number of pieces, inserted into each other, all alike in shape and size, hollow, and of a thin, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a>, brittle substance, similar to the exterior part of the scuta. Their form is nearly that of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRILATERAL\">quadrilateral</a> pyramid, with the corners rounded off. The first piece, or that nearest the body, may be considered as a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, which contains the three last vertebrae of the tail, on which it appears to be moulded, and has three convex, circular elevations corresponding with them; the two last of these elevations are fitted into the two first of the next piece; so that of every piece except the last, the first only of the elevations is exposed to view, the two others being inclosed in those of the following, in which they have room to play from side to side. These several pieces have no muscles, nerves, nor ligaments, nor are they connected, either with each other, or with the body of the serpent any otherwise than by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of insertion already described. Thus they derive no nourishment from the animal, and are merely an appendage which can have no other motion than what is communicated to it by that of the tail. These several pieces of which the rattle consists, appear to have been separately formed.\n\nDr Van Meus imagines them to be no other than the old epidermis of the tail, which, when its nourishment is intercepted by the new skin formed beneath it, grows hard and brittle. Hence, he supposes, that whenever this part acquires a new skin, a new piece of the rattle is added to the former, which is thus detached from the vertebrae, and thrown farther from the tail. The number of these pieces, however, affords no certain criterion of the animal's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, because those which are most remote from the tail, become dry and brittle, that they are very liable to be broken off and lost.\n\nThe two principal fangs are placed without the jaws, on a separate bone, and the smaller ones attached to muscles and tendons. These fangs may be touched, or raised, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of the animal, and are furnished with an opening near the root, and a slit towards the point, so that on pressing gently with the finger on the side of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a>, which is yellowish, is perceived to issue from the hollow of the tooth, through the slit. The vehicle which contains the poison, is externally of a triangular form, and of a tendinous texture; internally, it is cellular; and its anterior part terminates in a small duct, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> with the faucius which covers the perforated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>. It is furnished with a constrictor muscle, for the purpose of expressing its contents. The virulence of the latter may be inferred from various experiments reported in the Philosophical Transactions, and other publications. A rattlesnake of about four feet long, being fastened to a stake, bit three dogs, the first of which died in less than a quarter of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>; the second, which was bitten a short time afterwards, in about two hours, and the third, which was bitten about half an hour afterwards, showed the visible effects of the poison in three hours, and likewise died. Other experiments were instituted; and lastly, in order to try if the snake could poison itself, it was provoked to bite a part of its own body, and actually expired in less than twelve minutes. Our limits will not permit us to enumerate various other instances of the almost instantaneous effects of this poison, which is most to be dreaded in hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, and when the animal is much irritated. The rattlesnake, however, is rather afraid of man, and will not venture to attack him unless provoked. It moves slowly, for the most part with its head on the ground; but if alarmed, it throws its body into a circle, coiling itself, with the head erect in the centre, and with its eyes flaming in a terrific manner. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of flight bites, the Indians usually suck the wound. They have likewise recourse to the juices of various herbs, and to the root of polygala seneca; but these applications produce little effect, without scarification and ligatures. According to Dr Barton, the rude and simple practice of the western settlers, is, first, to throw a tight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGATURE\">ligature</a> above the part into which the poison has been introduced, at least as often as the circumstances of the case admit of such an application. The wound is next scarified, and a mixture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, or either of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>, separately, laid on the part. Over the whole is put a piece of the bark of juglans <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBA\">alba</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> walnut-tree, which acts as a blister. At the same time, a decoction or infusion of one or more stimulant vegetables, with large quantities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, are administered internally: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> is, nevertheless, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that the beneficial effects of this mode of treatment are chiefly to be ascribed to the external applications. If the gang has penetrated a vein or artery, or attacked the region of the throat, the bite commonly proves fatal, and the patient expires in dreadful agony. \"Where a rattlesnake, (says Cateby,) with full force, penetrates with his deadly fangs, and pricks a vein, or artery, inevitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> ensues; and that, as I have often seen, in less than two minutes.\" \"The Indians, (he continues,) know their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTINY\">destiny</a> the minute they are bit; and, when they perceive it mortal, apply no remedy, concluding all efforts in vain.\" Dr Barton, however, inclines to think, that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFIRMATION\">affirmation</a> should be received with considerable limitation, and that the application of ligatures, &c., even in cases apparently the most desperate, should not be neglected. According to Clavigero, the most effectual method is thought to be, the holding of the wounded part some time in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. But if the poison be once received into the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of the blood, it is almost needless to have recourse to medicines. A considerable degree of nausea is usually the first alarming symptom; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a> becomes full, strong, and greatly agitated; the whole body swells; the eyes are suffused with blood; a hemorrhage frequently proceeds from the eyes, nose and ears; large quantities of blood are sometimes thrown out on the surface of the body, in the form of sweat; the teeth vacillate in their sockets; and the pains and groans of\nof the unhappy sufferer too plainly indicate, that the moment of dissolution is near at hand.\n\nThe following remarkable case is related by Mr Hector St John. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> was one day mowing with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a>, when he accidentally trod on a rattle-snake, which immediately turned on him, and bit his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOOT\">boot</a>. At night, when he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, he was attacked with fevers; his body swelled, and before a physician could be called in, he died. All his neighbours were surprised at his sudden death; but the body was interred without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>. A few days after, one of the sons put on the father's boots, and, at night, when he pulled them off, he was seized with the same symptoms, and died on the following morning. The physician arrived, and, unable to divine the cause of so singular a disorder, ferociously pronounced both the father and son to have been bewitched. At the tale of the effects, a neighbour purchased the boots, and on putting them on, experienced the like dreadful symptoms with the father and son. A skilful physician, however, being sent for, who had heard of the foregoing accidents, suspected the cause, and by applying proper remedies, recovered the patient. The fatal boots were now carefully examined, and the two fangs of the snake were discovered to have been left in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>, with the poison-bladders adhering to them. They had penetrated entirely through, and both the father and son had imperceptibly scratched themselves with their point in pulling off the boots.\n\nWe are informed by Dr Barton, that a gentleman of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILADELPHIA\">Philadelphia</a> had a large rattle-snake brought to him alive, which he so managed by a string, that he could easily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> it into, or out of a clothe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAGE\">cage</a>. On the first day, he suffered this snake to bite a chicken, which had been allured to the mouth of the cage by crumbs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>. In a few hours, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> mortified, and died. On the second day, another chicken was bitten in the same manner, and survived the injury much longer than the first. On the third day, the experiment was made on a third chicken, which swelled much, but, nevertheless, recovered. On the fourth day, several chickens were suffered to be bitten, without receiving any injury. These simple experiments enable us to assign a reason, why persons who have actually been bitten by the rattle-snake, have sometimes experienced very inconsiderable, or no bad consequences from the wound; they shew in what manner many vegetables have acquired a reputation for curing the bites of serpents, without our being obliged to impeach the veracity of those from whom our information is derived; and lastly, they teach us the physiological fact, that the poison of this reptile is secreted very slowly.\n\nIt has been observed by M. Gauthier, that the poison stains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> with a green hue, which is deeper in proportion as the linen has been impregnated with lixivium.\n\nThe pretended fascinating power of the rattle-snake is now generally discredited; and Dr Barton, professor of natural history in the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENNSYLVANIA\">Pennsylvania</a>, reduces the whole to the fluttering of old birds in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of their young, and too near an approach to the formidable enemy. In confirmation of this opinion, he observes, that he can trace no allusion to the alleged fascinating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> writers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> and Rome; that he doubts if it is credited by the American Indians; that Linnaeus was extremely credulous; that the enchanting power of the rattle-snake is questioned by some eminent European naturalists; that the breath of this reptile is not remarkably infectious or pestiferous; that it often fails in catching birds; that the latter, and squirrels, are not its principal food; and that it is even devoured by some of the larger kinds of birds.\n\nMr Peale, an intelligent and zealous naturalist, kept a rattle-snake alive for five years and a half. \"Curious to enquire,\" (says M. Beauvois), \"how this animal sizes his prey, he (Mr Peale) has confined several birds in the same cage with him, and the hungry reptile has made many attempts to take hold of the bird. This experiment has been repeated many times, and every time with the same effect. I have seen myself, one of these birds in the cage; but whether the reptile was not hungry, or was sensible of its want of power, it remained perfectly tranquil, while the bird was perfectly at ease. It gave no indication which could make it be believed that it was either enchanted or affrighted; and the air did not appear different, if we might judge from its behaviour, from that which it found in an ordinary clothe cage. The bird remained two days in the same situation, without the least attention paid to it by the reptile, who, in the meantime, ate a dead one which was presented to him.\"\n\n\"Another living bird was put into the cage with the serpent: far from being alarmed, it amused itself with pecking in the bottom, and picking up a few grains which it found there: often changing place in its accustomed manner, and even resting itself on the back of the boioura, which made no extraordinary movements. This experiment was made several times.\n\n\"Mr Peale, his children, and myself, have often examined the reptile. We never perceived it to send out the slightest suffocating odour. It is in vain to object, that the living birds thus given it were not of the kind fitted for its nourishment; for it has eaten the same birds, when presented to it dead, and it is not useless to remark, that it never refused one of them.\"\n\nCateby mentions an individual of this species, which was about eight feet long, and weighed from eight to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> pounds. It was seen gliding into a gentleman's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, and terrified all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> animals.\n\nMr St. John, whom we have quoted above, once saw a tamed rattle-snake, as gentle as it is possible to conceive a reptile to be. It went to the water, and swam wherever it pleased; and when the boys to whom it belonged called it back, their summons was readily obeyed. They often stroked it with a soft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>; and this friction seemed to cause the most pleasing sensations; for it would turn on its back to enjoy it, as a cat does before the fire. We need scarcely add, that it had been deprived of its fangs.\n\nRattle-snakes abound in America, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRAZIL\">Brazil</a> to near Lake Champlain: but they are gradually disappearing in the more populous districts. According to Pennant, they affect woods and lofty hills, especially where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> are rocky or chalky, as at the falls near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NIAGARA\">Niagara</a>. They particularly frequent the sides of rills, to prey on such small animals as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> thither to quench their thirst. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, they are generally found in pairs; in winter, they collect in multitudes, and retire underground, beyond the reach of foot. Tempted by the warmth of a spring day, they often creep out, weak and languid. A person has seen a piece of ground covered with them, and killed with a rod between sixty and\nand seventy till, overpowered with the stench, he was obliged to retire. They are most easily dispatched by a blow with a stick on the spine.\n\nThe American Indians often regale on the rattle-snake. When they find it asleep, they put a small forked stick over its neck, which they keep immovably fixed to the ground, giving the snake a piece of leather to bite; and this they pull back several times with great force, until they perceive that the poison fangs are torn out. They then cut off the head, skin the body, and cook it, as we do eels. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> is said to be white and excellent. Hogs also sometimes devour the rattle-snake; but horses, dogs, and most other animals, regard it with antipathy and horror.\n\nStriped Rattle-snake, or White Rattle-snake.\u2014172 abdominal, and 21 subcaudal scuta. From a foot and a half, to four feet and a half long. Distinguished from the preceding by a pattern of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> streaks, forming a series of large rhombs, or lozenges, down the back. Has often been confounded with the former, on account of the same general aspect, constitution, and habits.\n\nWood Rattle-snake.\u2014165 abdominal, and 39 subcaudal scuta. Of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> tinge than the two preceding, and marked with yellowish variegations on the back.\u2014This species has been hitherto very imperfectly described; and Seba erroneously quotes it as a native of Ceylon.\n\nMiliary, or Small Rattle-snake.\u2014132 abdominal, and 32 subcaudal scuta. Gray, with a triple row of black spots, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> spot between each of the dorsal ones. The smallest of the genus; its ordinary length being about eighteen inches. From this circumstance, and the faint sound of its rattle, it is more dangerous than the larger species. It is also alleged, that its bite is more active. Its poison, according to Lebeau, is most successfully combated by the volatile alkali. It is confined to the temperate regions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> America, particularly to Carolina, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUISIANA\">Louisiana</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLORIDA\">Florida</a>.\n\nBlack-tailed Rattle-snake.\u2014170 abdominal, and 26 subcaudal scuta. The head greenish-gray, with two brown and oblong spots on the hinder part. The body of a reddish gray, speckled with brown <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, and crossed by 24 lengthened patches, or bands, brown, and irregular, and accompanied, on each side, by two spots of a brighter colour. The back is marked by a longitudinal, fawn-coloured stripe. Scales very numerous, rhomboidal, and carinated.\u2014From three to four feet long; a very venomous species; discovered by Boft, in Carolina, and described in Daudin's Natural History of Reptiles.\n\nGen. 2. BOA.\n\nCharacters. Scuta on the abdomen, and under the tail; but no rattle.\n\nThe boa <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of serpents is very numerous, and contains some species which are remarkable for their huge dimensions. Their head is covered, like that of the crotalus; but their tail terminates in a point. Their immense size has rendered them the objects of terror rather than of observation to mankind; while the quantity of food requisite for their sustenance, has precluded their multiplication within a limited range of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. Hence, a considerable degree of confusion attaches to their history; and a rational suspicion arises, that, with the progress of culture and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>, some of the more formidable forts have either been exterminated, or driven from the haunts of men. Some naturalists have asserted, that individuals belonging to this genus have been found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, and the south of France; but they appear to have mistaken some of the larger forts of coluber for the boa, which last is a native of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, Africa, and America.\n\nGreat or Constrictor Boa.\u2014240 abdominal, and 60 Constrictor, subcaudal scuta. The more ordinary disposition of its colouring is yellowish gray with a large, chestnut-coloured, chain-like pattern down the back, and triangular spots on the sides. A considerable degree of variety, however, is occasioned by the circumstances of age, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>; and even the number of scuta is by no means constant. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">Nature</a> has bestowed on this celebrated reptile, uncommon strength and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, but has wisely withheld from it the poisonous properties of some of the smaller species. It frequently attains to twenty, or even thirty feet in length. Except, however, when stimulated by the calls of hunger, it is a sluggish and harmless animal, affecting most and lazy situations, and, occasionally, devouring large animals, which it crushes in its contorted folds. In the German Ephemerides, we have an account of a combat between one of these huge serpents and a buffalo, by a person who affirms us, that he was himself a spectator. The serpent had for some time been waiting near the brink of a pool, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of prey, when a buffalo was the first animal that appeared. Having darted on the affrighted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a>, it instantly began to wrap him round in its voluminous twilights, and, at every twist, the bones of the buffalo were heard to crack almost as loud as the report of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUN\">gun</a>. It was in vain that the quadruped struggled and bellowed; its enormous enemy twisted it so closely, that at length all its bones were crushed to pieces, like those of a malefactor on the wheel, and the whole body reduced to one uniform mass. The serpent then untwined its folds, to swallow its prey at leisure. To prepare for this, and also to make it slip down more smoothly, it licked the whole body over, and smeared it with a mucilaginous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>. It then began to swallow it at the end that offered the least resistance, the throat dilating to such an extraordinary degree, as to admit a substance which was thrice its own thickness.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-BOMBAY\">Bombay</a> Courier, of August 31, 1799, it is stated, that as a Malay crew anchored for the night, close under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CELEBES\">Celebes</a>, one of the crew went on shore, in quest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BETEL\">betel</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> in the woods, and on his return, lay down to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, as it is supposed, on the beach. In the course of the night, he was heard by his comrades, to scream out for assistance. They immediately went on shore; but an immense snake of this species had already crushed him to death. The attention of the monster being entirely occupied with his prey, the people went boldly up to it, cut off its head, and took both it and the body of the man on board their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>. The snake had seized the poor fellow by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WRIST\">wrist</a>, where the marks of the teeth were very distinct; and the mangled corpse bore evident signs of being crushed. The length of the snake was about thirty feet, its thickness equal to that of a moderately sized man; and, on extending its jaws, the gape was found.\nfound wide enough to admit a body of the size of a man's head.\n\nThe female deposits a considerable number of eggs, which seldom exceed three inches in their greatest diameter, on the sand, or under leaves exposed to the sun's rays.\n\nIn some districts of Africa, the great boa is regarded as an object of veneration, and on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOZAMBIQUE\">Mozambique</a>, is worshipped as a god.\n\nIn a very interesting notice of this species, communicated to us by John Corfe Scott, Esq., mention is made of a live individual, which was discovered in a field, near the cattle, by some labourers, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Tipperah in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a>. This snake, which measured fifteen feet and three inches in length, and eighteen inches in circumference, was stunned by repeated blows, before it could be secured, and tied with cords to a long bamboo. It was pretty active after it was untied, and made frequent darts at any person coming near it. On presenting a long stick, it repeatedly feigned and bit it with great fierceness. On dissection, the heart was found to be of the size of a sheep's, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> open between the two ventricles. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a> was small in proportion, being about the size of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> pancreas, and, like it, divided into several lobes. The oesophagus, from the mouth to the pylorus, measured nine feet three inches, and its width was sufficient to admit a man's head with ease. The head was small, in proportion to the size of the animal, the eyes were dark and heavy, and the nostrils large; but there was no perceptible organ of hearing. From the mechanism of the jaws, they were capable of being distended so as to admit a substance or animal much thicker than the snake itself. This mechanism, and the absence of grinders, obviously prove, that the food is swallowed entire, without mastication. In a gorged individual of this species, Mr S. found an entire guana, and in another, a fawn, of a year old; but the bones of these quadrupeds were unbroken.\n\nSpotted Boa.\u2014250 abdominal, and 70 subcaudal scuta. Cinereous, with large, round, black spots on the back, and smaller ones, with white centres, on the sides, and oblong markings, interspersed with smaller variegations on the abdomen. Of a size scarcely inferior to the preceding, and of similar manners. It is a native of several parts of South America, and, like other snakes, occasionally eaten by the Indians.\n\nRinged Boa.\u2014265 abdominal, and 57 subcaudal scuta. General coat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERRUGINOUS\">ferruginous</a>, with large dark rings on the back, and blackish kidney-shaped spots, with white centres on the sides. The aboma of several writers. Grows to a large size, and is a native of South America, where it is treated with divine honours.\n\nCanine or Green Boa.\u2014203 abdominal, and 77 subcaudal scuta. Green, with cross, waving, and white dorsal bands. It has its specific name from the form of its head, which resembles that of a dog. Though destitute of poison fangs, it inflicts a severe bite, when provoked. It measures from four to twelve feet in length, inhabits South America, and is celebrated for its beauty.\n\nEmbroidered Boa.\u2014A remarkably elegant species, native of the East Indies, and omitted by Linn\u00e6us. White, with a cinereous tinge on the back, and the body marked with black <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LACE\">lace</a>-like variegations.\n\nGarden Boa.\u2014290 abdominal, and 123 subcaudal Hortulana scuta. Yellowish gray, with brown variegations, resembling in form the parterres of an old-fashioned garden, the body somewhat compressed, and the sides marked with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUNEIFORM\">cuneiform</a> spots. From two to three or four feet long, and native of South America.\n\nFasciata Boa.\u2014233 abdominal, and 36 subcaudal Fasciata scuta. Yellow, with dusky blue transverse bands. The body somewhat triangular, upwards of five feet in length, and five inches in the thickest part. Native of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, and very poisonous.\n\nAn individual of this species was sent to Dr Ruffel, in a very languid and emaciated state. Being set at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, it remained for some time without moving, but soon began to crawl slowly towards a dark corner. A chicken being presented, it seemed not to regard it, though the bird fluttered about it, and even rested a toe on its head. The chicken was then put on the snake's back, and clung so fast with its toes, that, when attempted to be separated, the snake was dragged a little way, without offering to resent the insult. An hour after, the chicken was again presented; but the snake shewing no disposition to bite, its jaws were forced apart, and the naked thigh of the chicken placed, that the jaws closed on part of it. The chicken, when engaged, shewed immediate symptoms of poison: it coughed, purged once or twice, and was not able to stand. In the course of the first ten minutes, after several ineffectual efforts to rise, it rested its beak on the ground; and the head was seized with paralysis. After fifteen minutes, it shewed a frequent disposition to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> down; but remained crouched some minutes longer. In twenty minutes, it lay down on one side, and convulsions supervening soon after, it expired within twenty minutes.\n\nViperine Boa.\u2014209 abdominal, and 19 subcaudal Viperina scuta. Gray, with a black waving dorsal band, edged with white; the sides spotted with black. About a foot and a half in length, including the tail, which is only one inch and a half long. Native of India, where its bite is said to produce a slow wasting of the fingers and toes. As, however, it has no fangs, and produces no deleterious effects on brute animals: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of the report seems to be very questionable.\n\nLineated Boa.\u2014209 abdominal, and 47 subcaudal Lineata scuta. Blackish line, with white dotted, transverse, arched lines, and whitish abdomen. Slender, native of India, and highly poisonous.\n\nAnnulated Boa.\u2014About two feet in length, somewhat ferruginous, with black rounded spots, included in rings, on the back, reniform ocellated spots on the sides, and waving dusky variegations on the abdomen. Native of South America, figured by Madame Merian, and preserved in the Hunterian Museum, at Glasgow.\n\nThe other species belonging to this genus are, erythris, ophryas, regia, murina, horatta, hipnale, contortrix, and palpebralis.\n\nGen. 3. Coluber, Snake (properly so called).\n\nScuta, or undivided plates, under the abdomen; squamae, Characters, or broad alternate scales, under the tail. The lat.\nter, although alternate, are reckoned by pairs; but, in many instances, the number is still undetermined, and it sometimes varies in the same species.\n\nThis tribe contains about 200 species, which greatly differ from one another in size and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>. The poisonous sorts, which constitute about one-fifth of the whole, are generally distinguished from the rest by their large, flattened, subcylindrical heads, and rather short bodies and tails; whereas most of the harmless species have small heads, with longer bodies and tails in proportion. Laurenti and Latreille have ranged the former under the genus *Vipera*, and the latter under that of *Coluber*: but Linnaeus, Daubenton, La C\u00e9p\u00e9de, &c., include both sorts under *Coluber*. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of serpents is widely diffused over various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of the world.\n\n**Common Viper.**\u2014146 abdominal scuta, 39 subcaudal scales. Attains to the length of two, or even three feet. The ground colour of the body is a dingy yellow, deeper in the female than in the male. The back is marked with rhomboidal, as the sides are with triangular, black spots. Its black belly, the greater thickness of the head, and the more abrupt termination of the tail, sufficiently distinguish it from the common snake, with which it has been often confounded.\n\nThe viper arrives at maturity in five or seven years, and produces 10 or 12 live young at the end of the second or third. Mr. White of Selborne killed and cut up a pregnant female, and found in the abdomen 15 young ones, about the size of full grown earth-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>. No sooner were they freed from confinement, than they twisted and wriggled about, set themselves up, and gaped very wide when touched with a stick, exhibiting manifest tokens of menace and defiance, though as yet no fangs were visible, even with the help of glasses.\u2014That the young, for some time after birth, retreat, when alarmed, into the mouth of the mother, seems to be a fact satisfactorily ascertained.\n\nVipers are capable of supporting long abstinence, feed on reptiles, worms, and young birds, and become torpid in winter. Their poison rarely proves fatal to man, and is most successfully counteracted by olive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, thoroughly rubbed on the wounded part. They are usually caught by wooden tongs, at the end of the tail, as, in that position, they cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> themselves up to injure their enemy. Their flesh was formerly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> esteem, as a remedy for various diseases, particularly as a restorative. Of late years, however, it has lost much of its ancient credit, and is rarely prescribed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> practitioners.\n\nThe common viper inhabits Europe and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>, and is by no means uncommon in Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, being the only poisonous animal in the island, frequenting dry and stony districts, and especially the chalky countries. It abounds in some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBRIDES\">Hebrides</a>, and is called *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDER\">adder</a>* by the Scots.\n\nThis species is subject to several varieties, which we cannot stop to enumerate. The *adder*, or black viper, resembles the *berus*, in almost every particular but colour; though Linnaeus, and other eminent naturalists, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> it as a distinct species.\n\n**American Black Viper.**\u2014About the length of the preceding, but much thicker, black, and remarkable for the largeness of its head, which it defends, with a horrid hiss, when irritated. Its bite is reckoned as dangerous as that of the rattlesnake. It is a native of Carolina, chiefly frequenting higher grounds.\n\n**Egyptian Viper.**\u2014118 abdominal scuta, and 22 subcaudal scales. Somewhat ferruginous, spotted with brown; whitish beneath, with a short mucronated tail. Rather smaller than the common species. Imported in considerable quantities to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>, for the use of the apothecaries in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of theriacs, &c. Native of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, and supposed by some to be the *asp* of Cleopatra; but it is very difficult to ascertain the true *asp* of the ancients.\n\n**Charasian Viper.**\u2014Rufous, with the snout acuminated above, and the body marked with short, subconfluent, dusky, and transverse streaks. Nearly allied to the common species, and described by Charas, a celebrated anatomist of serpents, in his day, but who contended, in opposition to Redi, that the symptoms caused by the viperine bite, proceeded from what he termed the enraged spirits of the creature, and not from the supposed poisonous fluid.\n\n**Redi's Viper.**\u2014152 abdominal scuta, and 32 subcaudal scales. Of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> brown colour, with a quadruple transverse series of short, subconfluent, brown streaks on the back. In other respects nearly allied to the common viper, but said to be more poisonous. It occurs in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a> and Italy, and is the sort which Redi chiefly employed in his experiments relative to animal poison.\n\n**Afp.**\u2014155 abdominal scuta, and 37 subcaudal scales. Affinis. Somewhat rufous, with roundish, alternate, dusky spots on the back, and subconfluent ones near the tail. About three feet long, the head rather large, and covered with small carinated scales. Native of France, particularly of the northern provinces of that country. It is very doubtful if this be the genuine *coluber alpis* (Lin.) and still more so if it be the *asp* of the ancients.\n\n**Greek Viper.**\u2014155 abdominal scuta, and 46 subcaudal scales. Labetinus. Gray, with a fourfold series of transverse spots, those on the middle yellowish, and those on the sides dusky. Nearly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUBIT\">cubit</a> in length, very thick towards the middle, and the head large and depressed. Inhabits Greece and the Grecian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>. According to Forficul, its bite proves fatal by inducing insuperable sleep.\n\n**Cerastes, or Horned Viper.**\u2014150 abdominal plates, Cerastes, and 25 subcaudal scales. Pale yellowish, or reddish brown, with a few round, distant, or oblong spots, of a deeper tinge, scattered along the upper parts of the body, and the belly of a pale leaden hue. The two curved processes, situated above the eyes, give the animal a more than ordinary appearance of malignity. Its length varies from about 15 inches to two feet. It is found in many parts of Africa, especially affecting dry places, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> deserts, and inflicting a dangerous wound on those who happen to approach it.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">Horn</a>-nose Snake.**\u2014127 abdominal plates, 32 subcaudal scales. Naficornis. Olive brown, with blackish variegations, a row of pale dorsal spots, surrounded by black, and a waving pale band on the sides. This fierce and forbidding species, which has its denomination from two large and pointed processes on the tip of the nose, is supposed to inhabit the interior parts of Africa.\n\n**Megera, or Spear-headed Snake.**\u2014224 abdominal plates, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEGARA\">Megara</a>.\nO P H I O L O G Y.\n\nCaluber. p'tes, and 68 subcaudal scales. Brown, with yellow variegations, flat cordate head, and a large orifice on each side, between the eyes and nostrils. Native of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARTINICO\">Martinico</a>, whence it is frequently called yellow Martinico snake. Measures, when full grown, five or six feet, has very large fangs, and inflicts a dangerous wound.\n\nSpectacle Snake, or Cobra de Capello.\u2014193 abdominal plates, 65 subcaudal scales. \"Its general length (says Dr Shaw), seems to be three or four feet, and the diameter of the body about an inch and a quarter: the head is rather small than large, and is covered on the fore part with large smooth scales; resembling, in this respect, the majority of innoxious serpents: the back part, sides, and neck, with smaller ovate scales; and the remainder of the animal, on the upper parts, with small, distinct, oval scales, not ill resembling the general form of a grain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>. At a small distance beyond the head is a lateral swelling or dilatation of the skin, which is continued to the distance of about four inches downwards, where the outline gradually sinks into the cylindric form of the rest of the body. This part is extensible, at the pleasure of the animal; and, when viewed from above, while in its most extended state, is of a somewhat cordated form, or wider at the upper than at the lower part: it is marked above by a very large and conspicuous patch or spot, greatly resembling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECTACLES\">spectacles</a>; the mark itself being white, with black edges, and the middle of each of the rounded parts black. This mark is more or less distinct in different individuals, and also varies occasionally in size and form, and in some is even altogether wanting. The usual colour of the animal is a pale ferruginous brown above, the under parts being of a bluish white, sometimes slightly tinged with pale brown or yellow: the tail, which is of a moderate length, tapers gradually, and terminates in a slender sharp-pointed extremity.\n\n\"This formidable reptile has obtained its Portuguese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of cobra de capello, or hooded snake, from the appearance which it presents when viewed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> in an irritated state, or when prepared to bite; at which time it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENDS\">bends</a> the head rather downwards, and seems hooded, as it were, in some degree, by the expanded skin of the neck. In India it is everywhere exhibited publicly as a show, and is, of course, more universally known in that country than almost any other of the race of reptiles. It is carried about in a covered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASKET\">basket</a>, and so managed by its proprietors as to assume, when exhibited, a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a> motion; raising itself up on its lower part, and alternately moving its head and body from side to side for some minutes, to the sound of some musical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> which is played during the time. The Indian jugglers, who thus exhibit the animal, first deprive it of its fangs, by which means they are secured from the danger of its bite.\"\n\nThe cobra de capello is one of the most formidable and dangerous of the serpent tribe, though it is devoured with impunity by the viverra ichneumon. Dr Ruffel describes ten varieties of this species, and enters into many curious details relative to the effects of its poison on dogs and other animals. He never knew it prove mortal to a dog in less than 27 minutes, nor to a chicken in less than half a minute. Hence its poison, fatal as it is, seems to be less speedy in its operation than that of the rattlesnake.\n\nRuffelian Snake.\u2014168 abdominal plates, 59 subcaudal scales. Brownish yellow; spots on the back acutely ovate, blackish, and edged with white; those on the sides smaller. About four feet long; native of India, and very poisonous. A chicken bitten in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PINION\">pinion</a>, by an individual of this species, was instantly infected, seized with convulsions, and expired in 33 seconds. Immediately after the chicken, a stout dog was bitten in the thigh. Within less than five minutes he appeared stupified; the thigh was drawn up, and he frequently moved it, as if in pain. He remained, however, standing, and ate some bread that was offered to him. In about 10 minutes the thigh became paralytic; in 15 minutes he entirely lost the use of it, and lay down howling, in a dismal manner, frequently licking the wound, and making, at intervals, ineffectual attempts to rise. In 19 minutes, after a short cessation, he again began to howl, moaned often, and breathed laboriously, till his jaws closed. The few succeeding minutes were pained, alternately, in agony and stupor; and, in 26 minutes after the bite, he expired. A second dog, of much smaller size, was next bitten, and expired in the space of six hours. A rabbit was next exposed to the bite, and died in less than an hour. After this, another chicken was bitten in the pinion, and expired in less than six minutes. These experiments were all made with the same snake, in the course of the same morning.\n\nCrimson-sided Snake.\u2014188 abdominal and 7 anal Porphyria plates, 45 subcaudal scales. Violet black, with the abdomen and sides of a beautiful crimson, the plates margined with black. A singular and elegant species, with the proportions nearly those of the common English snake; poisonous; and a native of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-NEW_HOLLAND\">New <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>.\n\nHomachate Snake.\u2014132 abdominal plates, 43 subcaudal scales. Red, clouded with white above, yellowish white beneath. Two feet or more in length; tail extremely short, and tapering to a point. Native of India; elegant, and poisonous.\n\nWater Viper.\u2014Brown above, banded with black and yellow beneath. \"This serpent (says Cateby) is called, in Carolina, the water rattlesnake; not that it hath a rattle, but is a large snake, and coloured not much unlike the rattlesnake, and the bite said to be as mortal. This snake frequents the water, and is never seen at any great distance from it: the back and head are brown; the belly transversely marked with black and yellow alternately, as are the sides of the neck; the neck is small, the head large, and armed with the like destructive weapons as the rattlesnake. It is very nimble, and particularly dexterous in catching fish. In summer great numbers are seen lying on the branches of trees hanging over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, from which, at the approach of a boat, they drop down into the water, and often into the boat, on the men's heads. They lie in this manner to surprise either birds or fish, after which last they plunge, and pursue them with great swiftness, and catch some of a large size, which they carry on shore, and swallow whole. One of these I surprized <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a> ashore, with a large catfish in its mouth. The tail is small towards the end, and terminates in a blunt horny point, about half an inch in length, and which, though harmless,\nharmless, is considered as of dreadful efficacy by the credulous vulgar, who believe, that the animal is able, with this weapon, not only to kill men and other animals, but even to destroy a tree by wounding it with it; the tree withering, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> black, and dying.\"\n\nSuperb Snake.\u2014White, the head variegated with black, and the body marked above by a quintuple series of ocellated red spots. About two feet long, and poisonous.\n\nArgus Snake.\u2014Chestnut brown, yellow beneath, and banded above, by transverse rows of ocellated red spots. Above five feet in length; native of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a> and Brazil, and very poisonous.\n\nJava Snake.\u2014512 abdominal plates, 93 subcaudal scales. Gray, the head striped with blue, and the body crossed by blue stripes, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>-colored edges. Frequent in the rice fields of Java, where it grows to the length of nine feet; but, in the more elevated and wooded situations, it attains to a still greater size, and is capable of devouring some of the larger animals. Splendid and innoxious.\n\nCommon, or Ringed Snake.\u2014170 abdominal plates, 60 subcaudal scales. Olive brown, with a black patch, accompanied by a yellow one, on each side of the neck, a row of narrow black spots down each side, and bulky abdomen.\n\nThis species is pretty generally diffused over Europe, and is not uncommon in our own island, affecting moist and warm woods, basking or sleeping in the sunshine, and becoming torpid in winter. The female deposits a chain of from 12 to 20 eggs, about the size of those of the blackbird, connected by bunches of a gluey matter, in dunghills, or warm recesses, near stagnant waters. The young come forth in the following spring. The common snake reappears in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> or April, when it casts its skin so completely, that the spoil exhibits even the exterior pellicle of the eye. To adopt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of Mr White, in his Naturalist's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALENDAR\">Calendar</a>, \"It would be a most entertaining sight, could a person be an eyewitness to such a feat, and see the snake in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of changing his garment. As the convexity of the eyes in the trough is now inward, that circumstance alone is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that the skin has been turned; not to mention that now, the present inside is much darker than the outer. If you look through the scales of the snake's eye from the concave side, viz., as the reptile used them, they lessen objects much. Thus it appears, that snakes crawl out of the mouth of their own troughs, and quit the tail part last, just as eels are skimmed by a cookmaid. While the scales of the eyes are growing loose, and a new skin is forming, the creature, in appearance, must be blind, and find itself in a very awkward and uneasy situation.\"\n\nThis species occasionally frequents the water, and preys chiefly on frogs, mice, small birds, insects, worms, &c. It is not only perfectly harmless, but even capable of being domesticated. Mr White mentions, that he knew a gentleman who had one in his house quite tame. Though usually as sweet as any other animal, yet, whenever a stranger, or a dog or cat entered, it would begin to hiss, and soon filled the room with an almost insupportable odor. Mr Revett Sheppard of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIUS\">Caius</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, had a common snake in his rooms near three months. \"He kept it (says Mr Bingley) in a box of bran; and, during all that time, he never could discover that it ate any thing, although he Coluber frequently put both eggs and frogs, the favorite food of this species, into the box. Whenever he was in the room he used to let the animal out of its prison; it would first crawl several times round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>, apparently with a desire to escape; and when it found its attempts fruitless, it would climb up the tables and chairs, and not unfrequently even up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> of its owner as he sat at his table. At length it became familiar as to lie in a serpentine form on the upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> of his chair: it would crawl through his fingers, if held at a little distance before its head, or lie at full length upon his table, while he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a>, for an hour or more at a time. When first brought into the room, it used to hiss and dart out its forked tongue; but in no instance emitted any unpleasant vapour. It was, in all its actions, remarkably cleanly. Sometimes it was indulged with a run upon the grass, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of the college; and sometimes with a swim in a large basin of water, which it seemed to enjoy very much. When this gentleman left the university, he gave his bedmaker orders to turn it out into the fields, which, he believes, was done.\"\n\nBlack Snake.\u2014186 abdominal plates, 92 subcaudal scales. Glossy black, with a very long slender body. Five or six feet long, and not venomous, though often confounded by the ignorant and the timid with the rattlesnake. Native of North America. Its speed and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a>, according to Brickell, are astonishing. Sometimes it will climb trees in quest of the tree-frog, or, for other prey, glide at full length, along the ground: on other occasions it presents itself half erect, and appears to great advantage. It is fond of milk, that it has been seen eating it out of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISH\">dish</a> with children, though they often gave it blows with their spoons on the head when it was too greedy. It persecutes rats with wonderful agility, pursuing them even to the roofs of barns and outhouses, and is therefore a great favorite among the Americans.\n\nFasciated or Wampum Snake.\u2014Blue above, paler, Fasciatus, and variegated with brighter blue beneath. Its colours resemble those of the strings of Indian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, called wampum, composed of shells cut into regular pieces, and strung with a mixture of blue and white. Native of Carolina and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a>, sometimes growing to the length of five feet, and perfectly innocent.\n\nBlue Green Snake.\u2014217 abdominal plates, 122 subcaudal scales. Bright blue green, with a purple tinge on the back, and whitish abdomen. A very beautiful species, about three feet long, harmless, and a native of Surinam.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COACH\">Coach</a>-whip Snake.\u2014Brown, with pale abdomen; very Flagellum. Long and slender, inoffensive, and native of North America. It runs with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> swiftness, in pursuit of flies, &c., and is very easily tamed.\n\nOrnamented Snake.\u2014Habit long, and very slender; Ornatus. Colour jet black, with white flower-shaped spots, and white abdomen. This very elegant species inhabits some of the West India islands, and, according to Seba, is also found in Java and Ceylon.\n\nDomicella Snake.\u2014118 abdominal plates, 60 subcaudal scales. A very elegant and harmless species, of a slender habit, with many jet-black cross bands, and a blackish line on the abdomen. It is alleged that the Indian ladies sometimes carry it in their bosoms.\n\nBoaform\n**Ophiology**\n\n---\n\n**Boaform Snake.**\u2014242 abdominal plates, 62 subcaudal scales. Whitish, with brown variegations; white beneath, with very short scuta, the under part of the tail variegated with black and white. Native of India, and so strong, that it can numb the hand by wreathing round the arm. Its bite, however, is not poisonous.\n\n**Domestic Snake.**\u2014245 abdominal plates, 94 subcaudal scales. Gray, spotted with brown, and a double black spot between the eyes. Native of Barbary, where it is domesticated for the purpose of destroying the smaller noxious animals.\n\n**Fasciolatus.** **Fasciolated Snake.**\u2014192 abdominal plates, 62 subcaudal scales. Cinereous, with whitish cross bands, and glaucous abdomen. Native of India, and not poisonous, as vulgarly believed.\n\n**Lineatus.** **Lineated Snake.**\u2014169 abdominal plates, 84 subcaudal scales. This beautiful and inoffensive species, though subject to considerable variety of aspect, may be generally distinguished by its bluish-green ground, and three or five brown linear stripes, of which that in the middle is broadest. It inhabits several parts of India, and is from two to three feet long.\n\n**Elegant Snake.**\u2014202 abdominal plates, 146 subcaudal scales. Yellowish gray, with three broad reticulated blackish bands, a broad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILLET\">fillet</a> on the abdomen, and the head freckled with brown. Length about two feet; tail very long and narrow. Native of South America. Well figured by Seba.\n\n**Mysteriorum.** **Long-snouted Snake.**\u2014192 abdominal plates, 167 subcaudal scales. Slender, with a sharp-pointed snout; colour grayish green, with a yellow line on each side of the abdomen. About three feet and a half in length, and half an inch in diameter. Native of North America, where it is often seen on trees, running very quickly in pursuit of insects.\n\n**Iridescens Snake.**\u2014163 abdominal plates, 150 subcaudal scales. Tinge blue green, and gilded, accompanied with iridescent hues, with pale abdomen, and black streak across the eyes. From three to four feet long. Native of India, one of the most beautiful of the serpent tribe, and perfectly innocent.\n\nTo exhibit even short definitions of the other species included in the genus *Coluber*, would extend this article to a disproportionate length. Of most of the omitted forts, however, we may observe, that the history is either not particularly interesting, or too little known.\n\n---\n\n**Gen. 4. Hydrus, Water-snake.**\n\nBody slender in front, gradually thickening, scaled; tail compressed.\u2014This is a genus of recent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a>, comprising those species of serpents which naturally inhabit the water.\n\n**Colubrinus.** **Colubrine Hydrus.**\u2014Lead-coloured, with black surrounding bands. Ordinary length about two feet and a half. The fangs are very small in proportion to the size of the animal. It is the *coluber laticeps* (Lin.), and inhabits the American and Indian seas.\n\n**Fasciatus.** **Fasciated Hydrus.**\u2014Long and slender; black, longitudinally marked by yellowish white pointed bands; upwards of two feet in length, poisonous, and native of the Indian seas.\n\n**Spiralis.** **Spiral Hydrus.**\u2014Yellowish, with brown bands; body spirally twisted. A rare and elegant species, thus described by Dr Shaw.\n\n---\n\n**Hydrus.** **Black-backed Hydrus.**\u2014Head oblong, body black above, and yellowish beneath; tail spotted. *Anguis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLATINA\">platina</a>*, Lin. Native of the Indian seas, and common about the coasts of Otaheite, where it is used as an article of food.\n\n**Great Hydrus.**\u2014Livid, with brown bands, and hexagonal scales abruptly carinated. Upwards of three feet long. Native of the Indian seas. Its habits little known.\n\nThe other hydrus are, *capensis*, *gracilis*, *caruleocephalus*, *curtus*, *atrocaruleus*, *cinereus*, *pictor*, and *palustris*.\n\n---\n\n**Gen. 5. Langaya.**\n\nAbdominal plates, caudal rings, and terminal scales.\n\nThere is only one species known, viz.\n\n**Langaya.**\u2014184 abdominal plates, 42 caudal rings; but these numbers are subject to vary. Length between two and three feet, and diameter about seven lines, in the thickest part of the body. Colour of the upper parts reddish, or violet, of the under parts pale or whitish. Teeth like those of the viper. Native of Madagascar, where it is much dreaded.\n\n---\n\n**Gen. 6. Acrochordus.**\n\nBody completely covered with warts.\n\n**Javan Acrochordus.**\u2014This reptile was discovered in Java.\nAcrochordus. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a> field, in the island of Java, in 1754. It measured eight feet in length, and 10 inches in diameter, in the thickest part of the body. It was blackish above, whitish beneath, and marked by dusky spots on the sides. Five young ones, full formed, and each nine inches long, were found in the belly. The Chinese esteem it as a food.\n\nThe dubius and fasciatus are so nearly allied to the preceding, that they may be regarded only as varieties.\n\nGen. 7. Anguis, Slow-worm.\n\nFurnished with abdominal and subcaudal scales. Conformation resembling that of some of the lizard tribes, the body being composed of a series of moveable rings, which are easily broken and easily reproduced. A very harmless, and rather sluggish genus.\n\nCommon Slow-worm, Blind-worm, or Long Cripple.\u2014135 abdominal, and the same number of subcaudal scales. Black, yellowish ash, or rufous gray; belly black, sides streaked with black and white, tail long and obtuse, scales small, soft, and compact. The colouring is subject to considerable variety. Length, from 10 to 12 inches, or more. Common in Europe and Siberia, frequenting hollow ways, woods, paths, rubbish, &c. Viviparous, subject to hibernation, living on worms and insects, and perfectly innocuous. It is observed of this species, as well as of some others, that, if struck with any degree of violence, the body not only breaks abruptly on the struck part, but even sometimes, at different places, and that the fragments will live a long while afterwards. Though of very gentle dispositions, the blind worm, like many of the family of serpents, refuses to eat in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a>, unless it is tamed. M. Daudin mentions that he kept one two months and a half, during all which time it constantly refused nourishment of every kind.\u2014It is preyed on by various birds, hedgehogs, snakes, frogs, and toads.\n\nAccording to Dr Shaw, the Blue-bellied Snake, or Aberdeen Slow-worm (A. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERYX\">Eryx</a> Lin.) is only a variety of the Fragilis. It occurs in Scotland and North America.\n\nPainted Slow-worm.\u2014240 abdominal, and 13 subcaudal scales. Varies much in colour, but is generally orange, with black blotches; sometimes black and white, sometimes pale rose and black, paler beneath, and elegantly fasciated with bars of deep black. Native of South America, particularly of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAYENNE\">Cayenne</a> and Surinam. In preserved specimens, the orange hue is very apt to fade into white.\n\nCoral Slow-worm.\u2014Ground colour pale red, with coral red variegations. A very beautiful species, native of Brazil.\n\nGlass Slow-worm.\u2014127 abdominal, 228 subcaudal scales. Blackish green, speckled with yellow, with a very short yellow abdomen, a deep furrow on each side of the body, from the corners of the mouth to the vent, and a tail more than twice the length of the abdomen. Native of North America, and not uncommon in Carolina, where it is called the Glass Snake. 'A small blow of a stick,' says Catesby, 'causes the body to separate, not only at the place struck, but at two or three other places, the muscles being articulated quite through the vertebrae.'\n\nSnouted Slow-worm.\u2014218 abdominal, and 12 subcaudal scales. Greenish black above, yellow beneath, snout elongated, tail terminating in a horny tip. Length about a foot. Native of Surinam.\n\nJamaica Slow-worm, or Silver Snake.\u2014Pale brown, with a silvery gloss on the scales; the body, which rarely exceeds fifteen inches in length, gradually thickening, and the tail abruptly subacuminate.\n\nThe other species are, Meleagris, Alter, Maculata, Leucomelas, Rufa, Reticulata, and Chiviea.\n\nGen. 8. Amphibena.\n\nBody nearly cylindrical, with annular divisions round the body and tail. The skin divided in a longitudinal direction, by straight lines, forming with the wings so many square or parallelogrammic scales. A harmless and oviparous genus, native of the warmer regions of the new world, and not of Ceylon, as Seba has erroneously asserted.\n\nWhite Amphibena.\u2014223 abdominal, and 16 caudal, scaly rings. Pale white, verging on yellowish, and unspotted. Two feet or more in length, and of a considerable proportionate thickness. Is found in woods, in Surinam, &c. where it preys chiefly on insects and worms.\n\nFuliginous Amphibena.\u2014200 abdominal, and 30 fuliginosa caudal, scaly rings. Differs from the preceding chiefly by its black and white variegations. Common in Cayenne, Surinam, and Brazil; but Linnaeus, and other naturalists, misled by Seba, have falsely represented it as a native of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBYA\">Libya</a>, the island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEMNOS\">Lemnos</a>, &c.\n\nGen. 9. Caecilia.\n\nBody cylindrical, wrinkles on the sides of the body and tail.\n\nEel-shaped Caecilia.\u2014Anguilliform, with distant wrinkles, and a very small cirrus beneath each nostril. The skin of the whole body, when closely inspected, is found to be covered with very minute granules. About 18 inches long, native of South America, and destitute of poison fangs.\n\nWhite-sided Caecilia.\u2014340 wrinkles on the body, 10 Glaucostoma on the tail. Brown, with very close wrinkles, and a whitish lateral line. Native of South America.\n\nSlender-Caecilia.\u2014Brown, shaped like an earthworm, nearly 14 inches long, and one fifth of an inch in diameter. The upper jaw is longer than the lower, and the teeth are so small, as not to be distinctly visible.\n\nWe cannot close our descriptive catalogue of the serpent tribe, without remarking, that the subject still requires elucidation; that the Linnean characters are not always to be strictly interpreted; and that several species appear to have been overlooked, merely because the number of their scales could not be ascertained.\n\nMiscellaneous Observations.\n\nThe formidable aspect of some serpents, and the poisonous qualities of others, have probably inspired mankind, in every age, with sentiments of terror and awe. In the rude periods of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, fear is akin to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>, and Bartram informs us, that the rattlesnake is worshipped by several of the savage tribes in North America. On the\nThe Gold and Slave coasts, a stranger, on entering the cottages of the natives, is often surprized to see the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> swarming with serpents, that cling there without molesting, and unmolested by, the natives. But his surprize will increase as he advances farther southward, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of Widah, when he finds that a serpent is the god of the country. This animal, which travellers describe as a huge overgrown creature, has its habitation, its temple, and its priests. These last impress the vulgar with an opinion of its virtues; and numbers are daily seen to offer, not only their goods, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, and prayers, but even their wives and daughters, at the shrine of their hideous deity. The priests readily accept the proffered females, and after some days of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENANCE\">penance</a>, return them to their supplicants, much benefited by the serpent's supposed embraces.\n\nThe ancients seem to have been aware, that certain species of serpents were attracted by musical sounds, and have celebrated the Pythi and Marsi,\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">Ad</a> quorum canus mitis jacure ceratiae.\n\nAt this day, there are jugglers in India, who train snakes to move and gesticulate to the sound of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUTE\">flute</a>; and we have already mentioned, that they tame the Cobra de Capello, and exhibit it to the populace. When the snake-man first provokes the creature to attack him, he covers his hand with an earthen jar, which he uses as a shield, and thus hurts the animal's mouth, and knocks it backwards, whenever it attempts to bite. He continues this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> for an hour, or longer, taking care, however, not to fatigue the snake too much, nor to hurt it so as to deter it from returning to the attack. Thus, the animal is gradually taught to raise itself, on presenting a jar, a stick, or even the bare hand, the motions of which it follows with its head, without daring to bite, lest it should again wound its mouth. The juggler accompanies this exercise with fingering, so that what is really a defensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> on the part of the serpent, has the appearance of a dance. To render this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> less dangerous, the fangs are sometimes removed; but more frequently the snake is deprived of its poison, by being daily irritated to bite on a piece of cloth, or any soft fleshy substance; nay, they have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> and courage to press its head, and thus provoke it, while biting, to make it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> the cloth with greater violence, and more effectually express its poison.\n\nThe Egyptian enchanters, however, appear to have recourse to more ingenious and mysterious artifices. \"They take the most poisonous vipers,\" says Haffelquilt, \"with their bare hands, play with them, put them in their bosoms, and use a great many more tricks with them, as I have often seen. I have frequently seen them handle those that were three or four feet long, and of the most horrid form. I inquired and examined if they had cut out the viper's poisonous teeth; but I have with my own eyes seen they do not. We may, therefore, conclude, that there are to this day Pythi in Egypt; but what art they use is not easily known. Some people are very superstitious, and the generality believe this to be done by some supernatural art which they obtain from invisible beings. I do not know whether their power is to be ascribed to good or evil; but I am persuaded that those who undertake it use many superstitions.\n\n\"The circumstances relating to the fascination of serpents in Egypt, related to me,\" he continues, \"were principally, 1. That the art is only known to certain families, who propagate it to their offspring. 2. The person who knows how to fascinate serpents, never meddles with other poisonous animals, such as scorpions, lizards, &c. There are different persons who know how to fascinate these animals; and they again never meddle with serpents. 3. Those that fascinate serpents, eat them both raw and boiled, and even make broth of them, which they eat very commonly amongst them; but in particular, they eat such a dish when they go out to catch them. I have been told, that serpents fried or boiled are frequently eaten by the Arabians both in Egypt and Arabia, though they know not how to fascinate them, but catch them either alive or dead. 4. After they have eaten their soup, they procure a blessing from their sheik (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> or lawyer), who uses some superstitious ceremonies, and amongst others, spits on them several times with certain gestures. This manner of getting a blessing from the priest is pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, and certainly cannot in the least help to fascinate serpents; but they believe, or at least persuade others, that the power of fascinating serpents depends upon this circumstance.\"\n\nOn this subject, the celebrated Mr Bruce in his travels to discover the source of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a>, is also minute and explicit. Among other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a>, we shall be content to quote the following.\n\n\"I will not hesitate to aver, that I have seen at Cairo (and this may be seen daily without trouble or expense) a man who came from above the catacombs, where the pits of the mummy birds are kept, who has taken a ceraite with his naked hand from a number of others lying at the bottom of the tub, has put it upon his bare head, covered it with the common red <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a> he wears, then taken it out, put it in his breast, and tied it about his neck like a necklace; after which it has been applied to a hen, and bit it, which has died in a few minutes; and to complete the experiment, the man has taken it by the neck and beginning at his tail, has eaten it as one would do a carrot or a stock of celery, without any feeling repugnance.\"\n\n\"I can myself vouch, that all the black people in the kingdom of Sennar, whether Funge or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUBA\">Nuba</a>, are perfectly armed against the bite of either scorpion or viper. They take the ceraites in their hands at all times, put them in their bosoms, and throw them to one another, as children do apples or balls, without having irritated them, by this usage, to much as to bite. The Arabs have not this secret naturally; but from their infancy they acquire an exemption from the mortal consequences attending the bite of these animals, by chewing a certain root, and washing themselves (it is not anointing) with an infusion of certain plants in water.\"\n\nThe testimony of Savary is not less precise. At the feast of Sidi Ibrahim, he saw a troop of people, seemingly possessed, with naked arms and fierce looks, holding in their hands enormous serpents, which twined round their body, and endeavoured to escape. But these enchanters avoided the bite, by grasping the animals strongly by the neck, then tore them with their teeth, and ate them alive, while the blood streamed from their mouth.\nThe circumstance of seizing them fast by the neck, accords with the concluding part of the ensuing relation of Demon.\n\n\"Having been always curious to observe the means by which some men command the opinions of others, I regretted that I was not at Rofetta, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESSION\">procession</a> of the feast of Ibrahim, in which the convulsions of the Plylli form the most entertaining part, to the populace, of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>. To make up for my loss, I addressed myself to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of the fest, who was keeper of the Okel or tavern of the Franks; I flattered him; and he promised to make me a spectator of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXALTATION\">exaltation</a> of one of the Plylli, as soon as he should have inspired him. From my curiosity he thought I was likely to become a proselyte, and he proposed to initiate me, which I accepted; but when I learned that in the ceremony of initiation, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> spits in the mouth of the neophyte, this circumstance cooled my ardour, and I found that I could not prevail on myself to submit to such a point of probation. I therefore gave my money to the chief, and the high priest promised to let me see one of the inspired.\n\n\"They had brought with them some serpents, which they let loose from a large leather sack in which they were kept, and by irritation made them erect their bodies, and hiss. I remarked that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> was the principal cause of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a>; for as soon as they were returned into the sack, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> ceased, and they no longer endeavoured to bite. They had a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, which was that when angry, the neck for six inches below the head was dilated to the size of one's hand. I soon saw, that I had no greater reason to dread the bite of these serpents than their masters had; for having well remarked that the Plylli, while they were threatening the animal with one hand, seized it on the back of the head with the other, I did the same with one of the serpents with equal success, though much to the indignation of these mysterious quacks.\"\n\nWe have likewise heard of people in Europe who allowed themselves to be bitten by vipers, with impunity, to the great astonishment of the spectators. They first made the animal eat of a prepared paste, which closed the apertures in the fangs, and thus prevented the discharge of the poison.\n\nVarious and contradictory opinions, conjectures, and fictions, have been advanced relative to the nature, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, and cure of serpentine poison. Among the vulgar errors connected with this subject, we may reckon the sting fixed in the serpent's tail, and the flowing of venom from the black forked tongue, and from the teeth in general.\n\nTowards the end of the 17th century, Ferdinand II. Grand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUSCANY\">Tuscany</a>, invited Steno, Redi, and some other eminent men of science, to his court, with a view to investigate the history of this important phenomenon in the animal economy. Redi, in particular, instituted a great variety of experiments, and arrived at some useful discoveries. When he either caused a living viper to bite a dog, or wounded the latter with the teeth of one newly dead, the event was the same. If the bite was repeated, its effect became weaker, and, at length was lost, the poison contained in the vehicle being exhausted. He observed, that when the teeth of serpents were extended to bite, they were moistened over with a certain liquor, and that when the vehicle at the base of the fangs was pressed, a drop of poison flowed to the point of the fang. When the poison thus flowing from the vehicle was received in soft bread, or a sponge, an animal bitten by the serpent received no more harm from the wound than from the pinch of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a>, till after a few days, when the venom was secreted afresh; but when an animal was wounded with the point of a needle dipped in the poison, it was tormented with the same pains as if it had been bitten by the viper itself. Having preserved some of this poison in a glass, and totally evaporated the moisture in the sun, when the residuum was diluted with water, Redi found, to his great surprise, that it had the same effect as when recent. But the boldness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a> Sozzi, a viper charmer, excited the astonishment of the learned. As they happened in the prince's presence to talk of the certain death which would attend the swallowing of viperine poison, Sozzi, confiding in his art, drank a considerable portion of it without hesitation, and with the same safety as if he had drunk so much water. This result, which so much startled the grand duke and his philosophical associates, was not unknown to the ancients, as may be inferred from these lines in Lucan:\n\nNoxia serpantium est admitto sanguine pefiri:\nMorfu virus habent et fatum dente minantur,\nPocula morte carent.\n\nThe ingenious and indefatigable Fontana made no fewer than 6000 experiments on this interesting subject. Of these, our limits will not permit us to enumerate the results. In consequence, however, of his multiplied and persevering researches, we are enabled to state, that this poison is not fatal to all animals; that it kills neither vipers, snakes, blind-worms, snails, nor leeches; that it acts very slightly on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TORTOISES\">tortoises</a>; that it is neither an acid nor an alkali; that it has no determined flavour, and that it leaves the mouth merely a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> of astringency and stinging. It long retains its virulence in the cavity of the tooth, whether the latter be separated or not from its socket; but when dried and kept in an exposed situation, it loses its deleterious qualities in less than a year. Hence the propriety of caution in examining vipers that are handled or preserved in spirits, and in making use of clothes that have been bitten by them. Fontana has also proved that the poison of the viper is not uniformly fatal except to very small animals, and that it is more dangerous to the larger sorts, according to the quantity of virus secreted, the frequency of the bites, the different parts of the body on which they have been inflicted, and probably also, the higher temperature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. A sparrow dies in five or eight minutes, a pigeon in eight or twelve, a cat sometimes recovers, and a sheep very often; so that a man has little reason to dread the consequences of a single bite in the climate of Italy, and still less so in France or Great Britain. The hundredth part of a grain of poison applied to a mulete will kill a sparrow, whereas six times that quantity are required to kill a pigeon. According to this estimate, about three grains should prove fatal to a man, and 12 to an ox. But the vehicles of an ordinarily sized viper seldom contain more than two grains of poison, and even that quantity is not exhausted till after repeated bites. The poison is of a gummy consistency, and seems to act by destroying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a> of the muscular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIBRE\">fibre</a>,\nfibres, and introducing into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> a principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a>. It may be swallowed with impunity, provided there be no wound in the mouth; but if introduced into the blood, the most violent and convulsive agonies ensue, the fangiferous system becoming coagulated, and the whole animal frame relaxed. Hence, powerful fudorifics, as the flesh of the viper itself, of snakes and lizards, which contain a large proportion of ammoniacal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>, the volatile alkali, and its various preparations, with numerous plants which excite copious perspiration, have been recommended, and often successfully used as antidotes, especially when their exhibition has been preceded by a tight ligature immediately above the wound, and by scarification and caustics.\n\nOn the effects and cure of the poison of snakes, some valuable observations and reflections occur in Dr Ruffell's splendid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> on Indian serpents. The judicious author remarks, that when the poison is applied to brute animals, its progress is often so rapid as hardly to leave time for the operation of medicine, or the application of any means whatever, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> of success. When the progress is slower, should the remedy be administered before unequivocal symptoms have removed all doubt of the poison having taken effect, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> may be ascribed to the medicine given, whilst, in reality, no malady existed; and if deferred till doubts are removed, the remedy which, if applied in time might have proved efficacious, may be unjustly regarded as useless. Besides, it is well known that a bite of the most noxious snake does not instantly prove fatal, and that even some of the more tender animals, without the use of any remedy, recover in cases where the symptoms are apparently very formidable. These symptoms, in the bodies of different animals are very much alike, and proceed nearly in the same order of progression, though with different degrees of rapidity.\n\nThe American Indians either suck the wound, or apply to it chewed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>, or make several incisions around it, which they fill with gunpowder, and then fire it off. During the progress of the cure they have likewise recourse to several pounded and bruised plants, as to some of the species of *Lactuca*, the root of *Prenanthes alba*, the stems and leaves of a species of *Helianthus*, and in desperate cases the radical bark of the tulip-tree. In general they are partial to the use of the syngeneous plants, and to the bark of the trunk and roots of various trees.\n\nThe experiments of Bernard de Jussieu, Lebeau, Sonnini, and Boof, seem to have established that, of all known remedies for the bite of the viper and the rattlesnake, the most efficacious are, the volatile alkali, or *eau de luce*, with suction and scarification of the recent wound.\n\nIn addition to these methods of cure, we shall quote the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESCRIPTION\">prescription</a> of Dr Mofeley, who spent 12 years in the West Indies.\n\n\"The bites and stings of all venomous animals are cured by the same local means, which are very simple if they were always at hand. The injured part must be instantly destroyed or cut out. Destroying it is the most safe, and equally certain; and the best application for that purpose is the *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAPIS\">lapis</a> infernalis*, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a>. These are preferable to a hot iron which the ancients used, because a hot iron forms a crust, which acts as a defence to the under parts instead of destroying them. The *lapis infernalis* is much better than any other, as it melts and penetrates during its application. The bitten part must be destroyed to the bottom, and where there is any doubt that the bottom of the wound is not sufficiently exposed, butter of antimony should be introduced to it on the following day, as deep as possible; and incisions should be made to lay every part open to the action of these applications. Besides destroying, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> out the part, incisions should be made round the wound, to prevent the communication of the virus. The wound is to be dried for some time with poultices, to affix the inflammation caused by the caustics; and afterwards with acid dressings and hot digestives to drain the injured parts.\n\n\"Where the above-mentioned caustics cannot be procured, corrosive sublimate, oil of vitriol, aquafortis, spirit of salt, common caustic, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a> made of quicklime and soap, may be applied to the wound. Gunpowder laid on the part and fired, has been used with success. When a person is bitten remote from any assistance, he should make a tight ligature above the part until proper application can be made. The Spanish writers say, that the *habilla de Cartagena*, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARTHAGENA\">Carthagena</a> bean, is a specific for poisonous bites taken inwardly.\n\nDr Mofeley then proceeds to state the ample testimony of Ulloa in favour of this bean, which is found in great abundance in the West India islands, under the name of *antidote* or *cocoon antidote*. \"I have been informed (adds he) by some intelligent Indians, that any of the red peppers, such as bird pepper or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELL\">bell</a> pepper, or what is called *Cayenne pepper*, powdered, and taken in a glass of rum, as much as the stomach can possibly bear, so as to cause and keep up for some time great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> and inflammation in the body, and a vigorous circulation, will stop the progress of the poison of serpents, even after its effects are visible; and that the bitten part only afterwards mortifies and separates, and that the patient, with bark, wine, and cordials, soon recovers.\"\n\nThe naturalist who collects serpents for the purpose of preserving them in his cabinet, should have recourse to various precautions, which, though several of them are sufficiently obvious, are, at the same time, too often neglected. In general the hurtful parts are caught with the greatest safety and dexterity by natives of the country in which they abound. The want of the head in many of the larger stuffed specimens from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUIANA\">Guiana</a>, &c., renders them of little value in a scientific point of view, and is the result of superfluous trouble to travellers who send them to Europe in this mutilated condition. Collectors, therefore, should carefully instruct their agents to preserve this part of the animal. As these larger specimens cannot easily be prepared without an incision in the skin, it will be of consequence to make this incision on the side, beginning at the termination of the plates, and not cutting across them, as is too often done, to the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> of distinct classification. When the skin is once stripped, it may be carefully rolled up, up, and stuffed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> room in the usual manner.\n\nThe smaller species of serpents may be kept in prepared spirits. Pure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALCOHOL\">alcohol</a> and spirituous liquors, especially when not reduced by water, frequently affect the\nmost brilliant animal colours. Thus, in the ordinary cabinet liquors, the fine red of the haemachate snake degenerates into a dark brown, scales of a bright green or blue become somewhat pale, yellow always whitens, and orange changes to red or pale. White, brown, black, purple, mother of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEARL\">pearl</a>, and metal-coloured scales are not liable to change. The following is an approved recipe for preserving the various colours of serpents entire.\n\nTake very pure spring water, saturate it with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>, then mix with it about one-fifth of its bulk of very limpid spirit of wine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> the mixture through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> strainer, and keep the liquor well corked up in bottles, in some cool and shady situation. Immerse the animal which you wish to preserve in a vessel filled with this liquor, and allow it to remain in it 24 hours. The vessel and its included liquor should be reserved for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> process. Then remove the reptile into a cylindrical vessel of fine glass, filled to three-fourths of its height with the liquor above described, and closed with a glass cover. Lute the latter with mastic and hogs grease; put the vessel on a shelf that is sheltered from heat and the solar rays; and at the end of two months, if the mastic be dry, and you with the jar to remain closed, paint the luting with an oil colour; but if you intend to open it frequently, use only the hogs grease.\n\nReptiles may also be conveniently preserved according to the method indicated by Chaufler, in the Bulletin des Sciences, (for Prairial, year 10, No. 63.), without the previous trouble of preparing the skin. All that is required, is to stuff the cavities with cotton, and to immerse the body in distilled water, saturated with super-oxygenated muriate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>; and when it has sufficiently imbibed the saline solution in all its parts, to allow it to dry slowly in a well aired situation, screened from the sun and dust. All the parts of the animal harden, and are thus defended from the voracity of insects, and corruption of every kind.","sp":153,"ep":170},{"h":"OPHIOMANCY","t":"in antiquity, the art of making predictions from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a>.

He admits, however, that means may be found for rendering the air's resistance to light <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>; and he seems to have thought of the very means which occurred for this purpose to M. de Saufure.\n\nThat eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, wishing to ascertain the transparency of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, by measuring the distances at which determined objects cease to be visible, perceived at once that his end would be attained, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he should find objects of which the disappearance might be accurately determined. Accordingly, after many trials, he found that the moment of disappearance can be observed with much greater accuracy when a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> is placed on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> ground, than when a white object is placed on a black ground; that the accuracy was still greater when the observation was made in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> than in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>; and that even a still greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of accuracy was obtained, when the white space surrounding a black circle, was itself surrounded by a circle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> ground of a dark <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. This last circumstance was particularly remarkable, and an observation quite new.\n\nIf a circle totally black, of about two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> in diameter, be fastened on the middle of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> sheet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> or pasteboard, and if this paper or pasteboard be placed in such a manner as to be exposed fully to the light of the sun, if you then approach it at the distance of three or four feet, and afterwards gradually recede from it, keeping your eye constantly directed towards the black circle, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> appear always to decrease in size the farther you retire from it, and at the distance of 33 or 34 feet will have the appearance of a point. If you continue still to recede, you will see it again enlarge itself; and it will seem to form a kind of cloud, the darkness of which decreases more and more according as the circumference becomes enlarged. The cloud will appear still to increase in size the farther you remove from it; but at length it will totally disappear. The moment of the disappearance, however, cannot be accurately ascertained; and the more experiments were repeated the more were the results different.\n\nM. de Saufure, having reflected for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> on the means of remedying this inconvenience, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> clearly, that, as long as this cloud took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> accuracy could be obtained; and he discovered that it appeared <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRAST\">contrast</a> formed by the white parts which were at the greatest distance from the black circle. He thence concluded, that if the ground was left white near this circle, and the parts of the pasteboard at the greatest distance from it were covered with a dark colour, the cloud would no longer be visible, or at least almost totally disappear.\n\nThis conjecture was confirmed by experiment. M. de Saufure left a white space around the black circle equal in breadth to its diameter, by placing a circle of black paper a line in diameter on the middle of a white circle three lines in diameter, so that the black circle was only surrounded by a white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> a line in breadth. The whole was pasted upon a green ground. A green colour was chosen, because it was dark enough to make the cloud disappear, and the easiest to be procured.\n\nThe black circle, surrounded in this manner with white on a green ground, disappeared at a much less distance than when it was on a white ground of a large size.\n\nIf a perfectly black circle, a line in diameter, be pasted on the middle of a white ground exposed to the open light, it may be observed at the distance of from 44 to 45 feet; but if this circle be surrounded by a white ring a line in breadth, while the rest of the ground is green, all sight of it is lost at the distance of only 15 feet.\n\nAccording to these principles M. de Saufure delineated several black circles, the diameters of which increased in a geometrical progression; the exponent of which was 3. His smallest circle was \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) or 0.2 of a line in diameter; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> 0.3; the third, 0.45; and so on to the sixteenth, which was 87.527, or about 7 inches 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) lines. Each of these circles was surrounded by a white ring, the breadth of which was equal to the diameter of the circle, and the whole was pasted on a green ground.\n\nM. de Saufure, for his experiments, selected a straight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> of about 1200 or 1500 feet in circumference, which towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> was bounded by trees or an ascent. Those who repeat them, however, must pay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the following remarks: When a person retires backwards, keeping his eye constantly fixed on the pasteboard, the eye becomes fatigued, and soon ceases to perceive the circle; as soon therefore as it ceases to be distinguishable, you must suffer your eyes to rest; not, however, by shutting them, for they would when again opened be dazzled by the light, but by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> them gradually to some less illuminated object in the horizon. When you have done this for about half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, and again directed your eyes to the pasteboard, the circle will be again visible, and you must continue to recede till it disappear once more. You must then let your eyes rest a second time in order to look at the circle again, and continue in this manner till the circle becomes actually invisible.\n\nIf you wish to find an accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> for the want of transparency, you must employ a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of circles, the diameters of which increase according to a certain progression; and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of the distances at which they disappear will give the law according to which the transparency of the atmosphere decreases at different distances. If you wish to compare the transparency of the atmosphere on two days, or in two different places, two circles will be sufficient for the experiment.\n\nAccording to these principles, M. de Saufure caused to be prepared a piece of white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> cloth eight feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>. In the middle of this square he sewed a perfect circle, two feet in diameter, of beautiful black <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>; around this circle he left a white ring two feet in breadth, and the rest of the square was covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> green. In the like manner, and of the same materials, he prepared another square; which was, however, equal to only \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the size of the former, so that each side of it was 8 inches; the black circle in the middle was two inches in diameter, and the white space around the circle was 2 inches also.\n\nIf two squares of this kind be suspended vertically\nApparatus and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to each other, so that they may be both illuminated in an equal degree by the sun; and if the atmosphere, at the moment when the experiment is made, be perfectly transparent, the circle of the large square, which is twelve times the size of the other, must be seen at twelve times the distance. In M. de Saufure's experiments the small circle disappeared at the distance of 314 feet, and the large one at the distance of 3588 feet, whereas it should have disappeared at the distance of 3768. The atmosphere, therefore, was not perfectly transparent. This arose from the thin vapors which at that time were floating in it. M. de Saufure calls his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> a daphanometer; but it serves one of the purposes of a photometer.\n\nFrom a number of experiments made with the photometer, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">Count</a> Rumford found, that, by passing through a pane of fine, clear, well polished glass, such as is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a>-glasses, light loses \\( \\frac{1}{973} \\) of its whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, i.e., of the quantity which impinges on the glass; that when light is made to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through two panes of such glass standing parallel, but not touching each other, the loss is \\( \\frac{1}{3184} \\) of the whole; and that in passing through a very thin, clear, colourless pane of window-glass, the loss is only \\( \\frac{1}{1263} \\). Hence he infers, that this apparatus might be very usefully employed by the optician, to determine the degree of transparency of glass, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> his choice in the provision of that important article of his trade. The loss of light when reflected from the very best plain glass mirror, the author ascertained, by five experiments, to be \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the whole which fell upon the mirror.\n\nAn ingenious photometer has also been invented by Professor Leslie, and fully described in his celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">Heat</a>, to which we must refer the reader for a complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of this instrument. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> the calorific effect of heat, and is founded upon this principle, \"that if a body be exposed to the sun's rays, it will, in every possible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, be found to indicate a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of heat exactly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the quantity of light which it has absorbed.\" See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on Heat, p. 103.\n\n**CHAP. II. On the method of forming the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENS\">Lens</a> and Specula, of Refracting and Reflecting Telescopes.**\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. I. On the Method of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> and polishing Lenses.**\n\nHaving fixed upon the proper aperture and focal distance of the lens, take a piece of sheet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, and strike a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> upon its surface, with a radius equal to half that distance, if it is to be plano-convex, and let the length of this arch be a little greater than the given aperture. Remove with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILE\">file</a> that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the copper which is without the circular arch, and a convex gage will be formed. Strike another arch with the same radius, and having removed that part of the copper which is within it, a concave gage will be obtained. Prepare of the two circular plates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, about \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of an inch thick, and half an inch greater in diameter than the breadth of the lens, and folder them upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> of the same diameter, and about an inch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>. These formation tools are then to be fixed upon a turning lathe, and one of them turned into a portion of a concave sphere, so as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> the convex gage; and the other into a portion of a convex sphere, so as to answer the concave gage. After the surfaces of the brass plates are turned as accurately as possible, they must be ground upon one another, alternately, with flour <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMERY\">emery</a>; and when the two surfaces exactly coincide, the grinding tools will be ready for use.\n\nProcure a piece of glass whose dispersive power is as small as possible, if the lens is not for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACHROMATIC\">achromatic</a> instruments, and whose surfaces are parallel; and by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of large feelers or pincers, cut it into a circular shape, so that its diameter may be a little greater than the required aperture of the lens. When the roughness is removed from its edges by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> grindstone (A), it is to be fixed with black pitch to a wooden handle of a smaller diameter than the glass, and about an inch high, so that the centre of the handle may exactly coincide with the centre of the glass.\n\nThe glass being thus prepared, it is then to be ground with fine emery upon the concave tool, if it is to be convex, and upon the convex tool, if it is to be concave. To avoid circumlocution, we shall suppose that the lens is to be convex. The concave tool, therefore, which is to be used, must be firmly fixed to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENCH\">bench</a>, and the glass wrought upon it with circular strokes, so that its centre may never go beyond the edges of the tool. For every 6 circular strokes, the glass should receive 2 or 3 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> ones along the diameter of the tool, and in different directions. When the glass has received its proper shape, and touches the tool in every point of its surface, which may be easily known by inspection, the emery is to be washed away, and finer kinds (B) successively substituted in its room, till by the same alternation of circular and transverse strokes, all the scratches and imperfections are removed from its surface. After the finest emery has been used, the roughness which remains may be taken away, and a slight polish superinduced by grinding the glass with pounded pumice-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, in the same manner as before. While the operation of grinding is going on, the convex tool should, at the end of every five\n\n(A) When the focal distance of the lens is to be short, the surface of the piece of glass should be ground upon a common grindstone, so as to suit the gage as nearly as possible; and the plates of brass, before they are foldered on the lead, should be hammered as truly as they can be done into their proper form. By this means much labour will be saved both in turning and grinding.\n\n(B) Emery of different degrees of fineness may be made in the following manner. Take five or six clean vessels, and having filled one of them with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, put into it a considerable quantity of flour emery. Stir it well with a piece of wood, and after standing for 5 seconds pour the water into the second vessel. After it has stood about 12 seconds, pour it out of this into a third vessel, and so on with the rest; and at the bottom of each vessel will be found emery of different degrees of fineness, the coarsest being in the first vessel, and the finest in the last.\nMethod of five minutes, be wrought upon the concave one for a few seconds, in order to preserve the same curvature to the polishing tools and the glass. When one side is finished off with the pumice-stone, the lens must be separated from its handle by inserting the point of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a> between it and the pitch, and giving it a gentle stroke. The pitch which remains upon the glass may be removed by rubbing it with a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, or spirits of wine; and after the ground side of the glass is fixed upon the handle, the other surface is to be wrought and finished in the very same manner.\n\nWhen the glass is thus brought into its proper form, the next and the most difficult part of the operation is to give it a fine polish. The best, though not the simplest way of doing this, is to cover the concave tool with a layer of pitch, hardened by the addition of a little rosin, to the thickness of one-fifteenth of an inch. Then having taken a piece of thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> paper, press it upon the surface of the pitch with the convex tool, and pull the paper quickly from the pitch before it has adhered to it; and if the surface of the pitch is marked everywhere with the lines of the paper, it will be truly spherical, having coincided exactly with the surface of the convex tool. If any paper remains on the surface of the pitch, it may be removed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a> and water; and if the marks of the paper should not appear on every part of it, the operation must be repeated till the polisher, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of pitch, is accurately spherical. The glass is then to be brought on the polisher by circular and cross strokes, with the oxide of tin, called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTTY\">putty</a> in the shops, or with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> oxide of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, otherwise called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLCOTHAR\">colcothar</a> of vitriol, till it has received on both sides a complete polish (c). The polishing will advance slowly at first, but will proceed rapidly when the polisher becomes warm with the friction. When it is nearly finished, no more putty or water should be put upon the polisher, which should be kept warm by breathing upon it; and if the glass moves with difficulty from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADHESION\">adhesion</a> to the tool, it should be quickly removed, lest it spoil the surface of the pitch. When any particles of dust or pitch infuse themselves between the glass and the polisher, which may be easily known from the very unpleasant manner of working, they should be carefully removed, by washing both the polisher and the glass, otherwise the lens will be scratched, and the bed of pitch materially injured.\n\nThe operation of polishing may also be performed by covering the layer of pitch with a piece of cloth, and giving it a spherical form by pressing it with the convex tool when the pitch is warm. The glass is wrought as formerly, upon the surface of the cloth, with putty or colcothar of vitriol, till a sufficient polish is induced. By this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> the operation is slower, and the polish less perfect; though it is best fitted for those who have but little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, and would therefore be apt to injure the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of the lens by polishing it on a bed of pitch.\n\n(c) As colcothar of vitriol is obtained by the decomposition of martial vitriol, it sometimes retains a portion of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>. When this portion of martial vitriol is decomposed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> in water, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> ochre which results penetrates the glass, forms an incrustation upon its surface, and gives it a dull and yellowish tinge, which is communicated to the image which it forms.\n\n(d) The finest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> which we have met with in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, is to be found at Roxburgh castle, in the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KELSO\">Kelso</a>.\n\nIn this manner the small lenses of simple and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> microscopes, the eye-glasses and the object-glasses of telescopes, are to be ground. In grinding concave lenses, Mr Imison* employs leaden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> with the same radius as the curvature of the lens, and with their circumferences as the convexity of the lens is to be concave. These spherical zones are fixed upon a turning lathe, and the lens, which is held steadily in Improperly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, is ground upon them with emery, while they are revolving on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINDLE\">spindle</a> of the lathe. In the same way convex lenses may be ground and polished, by fixing the concave tool upon the lathe; but these methods, however simple and expeditious they may be, should never be adopted for forming the lenses of optical instruments, where an accurate spherical figure is indispensible. It is by the hand alone that we can perform with accuracy those circular and transverse strokes, the proper union of which is essential to the production of a spherical surface. Appendix to Ferguson's Lectures, vol. ii. p. 452.\n\nSect. II. On the Method of Casting, Grinding, and Polishing the Specula of Reflecting Telescopes.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> of reflecting telescopes are generally composed of 32 parts of copper, and 15 of grain tin, of the metal with the addition of two parts of arsenic, to render the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> more white and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a>. The Reverend Mr Edwards found, from a variety of experiments, that if one part of brass, and one of silver, be added to the preceding composition, and only one part of arsenic used, a most excellent metal will be obtained, which is the whitest, hardest, and most reflective, that he ever met with. The superiority of this composition, indeed, has been completely evinced by the excellence of Mr Edwards' telescopes, which excel other reflectors in brightness and distinctness, and show objects in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> colours. But as metals of this composition are extremely difficult to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>, as well as to grind and polish, it will be better for those who are inexperienced in the art, to employ the composition first mentioned.\n\nAfter the flasks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> (d) are prepared, and a mould made for the metal by means of a wooden or metallic pattern, so that its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> may be downwards, and a few small holes left in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> at its back, for the free escape of the included air\u2014melt the copper in a crucible by itself, and when it is reduced to a fluid state, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUSE\">fuse</a> the tin in a separate crucible, and mix it with the melted copper, by stirring them together with a wooden spatula. The proper quantity of powdered arsenic, wrapped up in a piece of paper, is then to be added, the operator retaining his breath till its noxious fumes are completely dissipated; and when the scoria is removed from the fluid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, it is to be poured out as quickly as possible into the flasks. As soon as the metal is become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a>, remove it from the flask into some hot ashes or coals, for the purpose of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNEALING\">annealing</a>.\nMethod of annealing it, and let it remain among them till they are completely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>. The ingate is then to be taken from the metal by means of a file; and the surface of the speculum must be ground upon a common grindstone, till all the imperfections and asperities are taken away. When Mr Edwards' composition is employed, the copper and tin should be melted according to the preceding directions, and, when mixed together, should be poured into cold water, which will separate the mals into a number of small particles. These small pieces of metal are then to be collected and put into the crucible, along with the silver and bras, after they have been melted together in a separate crucible; the proper quantity of arsenic is to be added, and a little powdered rosin thrown into the fluid metal before it is poured into the flasks.\n\nWhen the metal is cast, and prepared by the common grindstone for receiving its proper figure, the gages and grinding tools are to be formed in the same manner as for convex lenses, with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> only, that the radius of the gages must always be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> the focal length of the speculum. In addition to the convex and concave bras tools, which should be only a little broader than the metal itself, a convex elliptical tool of lead and tin should also be formed with the same radius, so that its transverse may be to its conjugate diameter as 10 to 9, the latter being exactly equal to the diameter of the metal. On this tool the speculum is to be ground with flour emery, in the same manner as lenses, with circular and cross strokes alternately, till its surface is freed from every imperfection, and ground to a spherical figure. It is then to be wrought with great circumspection, on the convex bras' tool, with emery of different degrees of fineness, the concave tool being sometimes ground upon the convex one, to keep them all of the same radius; and when every scratch and appearance of roughness is removed from its surface, it will be fit for receiving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> polish. Before the speculum is brought to the polisher, it has been the practice to smooth it on a bed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, or a convex tool made of common blue stones. This additional tool, indeed, is absolutely necessary, when silver and bras enter into the composition of the metal, in order to remove that roughness which will always remain after the finest emery has been used; but when these metals are not ingredients in the speculum, there is no occasion for the bed of stones. Without the intervention of this tool I have finished several specula, and given them as exquisite a lustre as they could possibly have received. Mr Edwards does not use any bras tools in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, but transfers the metal from the elliptical leaden tool to the bed of stones. By this means the operation is simplified, but we doubt much if it is, in the least degree, improved. As a bed of stones is more apt to change its form than a tool of brass, it is certainly of great consequence that the speculum should have as true a figure as possible before it is brought to the stones; and we are persuaded, from experience, that this figure may be better communicated on a bras' tool, which can always be kept at the same curvature by its corresponding tool, than on an elliptical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> of lead. We are certain, however, that when the speculum is required to be of a determinate focal length, this length will be obtained more precisely with the bras tools than without them. But Mr Edwards has observed, that these tools are not only unnecessary, but 'really detrimental.' That Mr Edwards found them unnecessary, we cannot doubt, from the excellence of the specula which he formed without their affluence; but it seems inconceivable how the bras tools can be in the least degree detrimental. If the mirror is ground upon 20 different tools before it is brought to the bed of stones, it will receive from the last of these tools a certain figure, which it would have received even if it had not been ground on any of the rest; and it cannot be questioned, that a metal wrought upon a pair of bras tools, is equally, if not more, fit for the bed of stones, than if it had been ground merely on a tool of lead.\n\nWhen the metal is ready for polishing, the elliptical leaden tool is to be covered with black pitch, about polishing one-twentieth of an inch thick, and the polisher formed the metal in the same way as in the case of lenses, either with the concave bras tool, or with the metal itself. The colochar of vitriol should then be triturated between two surfaces of glass, and a considerable quantity of it applied at first to the surface of the polisher. The speculum is then to be wrought in the usual way upon the polishing tool till it has received a brilliant lustre, taking care to use no more of the colochar, if it can be avoided, and only a small quantity of it, if it should be found necessary. When the metal moves fluidly on the polisher, and the colochar assumes a dark muddy hue, the polish advances with great rapidity. The tool will then grow warm, and would probably stick to the speculum, if its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> were discontinued for a moment. At this stage of the process, therefore, we must proceed with great caution, breathing continually on the polisher, till the friction is so great as to retard the motion of the speculum. When this happens, the metal is to be flipped off the tool at one side, cleaned with soft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>, and placed in a tube for the purpose of trying its performance; and if the polishing has been conducted with care, it will be found to have a true parabolic figure.\n\nAppendix to Ferguson's Lectures, vol. ii. p. 457.","sp":301,"ep":334},{"h":"OPTIO","t":"an officer in the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, being an assistant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CENTURION\">centurion</a>.

And from the accidental coincidence of the Frank aureus with the eighth part of their mark, the Danes probably took occasion to give it the new name of ora. There was another ora mentioned in the rolls of the 27th of Henry III. the value of which was sixteen pence; and this was probably derived from the half mancus of the Saxons. Such, in all appearance, was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> of these two oras; as there were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> aurei of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, to which these two denominations of money of sixteen and twelve pence can possibly be ascribed. It is observed farther, that the name ora distinguishes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> coins in several parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. The Portuguese moideira is nothing else but moeda d'oro, from the Latin moneta de auro; the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> d'ors come from the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of the word, and owe their appellation to the ora.

It is also used for the god who was thought to give the answer, and for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where it was given.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORACLES\">oracles</a> was so great, that in all doubts and disputes their determinations were held sacred and inviolable: whence vast numbers flocked to them for advice about the management of their affairs; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> business of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> was undertaken, scarce any peace concluded, any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> waged, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> any new form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> instituted, without the advice and approbation of some oracle. The answers were usually given by the intervention of the priests or priestesses of the god who was consulted; and generally expressed in such dark and unintelligible phrases, as might be easily wrested to prove the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of the oracle whatever was the event. It is not, therefore, to be wondered at, that the priests who delivered them were in the highest credit and esteem, and that they managed this reputation so greatly to promote their own particular advantage. They accordingly allowed no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> to consult the gods, before he had offered costly sacrifices, and made rich presents to them. And to keep up the veneration for their oracles, and to prevent their being taken unprepared, they admitted persons to consult the gods only at certain stated times; and sometimes they were so cautious, that the greatest performances could obtain no answer at all. Thus Alexander himself was peremptorily denied by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHIA\">Pythia</a>, or priestess of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a>, till she was by downright force obliged to ascend the tripod; when, being unable to resist any longer, she cried out, Thou art invincible: and these words were accepted instead of a farther oracle.\n\nOf the ambiguity of oracles, the following, out of a great many examples, may be mentioned. Croesus having received from the Pythianess this answer, That by palling the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALYS\">Halys</a>, he would destroy a great empire; he understood it to be the empire of his enemy, whereas he destroyed his own.\u2014The oracle consulted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PYRRHUS\">Pyrrhus</a> gave him an answer, which might be equally understood of the victory of Pyrrhus, and the victory of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> his enemies:\n\nAio te, \u00c6acida, Romanos vincere posse.\n\nThe equivocation lies in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of the Latin tongue, which cannot be rendered in English.\u2014The Pythones advised Croesus to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULE\">mule</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Lydia understood nothing of the oracle, which denoted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYRUS\">Cyrus</a> descended from two different nations; from the Medes, by Mandana his mother, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTYAGES\">Astyages</a>; and from the Persians, by his father Cambyses, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> was by far less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> and illustrious.\u2014Nero had for answer, from the oracle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DELPHOS\">Delphos</a>, that seventy-three might prove fatal to him. He believed he was safe from all danger till that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>; but, finding himself deserted by every one, and hearing Galba proclaimed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>, who was 73 years of age, he was sensible of the deceit of the oracle.\n\nWhen men began to be better instructed by the lights <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> had introduced into the world, the false oracles infinibly lost their credit. Chrysippus filled an entire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> with false or doubtful oracles. Oenomaus, to be revenged of some oracle that had deceived him, made a compilation of oracles, to show their ridiculous vanity. Eusebius has preserved some fragments of this criticism on oracles by Oenomaus. \"I might (says <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGEN\">Origen</a>) have recourse to the authority of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIPATETICS\">Peripatetics</a>, to make the Pythones much suspected; I might extract from the writings...\"\nwritings of Epicurus and his sectors an abundance of things to discredit oracles; and I might shew that the Greeks themselves made no great account of them.\"\n\nThe reputation of oracles was greatly lessened when they became an artifice of politics. Themistocles, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of engaging the Athenians to quit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, and to embark, in order to be in a better condition to resist <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-XERXES\">Xerxes</a>, made the Pythones d'Ever an oracle, commanding them to take refuge in wooden walls. Demoithenes said, that the Pythones <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a>-pized; to signify that he was gained over by Philip's pretexts.\n\nThe cessation of oracles is attested by several profane authors; as Strabo, Juvenal, Lucan, and others. Plutarch accounts for it, by saying, that the benefits of the gods are not eternal as themselves are; or that the genii, who presided over oracles, are subject to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; or that the exhalations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> had been exhausted. It appears that the last reason had been alleged in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of Cicero, who ridicules it in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> book of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINATION\">Divination</a>, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the spirit of prophecy, supposed to be excited by subterraneous effluvia, had evaporated by length of time, as wine or pickle by being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> kept.\n\nSuidas, Nicephorus, and Cedrenus, relate, that Augustus, having consulted the oracle of Delphos, could obtain no other answer but this: \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> child whom all the gods obey, drives me hence, and sends me back to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELL\">hell</a>: get out of this temple without speaking one word.\" Suidas adds, that Augustus dedicated an altar in the Capitol, with this inscription, \"To the eldest Son of God.\" Notwithstanding these testimonies, the answer of the oracle of Delphos to Augustus seems very suspicious. Cedrenus cites Eusebius for this oracle, which is not now found in his works; and Augustus's peregrination into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> was 18 years before the birth of Christ.\n\nSuidas and Cedrenus give an account also of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> oracle delivered to Thulis, a king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, which they say is well authenticated. The king having consulted the oracle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERAPIS\">Serapis</a>, to know if there ever was, or would be, one so great as himself, received this answer: First, God, next the Word, and the Spirit with them. They are equally eternal, and make but one, whose power <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> never end. But thou, mortal, go hence, and think that the end of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of man is uncertain.\"\n\nVan Dale, in his treatise of oracles, does not believe that they ceased at the coming of Christ. He relates several examples of oracles consulted till the death of Theodosius the Great. He quotes the laws of the emperors Theodosius, Gratian, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VALENTINIAN\">Valentinian</a>, against those who consulted oracles, as a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> of oracles still subsisted in the time of those emperors.\n\nAccording to others, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of those who believe that demons had no share in the oracles, and that the coming of the Messiah made no change in them, and the contrary opinion of those who pretend that the incarnation of the Word imposed a general silence on all oracles, should be equally rejected. They allege, that two sorts of oracles ought to be distinguished: the one dictated by the spirits of darkness, who deceived men by their obscure and doubtful answers; the other, the pure artifice and cheat of the priests of false divinities. As to the oracles given out by demons, the reign of Satan was destroyed by the coming of the Saviour; truth that the mouth of lies; but Satan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> his old craft among idolaters. All the devils were not forced to silence at the same time by the coming of the Messiah; it was on particular occasions that the truth of Christianity, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, imposed silence on the devils. St. Athanasius tells the Pagans, that they have been witnesses themselves that the sign of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> puts the devils to flight, silences oracles, and dissipates enchantments. This power of silencing oracles, and putting the devils to flight, is also attested by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARNOBIUS\">Arnobius</a>, Lactantius, Prudentius, Minutius Felix, and several others. Their testimony is a certain proof that the coming of the Messiah had not imposed a general silence on oracles.\n\nPlutarch relates, that the pilot Thamus heard a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, crying out, \"The great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAN\">Pan</a> is dead;\" whereupon Eusebius observes, that the accounts of the death of the demons were frequent in the reign of Tiberius, when Christ drove out the wicked spirits.\n\nThe same judgment, it is said, may be passed on oracles as on predictions. It was on particular occasions, by the divine permission, that the Christians <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> out devils, or silenced oracles, in the presence, and even by the confession, of the Pagans themselves. And thus it is we should, it seems, understand the palliages of St Jerome, Eusebius, Cyril, Theodore, Prudentius, and other authors, who said that the coming of Christ had imposed silence on the oracles.\n\nAs to the second sort of oracles, which were pure artifices and cheats of the priests of false divinities, and which probably exceeded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of those that immediately proceeded from demons, they did not cease till idolatry was abolished, though they had lost their credit for a considerable time before the coming of Christ. It was concerning this more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> and general sort of oracles that Minutius Felix said, they began to discontinue their responses, according as men began to be more polite. But, however oracles were decreed, impostors always found dupes, the greatest cheats having never failed.\n\nDaniel discovered the imposture of the priests of Bel, who had a private way of getting into the temple to take away the offered meats, and who made the king believe that the idol confirmed them.\u2014Mundus, being in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> with Paulina, the eldest of the priestesses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISIS\">Isis</a>, went and told her, that the god Amibus, being passionately fond of her, commanded her to give him a meeting. She was afterwards shut up in a dark room, where her lover Mundus, whom she believed to be the god Amibus, was concealed. This imposture having been discovered, Tiberius ordered those detestable priests and priestesses to be crucified, and with them Idea, Mundus's free woman, who had conducted the whole intrigue. He also commanded the temple of Isis to be levelled with the ground, and her statue to be thrown into the Tiber; and, as to Mundus, he contented himself with sending him into banishment.\n\nTheophilus, bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, not only destroyed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a> of the false gods, but discovered the cheats of the priests, by showing that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a>, some of which were of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, and others of wood, were hollow within, and led into dark palliages made in the wall.\nLucian, in discovering the impostures of the false prophet Alexander, says, that the oracles were chiefly afraid of the subtleties of the Epicureans and Chritians. The false prophet Alexander sometimes feigned himself seized with a divine fury, and by means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERB\">herb</a> popowort, which he chewed, frothed at the mouth in an extraordinary manner, that the ignorant people attributed it to the strength of the god he was possessed by. He had long before prepared a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of a dragon made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>, which opened and shut its mouth by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>. He went by night to a place where the foundations of a temple were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a>; and having found <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, either of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> that had settled there, he hid in it a goose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>, in which he had enclosed a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENT\">serpent</a> that had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> hatched. The next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, very early in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, he came quite naked into the street, having only a scarf about his middle, holding in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> a scythe, and tossing about his hair as the priests of Cybele; then getting atop of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> altar, he said, that the place was happy to be honoured by the birth of a god.\u2014Afterwards, running <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the place where he had hid the goose egg, and going into the water, he began to sing the praises of Apollo and Aesculapius, and to invite the latter to come and show himself to men. With these words, he dips a bowl into the water, and takes out the mysterious egg, which had a god enclosed in it; and when he had it in his hand, he began to say that he held Aesculapius. Whilst all were eager to have a sight of this fine mystery, he broke the egg, and the little serpent starting out, twisted itself about his fingers.\n\nThese examples show clearly, that both Christians and Pagans were so far agreed as to treat the greater number of oracles as purely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> impostures. That, in fact, all of them were so, will be concluded by those who give equal credit to demoniacal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a>, and demoniacal possession. The most ancient oracle was that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DODONA\">Dodona</a> (see Dodona); but the most famous was that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DELPHI\">Delphi</a>, to which article we also refer for further particulars on this subject, so famous in Pagan antiquity. Another celebrated one was the oracle of Trophonius, in the neighbourhood of Lebada, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOEOTIA\">Boeotia</a>, which was held in high estimation. It received its name from Trophonius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> of Agamedes, who lived in a subterranean dwelling near Lebada, and pretended to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of foretelling future events. He died in his cave, and was deified as an oracular god. This oracle owed its reputation to one Saon.\n\nThose who repaired to this cave for information, were required to offer certain sacrifices, to anoint themselves with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, and to bathe in a certain river: They were then clothed in a linen robe, took a honeyed cake in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, and defended into the subterraneous chamber by a narrow passage. Here it was that futurity was unfolded to them, either by visions or extraordinary sounds. The return from the cave was by the same passage, but the persons consulting were obliged to walk backwards. They generally came out astonied, melancholy, and dejected; hence the proverb us Tepaionos psuchisth. The priests on their return placed them on an elevated seat, called the seat of Mnemosyne, where an account was taken of what they had seen and heard. They were then conducted to the chapel of good Genius by their companions, where, by degrees, they recovered their usual composure and cheerfulness.\n\nBesides these three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> oracles of Greece, it is proper to take notice of that of Amphiarous at Oropus in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTICA\">Attica</a>. It was so called from Amphiarous, the son of Oicleus, a man skilled in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGIC\">magic</a>, the interpretation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a>, &c. and who after his death was deified and delivered oracles in a temple erected to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>. (See Amphiarous). They who applied to them for information, were to purify themselves, offer sacrifice, fast twenty-four hours, abstain from wine two days, and make an offering of a ram to Amphiarous; on the skin of which they were to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, and see their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESTINY\">destiny</a> in a dream. Near the temple was Amphiarous\u2019s fountain, which was sacred, and the waters of it forbidden to be used for ordinary purposes.\n\nAt Delos also there was an oracle of the Delian Apollo; in Mileia was that of the Branchidae, with others of less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, which require not a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, such as that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LACEDEMON\">Lacedemon</a>, that of Nabarcha, that of Chrylopolis, that of Clares in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IONIA\">Ionia</a>, that of Mallos, that of Patara, that of Pella, that of Phaselides, that of Sinope, that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORPHEUS\">Orpheus</a>\u2019s head, &c.\n\nThough the Romans consulted the Grecian oracles upon many occasions, and had few oracles in their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; yet we must not omit mentioning the Cumaean oracles, which were delivered by the Sibyl of Cumae. For an account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIBYLS\">Sibyls</a>, see the article SIBYL. See also Daemon and Demoniac.\n\nWe have hitherto only considered the oracles of false gods, of which there was a far greater number than our limits permit us to observe, and before either Greeks or Romans had risen to any distinction. Oracle is in sacred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> sometimes used for the mercy seat, or the cover of the ark of the covenant; and by others it is taken for the sanctuary, or for the most holy place, wherein the ark was deposited.\n\nAmong the Jews we may distinguish several sorts of real oracles. They had first oracles that were delivered viva voce; as when God spake to Moses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> to face, and as one friend speaks to another, (Numb. xii. 8.). Secondly, Prophetic dreams sent by God; as the dreams which God sent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a>, and which foretold his future greatness. (Gen. xxxvii. 5, 6.). Thirdly, Visions; as when a prophet in an ecstasy, being neither properly asleep nor awake, had supernatural revelations, (Gen. xv. 1. xlvi. 2.). Fourthly, The oracle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-URIM_AND_THUMMIM\">Urim and Thummim</a>, which was accompanied with the ephod or the pectoral worn by the high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>, and which God had endued with the gift of foretelling things to come, (Numb. xii. 6. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOEL\">Joel</a>. ii. 28.). This manner of inquiring of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> was often made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of, from Joshua\u2019s time to the erection of the temple at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>. Fifthly, After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of the temple, they generally consulted the prophets, who were frequent in the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. From Haggai, Zechariah, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALACHI\">Malachi</a>, who are the last of the prophets that have any of their writings remaining, the Jews pretend that God gave them what they call Bathcol, the daughter of the voice, which was a supernatural manifestation of the will of God, which was performed either by a strong inspiration or internal voice, or else by a sensible and\nOracle, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> voice, which was heard by a number of persons sufficient to bear testimony of it. For example, such was the voice that was heard at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ, saying, This is my beloved Son, &c. (Matt. iii. 17.)\n\nThe Scripture affords us examples likewise of profane oracles. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALAAM\">Balaam</a>, at the instigation of his own spirit, and urged on by his advice, fearing to lose the recompense that he was promised by Balak king of the Moabites, suggests a diabolical expedient to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, of making the Israelites <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into idolatry and fornication (Num. xxiv. 14-xxvi. 16.), by which he assures him of a certain victory, or at least of considerable advantage against the people of God.\n\nMicahiah the son of Imnah, a prophet of the Lord, says (1 Kings xxii. 21, &c.), that he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the Almighty sitting upon his throne, and all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOST\">host</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> round about him; and the Lord said, who shall tempt Ahab king of Israel, that he may go to war with Ramothgilead, and fall in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>? One answered after another manner, and another in another. At the same time an evil spirit presented himself before the Lord, and said, I will seduce him. And the Lord asked him, How? To which Satan answered, I will go and be a lying spirit in the mouth of his prophets. And the Lord said, Go and thou shalt prevail. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALOGUE\">dialogue</a> clearly proves these two things: firstly, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a> could do nothing by his own power; and, secondly, that with the permission of God, he could inspire the false prophets, sorcerers, and magicians, and make them deliver false oracles.\n\nReflecting the cessation of profane oracles there have been a variety of opinions; some of which we have already remarked. It has been generally held, indeed, that oracles ceased at the birth of Jesus Christ: Yet some have endeavoured to maintain the contrary, by showing that they were in being in the days of Julian, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> called the Apollate, and that this emperor himself consulted them; nay, farther, say they, history makes mention of several laws published by the Christian emperors Theodosius, Gratian, and Valentinian, to punish persons who interrogated them, even in their days; and that the Epicureans were the first who made a jest of this superstition, and exposed the roguery of its priests to the people. As we suspect most of the facts here asserted should be understood in a qualified <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, we shall endeavour to discuss this point of controversy in as few words as possible, although it is undoubtedly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of some consequence.\n\n1st, The question, properly stated, is not, Whether oracles became extinct immediately upon the birth of Christ, or from the very moment he was born; but, If they fell gradually into disrepute and ceased, as Christ and his gospel became known to mankind. And that they did so, is most certain from the concurrent testimonies of the fathers, which, whoever would endeavour to invalidate, may equally give up the most respectable traditions and relations of every kind.\n\n2ndly, But did not Julian the apollate consult these oracles? We answer in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>: he had indeed recourse to magical operations, but it was because oracles had already ceased; for he bewailed the loss of them, and assigned pitiful reasons for it; which St Cyril has vigorously refuted, adding, that he never could have offered such, but from an unwillingness to acknowledge, that when the world had received the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> of Christ, the dominion of the devil was at an end.\n\n3rdly, The Christian emperors do indeed seem to condemn the superstition and idolatry of those who were still for consulting oracles; but the edicts of those princes do not prove that oracles actually existed in their times, any more than that they ceased in consequence of their laws. It is certain that they were for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> extinct before the conversion of Constantine.\n\n4thly, Some Epicureans might make a jest of this superstition: however the Epicurean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> Celsus, in the second century of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, was for crying up the excellency of several oracles, as appears at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> from Origen's seventh book against him.","sp":340,"ep":343},{"h":"ORAN","t":"a very strong and important town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, in Barbary, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of Tremecen, with several forts, and an excellent harbour.

M. de la Hire observing this, placed some flat pieces of glass under the leaves to receive it; and having procured some large drops of it, was desirous of discovering what it was. He soon found that it was not merely an aqueous fluid, because it did not evaporate in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; and that it was not a resin, because it readily and perfectly mixed with water: it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> then to suppose it a liquid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>; but neither did this, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, prove to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>; for being laid on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, it did not dry as the other liquid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a> do. Its answering to none of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, and its being of the consistence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>, and of a sweet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>-like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, gave a suspicion of its being a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANNA\">manna</a>; and whatever in the other trials had proved it not a resin, a gum, &c. all equally tends to prove that it is this substance.\n\n**Orange, Sea**, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">Natural <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a>, a name given by Count Marigli to a very remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> substance, which he denominates a plant. It is tough and firm in its structure, and in many things resembles the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUCUS\">fucus</a>; but instead of growing in the Orange, branched form which the generality of those substances have, it is round and hollow, and in every respect resembles the shape of an orange. It has, by way of root, some exceeding fine filaments, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> on themselves to the rocks, or to shells, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, or anything else that comes in the way. From these there grows no pedicle; but the body of the orange, as it is called, is fastened by them to the rock, or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> substance. The orange itself is usually of about three or four inches in diameter; and while in the sea, is full of water, and even retains it when taken up. In this state it frequently weighs a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> and a half; but when the water is let out, and it is dried, it becomes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> membrane, weighing scarce any thing. It is best preserved, by rubbing it with cotton as soon as the water is let out of it, and then hanging it up to dry. Its surface is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> and rough, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> a dusky green on the outside, and a clearer but somewhat bluish green within; and its thickness is about an eighth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of an inch. When viewed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>, it is seen to be all over covered with small glandules, or rather composed of them; for they stand so thick one by another as to leave no space between, and seem to make up the whole substance; so that it appears very like the rough flaggreen skin used to cover toys. There are indeed so many hollow ducts, through which the sea-water finds a passage into the globe formed by this skin, and by this means it is kept always full and distended; on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> it with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of scissors, the water immediately runs out, and the skins collapse; but there is something extremely remarkable in this, for the whole substance, near the wounded place, is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, and seems as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> alive, and sensible of the wound. The glandules are found full of water, and resembling small transparent bottles; and what goes to the structure of the plant beside these, is an assemblage of a vast number of filaments, all which are likewise hollow, and filled with a clear and transparent fluid.\n\nThere is another substance of this kind, mentioned and described by Count Marigli, Triumphetti, and others, and called the romafe or branched orange. This is very much of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the former; but, instead of consisting of one round globule, it is formed of several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> ones, all joined together, and representing the branches of some of the fucuses, only they are shorter; and these are all hollow and full of water, in the same manner as the single globes of the common kind. This has, by way of root, certain fine and slender filaments, which fall on it to the stones or shells near which it is produced; and it is of a dusky greenish colour on the surface, and of a fine bluish green within. The surface, viewed by the microscope, appears rough, as in the other, and the glandules are of the same kind, and are always found full of clear water.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORATION\">Oration</a>**, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">Rhetoric</a>, a speech or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARANGUE\">harangue</a>, composed according to the rules of oratory, but spoken in public.

Do not they excite, restrain, prove, admire, and shame? that in so great a variety of speech among all nations and countries, this seems to me the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of all mankind.\" Thus far Quintilian. Now, all bodily motion is either upward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> downward, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> or left, forward or backward, or else circular. The hands are employed by the orator in all these, except the last. And as they ought to correspond with our expressions, so they ought to begin and end with them. In admiration, and addresses to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, they must be elevated, but never raised above the eyes; and in speaking of things below us, they are directed downwards. Side motion should generally begin from the left, and terminate gently on the right. In demonstrations, addressing, and on several other occasions, they are moved forward; and in threatening, sometimes thrown back. But when the orator speaks of himself, his right-hand should be gently laid on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>. When <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> other motion is necessary, the hands should be kept about as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as the breast, so as to make near a right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> with the arm. This is not only graceful, but likewise the most easy posture, and gives the least strain to the muscles. They should never be suffered to hang down, nor to loll upon the cushion or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>. The left hand should never move alone, but accommodate itself to the motions of the right. In motions to the left side, the right hand should not be carried beyond the left shoulder. In promises and expressions of compliment; the motion of the hands should be gentle and slow; but in exhortations and applause more swift. The hands should generally be open; but in expressions of compunction and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> they may be closed. All fidgety and trifling actions of the fingers ought to be avoided; nor should they be stretched out and expanded in a stiff and rigid posture, but kept easy and pliable.\n\nNeither the breast nor the belly should be thrust out; which in itself looks ungainly, and hinders the free motion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a>; which ought not to be kept too stiff and upright, but easy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a>, always suiting itself to the motions of the head and hands. The feet should continue steady, and not give the body a wavering and giddy motion by frequently shifting; though some persons <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> without moving their feet. Curius, a Roman orator, as Cicero tells us, was addicted to this; which occasioned a friend of his once to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> a joke upon him, by asking, \"Who that was talking out of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>?\" The jest is too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> to need explication; for every one knows the waving of a boat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> give the body such a motion.\n\nThe gestures we have hitherto discussed, are such as naturally accompany our expressions. And we believe those we have mentioned, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> duly attended to, will be found sufficient to answer all the purposes of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> pronunciation. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>, indeed, used several more vehement actions and gestures than we are accustomed to; as we have formerly shown. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> the Roman orator, as Cicero informs us, did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> to prepare his discourses; but spoke, as we say, off-hand. And he was wont to tell his friends, \"he was never fit to talk till he had warmed his arm.\" He doubted, therefore, used a more violent motion with his arms and hands than is common with us. And Cicero calls the arm projected the orator's weapon. Indeed, to extend or brandish the arm, carries in it an air of command and authority, which was not unbecoming the character of Philip, who was a person of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. And therefore young orators, both among the Greeks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, for a time used no motion of the arm, but kept it confined in their garment, as an argument of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a>, till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> allowed them to use greater freedom. Nor was it uncommon for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> orators to express the excess of their passions by tears. They thought nothing unbecoming that was natural; and judged it agreeable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> even of the bravest men, to be touched with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> in great calamities: And therefore we find both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a> make their greatest heroes shed tears on some occasions.\n\nThe other sort of gestures above-mentioned are such as arise from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>; as where the orator describes some action, or personates another speaking. But here great care is to be taken not to overact his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>, by running into any ludicrous or theatrical mimicry. It is sufficient for him so to represent things of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, as may best convey the image of them in a lively manner to the minds of the hearers; without any such change either of his actions or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> as are not suitable to his own character.\n\nCHAP. IV. Some particular Rules for the Voice and Gesture.\n\nThe subject of pronunciation is of so great importance to an orator, that it can neither be too clearly laid down, nor too strongly inculcated. If we inquire into the causes of that surprising power it has over us, and by what means it so strongly affects us, this may in some measure appear by reflecting on the frame and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> nature. For our infinitely wise and great Maker has so formed us, that not only the actions of the body are subject to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the mind, but we are likewise endowed with various passions\npassions and affections, that excite us to pursue those things which make for our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>, and avoid others which are hurtful to us. And as we are made for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, we are also furnished with speech, which enables us to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> with one another. And such is the contrivance of our make, and influence of our minds upon the mechanism of our bodies, that we can not only communicate our thoughts to each other, but likewise our passions. For, as Cicero well observes, \"Every motion of the mind has naturally its peculiar countenance, voice, and gesture; and the whole body, every position of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, and sound of the voice, like the strings of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> agreeably to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> they receive from the mind.\" Nor is this all: but as every one is differently affected himself, he is capable to make the like impressions upon others, and excite them to the same motions which he feels in himself. As when two instruments are set to the same pitch, the strings of the one being touched, produce in the other the like sound. This common sympathy in the human frame shows how necessary it is that an orator should not only in general be well acquainted with the rules of pronunciation, but likewise know how to use them as occasion requires; for a general knowledge of the rules of art is not of itself sufficient to perfect an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>, without a further acquaintance with the particular application of them to their several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> and circumstances. Thus, for instance, it is not enough for an orator to understand all the beauties and ornaments of language, and which of them are suited to form the several kinds of style, unless he can likewise accommodate each of those characters to their proper subject. And so likewise in pronunciation, he ought not only to know the several qualities of the voice, and proper gestures of the body, but also when and where to make use of them. For not only different subjects, but also different parts of the same discourse, and even particular expressions, often require a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in the manner of pronunciation, both as to the voice and gesture. Having therefore treated on both these parts of pronunciation in general, it may not be amiss now to consider how they are to be applied in each of the two respects last mentioned.\n\nWe shall begin with the parts of a discourse, and treat of them in their natural order. And here the view and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of the speaker in each of them will easily help us to see the proper manner of pronunciation.\n\nLet us suppose then a person presenting himself before an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>, in order to make a discourse to them. It cannot be decent immediately to begin to speak too soon as ever he makes his appearance. He will first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> himself, compose his countenance, and take a respectful view of his audience. This prepares them for silence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. To begin presently, and hurry on, without first allowing either himself or his hearers time to compose themselves, looks as if he was rather performing a task than had any design to please them; which will be very apt to make them uneasy till he has done, as he seems to be himself. Persons <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> form some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of a speaker from their first view of him, which prejudices them either in his favour, or otherwise, as to what he says afterwards. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> and sedate aspect inclines them to think him serious; that he has considered his subject, and may have something to offer worth their attention. A haughty and forbidding air occasions dislike, as it looks like disrespect. A wandering giddy countenance argues levity. A dejected drooping appearance is apt to raise contempt, unless where the subject is melancholy. And a cheerful aspect is a proper prelude to a pleasant and agreeable argument.\n\nTo speak low at first has the appearance of modesty, and is best for the voice; which, by rising gradually, will with more ease be carried to any pitch that may be afterwards necessary, without straining it. However, some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of the voice is always proper to give it an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>. Nay, and sometimes it is not improper for an orator to set out with a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of warmth, expressed by such an elevation of the voice, and gestures of the body, as are suited to represent the emotions of his mind. But this is not ordinarily the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. We have some few instances of this in Cicero; as in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORATION\">oration</a> for Roelius Merinus, where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> could not but excite his indignation against the accusers. And so likewise in that against Piso, and the two first against Catiline, which begin in the same manner, from the resentment he had conceived against their persons and conduct.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NARRATION\">narration</a>, the voice ought to be raised to somewhat an higher pitch. Matters of fact should be related in a very plain and distinct manner, with a proper stress and emphasis laid upon each circumstance, accompanied with a suitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> and motions of the body, to engage the attention of the hearers. For there is a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> in telling a story, by which those who are masters of it seldom fail to recommend themselves in conversation. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of it consists in an easy and familiar manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, attended with such actions and gestures as are suited to the nature of the things related, and help to enliven each particular circumstance and part of the discourse.\n\nThe proposition, or subject of the discourse, should be delivered with a very clear and audible voice. For if this be not plainly heard, all that follows in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of it cannot well be understood. And for the same reason, if it be divided into several parts or branches, they should each be expressed very deliberately and distinctly. But as the design here is only information, there can be little room for gesture.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> admits of great variety both of the voice and gestures. In reasoning, the voice is quick and pungent, and should be enforced with suitable actions. And as descriptions likewise have often a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> here, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> out the images of things, the orator should endeavour to adapt both his voice, and the motions of his body, particularly the turn of his eyes, and action of his hands, as may best help the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> of his hearers. Where he introduces another person speaking, or addresses to an absent person, it should be with some degree of imitation. And in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALOGUE\">dialogue</a> the voice should alter with the parts. When he diverts from his subject by any digression, his voice should be lively and cheerful; since that is rather designed for entertainment than instruction.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUTATION\">confutation</a>, the arguments of the adverse party ought first to be repeated in a plain and distinct manner, that the speaker may not seem to concede, or avoid the force of them, unless they appear trifling and\nPronunciation and unworthy of a serious answer; and then a facetious manner, both of expression and gesture, may be the properest way to convey them. For to attempt to answer in a grave and serious manner, what is in itself empty and ludicrous, is apt to create a suspicion of its having more in it than it really has. So when Tubero, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a> of Ligarius before Caesar, had made it part of his charge, that Ligarius was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a> during some part of the civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> between Caesar and Pompey; Cicero, in his answer, not thinking it deserved a serious reply, contents himself with barely mentioning it ironically. For thus he begins his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of Ligarius: \"Caesar, my kinman Tubero has laid before you a new crime, and till this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> unheard-of, that Q. Ligarius was in Africa.\" Everyone must easily perceive, by the manner in which these words were pronounced, that the design of them was to make the charge appear ridiculous. But caution should be used not to represent any argument of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> in a ludicrous way, lest by so doing the speaker should more expose himself than his adversary.\n\nIn the conclusion, both the voice and gesture should be brisk and sprightly, which may seem to arise from a tenor of the speaker's opinion of the goodness of his cause, and that he has offered nothing but what is agreeable to reason and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>; as likewise from his assurance that the audience agree with him in the same sentiments. In every undertaking that requires care and thought, persons are apt at first to be sedate and moderate; but when it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> to an end, and is near finished, it is very natural to appear more gay. If an enumeration of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> arguments of the discourse be convenient, as it sometimes is, where they are pretty numerous, or the discourse is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, they ought to be expressed in the most clear and forcible manner. And if there be an address to the passions, both the voice and gesture must be suited to the nature of them, of which more will be said presently.\n\nWe proceed now to the consideration of particular expressions. And what we shall offer here, will be first in relation to single words, then sentences, and lastly the passions.\n\nI. Even in those sentences which are expressed in the most even and sedate manner, there is often one or more words which require an emphasis and distinction of the voice. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRONOUNS\">Pronouns</a> are often of this kind; as, This is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>. And such are many words that denote the circumstances and qualities of things. Such as heighten or magnify the idea of the thing to which they are joined, elevate the voice; as noble, admirable, majestic, greatly, and the like. On the contrary, those which lessen the idea, or deflate it, depress the voice, or at least protract the tone; of which sort are the words little, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a>, poorly, contemptible, with many others. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol0.html#article-TROPES\">tropes</a> likewise, as metaphors and verbal figures, which consist in the repetition of a single word, should have a particular emphasis. As when Virgil says of the river Araxes, It abstained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>. And <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NICIAS\">Nicias</a> of himself in the same poet, I, I am the man; where the repeated word is loudest. This distinction of words, and giving them their proper emphasis, does not only render the expression more clear and intelligible, but very much contributes to the variation of the voice, and the preventing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONOTONY\">monotony</a>. And the different pronunciations of these words will also require a peculiar pronunciation.\n\nII. In sentences, regard should be had to their length, and the number of their parts, in order to distinguish them by proper pauses. The frame and structure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> ought likewise to be considered, that the voice may be so managed as to give it the most musical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCENT\">accent</a>. Unless there be some special reason to the contrary, it should end louder than it begins. And this difference of tone between the end of the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> and the beginning of the next, not only helps to distinguish the sentence, but aids to the harmony of the voice. And that the last syllables of a sentence might become more audible and distinct, was doubtless one reason why the ancient rhetoricians dislike short feet at the end of a period. In an antithesis, or a sentence consisting of opposite parts, one contrary must be louder than the other. As, \"He is gone, but by a painful removal, from painful labour to quiet rest; from unquiet desires to happy contentment; from sorrow to joy; and from transitory time to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a>.\" In a climax or gradation, the voice should rise with it. So, \"There is no enjoyment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>; no government without a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>; no magistrate without obedience; no obedience where every one acts as he pleases.\" And so in other gradations of a different form. As, \"Since <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCORD\">concord</a> was lost, friendship was lost, fidelity was lost, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> was lost, all was lost.\" And again, \"You would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> him whom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> hath condemned, whom the people of Rome have condemned, whom all mankind have condemned.\" We might mention several other figurative expressions, which require a particular conformation and management of the voice; but these, we presume, with some others we shall have occasion to name presently when we come to the passions, may be sufficient to guide us in the rest. But that it may appear more evidently how necessary a different inflection and variation of the voice is in most sentences, give us leave to show how Quintilian illustrates it, by a passage which he takes from Cicero. The place is the beginning of Cicero's defence for Milo, and the words are these: \"Although I am apprehensive it may seem base to discover fear when I enter upon the defence of a most courageous man, and it may appear very indecent, when Milo discovers more concern for the public safety than for his own, not to show a greatness of mind equal to his cause, yet this new form of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> terrifies my eyes, which cannot discern the ancient manner of the forum, and former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of trials, whatever way they look: your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENCH\">bench</a> is not surrounded with its usual attendants.\" This sentence consists of four members. And Quintilian supposes, that though these words are the beginning of a speech, and were accordingly expressed in a calm and submissive manner, yet that the orator used a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of variety in the pronunciation of their several parts. In the first member (as he imagines) his voice was more elevated in expressing the words, a most courageous man, than in those other parts of it I am apprehensive it may seem base, and, to discover fear. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> member he rose higher, in saying, when Milo discovers more concern for the public safety than for his own; and then again, as it were, checked himself in what follows, not to show a greatness of mind equal...\nThe beginning of the third member, carrying a reflection in it, was spoke with a different tone of the voice, this new form of the court terrifies my eyes; and the other part of it more loud and distinctly, which cannot discern the ancient manner of the forum, and former custom of trials. And the last member was still more raised and audible, your bench is not surrounded with its usual attendants. And it must be supposed, that while he was saying this, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> his eyes round the assembly, and viewed the folders whom Pompey had placed there, which renders the expression still more grave and solemn. If this was the manner of the ancient orators, and they were so exact and accurate in expressing their periods, and the several parts of them, as we have reason to believe they were, it must have given a very great force, as well as beauty, to their pronunciation.\n\nIII. That the passions have each of them both a different voice and action, is evident from hence; that we know in what manner a person is affected, by the tone of his voice, though we do not understand the sense of what he says, or many times so much as see him: and we can often make the same judgment from his countenance and gestures. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">Love</a> and esteem are expressed in a smooth and cheerful tone: but anger and resentment, with a rough, harsh, and interrupted voice; for when the spirits are disturbed and ruffled, the organs are moved unequally. Joy raises and dilates the voice, as sorrow sinks and contracts it. Cicero takes notice of a passage in an oration of Gracchus, wherein he bewails the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, who was killed by Scipio, which in his time was thought very moving: \"Unhappy man (says he), whither shall I betake myself? where shall I go? Into the capitol? that flows with my brother's blood. Shall I go home? and behold my unhappy mother all in tears and despair?\" Though Gracchus had a very ill design in that speech, and his view was to excite the populace against their governors, yet (as Cicero tells us) when he came to this passage, he expressed himself in such moving accents and gestures, that he extorted tears even from his enemies. Fear occasions a tremor and hesitation of the voice, and affluence gives it strength and firmness. Admiration elevates the voice, and should be expressed with pomp and magnificence: O surprising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLEMENCY\">clemency</a>, worthy of the highest praise and greatest encomiums, and fit to be perpetuated in lasting monuments! This is Cicero's compliment to Caesar when he thought it for his purpose. And oftentimes this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> is accompanied with an elevation both of the eyes and hands. On the contrary, contempt sinks and protracts the voice. In the dispute between Cicero and Cecilius, which of them should accuse Verres, Cicero puts this contemptuous question to him: \"How are you qualified, Cecilius, for such an undertaking? I will not ask, when you ever gave a proof of it; but when you so much as attempted it? Do you consider the difficulty of managing a public cause?\" with much more to the same purpose. Though such kind of expressions require little gesture, yet sometimes a motion of the hand may not be improper, to signify disdain or aversion. We may suppose Cicero to have acted thus in his defence of Rabirius. For to show his assurance of his client's cause, having used this expression in a very audible manner, \"I wish I had it to say, that Rabirius had with his own hand killed Saturninus, who was an enemy to the Roman state,\" some persons in the crowd began to raise a clamour, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as of later times hissing has been practised on the like occasions. Upon which Cicero immediately replies, \"This noise does not disturb me, but please me, since it shows, though there are some weak persons, yet they are but few.\" Then presently after follows the expression we refer to: \"Why do not you cease your clamour, since it only discovers your folly, and the smallness of your number?\" All exclamations should be violent. When we address to inanimate things, the voice should be higher than when to animated beings; and appeals to heaven must be made in a loftier tone than those to men.\n\nThese few hints for expressing the principal passions may, if duly attended to, suffice to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> our practice in others. Though, after all, it is impossible to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> a just and decent pronunciation of voice and gesture merely from rules without practice and an imitation of the best examples. Which shows the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> of the ancients, in training up their youth to it, by the affluence of masters, to form both their speech and actions.\n\nBut there is one thing which ought always to be attended to; namely, that persons should well consider their own make and genius, especially with respect to the passions. We seldom find, that any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTOR\">actor</a> can excel in all characters; but if he performs one well, he is deficient in another: And therefore they are commonly too prudent as to confine themselves to such as best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> them. The case is the same in an orator; who should therefore keep within those bounds which nature seems to have prescribed for him. Some are better fitted for action than others, and most for some particular actions rather than others; and what fits well upon one would appear very awkward in another.
