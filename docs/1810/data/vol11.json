There are three general principles on which hygrometers have been constructed. 1. The lengthening and shortening of strings by dryness and moisture, or their twisting and untwisting by the same. 2. The swelling and shrinking of solid substances by moisture or dryness; and 3. By the increase or decrease of the weight of particular bodies whose nature is to absorb the humidity of the atmosphere.\n\nSmeaton's. I. On the first of these principles Mr Smeaton constructed an hygrometer greatly superior to any that had appeared before; and of which the following account is given in the 62d volume of the Philosophical Transactions.\n\nHaving some years ago attempted to make an accurate and sensible hygrometer by means of a hempen Hygrometer cord of a considerable length, I quickly found, that though it was more than sufficiently susceptible of every change in the humidity of the atmosphere, yet the cord was upon the whole in a continual state of lengthening. Though this change was the greatest at first, yet it did not appear probable that any given time would bring it to a certainty; and furthermore, it seemed, that as the cord grew more determinate in mean length, the alteration by certain differences of moisture grew less. Now, as on considering wood, catgut, paper, &c., there did not appear to be a likelihood of finding any substance sufficiently sensible of differences of moisture that would be unalterable under the same degrees thereof; this led me to consider of a construction which would readily admit of an adjustment; so that, though the cord whereby the instrument is actuated may be variable in itself, both as to absolute length, and difference of length under given degrees of moisture, yet that, on supposition of a material departure from its original scale, it might be readily restored thereto; and, in consequence, that any number of hygrometers, similarly constructed, might, like thermometers, be capable of speaking the same language.\n\nThe two points of heat the more readily determinable in a thermometer, are the points of freezing and boiling water. In like manner, to construct hygrometers which shall be capable of agreement, it is necessary to establish two different degrees of a moisture which shall be as fixed in themselves, and to which we can have recourse as readily and as often as possible.\n\nOne point is given by making the substance perfectly wet, which seems sufficiently determinable; the other is that of perfect dry, which I do not apprehend to be attainable with the same precision. A readiness to imbibe wet, so that the substance may be soon and fully saturated, and also a facility of parting with its moisture on being exposed to the fire to dry, at the same time, that neither immersion, nor a moderate exposition to the warmth of the fire, shall injure its texture, are properties requisite to the first mover of such an hygrometer, that in a manner exclude all substances that I am acquainted with, besides hempen and flaxen threads and cords, or substances compounded of them.\n\nUpon these ideas, in the year 1758, I constructed two hygrometers as nearly alike as possible, in order that I might have the means of examining their agreement or disagreement on similar or dissimilar treatment. The interval or scale between dry and wet I divided into 100 equal parts, which I call the degrees of this hygrometer. The point of 0 denotes perfect dry; and the numbers increase with the degrees of moisture to 100, which denotes perfect wet.\n\nOn comparing them for some time, when hung up together in a passage or staircase, where they would be very little affected by fire, and where they would be exposed to as free an air as possible in the inside of the house, I found that they were generally within one degree, and very rarely differed two degrees; but as these comparisons necessarily took up some time, and were frequently interrupted by long avocations from home, it was some years before I could form a tolerable judgment of them. One thing I soon observed, not altogether\naltogether to my liking, which was, that the flaxen cords made use of seemed to make too much resistance to the entry of small degrees of moisture (such as is commonly experienced within doors in the situation above-mentioned), that all the changes were comprised within the first 30\u00b0 of the scale; but yet, on exposing them to the warm steam of a wash-house, the index quickly mounted to 100. I was therefore desirous of impregnating the cords with something of a saline nature, which should dispose them more forcibly to attract moisture; in order that the index might, with the ordinary changes of the moisture in the atmosphere, travel over a greater part of the scale of 100. How to do this in a regular and fixed quantity, was the subject of many experiments and several years interrupted inquiry. At last I tried the one hereafter described, which seemed to answer my intention in a great measure; and though upon the whole it does not appear probable that ever this instrument will be made capable of such an accurate agreement as the mercurial thermometers are, yet if we can reduce all the disagreements of an hygrometer within 1/5th part of the whole scale, it will probably be of use in some philosophical inquiries, in lieu of instruments which have not yet been reduced to any common scale at all.\n\n\"Fig. 1. and 2. ABC is an orthographic delineation of the whole instrument seen in front in its true proportion. DE is that of the profile, or instrument seen edgewise. FG in both represents a flaxen cord about 35 inches long, suspended by a turning peg F, and attached to a loop of brass wire at A, which goes down into the box cover H, and defends the index, &c. from injury; and by a glass exposes the scale to view.\n\n\"Fig. 3. shows the instrument to a larger scale, the upright part being shortened, and the box-cover removed; in which the same letters represent the same parts as in the preceding figures; G1 are two loops or long links of brass wire, which lay hold of the index KL, moveable upon a small stud or centre K. The cord FG is kept moderately strained by a weight M of about half a pound avoirdupois.\u2014It is obvious, that, as the cord lengthens and shortens, the extreme end of the index rises and falls, and successively passes over N 2 the scale divided in the arch of a circle, and containing 100 equal divisions. This scale is attached to the brass sliding ruler QP, which moves upon the directing piece RR, fixed by screws to the board, which makes the frame or base of the whole; and the scale and ruler NOP is retained in any place nearer to or further from the centre K, as may be required by the screw S.\n\n\"Fig. 4. represents in profile the sliding piece and stud I (fig. 3.), which traverses upon that part of the index next the centre K; and which can, by the two screws of the stud, be retained upon any part of the index that is made parallel; and which is done for three or four inches from the centre, for that purpose. The stud is filed to the edges, like the fulcrum of a scale-beam; one being formed on the under side, the other on the upper, and as near as may be to one another. An hook formed at the lower end of the wire-loops CI, retains the index, by the lowermost edge of the stud; while the weight M hangs by a small hook upon the upper edge: by these means the index is kept steady and the cords strained by the weight, with very little friction or burden upon the central stud K.\n\n\"Fig. 5. is a parallelogram of plate-brass, to keep out dust, which is attached to the upper edge of the box-cover H; and serves to shut the part of the box-cover necessarily cut away, to give leave for the wire GI to traverse with the sliding stud nearer to or farther from the centre of the index K; and where, in fig. 5. a is a hole of about an inch diameter, for the wire GI to pass through in the rising and falling of the index freely without touching; b is a slit of a lesser size, sufficient to pass the wire, and admit the cover to come off without deranging the cord or index; c c are two small screws applied to two slits, by which the plate slides lengthwise, in order to adapt the hole c to the wire GI, at any place of the stud I upon the index KL.\n\n\"1. In this construction, the index KL being 12 inches long, 4 inches from the extreme end are filed to narrow in the direction in which it is seen by the eye, that any part of these four inches lying over the divisions of the scale, becomes an index thereto. The scale itself slides four inches, so as to be brought under any part of the four inches of the index attenuated as above-mentioned.\n\n\"2. The position of the directing piece RR is so determined as to be parallel to a right line drawn through o upon the scale, and the centre K of the index; consequently, as the attenuated part of the index forms a part of a radius or right line from the same centre, it follows, that whenever the index points to o upon the scale, though the scale is moved nearer to or further from the centre of the index, yet it produces no change in the place to which the index points.\n\n\"When the divided arch of the scale is at 10 inches from the centre (that is, at its mean distance); then the centre of the arch and the centre of the index are coincident. At other distances, the extremes of which are eight or twelve inches, the centre of the divisions, and the centre of the index pointing thereto, not being coincident, the index cannot move over the spaces geometrically proportional to one another in all situations of the scale; yet the whole scale not exceeding 30\u00b0 of a circle, it will be found on computation, that the error can never be so great as 1/5th part of the scale, or 1\u00b0 of the hygrometer; which in this instrument being considered as indivisible, the mechanical error will not be sensible.\n\n\"The cord here made use of is flax, and between 1/5th and 1/6th of an inch in diameter; which can be readily ascertained by measuring a number of turns made round a pencil or small stick. It is a sort of cord used in London for making nets, and is of that particular kind called by net-makers flaxen three-threads laid. A competent quantity of this cord was boiled in one pound avoirdupois of water, in which was put two pennyweights troy of common salt; the whole was reduced by boiling to fix ounces avoirdupois, which was done in about half an hour. As this ascertains a given strength of the brine, on taking out the cord, it may be supposed that every fibre of the cord is equally impregnated with salt. The cord being dried, it will be proper to stretch it; which may be done so as to prevent it from untwisting, by tying...\nHYG\n\nHygrometer.\n\nthree or four yards to two nails against a wall, in an horizontal position, and hanging a weight of a pound or two to the middle, so as to make it form an obtuse angle. This done for a week or more in a room, will lay the fibres of the cord close together, and prevent its stretching so fast after being applied to the instrument as it would otherwise be apt to do.\n\n\"The hygrometer is to be adjusted in the following manner. The box-cover being taken off to prevent its being spoiled by the fire, and choosing a day naturally dry, set the instrument nearly upright, about a yard from a moderate fire; so that the cord may become dry, and the instrument warm, but not so near as would spoil the finest linen by too much heat, and yet fully evaporate the moisture; there let the instrument stay till the index is got as low as it will go; now and then stroaking the cord betwixt the thumb and finger downwards, in order to lay the fibres thereof close together; and thereby caulking it to lengthen as much as possible. When the index is thus become stationary, which will generally happen in about an hour, more or less as the air is naturally more or less dry, by means of the peg at top, raise or depress the index, till it lies over the point o. This done, remove the instrument from the fire; and having ready some warm water in a tea-cup, take a middling camel's hair pencil, and dipping it in the water, gently anoint the cord till it will drink up no more, and till the index becomes stationary and water will have no more effect upon it, which will also generally happen in about an hour. If in this state the index lies over the degree marked 100, all is right; if not, slack the screw S, and slide the scale nearer to or further from the centre, till the point 100 comes under the index, and then the instrument is adjusted for use; but if the compass of the slide is not sufficient to effect this, as may probably happen on the first adjustment, slack the proper screws, and move the sliding stud I nearer to or further from the centre of the index, according as the angle formed by the index between the two points of dry or wet happens to be too small or too large for the scale.\"\n\nOn this principle, a simple hygrometer has been made by Mr Coventry of Southwark, London. It is not upon the most accurate construction, yet will act very sensibly in the common changes of the air. Fig. 6 represents the hygrometer as applied to a wall or board. A is a string of whip-cord, catgut, &c. of any length at pleasure: it is suspended on a bracket B, and kept extended by a weight at the bottom C. DD is a slip of wood, which with the bracket is fixed perpendicularly to a wall or side of a room. It has a straight line E drawn down in the middle of the board, serving to point out the divisions upon the edges of the two thin circular cards F and G. At the centre of the bottom of each of these cards is glued a piece of cork, through which the string A is drawn: These cork pieces serve to preserve the horizontal position of the cards. The upper card F is divided into 10 equal parts or divisions, and the under card G into 100 equal parts; the string A being measured into 10 equal parts, from the point of suspension H to the surface of the lower card J. The card F is hung at the first part, from H, and the card G at the 10th part from the same point; consequently, from the twisting and untwisting of the string A by the different changes of Hygrometer, the lower card G, from the mechanical principles of motion, will describe 10 revolutions for one of the upper card F; or when the lower card G has made one revolution, the upper card F will have described but the 10th part, or one of its divisions. From whence it appears, that by the affluence of the upper card F, an index is thereby obtained of the number of revolutions the lower card G performs, which are reckoned by the line E on the slip of wood.\n\nExample. It must first be observed what division of the card F the line E is against, suppose 3; and also what division of the lower card G is cut by the same line, suppose 10: it then appears, that the state of the hygrometer is thus, 3 degrees and 10 hundredths of another. If the whole 10 divisions of the card have passed the line E, the lower card G will have revolved 10 times, or 10 hundred parts, equal to 1000; the accuracy to which the principle of this simple contrivance answers. Before use, the hygrometer should be adjusted; to do which, the cards F and G are first set to the line E at the 0 of each, or commencement of the graduations: whatever direction the cards afterwards take, it must evidently be from the change to greater moisture or dryness in the air; and they will accordingly point it out.\n\nOn this principle, but with a degree of ingenuity and pains perhaps never before employed, an hygrometer has been constructed by M. de Saufure, professor of philosophy at Geneva. In his Essais sur l'Hygrometrie, in 4to, 1783, is an important detail on the subject of hygrometry; from which the following description of his hygrometer is taken. The author found by repeated experiments, that the difference between the greatest extension and contraction of a hair, properly prepared, and having a weight of about three grains suspended to it, is nearly \u215b of its whole length; that is, 3\u00bd, or 3\u00bd lines in a foot. This circumstance suggested the idea of a new hygrometer: and, in order to render those small variations perceptible and useful, the following apparatus was constructed.\n\nFig. 7. is a representation of the whole instrument, with the hair and other appendages complete. The lower extremity of the hair ab is held by the chaps of the screw pincers b. These pincers are represented aside at B: by a screw at its end, it fastens into the nut of the bottom plate C. This nut of the plate turns independently of the piece that supports it, and serves to raise or depress the pincers B at pleasure.\n\nThe upper extremity a of the hair is held by the under chaps of the double pincers a, represented aside at A. These pincers fasten the hair below, and above fasten a very fine narrow slip of silver, carefully annealed, which rolls round the arbor or cylinder d, a separate figure of which is shown at DF. This arbor, which carries the needle or index e e, or E in the separate figure, is cut into the shape of a screw; and the intervals of the threads of this screw have their bases flat, and are cut squarely so as to receive the slip of silver that is fastened to the pincers a, and joined in this manner with the hair. M. Saufure observes, that hair alone fixed immediately to the arbor would not do; for it curled upon it, and acquired a stiffness that the counterpoise was not able to surmount. The arbor was cut in a screw form, in order that the slip of silver in wind-\ning upon it should not increase the diameter of the arbor, and never take a situation too oblique and variable. The slip is fixed to the arbor by a small pin F. The other extremity of the arbor D is shaped like a pulley, flat at the bottom so as to receive a fine supple filken string, to which is suspended the counterpoise G in the large figure, and G in the side one. This counterpoise is applied to distend the hair; and acts in a contrary direction to that of the hair, and the moveable pincers to which the hair is fixed. If then the hair should be loaded with the weight of four grains, the counterpoise must weigh four grains more than the pincers. The arbor at one end passes through the centre of the dial, and turns therein, in a very fine hole, on a pivot made very cylindrical and well polished; at the other end is also a similar pivot, which turns in a hole made in the end of the arm h of the cock h, H. I. This cock is fixed behind the dial by means of the screw I.\n\nThe dial k e e k, divided into 360 degrees, is supported by two arms //; these are foldered to two tubes, which inclose the cylindrical columns m m m m. The setting screws n n move upon these tubes, and serve thereby to fix the dial and arbor to any height required. The two columns which support the dial are firmly fastened to the case of the hygrometer, which rests upon the four screws o o o o; by the affixture of these screws, the instrument is adjusted, and placed in a vertical situation.\n\nThe square column pp, which rests upon the base of the hygrometer, carries a box q, to which is fixed a kind of port-crayon r, the aperture of which is equal to the diameter of the counterpoise g. When the hygrometer is to be moved from one place to another; to prevent a derangement of the instruments from the oscillations of the counterpoise, the box q and the port-crayon r must be raised up so as the counterpoise may fall into and be fixed in it, by tightening the screw s and the box and counterpoise together by the screw t. When the hygrometer is intended for use, the counterpoise must be disengaged by lowering the box, as may be conceived from the figure.\n\nLastly, at the top of the instrument is a curved piece of metal x, y, z, which is fastened to the three columns just described, and keeps them together. It has a square hole at y, which serves to hang up the hygrometer by when required.\n\nThe variations of which this hygrometer is capable, are (all things besides equal) as much greater as the arbor round which the slip of fluff winds is than a smaller diameter, and as the instrument is capable of receiving a longer hair. M. Saufure has had hygrometers made with hairs 14 inches long, but he finds one foot sufficient. The arbor is three-fourths of a line in diameter at the base between the threads of the screw or the part on which the slip winds. The variations, when a hair properly prepared is applied to it, are more than an entire circumference, the index describing about 400 degrees in moving from extreme dryness to extreme humidity. M. Saufure mentions an inconvenience attending this hygrometer, viz. its not returning to the same point when moved from one place to another; because the weight of three grains that keeps the fluff slip extended, cannot play so exactly as to act always with the same precision against the arbor round which it winds. But this weight cannot be sensibly increased without still greater inconveniences: he therefore observes, that his hygrometer is well calculated for a fixed situation in an observatory, and for various hygrometrical experiments; since, instead of the hair, there may be substituted any other substance of which a trial may be wanted; and it may be kept extended by a counterpoise more or less heavy as they may require: but the instrument will not admit of being moved, nor serve even for experiments which may subject it to agitation.\n\nTo obviate the objection above-mentioned, M. Saufure has contrived another apparatus more portable and convenient, and which, if not so extensive in its variations, is in fact very firm, and not in the least liable to be deranged by carriage and agitation. Fig. 8. is a representation of this hygrometer, which he calls the portable hygrometer, in distinction from the preceding, which he calls the great hygrometer or the hygrometer with the arbor. The material part of this instrument is its index a b c e; an horizontal view of which, and the arm that carries it, is seen in the separate figure G B D E F. This index carries in its centre D a thin tube hollow throughout, and projects out on each side of the needle. The axis which passes through it, and round which the index turns, is made thin in the middle of its length and thick at the ends; so that the cylindrical tube which it passes through touches it only at two points, and acts upon it only at its extremities.\n\nThe part d e DE of the index serves to point out and mark on the dial the degrees of moisture and dryness; the opposite part d b DB serves to fix both the hair and counterpoise. This part, which terminates in a portion of a circle, and is about a line in thickness, is cut on its edge in a double vertical groove, which makes this part similar to the segment of a pulley with a double neck. These two grooves, which are portions of a circle of two lines radius, and have the same centre with that of the index d, serve in one of them to contain the hair, and in the other the silk, to the end of which the counterpoise is suspended. The same index carries vertically above and below its centre two small screw-pincers, situated opposite to the two grooves: that above at a, opposite to the hindmost groove, serves to fix to the silk to which the counterpoise is suspended; and that below at b, opposite to the hitherto most groove, serves to hold one of the ends of the hair. Each of these grooves has its partitions cut, as seen in the section B, and its bottom made flat, in order that the hair and silk may have the greatest freedom possible. The axis of the needle DD goes through the arm g f G F, and it is fixed to this arm by the tightening screw f E. All the parts of the index should be in perfect equilibrium about its centre; so that when it is on its pivot without the counterpoise, it will rest indifferently in any position it may be placed in.\n\nIt must be understood, that when the hair is fixed by one of its extremities in the pincers e, and by the other end on the pincers y at the top of the instrument, it passes in one of the necks of the double pulley b, whilst the counterpoise to which the silk is fixed in a passes in the other neck of the same pulley: the counterpoise serves to keep the hair extended, and acts always in the same direction and with the same force, whatever...\nHygrometer\u2014whatever the situation of the index may be. When therefore the dryness contracts the hair, it overpowers the gravity of the counterpoise, and the index descends; when, on the contrary, the humidity relaxes the hair, it gives way to the counterpoise, and the index ascends. The counterpoise should weigh but three grains; so that the index should be made very light and very easy in its motion, in order that the least possible force may move it and bring it back again to its point when drawn aside.\n\nThe dial \\( h \\) is circular arch, the centre of which is the same with that of the index. This arch is divided into degrees of the same circle, or into the hundreds of the interval which is found between the limits of extreme dryness and extreme humidity. The interior edge of the dial carries at the distance \\( h \\) a kind of projecting bridle or stay \\( i \\), made of brass wire, curved to the arch, and fixed in the points \\( i \\). This bridle retains and guards the index, at the same time leaving it to play with the requisite freedom. The screw-pincers \\( y \\), in which is fastened the upper extremity of the hair, is carried by a moveable arm, which ascends and descends at pleasure the length of the frame \\( K \\). This frame is cylindrical everywhere else, except its being here flattened at the hinder part to about half its thickness, in order that the piece with the screw which carries the arm should not project out underneath, and that the arm may not turn. The arm may be stopped at any desired height by means of the pressing screw \\( x \\). But as it is of use sometimes to be able to give the instrument a very small and accurate motion, so as to bring the index exactly to the part that may be wanted, the slide piece \\( l \\), which carries the pincers \\( y \\), to which the hair is fixed, is to be moved by the adjusting screw \\( m \\).\n\nAt the base of the instrument is a great lever \\( n o p q \\), which serves to fix the index and its counterpoise when the hygrometer is to be moved. The lever turns an axis \\( n \\), terminated by a screw which goes into the frame; in tightening this screw, the lever is fixed in the desired position. When the motion of the index is to be stopped, the intended position is given to this lever, as represented in the dotted lines of the figure. The long neck \\( p \\) of the lever lays hold of the double pulley \\( b \\) of the index, and the short neck \\( o \\) of the counterpoise: the tightening screw \\( q \\) fastens the two necks at once. In confining the index, it must be so placed, that the hair be very slack; so that, if whilst it is moved the hair should get dry, it may have room to contract itself. Afterwards, when the instrument is placed for use, the first thing to be done is to relax the screw \\( n \\), and turn back the double lever with great care, taking equal caution at the same time not to strain the hair. It is better to apply one hand to the index near its centre, whilst the other hand is disengaging the pulley and the counterpoise from the lever that holds them steady. The hook \\( r \\) serves to suspend a thermometer upon; it should be a mercurial one, with a very small naked bulb or ball, so as to show in the most sensible manner the changes of the air: it should be mounted in metal, and guarded in such a manner as not to vibrate so as to break the hair. Lastly a notch is made under the top of the frame \\( s \\), to mark the point of suspension, about which the instrument is in equilibrium, and keeps a vertical situation.\n\nAll the instrument should be made of brass: though Hygrometer\u2014the axis of the index and its tube work more pleasantly together if made of bell-metal.\n\nThe extent of this hygrometer's variations is not more than the fourth or fifth part of the hygrometer with the arbor. It may be augmented by making the segment of the pulley to which the hair is fixed of a smaller diameter; but then the hair, in moving about it, would fret and contract a stiffness, which would cause it to adhere to the bottom of the neck. M. Sauflure is of opinion, that the radius of this pulley should not be less than two lines, at least that there should be adapted a plate of silver or some other contrivance; but then the hygrometer would be too difficult to construct, and it would require too much attention and care on the part of those who use it: his object was, to make an instrument generally useful, and easy and convenient in its use. The hygrometer with the arbor may be used for observations which require an extreme sensibility.\n\nThe variations of this instrument may be augmented by making it higher, because in that case longer hairs might be adapted; but it would be then less portable. Besides, if the hair is too long when observations are made in the open air, the wind has too great an effect upon it, and thus communicates to the index inconvenient vibrations. It is not proper therefore to make it more than a foot in height. When it is of this dimension, an hair properly prepared can be applied to it, and its variations from extreme dryness to extreme humidity are 80 or even 100 degrees; which on a circle of 3 inches radius forms an extent sufficient for observations of this kind. M. Sauflure has even made smaller instruments that may be carried conveniently in the pocket, and to make experiments with under small receivers: they were but seven inches high by two inches of breadth; which, notwithstanding their variations, were very sensible.\n\nThus much for the construction of the various parts of the instrument. The limits of this work will not admit of our inserting the whole of M. Sauflure's subsequent account of the preparation of the hair, the manner of determining the limits of extreme humidity and of extreme dryness, the pyrometrical variations of the hair, and the graduation of the hygrometer. The following abstract must therefore suffice.\n\nIn the preparation of the hair, it was found necessary to free it of a certain unctuousity it always has in its natural state, which in a great measure deprives it of its hygrometrical sensibility. A number of hairs are boiled in a ley of vegetable alkali; and among these are to be chosen for use such as are most transparent, bright, and soft: particular precautions are necessary for preventing the straining of the hair, which renders it unfit for the intended purpose.\n\nThe two fixed points of the hygrometer are the extremes both of moisture and dryness. The former is obtained by exposing the instrument to air completely saturated with water; and this is effected by placing it in a glass receiver standing in water, the sides of which are kept continually moistened. The point on the dial, at which the hand after a certain interval remains stationary, is marked 100. The point of extreme dryness, not absolute dryness, for that does not exist,\nexist, but the greatest degree of it that can be obtained, is produced by introducing repeatedly into the same receiver containing the instrument, and standing now upon quicksilver, certain quantities of deliquescent alkaline salts, which absorb the moisture of the air. The highest point to which the hand can be brought by this operation, not only when it will rise no higher, but when it becomes retrograde from the dilatation occasioned by heat, is called 0; and the arch between these two points is divided into 100 equal parts, being degrees of the hygrometer. The arch PP, upon which the scale is marked in the instrument (represented in fig. 2.) being part of a circle of three inches diameter; hence every degree measures about one third of a line.\n\nIn the stationary hygrometer, fig. 1., the scale upon the complete circular dial is so much larger, that every degree measures about five lines; but this M. Saufire considers as far from being a perfection, that it is rather an inconvenience; since the instrument becomes thereby so very susceptible of the least impression, that there is even no approaching it without a sensible variation. The thermometer, adapted as before mentioned, serves to correct the changes of temperature: towards the extreme of dryness, 1\u00b0 of the thermometer produces on the hair an effect of half a degree of the hygrometer, but towards the extreme of moisture, the same difference of temperature causes an effect no less than 3\u00b0 on the hygrometer. He constructed two tables, that gave the intermediate hygrometrical variations for single degrees of the thermometer at different parts of the scale.\n\nThe whole range of the atmospherical variations takes in about 75\u00b0 of this scale; a dryness of more than 25\u00b0 being always the effect of art. The sensibility of this instrument is so very great, that being exposed to the dew, he mentions that it varies above 45\u00b0 in about 20 minutes of time. Being removed from a very moist into a very dry air, it varied in one instance no less than 35\u00b0 in three minutes. He says that its variations were always found uniform in different instruments suspended in different parts of the same atmosphere. This hygrometer is considered by the author as possessed of all the properties requisite in such an instrument. These are, 1. That the degrees in the scale be sufficiently large, and to point out even the least variation in the dryness or moisture of the atmosphere. 2. That it be quick in its indications. 3. That it be at all times consistent with itself; viz. that in the same state of the hair it always points to the same degree. 4. That several of them agree with one another. 5. That it be affected only by the aqueous vapours. 6. That its variations be ever proportionate to the changes in the air.\n\nBut after all it must be observed, that a considerable degree of trouble and delicacy is requisite in the preparation of the hair, and it is very fragile; circumstances which may prevent it from coming into general use among common observers, although probably it may be the best in principle of any yet made.\n\nInstead of hairs or cat-gut, of which hygrometers of the first kind are commonly made, Caffebois, a Benedictine monk at Mentz, proposed to make such hygrometers of the gut of a silk-worm. When that insect is ready to spin, there are found in it two vessels proceeding from the head to the stomach, to which they adhere, and then bend towards the back, where they form a great many folds. The part of these vessels next the stomach is of a cylindric form, and about a line in diameter. These vessels contain a gummy sort of matter from which the worm spins its silk; and, though they are exceedingly tender, means have been devised to extract them from the insect, and to prepare them for the above purpose. When the worm is about to spin, it is thrown into vinegar, and suffered to remain there twenty-four hours; during which time the vinegar is absorbed into the body of the insect, and coagulates its juices. The worm being then opened, both the vessels, which have now acquired strength, are extracted; and, on account of their pliability, are capable of considerable extension. That they may not, however, become too weak, they are stretched only to the length of about fifteen or twenty inches. It is obvious that they must be kept sufficiently extended till they are completely dry. Before they attain to that state, they must be freed, by means of the nail of the finger, from a slimy substance which adheres to them. Such a thread will sustain a weight of six pounds without breaking, and may be used for an hygrometer in the same manner as cat-gut; but we confess that we do not clearly perceive its superiority.\n\nII. On the second general principle, namely, that De Luc's, of the swelling of solid bodies by moisture, and their contraction by dryness, M. de Luc's instrument is the best. He makes choice of ivory for the construction of his hygrometer, because he finds that, being once wetted, ivory regularly swells by moisture, and returns exactly to the same dimensions when the moisture is evaporated, which other bodies do not. This hygrometer is represented in fig. 9., where aa b is an ivory tube, open at the end aa, and close at b. It is made of a piece of ivory taken at the distance of some inches from the top, of a pretty large elephant's tooth, and likewise at the same distance from its surface and from the canal which reaches to that point. (This particular direction is given, that the texture of the ivory in all different hygrometers may be the same, which is of great importance.) This piece is to be bored exactly in the direction of its fibres; the hole must be very straight, its dimensions 2\u00bd lines in diameter, and 2 inches 8 lines in depth from aa to c. Its bore is then to be exactly filled with a brass cylinder, which, however, must project somewhat beyond the ivory tube; and thus it is to be turned on a proper machine, till the thickness of the ivory is exactly \u00bc of a line, except at the two extremities. At the bottom b the tube ends in a point; and at the top aa it must for about two lines be left a little thicker, to enable it to bear the pressure of another piece put upon it. Thus the thin or hygrometrical part of the tube will be reduced to 2\u00bc French inches, including the concavity of the bottom. Before this piece is used, it must be put into water, so that the external part alone may be wetted by it; and here it is to remain till the water penetrates to the inside, and appears in the form of dew, which will happen in a few hours. The reason of this is, that the ivory tube remains somewhat larger ever after it is wetted the first time.\n\nFor this hygrometer, a glass tube must be provided, about 14 inches long, the lower end of which is shown in ddee. Its internal diameter is about \u00bc of a line.\nIf now the ivory tube is exactly filled with mercury, and the glass one affixed to it, as the capacity of the former decreases by being dried, the mercury will be forced up into the glass one.\n\nThe piece \\( ffg \\) is intended to join the ivory with the glass tube. It is of brafs, shaped as in the figure. A cylindrical hole is bored through it, which holds the glass tube as tight as possible without danger of breaking it; and its lower part is to enter with some degree of difficulty into the ivory pipe. To hinder that part of the tube which incloses the brafs piece from being affected by the variations of the moisture, it is covered with a brafs vellor represented in \\( hhi \\).\n\nThe pieces must be united together with gum-lac or mastic.\n\nThe introduction of the mercury is the next operation. For this purpose, a slip of paper three inches wide is first to be rolled over the glass tube, and tied fast to the extremity nearest the ivory pipe. A horse-hair is then to be introduced into the tube, long enough to enter the ivory pipe by an inch, and to reach three or four inches beyond the extremity of the glass one. The paper which has been shaped round the tube must now be raised, and used as a funnel to pour the mercury into the instrument, which is held upright. The purest quicksilver is to be used for this purpose, and it will therefore be proper to use that riveted from cinna- bar. It easily runs into the tube; and the air escapes by means of the horse-hair, assisted with some gentle shakes. Fresh mercury must from time to time be supplied, to prevent the mercurial tube from being totally emptied; in which case, the mercurial pellicle which always forms by the contact of the air, would run in along with it.\n\nSome air-bubbles generally remain in the tube; they may be seen through the ivory pipe, which is thin enough to have some transparency. These being collected together by shaking, must be brought to the top of the tube, and expelled by means of the horse-hair. To facilitate this operation, some part of the mercury must be taken out of the tube, in order that the air may be less obstructed in getting out, and the horse-hair have a free motion to assist it. Air, however, cannot be entirely driven out in this manner. It is the weight of the mercury with which the tube is for that reason to be filled, which in time completes its expulsion, by making it pass through the pores of the ivory. To hasten this, the hygrometers are put into a proper box. This is fixed nearly in a vertical direction to the saddle of a horse, which is set a trotting for a few hours. The shakes sometimes divide the column of mercury in the glass tube, but it is easily re-united with the horse-hair. When upon shaking the hygrometer vertically, no small tremulous motion is any longer perceived in the upper part of the column, one may be sure that all the air is gone out.\n\nThe scale of this hygrometer may be adjusted, as soon as the air is gone out, in the following manner. The instrument is to be suspended in a vessel of water cooled with ice, fresh quantities of which are to be added as the former melts. Here it is to remain till it has sunk as low as it will sink by the enlargement of the capacity of the ivory tube, owing to the moisture it has imbibed. This usually happens in seven or eight hours, and is to be carefully noted. In two or three hours the mercury begins to ascend, because the moisture passes into the cavity, and forces it up. The lowest station of the mercury is then to be marked; and for the more accurate marking the degrees on the scale, M. de Luc always chose to have his hygrometric tube made of one which had formerly belonged to a thermometer. The reason of this is, that in the thermometer the expansion of the mercury by heat had been already determined. The distance between the thermometrical points of melting ice and boiling water at 27 French inches of the barometer was found to be 1937 parts. The bulb of this preparatory thermometer was broke in a basin, in order to receive carefully all the mercury that it contained. This being weighed in nice scales amounted to 1428 grains. The hygrometer contained 460 grains of the same mercury. Now it is plain, that the extent of the degrees on the hygrometer, ought to be to that of the degrees on the preparatory thermometer as the different weights of the mercury contained in each; consequently 1428 : 460 :: 1937 : 624 nearly; and therefore the corresponding intervals ought to follow the same proportion: and thus the length of a scale was obtained, which might be divided into as many parts as he pleased.\n\nFig. 10. is a representation of De Luc's hygrometer when fully constructed. In elegance it far exceeds Smeaton's or any other, and probably also in accuracy; for by means of a small thermometer fixed on the board along with it, the expansion of the mercury by heat may be known with great accuracy, and of consequence how much of the height of the mercury in the hygrometer is owing to that cause, and how much to the mere moisture of the atmosphere.\n\nM. de Luc having continued his inquiries further into the modifications of the atmosphere, mentions in his Id\u00e9e sur la M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie another hygrometer, which he finds to be the best adapted to the measure of local humidity. Of all the hygroscopic substances which he tried for this purpose, that which answers the best is a slip of whalebone cut transversely to the direction of the fibres, and made extremely thin; for on this depends its sensibility. A slip of 12 inches in length and a line in breadth, he has made so thin as to weigh only half a grain; and it may be made still thinner, but is then of too great sensibility, being affected even by the approach of the observer. This slip is kept extended by a small spring, and the variations in its length are measured by a vernier division, or by, which is perhaps better, an index on a dial plate: the whole variation from extreme dryness to extreme moisture is about \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of its length.\n\nIn these hygrometers, which are made by the instrument-makers in London, the slip of whalebone is mounted in a frame very similar to that belonging to M. Sauflure's hygrometer before described (see fig. 7.) The only material difference is, that a small concentric wire spring is used, instead of a counterpoise, to keep the slip of whalebone extended. M. Sauflure had tried such a spring applied to his hairs; but the weakest spring he found too strong for the hair; and he was further apprehensive, that the variations which the cold, heat, and the weather infallibly make, would suffer from the force of the springs.\n\nM. de Luc, in the hygrometers he formerly made, as before described (made of ivory), had graduated them from\nHygrometers from one fixed point only, that of extreme moisture, which is obtained by soaking them in water. He has now very ingeniously contrived to fix the other extreme, that of dryness; but this being producible only by means of strong fires, such as hygrometers cannot support, he uses an intermediate body, quicklime; which after having been deprived, by force of fire, of all its own humidity, has the property of slowly imbibing humidity again from the bodies in its neighbourhood; and whose capacity is such that all the vapour that can be contained in a quantity of air equal to its own bulk, can give it no sensible humidity. These hygrometers, inclosed with a large quantity of fresh burnt lime in lumps, acquire in three weeks the same degree of dryness with the lime, which cannot differ sensibly from extreme dryness.\n\nM. de Sauffure makes choice of hairs, prepared by maceration in alkaline lye. M. de Luc shows that hairs, and all other animal or vegetable substances, taken lengthwise, or in the direction of their fibres, undergo contrary changes from different variations of humidity; that, when immersed in water, they lengthen at first, and afterwards shorten; that when they are near the greatest degree of humidity, if the moisture is increased, they shorten themselves; if it is diminished, they lengthen themselves first before they contract again. These irregularities, which obviously render them incapable of being true measures of humidity, he shows to be the necessary consequence of their organic reticular structure.\n\nM. de Sauffure takes his point of extreme moisture from the vapours of water under a glass bell, keeping the sides of the bell continually moistened; and affirms, that the humidity is there constantly the same in all temperatures; the vapours even of boiling water having no more effect than those of cold. M. de Luc shows, on the contrary, that the differences of humidity under the bell are very great, though M. Sauffure's hygrometer was incapable of discovering them; and that the real undecomposed vapour of boiling water has the directly opposite effect to that of cold, the effect of extreme dryness; and on this point he mentions an interesting fact, communicated to him by Mr Watt, viz., that wood cannot be employed in the steam engine for any of those parts where the vapour of the boiling water is confined, because it dries so as to crack, just as if exposed to the fire. In M. de Luc's work above mentioned there are striking instances related, in which the imperfection of M. Sauffure's hygrometer led him into false conclusions respecting phenomena, and into erroneous theories to account for them.\n\nIII. On the third principle, namely, the alteration of the weight of certain substances by their attracting the moisture of the air, few attempts have been made, nor do they seem to have been attended with much success. Sponges dipped in a solution of alkaline salts, and some kinds of paper, have been tried. These are suspended to one end of a very accurate balance, and counterpoised by weights at the other, and show the degrees of moisture or dryness by the ascent or descent of one of the ends. But, besides that such kinds of hygrometers are destitute of any fixed point from whence to begin their scale, they have another inconvenience (from which indeed Smeaton's is not free, and which has been found to render it erroneous), namely, that all saline substances are destroyed by long continued exposure to the air in very small quantities, and therefore can only imbibe the moisture for a certain time. Sulphuric acid has therefore been recommended in preference to the alkaline or neutral salts, and, indeed, for such as do not choose to be at the trouble of constructing a hygrometer on the principles of Mr Smeaton or De Luc, this will probably be found the most easy and accurate. Fig. 11 represents an hygrometer of this kind. A is a small glass cup containing a small quantity of oil of vitriol, B an index counterpoising it, and C the scale; where it is plain, that as the oil of vitriol attracts the moisture of the air, the scale will descend, which will raise the index, and vice versa. This liquor is exceedingly sensible of the increase or decrease of moisture. A single grain, after its full increase, has varied its equilibrium so sensibly that the tongue of a balance, only an inch and a half long, has described an arch, one-third of an inch in compass (which arch would have been almost three inches if the tongue had been one foot), even with so small a quantity of liquor; consequently, if more liquor, expanded under a large surface, were used, a pair of scales might afford as nice an hygrometer as any kind yet invented. A great inconvenience, however, is, that as the air must have full access to the liquid, it is impossible to keep out the dust, which, by continually adding its weight, must render the hygrometer false; add to this, that even oil of vitriol itself is by time destroyed, and changes its nature, if a small quantity of it is continually exposed to the air.\n\nThe best hygrometer upon this principle, and for ascertaining the quantity as well as the degree of moisture in the variation of the hygrometer, is of the contrivance of Mr Coventry, Southwark, London. The account he has favoured us with is as follows.\n\n\"Take two sheets of fine tissue paper, such as is used by haters; dry them carefully at about two feet distance from a tolerably good fire, till after repeatedly weighing them in a good pair of scales no moisture remains. When the sheets are in this perfectly dry state, reduce them to exactly 50 grains; the hygrometer is then fit for use. The sheets must be kept free from dust, and exposed a few minutes in the open air; after which it may be always known by weighing them the exact quantity of moisture they have imbibed.\n\n\"For many years the hygrometer has (says Mr Coventry) engrossed a considerable share of my attention; and every advantage proposed by others, either as it respected the substances of which the instrument was composed, or the manner in which its operations were to be discerned, has been impartially examined. But (adds he) I have never seen an hygrometer so simple in itself, or that would act with such certainty or so equally alike, as the one I have now described. The materials of which it is composed being thin, are easily deprived wholly of their moisture; which is a circumstance efficiently necessary in fixing a datum from which to reckon, and which, I think, cannot be said of any substance hitherto employed in the construction of hygrometers; with equal facility they imbibe or impart the humidity of the atmosphere, and show with the greatest exactness when the least alteration takes place.\"\nWhen the paper is prepared, as already described, it will serve, without the trouble of drying, as a standard for any number of sheets intended for the same purpose. But then the sheets must be kept together in the open air for a few hours; because whatever alteration may take place by this exposure, the paper already weighed must have undergone the same; being consequently in the same state, they must be cut to the same weight.\n\nFor easier weighing the paper, take a piece of round tin or brass the size of a crown-piece, through the centre of which drill a hole, and also three others round it at equal distances; then cut about one hundred papers; and after putting them under the tin or brass, drive through each hole a strong pin into a board, in order to round them to the shape of the plate: the papers must be then separated and exposed to the air a few hours with that already weighed, and so many of them taken as are equal to the weight already specified. This done, threadle them together through those holes made by the pins, putting between every paper on each thread a small bead, in order to prevent the papers from touching each other, and also that the air may be more readily admitted. The top of the hygrometer is covered with a card cut to the same size; and which, by reason of its stiffness, supports all the papers, and keeps them in proper shape. Before the papers are threaded, the beads, silk, card, and a thin piece of brass about the size of a sixpence, which must be placed at the bottom, and through which the centre string passes, must be weighed with the greatest exactness, in order to bring them to a certain weight, suppose 50 grains; now the paper in its driest state being of equal weight, they will weigh together 100 grains, consequently what they weigh more at any time is moisture.\n\nTo obviate the trouble and difficulty of making experiments with weights and scales, Mr Coventry contrived a machine or scale by which to determine at one view the humidity or dryness of the atmosphere. This, with its case, is represented by fig. 12. The front and back of the case are glass; the sides fine gauze, which excludes the dust and admits the air; the case is about ten inches high, 8 inches broad, and 4 inches deep. A, a brass bracket in front, behind which, at about 3\u00bd inches distance, is another; these support the axis of the index E, also of the beam D, and another which supports the item B, to which the ivory scale of divisions C is fixed. G, a brass scale suspended in the usual manner to the end of a beam D, and weighing exactly 100 grains. This scale is an exact counterpoise to the papers I and the different apparatus. The particular manner of suspension in this balance is, from the construction, as follows: The axis of the beam G, which is made of brass, instead of hanging on pivots, as in common scales, turns with two steel edges k k, fixed in the extremities of the brass axis; these edges are shaped like the edge of a knife, and act on two steel concave edges l l, in order to render the friction as small as possible. D, is a fine scale beam fixed at right angles with the axis G. E, the steel index fixed to the under side of the same axis. F, a brass sliding weight: h is the axis that holds the item B to which the scale of divisions C is fixed. AA, the brass brackets which support the whole by four screws, two of which are seen at i i, that screw the Hygrometer brackets to the top of the case. The axis of the scale of divisions is hung on pivots, one of which is seen at m, that, should the case not stand level, the item B may always be in a perpendicular situation.\n\nThe hygrometer, before use, should be adjusted as follows: To the end of the beam where the hygrometer is suspended, hang a weight of 100 grains, which is equal to the weight of the scale; then move the sliding weight F up or down the index E, till one grain will cause the index to traverse neither more nor less than the whole scale of divisions; then add half a grain to the scale, in order to bring the index to 0; and the instrument, after taking off the 100 grain weight and hanging on the papers, is fit for use; then put grain weights in the scale till the index is brought within compass of the scale of divisions. Example: H is 3 grains on the brass scale, and the index points at 10; consequently there is 3 grains and 10 hundredths of a grain of moisture in the papers. If four grain weights are kept, viz. 1, 2, 4, and 5, they will make any number from 1 to 9, which are as many as will be wanted. Sometimes the index will continue traversing within the scale of divisions for many days without shifting the weights; but if otherwise, they must be changed as occasion may require.\n\n\"One great advantage of this hygrometer above all others that have attracted my notice is (says Mr Coventry), that it acts from a certain datum, namely, the dry extreme; from which all the variations towards moist are calculated with certainty: and if constructed with that precision represented by the drawing, it will afford pleasure to the curious in observing the almost perpetual alteration of the atmosphere, even in the most settled weather. In winter it will be constantly traversing from about eight in the morning till four or five in the afternoon, towards dry; and in summer, from about four in the morning till six or seven in the evening, when the weather is hot and gloomy, the hygrometer discovers a very great change towards moisture; and when clear and frosty, that it contains a much greater quantity of moisture than is generally imagined.\"\n\nAn improvement has been proposed of this kind of hygrometer, of which the following circumstance, it is said, suggested the first hint. While Mr Lowitz was at Dmitriewsk in Astracan, he found on banks of the Wolga, a thin bluish kind of slate which attracted moisture remarkably soon, but again suffered it as soon to escape. A plate of this slate weighed, when brought to a red heat, 175 grains, and, when saturated with water, 247: it had therefore imbibed, between complete dryness and the point of complete moisture, 72 grains of water. Lowitz suspended a round thin plate of this slate at the end of a very delicate balance, fastened within a wooden frame, and suspended at the other arm a chain of silver wire, the end of which was made fast to a sliding nut that moved up and down in a small groove on the edge of one side of the frame. He determined, by trial, the position of the nut when the balance was in equilibrium and when it had ten degrees of over-weight, and divided the space between these two points into ten equal parts, adding such a number more of these parts as might be necessary. When the stone was suspended from the one arm\nof the balance, and at the other a weight equal to 175 grains, or the weight of the stone when perfectly dry, the nut in the groove shewed the excess of weight in grains when it and the chain were so adjusted that the balance stood in equilibrium. A particular apparatus on the same principles as a vernier, applied to the nut, shewed the excess of weight to ten parts of a grain.\n\nLowitz remarked that this hygrometer in continued wet weather gave a moisture of more than 1.5 grains, and in a continued heat of 113 degrees of Fahrenheit only 1\u00bd degree of moisture.\n\nThe hygrometer thus invented by Lowitz was, however, attended with this fault, that it never threw off the moisture in the same degree as the atmosphere became drier. It was also sometimes very deceitful, and announced moisture when it ought to have indicated that dryness had again begun to take place in the atmosphere. To avoid these inconveniences, M. Hochheimer proposes the following method:\n\n1. Take a square bar of steel about two lines in thickness, and from ten to twelve inches in length, and form it into a kind of balance, one arm of which ends in a screw. On this screw let there be screwed a leaden bullet of proper weight, instead of the common weights that are suspended.\n\n2. Take a glass plate about ten inches long, and seven inches in breadth; destroy its polish on both sides, free it from all moisture by rubbing it over with warm ashes, suspend it at the other end of the balance, and bring the balance into equilibrium by screwing up or down the leaden bullet.\n\n3. Mark now the place to which the leaden bullet is brought by the screw, as accurately as possible, for the point of the greatest dryness.\n\n4. Then take away the glass plate from the balance, dip it completely in water, give it a shake that the drops may run off from it, and wipe them carefully from the edge.\n\n5. Apply the glass plate thus moistened again to the balance, and bring the latter into equilibrium by screwing the leaden bullet. Mark then the place at which the bullet stands as the highest degree of moisture.\n\n6. This apparatus is to be suspended in a small box of well dried wood, sufficiently large to suffer the glass plate to move up and down. An opening must be made in the lid, exactly of such a size as to allow the tongue of the balance to move freely. Parallel to the tongue apply a graduated circle, divided into a number of degrees at pleasure, from the highest point of dryness to the highest degree of moisture. The box must be pierced with small holes on all the four sides, to give a free passage to the air; and to prevent moisture from penetrating into the wood by rain, when it may be requisite to expose it at a window, it must either be lacquered or painted. To save it at all times from rain, it may be furnished with a sort of roof.\n\nFor a description of Mr Leflie's Hygrometer, fig. 13, and in a more portable form, fig. 14.

Of these, some held only one life, which they called a plastic nature, precluding regularly and invariably over the whole corporeal universe, which they represented as a kind of large plant or vegetable: these were called the cosmoplastic and stoical atheists, because the Stoics held such a nature, though many of them supposed it to be the instrument of the Deity.

This membrane is supposed to be stretched in the neck of the womb of virgins, below the nymphae, leaving in some subjects a very small opening,\nin others larger, and in all rendering the external orifice narrower than the rest of the cavity, and to be broke when they are deflowered; an effusion of blood following the breach.\n\nThe membranous circle may likewise suffer some disorder by too great a flux of the menes, by imprudence, levity, and other particular accidents.\n\nThe hymen is generally looked upon as the test of virginity; and when broke, or withdrawn, shows that the person is not in a state of innocence. This notion is very ancient. Among the Hebrews, it was the custom for the parents to save the blood shed on this occasion as a token of the virginity of their daughter, and to send the sheets next day to the husband's relations. And the like is said to be still practised in Portugal, and some other countries.\n\nAnd yet authors are not agreed as to the existence of such a membrane. Nothing, Dr Drake observes, has employed the curiosity of anatomists, in dissecting the organs of generation in women, more than this part: they have differed not only as to its figure, substance, place, and perforation, but even its reality; some positively affirming, and others flatly denying it.\n\nDe Graaf himself, the most accurate inquirer into the structure of these organs, confesses he always sought it in vain, though in the most unsuspected subjects and ages: all he could find was, a different degree of straitness or wideness, and different corrugations, which were greater or less according to the respective ages; the aperture being still the least, and the rugosities the greatest, as the subject was younger and more untouched.\n\nDr Drake, on the other hand, declares, that in all the subjects he had opportunity to examine, he does not remember to have missed the hymen so much as once, where he had reason to depend on finding it. The fairest view he ever had of it was in a maid who died at thirty years of age; in this he found it a membrane of some strength, furnished with flabby fibres, in figure round, and perforated in the middle with a small hole, capable of admitting the end of a woman's little finger, and situated a little above the orifice of the urinary passage, at the entrance of the vagina of the womb.\n\nIn infants it is a fine thin membrane, not very conspicuous, because of the natural straitness of the passage itself, which does not admit of any great expansion in so little room; which might lead De Graaf into a notion of its being no more than a corrugation.\n\nThis membrane, like most others, does probably grow more distinct, as well as firm, by age. That it not only exists, but is sometimes very strong and impervious, may be collected from the history of a case reported by Mr Cowper. In a married woman, twenty years of age, whose hymen was found altogether impervious, so as to detain the menes, and to be driven out by the prelude thereof beyond the labia of the pudendum, not unlike a prolapsus of the uterus; on dividing it, at least a gallon of grumous blood came forth. It seems the husband, being denied a passage that way, had found another through the meatus urinarius; which was found very open, and its sides extended like the anus of a cock.\n\nUpon a rupture of the hymen, after the consummation of marriage, and especially delivery, its parts shrinking up, are supposed to form those little fleshy Hymen\u00e6a knots, called Carunculae myrtiformes.\n\nHymen\u00e6a, the bastard locust tree; a genus of plants, belonging to the decandria clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 33rd order, Lomentaceae.

Her father, encouraged by her extraordinary genius, had her not only educated in all the ordinary qualifications of her sex, but instructed in the most abstruse sciences. She made such great progress in philosophy, geometry, astronomy, and the mathematics, that she passed for the most learned person of her time. At length she was thought worthy to succeed her father in that distinguished and important employment, the government of the school of Alexandria; and to teach out of that chair where Ammonius, Hierocles, and many other great men, had taught before; and this at a time too when men of great learning abounded both at Alexandria and in many other parts of the Roman empire. Her fame was so extensive, and her worth so universally acknowledged, that we cannot wonder if she had a crowded auditory.\n\nShe explained to her hearers (says Socrates) the several sciences that go under the general name of philosophy; for which reason there was a confluence to her from all parts of those who made philosophy their delight and study. One cannot represent to himself, without pleasure, the flower of all the youth of Europe, Asia, and Africa, sitting at the feet of a very beautiful lady (for such we are assured Hypatia was), all greedily swallowing instruction from her mouth, and many of them, doubtless, love from her eyes; though we are not sure that she ever listened to any solicitations, since Suidas, who talks of her marriage with Isidorus, yet relates at the same time that she died a maid.\n\nHer scholars were as eminent as they were numerous; one of whom was the celebrated Synesius, who was afterwards bishop of Ptolemais. This ancient Christian Platonist everywhere bears the strongest, as well as the most grateful, testimony of the virtue of his tutors; and never mentions her without the most profound respect, and sometimes in terms of affection coming little short of adoration. But it was not Synesius only, and the disciples of the Alexandrian school, who admired Hypatia for her virtue and learning: never was woman more cared for by the public, and yet never woman had a more unspotted character. She was held as an oracle for her wisdom, which made her consulted by the magistrates in all important cases; and this frequently drew her among the greatest concourse of men, without the least censure of her manners. In a word, when Nicephorus intended to pass the highest compliment on the princess Eudocia, he thought he could not do it better than by calling her another Hypatia.\n\nWhile Hypatia thus reigned the brightest ornament of Alexandria, Orestes was governor of the same place for the emperor Theodosius, and Cyril was bishop or patriarch. Orestes having had a liberal education, could not but admire Hypatia; and as a wise governor frequently consulted her. This, together with an aversion which Cyril had against Orestes, proved fatal to the lady. About 500 monks assembling, attacked the governor one day, and would have killed him, had he not been rescued by the townsmen; and the respect which Orestes had for Hypatia causing her to be traduced among the Christian multitude, they dragged her from her chair, tore her to pieces, and burned her limbs. Cyril is not clear from a suspicion of fomenting this tragedy. Cave indeed endeavours to remove the imputation of such an horrible action from the patriarch; and lays it upon the Alexandrian mob in general, whom he calls levissimum hominum genus, \"a very trifling discontented people.\" But though Cyril should be allowed neither to have been the perpetrator, nor even the contriver of it, yet it is much to be suspected that he did not discontinue it in the manner he ought to have done; which suspicion must needs be greatly confirmed by reflecting, that he was so far from blaming the outrage committed by the monks upon Orestes, that he afterwards received the dead body of Ammonius, one of the most forward in that outrage, who had grievously wounded the governor, and who was justly punished with death. Upon this riotous ruffian Cyril made a panegyric in the church where he was laid, in which he extolled his courage and constancy, as one that had contended for the truth; and changing his name to Thaumaturgus, or the \"Admirable,\" ordered him to be considered as a martyr. \"However, (continues Socrates), the wisest part of Christians did not approve the zeal which Cyril showed on this man's behalf, being convinced that Ammonius had justly suffered for his desperate attempt.\"","sp":21,"ep":21},{"h":"HYPECOM","t":"WILD CUMIN, a genus of plants belonging to the tetrandria clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 24th order, Corydalis.

See ORATORY, No. 58.\n\nAn object uncommon with respect to size, either very great of its kind or very little, strikes us with surprize; and this emotion forces upon the mind a momentary conviction that the object is greater or less than it is in reality: the same effect precisely attends figurative grandeur or littleness; and hence the hyperbole, which expresses this momentary conviction.\n\nA writer, taking advantage of this natural delusion, enriches his description greatly by the hyperbole: and the reader, even in his coolest moments, relishes this figure, being sensible that it is the operation of nature upon a warm fancy.\n\nIt cannot have escaped observation that a writer is generally more successful in magnifying by a hyperbole than in diminishing. The reason is, that a minute object contracts the mind, and fetters its powers of imagination; but that the mind, dilated and inflamed with a grand object, moulds objects for its gratification with great facility. Longinus, with respect to a diminishing hyperbole, cites the following ludicrous thought from a comic poet: \"He was owner of a bit of ground not larger than a Lacedemonian letter.\" But, for the reason now given, the hyperbole has by far the greater force in magnifying objects; of which take the following example:\n\nFor all the land which thou seekest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever. And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.\n\nGen. xiii. 15. 16.\n\nIlla vel intabae segetis per funna volaret Gramina, nec teneras curfu lefissi ortifas.\n\n\u00c6neid. vii. 808.\n\nAtque ino barathri ter gurgite vastos Sorbet in abruptum fluctus, rufusque ful auras Erigit alternos, et fidera berate unda.\n\n\u00c6neid. iii. 421.\n\nHorrificis juxta tonat \u00c6tna ruinis,\nInterdumque atram prorumpit ad \u00e6thera nubem,\nTurbine fumanentem piceo et candente favilla:\nAttollitque globos flammarum, et fidera lambit.\n\n\u00c6neid. iii. 571.\n\nSpeaking of Polyphemus,\n\nIps\u00e6 arduus, altaque pulsat Sidera.\n\n\u00c6neid. iii. 619.\n\nWhen he speaks,\nThe air, a charter'd libertine, is still.\n\nHenry V. act. i. sc. 1.\n\nNow shield with shield, with helmet helmet clos'd,\nTo armour armour, lance to lance oppos'd,\n\nHost against host with shadowy squadrons drew,\nThe sounding darts in iron tempests flew,\nVictors and vanquish'd join promiscuous cries,\nAnd thrilling shouts and dying groans arise;\nWith streaming blood the slippery fields are dy'd,\nAnd slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.\n\nIliad iv. 508.\n\nQuintilian is sensible that this figure is natural: \"For (says he), not contented with truth, we naturally incline to augment or diminish beyond it; and for that reason the hyperbole is familiar even among the vulgar and illiterate;\" and he adds, very justly, \"That the hyperbole is then proper, when the object of itself exceeds the common measure.\" From these premises, one would not expect the following inference, the only reason he can find for justifying this figure of speech, Conceditur enim amplius dicere, quia dici quantum ef, non potest: meliusque ultra quam circa flat oratio.\" (We are indulged to say more than enough, because we cannot say enough; and it is better to be above than under.) In the name of wonder, why this flight and childish reasoning, when immediately before he had observed, that the hyperbole is founded on human nature? We could not resist this personal stroke of criticism; intended not against our author, for no human creature is exempt from error; but against the blind veneration that is paid to the ancient classic writers, without distinguishing their blemishes from their beauties.\n\nHaving examined the nature of this figure, and the principle on which it is erected, let us proceed to the rules by which it ought to be governed. And, in the first place, it is a capital fault to introduce an hyperbole in the description of an ordinary object or event; for in such a case, it is altogether unnatural, being destitute of surprize, its only foundation. Take the following instance, where the subject is extremely familiar, viz. swimming to gain the shore after a shipwreck.\n\nI saw him beat the surges under him,\nAnd ride upon their backs: he trode the water;\nWhose enmity he flung aside, and breasted\nThe surge most swollen that met him: his bold head\nAbove the contentious waves he kept, and o'er'd\nHimself with his good arms, in lusty strokes\nTo th' shore, that o'er his wave-born bows bow'd,\nAs stooping to relieve him.\n\nTempest, act ii. sc. 1.\n\nIn the next place, it may be gathered from what is said, that an hyperbole can never suit the tone of any dispiriting passion: sorrow in particular will never prompt such a figure; and for that reason the following hyperboles must be condemned as unnatural:\n\nK. Kich. Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!\nWe'll make foul weather with distil'd tears:\nOur sighs, and they, shall lodge the summer-corn,\nAnd make a death in this revolving land.\n\nRichard II. act. iii. sc. 6.\n\nDraw them to Tyber's bank, and weep your tears\nInto the channel, till the lowest stream\nDo kiss the most exalted shore of all.\n\nJulius C\u00e6sar, act i. sc. 1.\n\nThirdly,\nThirdly, A writer, if he wish to succeed, ought always to have the reader in his eye: he ought, in particular, never to venture a bold thought or expression, till the reader be warned and prepared. For this reason, an hyperbole in the beginning of a work can never be in its place. Example:\n\n*Jam pauc\u00e2 aratro jugera regio*\n*Moles relinquunt.*\nHorat. Carm. lib. ii. ode 15.\n\nIn the fourth place, The nicest point of all is, to ascertain the natural limits of an hyperbole, beyond which being overstrained, it has a bad effect. Longinus (chap. iii.), with great propriety of thought, enters a caveat against an hyperbole of this kind: he compares it to a bow-string, which relaxes by overstraining, and produces an effect directly opposite to what is intended. To ascertain any precise boundary, would be difficult, if not impracticable. We shall therefore only give a specimen of what may be reckoned overstrained hyperboles. No fault is more common among writers of inferior rank; and instances are found even among those of the finest taste; witness the following hyperbole, too bold even for an Hotspur.\n\nHotspur talking of Mortimer:\n*In single opposition hand to hand,\nHe did confound the best part of an hour\nIn changing hardiment with great Glendower.*\nThree times they breath'd, and three times did they drink,\nUpon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;\nWho then affrighted with their bloody looks,\nRan fearfully among the trembling reeds,\nAnd hid his crimp'd head in the hollow bank,\nBlood-stained with these valiant combatants.*\n\nFirst Part Henry IV. act i. sc. 4.\n\nSpeaking of Henry V.\n*England ne'er had a King until this time.\nVirtue he had, delivering to command:\nHis brandish'd sword did blind men with its beams:\nHis arms spread wider than a dragon's wings:\nHis sparkling eyes, replete with awful fire,\nMore dazzled, and drove back his enemies,\nThan mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.\nWhat should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:\nHe never lifted up his hand, but conquer'd.*\nFirst Part Henry VI. act i. sc. 1.\n\nLastly, An hyperbole, after it is introduced with all advantages, ought to be comprehended within the fewest words possible: as it cannot be relished but in the hurry and dwelling of the mind, a leisurely view dissolves the charm, and discovers the description to be extravagant at least, and perhaps also ridiculous. This fault is palpable in a sonnet which passeth for one of the most complete in the French language: Phillis, in a long and florid description, is made as far to outshine the sun as he outlines the stars:\n\n*Le silence regnoit sur la terre et sur l'onde,\nL'air devenoit ferra\u00efn et l'Olimp vermeil,\nEt l'amoureux Zephyr affranchi du sommel,\nRefusait les fleurs d'une haline feconde.*\n\n*L'Aurore deploiait l'on de sa tresse blonde,\nEt fenoit de rubis le chemin du soleil;\nEnfin ce Dieu venoit au plus grand appareil\nQu'il soit jamais venu pour eclaire le monde:\nQuand la jeune Phillis au visage riant,\nSortant de son palais plus clair que l'orient,\nFit voir une lumiere et plus vive et plus belle.*\nSacre Flambeau du jour, n'en soyez point jaloux,\nVous parutes alors aussi peu devant elle,\nQue les feux de la nuit avoient fait devant vous.*\nMalleville.\n\nThere is in Chaucer a thought expressed in a single line, which sets a young beauty in a more advantageous light than the whole of this much laboured poem:\n\n*Up rose the sun, and up rose Emelie.*","sp":22,"ep":23},{"h":"HYPERBOREAN","t":"in the Ancient Geography.

Herodotus doubts whether or not there were any such nations as the Hyperborean. Strabo, who professes that he believes there are, does not take hyperborean to signify beyond Borea or the north, as Herodotus understood it: the preposition \u1f51\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1, in this case, he supposes only to help to form a superlative; so that hyperborean, on his principles, means no more than most northern; by which it appears the ancients scarce knew themselves what the name meant.\u2014Most of our modern geographers, as Hoffman, Cellarius, &c. have placed the Hyperboreans in the northern parts of the European continent, among the Siberians and Samoeds: according to them, the Hyperboreans of the ancients were those in general who lived farther to the north.

Thus we hold, that there is but one nature or essence in God, but three hypostases or persons.\n\nThe term hypostasis is of a very ancient standing in the church. St Cyril repeats it several times, as also the phrase union according to hypostasis. The first time it occurs is in a letter from that father to Nectarius, where he uses it instead of \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03ce\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5, the word we commonly render person, which did not seem expressive enough. \"The philosophers (says St Cyril) have allowed three hypostases: They have extended the Divinity to three hypostases: They have even sometimes used the word trinity: And nothing was wanting but to have admitted the consubstantiality of the three hypostases, to show the unity of the divine nature, exclusive of all triplicity in respect of distinction of nature, and not to hold it necessary to conceive any respective inferiority of hypostases.\"\n\nThis term occasioned great differences in the ancient church; first among the Greeks, and afterwards also among the Latins. In the council of Nice, hypostasis was defined to denote the same with essence or substance; so that it was hereby to say that Jesus Christ was of a different hypostasis from the Father; but custom altered its meaning. In the necessity they were under of expressing themselves strongly against the Sabellians, the Greeks made choice of the word hypostasis, and the Latins of persona; which change proved the occasion of endless disagreement. The phrase \u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd\u03ce\u03c0\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, used by the Greeks, scandalized the Latins, whose usual way of rendering \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 in their language was by \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2. The barrenness of the Latin tongue in theological phrases, allowed them but one word for the two Greek ones, \u1f10\u03bd\u03ce\u03c0\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd and \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2; and thus disabled them from distinguishing essence from hypostasis. For which reason they chose rather to use the term \u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2, and \u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2 \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2.\u2014An end was put to logomachias, in a synod held at Alexandria about the year 362, at which St Athanasius assented; from which time the Latins made no great scruple of saying \u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2 \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2, nor the Greeks of three persons.","sp":25,"ep":25},{"h":"HYPOTHECA","t":"in the Civil Law, an obligation, whereby the effects of a debtor are made over to his creditor, to secure his debt. The word comes from the Greek \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc\u03b8\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1, a thing subject to some obligation; of the verb \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03ad\u03ba\u03c9, suppose, \"I am rejected;\" of \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc under, and \u1f14\u03c7\u03c9 pono, \"I put.\"\n\nAs the hypotheca is an engagement procured on purpose for the security of the creditor, various means have been made use of to secure to him the benefit of the convention. The use of the pawn or pledge is the most ancient, which is almost the same thing with the hypotheca; all the difference consisting in this, that the pledge is put into the creditor's hands; whereas, in a simple hypotheca, the thing remained in the possession of the debtor. It was found more easy and commodious to engage an estate by a civil covenant than by an actual delivery: accordingly the expedient was first practised among the Romans; and from them the Romans borrowed both the name and the thing; only the Greeks, the better to prevent frauds, used to fix some visible mark on the thing, that the public might know it was hypothecate or mortgaged by the proprietor; but the Romans, looking on such advertisements as injurious to the debtor, forbade the use of them.\n\nThe Roman lawyers distinguished four kinds of hypothecas: the conventional, which was with the will and consent of both parties; the legal, which was appointed by law, and for that reason called tacit; the praetor's pledge, when by the flight or non-appearing of the debtor, the creditor was put in possession of his effects; and the judiciary, when the creditor was put in possession by virtue of a sentence of the court.\n\nThe conventional hypotheca is subdivided into general and special. The hypotheca is general, when all the debtor's effects, both present and future, are engaged to the creditor. It is special, when limited to one or more particular things.\n\nFor the tacit hypotheca, the civilians reckon no less than twenty-five different species thereof.","sp":25,"ep":25},{"h":"HYPOTHENUSE","t":"in Geometry, the longest side of a right-angled triangle, or that which subtends the right angle.","sp":25,"ep":25},{"h":"HYPOTHESIS","t":"(formed of \u1f51\u03c0\u03cc under, and \u1f14\u03c7\u03c9 pono, \"I put\"), is a proposition or principle which we suppose, or take for granted, in order to draw conclusions for the proof of a point in question.\n\nIn disputation, they frequently make false hypotheses, in order to draw their antagonists into absurdities; and even in geometry truths are often deducible from such false hypotheses.\n\nEvery conditional or hypothetical proposition may be distinguished into hypothesis and thesis: the first rehearses the conditions under which any thing is affirmed or denied; and the latter is the thing itself affirmed or denied. Thus, in the proposition, a triangle is half of a parallelogram, if the bases and altitudes of the two be equal; the latter part is the hypothesis, \"if the bases,\" &c., and the former a thesis, \"a triangle is half a parallelogram.\"\n\nIn strict logic, we are never to pass from the hypo-","sp":25,"ep":25},{"h":"HYPOTHESIS","t":"in Physics, &c., denotes a kind of system laid down from our own imagination, whereby to account for some phenomenon or appearance of nature.

The latest and best writers are for excluding hypotheses, and standing wholly on observation and experiment. Whatever is not deduced from phenomena, says Sir Isaac Newton, is an hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical, or physical, or mechanical, or of occult qualities, have no place in experimental philosophy.\n\nThe Cartesians take upon them to suppose what affections in the primary particles of matter they please; just what figures, what magnitudes, what motions, and what situations, they find for their purpose. They also feign certain unseen, unknown fluids, and endue them with the most arbitrary properties; give them a subtilty which enables them to pervade the pores of all bodies, and make them agitated with the most unaccountable motions. But is not this to set aside the real constitution of things, and to substitute dreams in their place? Truth is scarce attainable even by the surest observations; and will fanciful conjectures ever come at it? They who found their speculations on hypotheses, even though they argue from them regularly, according to the strictest laws of mechanics, may be said to compose an elegant and artful fable; but it is still only a fable.\n\nHYPOTHESIS is more particularly applied in astronomy to the several systems of the heavens; or the different ways in which different astronomers have supposed the heavenly bodies to be ranged, moved, &c.\n\nThe principal hypotheses are the Ptolemaic, Copernican, and Tychoonic.

Farther than this, as Pliny observes, they did not go in their notation; but, when necessary repeated the last number, as CCCICOO, CCCICOO, for 200,000; CCCICOO, CCCICOO, CCCICOO, for 300,000; and so on.\n\nThe ancients sometimes changed i into u; decimus for decimius; maximus for maximus, &c.\n\nAccording to Plato, the vowel i is proper to express delicate but humble things, as in this verse in Virgil which abounds in i's, and is generally admired:\n\nAccipiant inimicum imbreem, rimisque satiarent.\n\nI, used as an abbreviation, is often substituted for the whole word Jesus, of which it is the first letter.","sp":26,"ep":27},{"h":"IAMBIC","t":"in ancient poetry, a sort of verse, so called from its consisting either wholly, or in great part, of iambus's.

The aspect of ice-houses should be towards the east or south-east, for the advantage of the morning sun to expel the damp air, as that is more pernicious than warmth; for which reason trees in the vicinity of an ice-house tend to its disadvantage.\n\nThe best soil for an ice-house to be made in is chalk, as it conveys away the waste water without any artificial drain; next to that, loose flinty earth or gravelly soil. Its situation should be on the side of a hill, for the advantage of entering the cell upon a level, as in the drawing, Plate CCLXXXVIII.\n\nTo construct an ice-house, first choose a proper place at a convenient distance from the dwelling-house or houses it is to serve; dig a cavity (if for one family, of the dimensions specified in the design) of the figure of an inverted cone, sinking the bottom concave, to form a reservoir for the waste water till it can drain off; if the soil requires it, cut a drain to a considerable distance, or so far as will come out at the side of the hill, or into a well, to make it communicate with the springs, and in that drain form a flink or air-trap, marked l, by sinking the drain so much lower in that place as it is high, and bring a partition from the top an inch or more into the water, which will consequently be in the trap; and will keep the well air-tight. Work up a sufficient number of brick piers to receive a cart-wheel, to be laid with its convex side upwards to receive the ice; lay hurdles and straw upon the wheel, which will let the melted ice drain through, and serve as a floor. The sides and dome of the cone are to be nine inches thick\u2014the sides to be done in screened brickwork, i.e., without mortar, and wrought at right angles to the face of the work: the filling in behind should be with gravel, loose stones, or brick-bats, that the water which drains through the sides may the more easily escape into the well. The doors of the ice-house should be made as close as possible, and bundles of straw placed always before the inner door to keep out the air.\n\nDescription of the parts referred to by the letters.\u2014\na The line first dug out. b The brick circumference of the cell. c The diminution of the cell downwards. d The lesser diameter of the cell. e The cart-wheel or joists and hurdles. f The piers to receive the wheel or floor. g The principal receptacle for straw. h The inner pallage, i the first entrance, k the outer door, pallages having a separate door each. l An air trap. m The well. n The profile of the piers. o The ice filled in. p The height of the cone. q The dome worked in two half brick arches. r The arched pallage. s The door-ways inserted in the walls. t The floor of the pallage. u An aperture through which the ice may be put into the cell; this must be covered next the crown of the dome, and then filled in with earth. v The sloping door, against which the straw should be laid.\n\nThe ice when to be put in should be collected during the frost, broken into small pieces, and rammed down hard in strata of not more than a foot, in order to make it one complete body; the care in putting it in, and well ramming it, tends much to its preservation. In a season when ice is not to be had in sufficient quantities, snow may be substituted.\n\nIce may be preserved in a dry place under ground, by covering it well with chaff, straw, or reeds.\n\nGreat use is made of chaff in some places of Italy to preserve ice: the ice-house for this purpose need only be a deep hole dug in the ground on the side of a hill, from the bottom of which they can easily carry out a drain, to let out the water which is separated at any time from the ice, that it may not melt and spoil the raft. If the ground is tolerably dry, they do not line the sides with anything, but leave them naked, and only make a covering of thatch over the top of the hole: this pit they fill either with pure snow, or else with ice taken from the purest and clearest water; because they do not use it as we do in England, to let the bottles in, but really mix it with the wine. They first cover the bottom of the hole with chaff, and then lay the ice, not letting it anywhere touch the sides, but ramming in a large bed of chaff all the way between: they thus carry on the filling to the top, and then cover the surface with chaff; and in this manner it will keep as long as they please. When they take any of it out for use, they wrap the lump up in chaff, and it may then be carried to any distant place without waste or melting.\n\nIt appears from the investigation of Professor Beckman, in his History of Inventions, that the ancients from the earliest ages were acquainted with the method of preserving snow for the purpose of cooling liquors in summer. \"This practice,\" (he observes), is mentioned by Solomon*; and proofs of it are so numerous in *Proverbs, the works of the Greeks and the Romans, that it is unnecessary for me to quote them, especially as they have been collected by others. How the repositories for keeping it were constructed, we are not expressly told; but it is probable that the snow was preserved in pits or trenches.\n\n\"When Alexander the Great besieged the city of Petra, he caused 30 trenches to be dug, and filled with snow, which was covered with oak branches; and which kept in that manner for a long time. Plutarch says, that a covering of chaff and coarse cloth is sufficient; and at present a like method is pursued in Portugal. Where the snow has been collected in a deep gulf, some grats or green sods, covered with dung from the sheep\nICE\n\nsheep pens, is thrown over it; and under these it is so well preserved, that the whole summer through it is sent the distance of 60 Spanish (nearly 180 English) miles to Lisbon.\n\n\"When the ancients, therefore, wished to have cooling liquors, they either drank the melted snow, or put some of it in their wine; or they placed jars filled with wine in the snow, and suffered it to cool there as long as they thought proper. That ice was also preserved for the like purpose, is probable from the testimony of various authors; but it appears not to have been used to much in warm countries as in the northern. Even at present snow is employed in Italy, Spain, and Portugal; but in Perfin ice. I have never anywhere found an account of Grecian or Roman ice-houses. By the writers on agriculture they are not mentioned.\"\n\nIce-Island, a name given by sailors to a great quantity of ice collected into one huge solid mass, and floating about upon the seas near or within the Polar circles.\n\n\u2014Many of these fluctuating islands are met with on the coasts of Spitzbergen, to the great danger of the shipping employed in the Greenland fishery. In the midst of those tremendous masses navigators have been arrested and frozen to death. In this manner the brave Sir Hugh Willoughby perished with all his crew in 1553; and in the year 1773, Lord Mulgrave, after every effort which the most finished seaman could make to accomplish the end of his voyage, was caught in the ice, and was near experiencing the same unhappy fate. See the account at large in Phipps's Voyage to the North Pole.\n\nAs there described, the scene, divested of the horror from the eventful expectation of change, was the most beautiful and picturesque.\u2014Two large ships becalmed in a vast basin, surrounded on all sides by islands of various forms: the weather clear: the sun gliding the circumambient ice, which was low, smooth, and even; covered with snow, excepting where the pools of water on part of the surface appeared crystaline with the young ice: the small space of sea they were confined in perfectly smooth. After fruitless attempts to force a way through the fields of ice, their limits were perpetually contracted by its closing; till at length it belet each vessel till they became immovably fixed. The smooth extent of surface was soon lost: the pressure of the pieces of ice, by the violence of the swell, caused them to pack: fragment rose upon fragment, till they were in many places higher than the main-yard. The movements of the ships were tremendous and involuntary, in conjunction with the surrounding ice, actuated by the currents. The water shoaled to 14 fathoms. The grounding of the ice or of the ships would have been equally fatal: The force of the ice might have crushed them to atoms, or have lifted them out of the water and overflown them, or have left them suspended on the summits of the pieces of ice at a tremendous height, exposed to the fury of the winds; or to the risk of being dashed to pieces by the failure of their frozen deck. An attempt was made to cut a passage through the ice; after a perseverance worthy of Britons, it proved fruitless. The commander, at all times master of himself, directed the boats to be made ready to be hauled over the ice, till they arrived at navigable water (a task alone of seven days), and in them to make their voyage to England. The boats were drawn progressively three whole days. At length a wind sprung up, the ice separated sufficiently to yield to the pressure of the full-laded ships, which, after labouring against the resisting fields of ice, arrived on the 10th of August in the harbour of Smeeringberg, at the west end of Spitzbergen, between it and Hackluyt's Headland.\n\nThe forms assumed by the ice in this chilling climate are extremely pleasing to even the most incurious eye. The surface of that which is congealed from the sea water (for we must allow it two origins) is flat and even, hard, opake, resembling white sugar, and incapable of being slid on, like the British ice. The greater pieces, or fields, are many leagues in length: the lesser are the meadows of the seas, on which these animals at times frolic by hundreds. The motion of the lesser pieces is as rapid as the currents: the greater, which are sometimes 200 leagues long, and 60 or 80 broad, move slow and majestically; often fix for a time, immoveable by the power of the ocean, and then produce near the horizon that bright white appearance called the blink. The approximation of two great fields produces a most singular phenomenon: it forces the lesser (if the term can be applied to pieces of several acres square) out of the water, and adds them to their surface; a second and often a third succeeds; so that the whole forms an aggregate of a tremendous height. These float in the sea like so many rugged mountains, and are sometimes 500 or 600 yards thick; but the far greater part is concealed beneath the water. These are continually increased in height by the freezing of the spray of the sea, or of the melting of the snow, which falls on them. Those which remain in this frozen climate receive continual growth; others are gradually wafted by the northern winds into southern latitudes, and melt by degrees, by the heat of the sun, till they waft away, or disappear in the boundless element.\n\nThe collision of the great fields of ice, in high latitudes, is often attended with a noise that for a time takes away the sense of hearing anything else; and the lesser with a grinding of unpealable horror. The water which dashes against the mountainous ice freezes into an infinite variety of forms; and gives the voyager ideal towns, streets, churches, steeples, and every shape which imagination can frame.\n\nICE-PLANT.

Among the most remarkable are those of the east coast of Spitzbergen (see GREENLAND, no. 10.)

The glaciers of Switzerland seem contemptible to these; but present often a similar front into some lower valley. The last exhibits over the sea a front 300 feet high, emulating the emerald in colour; cataracts of melted snow precipitate down various parts, and black spiring mountains, streaked with white, bound the sides, and rise crag above crag, as far as eye can reach in the background. See Plate CCLXXVIII. At times immense fragments break off, and tumble into the water, with a most alarming dashings. A piece of this vivid green substance has fallen, and grounded in 24 fathoms water, and spired above the surface 50 feet.

These icebergs are the creation of ages, and receive annually additional height by the falling of snows and rain, which often instantly freezes, and more than repairs the loss occasioned by the influence of the melting sun.","sp":60,"ep":63},{"h":"ICELAND","t":"a large island lying in the northern part of the Atlantic ocean, between 63 and 68 degrees of north latitude, and between 10 and 26 degrees of west longitude; its greatest length being about 700 miles, and its breadth 390.\n\nThis country lying partly within the frigid zone, and being liable to be surrounded with vast quantities of ice which come from the polar seas, is, on account of the coldness of its climate, very inhospitable; but much so for other reasons. It is exceedingly subject to earthquakes; and so full of volcanoes, that the little part of it which appears fit for the habitation of man seems almost totally laid waste by them. The best account that hath yet appeared of the island of Iceland is in a late publication, intitled \"Letters on Iceland, &c. written by Uno Von Troil, D.D. first chaplain to his Swedish majesty.\" This gentleman sailed from London on the 12th of July 1772, in company with Mr Banks, Dr Solander, and Dr James Lind of Edinburgh, in a ship for which 100l. sterling was paid every month. After visiting the Western isles of Scotland, they arrived on the 28th of August at Iceland; where they call anchor at Bessafelladr or Bessafelladr, lying in about 64\u00b0 6' N. Lat. in the western part of the island. The country had to them the most dismal appearance that can be conceived. \"Imagine to yourself (says Dr Troil) a country, which from one end to the other presents to your view only barren mountains, whose summits are covered with eternal snow, and between them fields divided by vitrified cliffs, whose high and sharp points seem to vie with each other to deprive you of the sight of a little grass which scantily springs up among them. These same dreary rocks likewise conceal the few scattered habitations of the natives, and nowhere a single tree appears which might afford shelter to friendship and innocence. The prospect before us, though not pleasing, was uncommon and surprising. Whatever presented itself to our view bore the marks of devastation; and our eyes, accustomed to behold the pleasing coasts of England, now saw nothing but the vestiges of the operation of a fire, Heaven knows how ancient!\"\n\nThe climate of Iceland, however, is not unwholesome, or naturally subject to excessive colds, notwithstanding its northerly situation. There have been instances indeed of Fahrenheit's thermometer sinking to 24\u00b0 below the freezing point in winter, and rising to 102\u00b0 in summer. Since the year 1749, observations have been made on the weather; and the result of these observations hath been unfavourable, as the coldness of the climate is thought to be on the increase, and of consequence the country is in danger of becoming unfit for the habitation of the human race. Wood, which formerly grew in great quantities all over the island, cannot now be raised. Even the hardy firs of Norway cannot be reared in this island. They seemed indeed to thrive till they were about two feet high; but then their tops withered, and they ceased to grow. This is owing chiefly to the storms and hurricanes which frequently happen in the months of May and June, and which are very unfavourable to vegetation of every kind. In 1772, Governor Thodal sowed a little barley, which grew very briskly; but a short time before it was to be reaped, a violent storm so effectually destroyed it, that only a few grains were found scattered about. Besides these violent winds, this island lies under another disadvantage, owing to the floating ice already mentioned, with which the coasts are often beset. This ice comes on by degrees, always with an easterly wind, and frequently in such quantities as to fill up all the gulfs on the north-west side of the island, and even covers the sea as far as the eye can reach; it also sometimes drives to other shores. It generally comes in January, and goes away in March. Sometimes it only reaches the land in April; and, remaining there for a long time, does an incredible deal of mischief. It consists partly of mountains of ice, said to be sometimes 60 fathoms in height; and partly of field ice, which is neither so thick nor so much dreaded. Sometimes these enormous masses are grounded in shoal-water; and in these cases they remain for many months, nay years, undisturbed, chilling the atmosphere for a great way round. When many such bulky and lofty ice-masses are floating together, the wood which is often found drifting between them, is so much chafed, and pressed with such violence together, that it sometimes takes fire; which circumstance has occasioned fabulous accounts of the ice being in flames.\n\nIn 1753 and 1754, this ice occasioned such a violent cold, that horses and sheep dropped down dead by reason of it, as well as for want of food; horses were observed to feed upon dead cattle, and the sheep ate off each other's wool. In 1755, towards the end of the month of May, the waters were frozen over in one night to the thickness of an inch and five lines. In 1756, on the 26th of June, snow fell to the depth of a yard, and continued falling through the months of July and August. In the year following it froze very hard towards the end of May and beginning of June, in the south part of the island, which occasioned a great scarcity of grass. These frosts are generally followed by a famine, many examples of which are to be found in the Icelandic chronicles. Besides these calamities, a number of bears annually arrive with the ice, which commit great ravages among the sheep. The Icelanders attempt to destroy these intruders as soon as they get sight of them. Sometimes they assemble together, and drive them back to the ice, with which they often float off again. For want of firearms, they are obliged to use spears on these occasions. The government also encourages the destruction of these animals,\nIceland. by paying a premium of 10 dollars for every bear that is killed, and purchasing the skin of him who killed it.\n\nNotwithstanding this dismal picture, however, taken from Von Troil's letters, some tracts of ground, in high cultivation, are mentioned as being covered by the great eruption of lava in 1783. It is possible, therefore, that the above may have been somewhat exaggerated.\n\nThunder and lightning are seldom heard in Iceland, except in the neighbourhood of volcanoes. Aurora Borealis is very frequent and strong. It most commonly appears in dry weather; though there are not wanting instances of its being seen before or after rain, or even during the time of it. The lunar halo, which prognosticates bad weather, is likewise very frequent here; as are also parhelions, which appear from one to nine in number at a time. These parhelions are observed chiefly at the approach of the Greenland ice, which an intense degree of frost has produced, and the frozen vapours fill the air. Fire-balls, sometimes round and sometimes oval, are observed, and a kind of ignis fatuus which attaches itself to men and beasts; and comets are also frequently mentioned in their chronicles. This last circumstance deserves the attention of astronomers.\n\nIceland, besides all the inconveniences already mentioned, has two very terrible ones, called by the natives ferida and finafloki: the name of the first imports large pieces of a mountain tumbling down and destroying the lands and houses which lie at the foot of it: this happened in 1554, when a whole farm was ruined, and thirteen people buried alive. The other word signifies the effects of a prodigious quantity of snow, which covers the top of the mountains, rolling down in immense masses, and doing a great deal of damage: of this there was an instance in 1669, during the night, when two farms were buried, with all their inhabitants and cattle. This last accident Iceland has in common with all very mountainous countries, particularly Switzerland.\n\n\"Iceland abounds with hot and boiling springs, some of which spout up into the air to a surprising height. All the jets d'eau which have been contrived with so much art, and at such an enormous expense, cannot by any means be compared with these wonders of nature in Iceland. The water-works at Herrenhausen throw up a single column of water of half a quarter of a yard in circumference to a height of about 70 feet; those at the Winterkette at Cassel throw it up, but in a much thinner column, 130 feet; and the jet d'eau at St Cloud, which is thought the greatest of all the French water-works, casts up a thin column 80 feet into the air; but some springs in Iceland pour forth columns of water several feet in thickness to the height of many fathoms; and many affirm of several hundred feet.\n\n\"These springs are unequal in their degrees of heat; but we have observed none under 188 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer; in some it is 192, 193, 212, and in one small vein of water 213 degrees. From some the water flows gently, and the spring is then called laug, \"a bath;\" from others it spouts with a great noise, and is then called Huer, or kitter. It is very common for some of these spouting springs to\n\nIceland. cole up, and others to appear in their stead. All Iceland. these hot waters have an incrusting quality, so that we very commonly find the exterior surface from whence it bursts forth covered with a kind of rind, which almost resembles chafed work, and which we at first took for lime, but which was afterwards found by Mr Bergman to be of a filaceous or flinty nature. In some places the water tastes of sulphur, in others not; but when drank as soon as it is cold, tastes like common boiled water. The inhabitants use it at particular times for dyeing; and were they to adopt proper regulations, it might be of still greater use. Victuals may also be boiled in it, and milk held over its steam becomes sweet; owing, most probably, to the excessive heat of the water, as the same effect is produced by boiling it a long time over the fire. They have begun to make salt by boiling sea water over it, which when it is refined, is very pure and good. The cows which drink this hot water yield a great deal of milk. Egbert Olafsen relates, that the water does not become turbid when alkali is thrown into it, nor does it change the colour of syrup of violets. Horrebow affirms, that if you fill a bottle at one of the spouting springs, the water will boil over two or three times while the spring throws forth its water; and if corked too soon, the bottle will burst.\n\n\"Among the many hot springs to be met with in Iceland, several bear the name of geyser: the following is a description of the most remarkable of that name, named from Hecla, near a farm called Haukadul. Here a poet would have an opportunity of painting whatever nature has of beautiful and terrible, united in one picture, by delineating this surprising phenomenon. Refuse to yourself a large field, where you see on one side, at a great distance, high mountains covered with ice, whose summits are generally wrapped in clouds, so that their sharp and unequal points become invisible. This loss, however, is compensated by a certain wind, which causes the clouds to sink, and cover the mountain itself, when its summit appears as it were to rest on the clouds. On the other side Hecla is seen, with its three points covered with ice, rising above the clouds, and, with the smoke which ascends from it, forming other clouds at some distance from the real ones: and on another side is a ridge of high rocks, at the foot of which boiling water from time to time issues forth; and further on extends a marsh of about three English miles in circumference, where are 40 or 50 boiling springs, from which a vapour ascends to a prodigious height.\u2014In the midst of these is the greatest spring geyser, which deserves a more exact and particular account. In travelling to the place, about an English mile and a half from the river, from which the ridge of rocks still divided us, we hear a loud roaring noise, like the rushing of a torrent precipitating itself from stupendous rocks. We asked our guide what it meant; he answered, it was geyser roaring; and we soon saw with our naked eyes what before seemed almost incredible.\n\n\"The depth of the opening or pipe from which the water gushes cannot well be determined; for sometimes the water sunk down several fathoms, and some seconds passed before a stone which was thrown into the aperture reached the surface of the water. The opening itself was perfectly round, and 19 feet in diameter,\nmeter, and terminated in a basin 59 feet in diameter. Both the pipe and the basin were covered with a rough halastic rind, which had been formed by the force of the water; the outermost border of the basin is nine feet and an inch higher than the pipe itself. The water here spouted several times a day, but always by fits, and after certain intervals. The people who lived in the neighbourhood told us, that they rose higher in cold and bad weather than at other times; and Egbert Olafsen and several others affirm, that it has spouted to the height of 60 fathoms. Most probably they guessed only by the eye, and on that account their calculation may be a little extravagant; and indeed it is to be doubted whether the water was ever thrown up so high, though probably it sometimes mounts higher than when we observed it. The method we took to observe the height was as follows. Every one in company wrote down, at each time that the water spouted, how high it appeared to him to be thrown, and we afterwards chose the medium. The first column marks the spoutings of the water, in the order in which they followed one another; the second, the time when these effusions happened; the third, the height to which the water rose; and the last, how long each spouting of water contained.\n\n| No | Time   | Height | Duration |\n|----|--------|--------|----------|\n| 1  | At VI 42 m. | 30 feet | 0 20 seconds |\n| 2  | 51     | 6      | 0 20     |\n| 3  | VII 16 | 6      | 0 10     |\n| 4  | 31     | 12     | 0 15     |\n| 5  | 51     | 60     | 0 6      |\n| 6  | VIII 17 | 24    | 0 30     |\n| 7  | 29     | 18     | 0 40     |\n| 8  | 36     | 12     | 0 40     |\n\nThe pipe was now for the first time full of water, which ran slowly into the basin.\n\n| No | Time   | Height | Duration |\n|----|--------|--------|----------|\n| 9  | IX 25  | 48     | 1 10     |\n| 10 | X 16   | 24     | 1 00     |\n\n\"At 35 minutes after twelve we heard, as it were, three discharges of a gun under ground, which made it shake: the water flowed over immediately, but instantly sunk again. At eight minutes after two, the water flowed over the border of the basin. At 15 minutes after three, we again heard several subterranean noises, though not so strong as before. At 43 minutes after four, the water flowed over very strongly during the space of a minute. In five minutes after, we heard many loud subterranean discharges, not only near the spring, but also from the neighbouring ridge of rocks, where the water spouted. At 51 minutes after six, the fountain spouted up to the height of 92 feet, and continued to do so for four minutes. After this great effort, it sunk down very low into the pipe, and was entirely quiet during several minutes; but soon began to bubble again: it was not, however, thrown up into the air, but only to the top of the pipe.\n\n\"The force of the vapours which throw up these waters is excessive: it not only prevents the stones which are thrown into the opening from sinking, but even throws them up to a very great height, together with the water. When the basin was full, we placed ourselves before the sun in such a manner that we could see our shadows in the water; when every one observed round the shadow of his own head (though not round that of the heads of others), a circle of almost the same colours which compose the rainbow, and round this another bright circle. This most probably proceeded from the vapours exhaling from the water.\n\n\"Not far from this place, another spring at the foot of the neighbouring ridge of rocks spouted water to the height of one or two yards each time. The opening through which this water issued was not so wide as the other: we imagined it possible to stop up the hole entirely by throwing large stones into it, and even flattered ourselves that our attempts had succeeded: but, to our astonishment, the water gushed forth in a very violent manner. We hastened to the pipe, and found all the stones thrown aside, and the water playing freely through its former channel. In these large springs the waters were hot in the highest degree, and tasted a little of sulphur; but in other respects it was pure and clear. In the smaller springs of the neighbourhood the water was tainted: in some, it was as muddy as that of a clay-pit: in others, as white as milk; and in some few, as red as blood.\n\n\"Iceland abounds with pillars of basaltic Account of the lower sort of people imagine have been piled upon the basaltic each other by the giants, who made use of supernatural force to effect it. They have generally from three to seven sides; and are from four to six feet in thickness, and from 12 to 16 yards in length, without any horizontal divisions. But sometimes they are only from six inches to one foot in height, and they are then very regular, inasmuch that they are sometimes made use of for windows and door-panes. In some places they only peep out here and there among the lava, or more frequently among the tufa; in other places they are quite overthrown, and pieces of broken pillars only make their appearance. Sometimes they extend without interruption for two or three miles in length. In one mountain they have a singular appearance: on the top the pillars lie horizontally, in the middle they are sloping; the lowest are perfectly perpendicular; and in some parts they are bent into a semicircular figure. The matter of the Iceland basaltic seems to be the same with that of Staffa; though in some it is more porous, and inclines to a gray. Some we observed which were of a blackish gray, and composed of several joints. Another time we observed a kind of porous glassy stone, consequently a lava, which was so indistinctly divided, that we were for some time at a loss to determine whether it was basaltic or not, though at last we all agreed that it was.\n\n\"Iron ore is found in some parts of the island, and that beautiful copper ore called malachites. Horrebows speaks of native silver. A stratum of sulphur is found near Myvatu from nine inches to two feet in thickness; partly of a brown colour, and partly of a deep orange. Immediately over the sulphur is a blue earth; above that a vitriolic and aluminoous one; and beneath the sulphur a reddish bole.\n\n\"At what time the island of Iceland was first peopled History of is uncertain. An English colony indeed is said to the island have been settled there in the beginning of the fifth century.\"\nIceland. century; but of this there are not sufficient proofs. There is, however, reason to suppose that the English and Irish were acquainted with this country under another name, long before the arrival of the Norwegians; for the celebrated Bede gives a pretty accurate description of the island. But of the original inhabitants we cannot pretend to say anything, as the Iceland chronicles go no farther back than the arrival of the Norwegians. What they relate is to the following purpose.\n\nNaddodd, a famous pirate, was driven on the coast of Iceland in 861, and named the country Snio-land, \"Snow-land,\" on account of the great quantities of snow with which he perceived the mountains covered. He did not remain there long; but on his return extolled the country to such a degree, that one Gardar Suaforson, an enterprising Swede, was encouraged by his account to go in search of it in 864. He failed quite round the island, and gave it the name of Garda\u00f0holmur, or Gardar's island. Having remained in Iceland during the winter, he returned in the spring to Norway, where he described the newly-discovered island as a pleasant well-wooded country. This excited a desire in Floke, another Swede, reputed the greatest navigator of his time, to undertake a voyage thither. As the compass was then unknown, he took three ravens on board to employ them on the discovery. By the way he visited his friends at Ferro; and having failed farther to the northward, he let fly one of his ravens, which returned to Ferro. Some time after, he dispatched the second, which returned to the ship again, as he could find no land. The last trial proved more successful; the third raven took his flight to Iceland, where the ship arrived a few days after. Floke stayed here the whole winter with his company; and, because he found a great deal of floating ice on the north side, he gave the country the name of Iceland, which it has ever since retained.\n\nWhen they returned to Norway in the following spring, Floke, and those that had been with him, made a very different description of the country. Floke described it as a wretched place; while one of his companions, named Thorulfr, praised it so highly, that he affirmed butter dropped from every plant; which extravagant commendation procured him the name of Thorulfr-sj\u00f3r, or Butter-Thorulfr.\n\nFrom this time there are no accounts of any voyages to Iceland, till Ingolfur and his friend Leifr undertook one in 874. They spent the winter on the island, and determined to settle there for the future. Ingolfur returned to Norway, to provide whatever might be necessary for the comfortable establishment of a colony, and Leifr in the mean time went to assist in the war in England. After an interval of four years, they again met in Iceland, the one bringing with him a considerable number of people, with the necessary tools and instruments for making the country habitable; and the other imported his acquired treasures. After this period many people went there to settle; and, in the space of 60 years, the whole island was inhabited. The tyranny of Harold king of Norway contributed not a little to the population of Iceland; and so great was the emigration of his subjects, that he was at last obliged to issue an order, that no one should sail from Norway to Iceland without paying four ounces of fine silver to the king.\n\nBesides the Norwegians, new colonies arrived from different nations, between whom wars soon commenced; and the Icelandic histories are full of the accounts of their battles. To prevent these conflicts for the future, a kind of chief was chosen in 928, upon whom great powers were conferred. This man was the speaker in all their public deliberations; pronounced sentence in difficult and intricate cases; decided all disputes; and published new laws, after they had been received and approved of by the people at large; but he had no power to make laws without the approbation and consent of the rest. He therefore assembled the chiefs whenever the circumstances seemed to require it; and after they had deliberated among themselves, he represented the opinion of the majority to the people, whose silent assent was necessary before it could be considered as a law. His authority among the chiefs and leaders, however, was inconsiderable, as he was chosen by them and retained his place no longer than while he preserved their confidence.\n\nThis institution did not prove sufficient to restrain the turbulent spirit of the Icelanders. They openly waged war with each other; and, by their intestine conflicts, so weakened all parties, that the whole became at last a prey to a few arbitrary and enterprising men; who, as is too generally the case, wantonly abused their power to the oppression of their countrymen, and the disgrace of humanity. Notwithstanding these troubles, however, the Icelanders remained free from a foreign yoke till 1261; when the greatest part of them put themselves under the protection of Hakon, king of Norway, promising to pay him tribute upon certain conditions agreed on between them; and the rest followed their example in 1264. Afterwards, Iceland, together with Norway, became subject to Denmark. For a long time the care of the island was committed to a governor, who commonly went there once a year; though, according to his instructions, he ought to have resided in Iceland. As the country suffered incredibly through the absence of its governors, it was resolved a few years ago that they should reside there, and have their seat at Belfeldi\u00f0, one of the old royal domains. He has under him a bailiff, two laymen, a sheriff, and 21 fylkemenn, or magistrates who superintend small districts; and almost everything is decided according to the laws of Denmark.\n\nAt the first settlement of the Norwegians in Iceland, they lived in the same manner as they had done in their own country, namely, by war and piracy. Their situation with regard to the kings of Norway, however, soon obliged them to apply to other states, in order to learn as much of the knowledge of government and politics as was necessary to preserve their colony from subjugation to a foreign yoke. For this purpose they often sailed to Norway, Denmark, Sweden, England, and Scotland. The travellers, at their return, were obliged to give an account to their chiefs of the state of those kingdoms through which they passed. For this reason, history, and what related to science, was held in high repute as long as the republican form of government lasted; and the great number of histories\nto be met with in the country, show at least the desire of the Icelanders to be instructed. To secure themselves, therefore, against their powerful neighbours, they were obliged to enlarge their historical knowledge. They likewise took great pains in studying perfectly their own laws, for the maintenance and protection of their internal security. Thus Iceland, at a time when ignorance and obduracy overwhelmed the rest of Europe, was enabled to produce a considerable number of poets and historians. When the Christian religion was introduced, about the end of the 10th century, more were found conversant in the law than could have been expected, considering the extent of the country, and the number of its inhabitants. Fishing was followed among them; but they devoted their attention considerably more to agriculture, which has since entirely ceased.\n\nTwo things have principally contributed towards producing a great change both in their character and way of life, viz., the progress of the Christian religion, and their subjection first to Norway, and afterwards to Denmark. For if religion, on one side, commanded them to desist from their ravages and warlike expeditions; the secular power, on the other, deprived them of the necessary forces for the execution of them; and, since this time, we find no farther traces of their heroic deeds, except those which are preserved in their hillories.\n\nThe modern Icelanders apply themselves to fishing and breeding of cattle. They are middle-sized and well made, though not very strong; and the women are in general ill-featured. Vices are much less common among them, than in other parts where luxury and riches have corrupted the morals of the people. Though their poverty disables them from imitating the hospitality of their ancestors in all respects, yet they continue to show their inclination to it: they cheerfully give away the little they have to spare, and express the utmost joy and satisfaction if you are pleased with their gift. They are uncommonly obliging and faithful, and extremely attached to government. They are very zealous in their religion. An Icelander never passes a river or any other dangerous place, without previously taking off his hat, and imploring the divine protection; and he is always thankful for the protection of the Deity when he has passed the danger in safety. They have an inexplicable attachment to their native country, and are nowhere so happy. An Icelander therefore rarely settles in Copenhagen, though ever such advantageous terms should be offered him. On the other hand, we cannot ascribe any great indolence or ingenuity to these people. They work on in the way to which they have all along been accustomed, without thinking of improvements. They are not cheerful in conversation, but simple and credulous; and have no aversion against a bottle, if they can find an opportunity. When they meet together, their chief pastime consists in reading their history. The master of the house makes the beginning, and the rest continue in their turns when he is tired. Some of them know these stories by heart; others have them in print, and others in writing. Besides this, they are great players at chess and cards, but only for their amusement, since they never play for money; which, however, seems to have been formerly in use among them; since by one of their old laws, a fine is imposed upon those who play for money.\n\nThe modern Icelanders have made very little alteration in their dress from what was formerly in use. Their dress is as follows:\n\nThe men all wear a linen shirt next to the skin, with a short jacket, and a pair of wide breeches over it. When they travel, another short coat is put over all. The whole is made of coarse black cloth, called wadmal; but some wear clothes of a white colour. On their head they wear large three-cornered hats, and on the feet Iceland shoes and worsted stockings. Some of them indeed have shoes from Copenhagen; but, as they are rather too dear for them, they generally make their own shoes, sometimes of the hide of oxen, but more frequently of sheep's leather. They make them by cutting a square piece of leather, rather wider than the length of the foot; this they sew up at the toes and behind at the heel, and tie it on with leather thongs. These shoes are convenient enough where the country is level; but it would be very difficult for us who are not accustomed to walk with them amongst the rocks and stones, though the Icelanders do it with great ease.\n\nThe women are likewise dressed in black wadmal. They wear a bodice over their shifts, which are sewed up at the bottom; and above this a jacket laced before with long narrow sleeves reaching down to the wrists. In the opening on the side of the sleeve, they have buttons of chased silver, with a plate fixed to each button; on which the lover, when he buys them in order to present them to his mistress, takes care to have his name engraved along with hers. At the top of the jacket a little black collar is fixed, of about three inches broad, of velvet or silk, and frequently trimmed with gold cord. The petticoat is likewise of wadmal, and reaches down to the ankles. Round the top of it is a girdle of silver or some other metal, to which they fasten the apron, which is also of wadmal, and ornamented at top with buttons of chased silver. Over all this they wear an upper dress nearly resembling that of the Swedish peasants; with this difference, that it is wider at bottom: this is close at the neck and wrists, and a hand's-breadth shorter than the petticoat. It is adorned with a facing down to the bottom, which looks like cut velvet, and is generally woven by the Icelandic women. On their fingers they wear gold, silver, or brass rings. Their head-dress consists of several cloths wrapped round the head almost as high again as the face. It is tied fast with a handkerchief, and serves more for warmth than ornament. Girls are not allowed to wear this head-dress till they are marriageable. At their weddings they are adorned in a very particular manner; the bride wears, close to the face, round her head-dress, a crown of silver gilt. She has two chains round her neck, one of which hangs down very low before, and the other rests on her shoulders. Besides these, she wears a lesser chain, from whence generally hangs a little heart, which may be opened to put some kind of perfume in it. This dress is worn by all the Icelandic women without exception: only with this difference, that the poorer sort have it of coarse wadmal, with ornaments of brass; and those that are in easier circumstances have it of broad cloth, with silver ornaments gilt.\nThe houses of the Icelanders are very indifferent, but the worst are said to be on the south side of the island. In some parts they are built of drift-wood, in others of lava, almost in the same manner as the stone-walls we make for inclosures, with moss stuffed between the pieces of lava. In some parts the walls are wainscotted on the inside. The roof is covered with sods, laid over rafting, or sometimes over the ribs of whales; the walls are about three yards high, and the entrance somewhat lower. Instead of glass, the windows are made of the chorion and amnios of sheep, or the membranes which surround the womb of the ewe. These are stretched on a hoop, and laid over a hole in the roof. In the poorer sort of houses they employ for the windows the inner membrane of the stomach of animals, which is less transparent than the others.\n\nAs the island of Iceland produces no kind of grain, the inhabitants of consequence have no bread but what is imported; and which being too dear for common use, is reserved for weddings and other entertainments. The following list of their viands is taken from Troil's Letters.\n\n1. Flour of fjalgras, (lichen flandicus), or rock-grass. The plant is first washed, and then cut into small pieces by some; though the greater number dry it by fire or in the sun, then put it into a bag in which it is well beaten, and lastly work it into flour by stamping.\n\n2. Flour of komfygr, (polygonum biflorum), is prepared in the same manner, as well as the two other sorts of wild corn melur (arundo arenaria, and arundo foliolum latericium convolutus), by separating it from the chaff, pounding, and lastly grinding it.\n\n3. Surt finoer, (four butter). The Icelanders seldom make use of fresh or salt butter, but let it grow four before they eat it. In this manner it may be kept for 20 years, or even longer; and the Icelanders look upon it as more wholesome and palatable than the butter used among other nations. It is reckoned better the older it grows; and one pound of it then is valued as much as two of fresh butter.\n\n4. String, or whey boiled to the consistence of sour milk, and preserved for the winter.\n\n5. Fish of all kinds, both dried in the sun and in the air, and either salted or frozen. Those prepared in the last manner are preferred by many.\n\n6. Mj\u00f6lk, or whey boiled to cheese, which is very good. But the art of making other kinds of good cheese is lost, though some tolerably palatable is sold in the east quarter of Iceland.\n\n7. Beina flriug, bones and cartilages of beef and mutton, and likewise bones of cod, boiled in whey till they are quite dissolved; they are then left to ferment, and are eaten with milk.\n\n8. Skyr. The curds from which the whey is squeezed are preserved in casks or other vessels; they are sometimes mixed with black crow-berries or juniper-berries, and are likewise eaten with new milk.\n\n9. Syra. is four whey kept in casks, and left to ferment; which, however, is not reckoned fit for use till a year old.\n\n10. Blunda, is a liquor made of water, to which a twelfth part of syra is added. In winter, it is mixed with the juice of thyme and of the black crow-berries.\n\n11. They likewise eat many vegetables, some of which grow wild, and some are cultivated; also shell-fish and mushrooms.\n\nThe Icelanders in general eat three meals a-day, at seven in the morning, two in the afternoon, and nine at night. In the morning and evening they commonly eat curds mixed with new milk, and sometimes with juniper or crow-berries. In some parts, they also have porridge made of rock-grass, which is very palatable, or curdled milk boiled till it becomes of a red colour, or new milk boiled a long time. At dinner, the food consists of dried fish, with plenty of sour butter; they also sometimes eat fresh fish, and, when possible, a little bread and cheese with them. It is reported by some, that they do not eat any fish till it is quite rotten; this report perhaps proceeds from their being fond of it when a little tainted: they however frequently eat fish which is quite fresh, though, in the same manner as the rest of their food, often without salt.\n\nThe common beverage is milk, either warm from the cow or cold, and sometimes boiled: they likewise use butter-milk with or without water. On the coasts they generally drink blanda and sour milk; which is sold after it is skimmed at two fifths of a rixdollar per cask: some likewise send for beer from Copenhagen, and some brew their own. A few of the principal inhabitants also have claret and coffee. The common people sometimes drink a kind of tea, which they make from the leaves of the dryas octopetala, and the veronica officinalis.\n\nOn the coasts the men employ themselves in fishing, both summer and winter. On their return home, many, when they have drawn and cleaned their fish, they give them to their wives, whose care it is to dry them. In the winter, when the inclemency of the weather prevents them from fishing, they are obliged to take care of their cattle, and spin wool. In summer, they mow the grass, dig turf, provide fuel, go in search of sheep and goats that were gone astray, and kill cattle. They prepare leather with the spiraea ulmaria instead of bark. Some few work in gold and silver; and others are instructed in mechanics, in which they are tolerable proficient. The women prepare the fish, take care of the cattle, manage the milk and wool, sew, spin, and gather eggs and down. When they work in the evening, they use, instead of an hour-glass, a lamp with a wick made of epilobium dipt in train oil, which is contrived to burn four, six, or eight hours.\n\nAmong the common people of Iceland, time is not reckoned by the course of the sun, but by the work they have done, and which is prescribed by law. According to his prescription, a man is to mow as much hay in one day as grows on 30 fathoms of manured soil, or 40 fathoms of land which has not been manured; or he is to dig 700 pieces of turf eight feet long and three broad. If as much snow falls as reaches to the horse's bellies, a man is required daily to clear a piece of ground sufficient for 100 sheep. A woman is to rake together as much hay as three men can mow, or to weave three yards of wadmal a-day.\nThe wages of a man are fixed at four dollars and 12 yards of wadmal; and those of a woman at two dollars and five yards of wadmal. When men are sent a-fishing out of the country, there is allowed to each man, by law, from the 25th of September to the 14th of May, six pounds of butter, and 18 pounds of dried fish every week. This may seem to be too great an allowance; but it must be remembered that they have nothing else to live upon. When they are at home, and can get milk, &c., every man receives only five pounds of dried fish and three quarters of a pound of butter a-week.\n\nThe food and manner of life of the Icelanders by no means contribute to their longevity. It is very rare indeed to see an inhabitant of Iceland exceed the age of 50 or 60; and the greater part are attacked by grievous diseases before middle age. Of these the leprosy and elephantiasis or leprosy are the worst. They are also subject to the gout in their hands, owing to their frequent employment in fishing, and handling the wet fishing-tackle in cold weather. St Anthony's fire, the jaundice, pleurisy, and lowness of spirits, are frequent complaints in this country. The small-pox also is exceedingly fatal, and not long ago destroyed 16,000 persons. By these diseases, and the frequent famines with which the country has been afflicted, the inhabitants are reduced to a much smaller number than they formerly were, insomuch that it is computed they do not in all exceed 60,000.\n\nThe exports of Iceland consist of dried fish, salted mutton and lamb, beef, butter, tallow, train-oil, coarse woollen cloth, stockings, gloves, raw wool, sheep-skins, lamb skins, fox-furs of various colours, cider down, feathers, and formerly sulphur; but there is no longer a demand for this mineral. On the other hand, the Icelanders import timber, fishing-lines and hooks, tobacco, bread, horse-shoes, brandy, wine, salt, linen, a little silk, and a few other necessaries, as well as superfluities for the better sort. The whole trade of Iceland is engrossed by a monopoly of Danes, indulged with an exclusive charter. This company maintains factories at all the harbours of Iceland, where they exchange their foreign goods for the merchandise of the country; and as the balance is in favour of the Icelanders, pay the overplus in Danish money, which is the only current coin in this island. All their accounts and payments are adjusted according to the number of fish: two pounds of fish are worth two shillings in specie, and 48 fish amount to one rixdollar. A Danish crown is computed at 30 fish: what falls under the value of 12 fish cannot be paid in money; but must be bartered either for fish or roll-tobacco, an ell of which is equal to one fish. The weights and measures of the Icelanders are nearly the same with those used in Denmark. The Icelanders being neither numerous nor warlike, and altogether unprovided with arms, ammunition, garrisons, or fleets, are in no condition to defend themselves from invasion, but depend entirely on the protection of his Danish majesty, to whom they are subject. The revenues which he draws from this island consist of the income of divers estates, as royal demesne, amounting to about 8000 dollars per annum; of the money paid by the company for an exclusive trade, to the value of 20,000 dollars; and of a fixed proportion in the tythes of fish paid in some particular districts.\n\nIceland is noted for the volcanoes with which it abounds, as already mentioned, and which seem to be of Iceland more furious than any yet discovered in the other parts of the globe. Indeed, from the latest accounts, it would seem that this miserable country were little other than one continued volcano. Mount Hecla has been commonly supposed to be the only burning mountain, or at least the principal one, in the island; (see HECLA). It has indeed been more taken notice of than many others of as great extent, partly from its having had more frequent eruptions than any single one, and partly from its situation, which exposes it to the sight of ships sailing to Greenland and North America. But in a list of eruptions published in the appendix to Pennant's Arctic Zoology, it appears, that out of 51 remarkable ones, only one third have proceeded from Hecla, the other mountains it seems being no less active in the work of destruction than this celebrated one. These eruptions take place in the mountains covered with ice, which the inhabitants call jokuls. Some of these, as appears from a large map of Iceland made by order of his Danish majesty in 1734, have been swallowed up. Probably the great lakes met with in this country may have been occasioned by the sinking of such mountains, as several instances of a similar nature are to be met with in other parts of the world. The great Icelandic lake called Myvatn may probably have been one. Its bottom is entirely formed of lava, divided by deep cracks, which shelter during winter the great quantity of trout which inhabit this lake. It is now only 30 feet deep, but originally was much deeper; being nearly filled up in the year 1718 by an eruption of the great mountain Krafla. The fiery stream took its course towards Myvatn, and ran into it with an horrid noise, which continued till the year 1730.\n\n\"The mountains of Iceland (says Mr Pennant) are of two kinds, primitive and posterior. The former consist of strata usually regular, but sometimes confused. They are formed of different sorts of stone without the least appearance of fire. Some are composed of sand and free-stone, pietroliet or chert, flaty or fissile stone, and various kinds of earth or bole, and scoriae; different sorts of breccia or conglomerated stones; jaspers of different kinds, Iceland crystal; the common rhomboid spar, mica, chaledonies stratified, and botryoids; zeolites of the most elegant kinds; crystals, and various other substances that have no relation to volcanoes. The primitive mountains are those called jokuls, and are higher than the others. One of them, called Asfjord or Riar, is 6000 feet high. It seems to be composed of great and irregular rocks of a dark gray colour, piled on each other. Another, called Emeberg, is about 3000 feet high; the Sn\u00e6fj\u00f6ld jokul, 2287 yards; the Sn\u00e6fellsnes or promontory of Sn\u00e6fj\u00f6ld is from 300 to 400 fathoms. Harnstrand or the coast by the north Cape Nord is very high, from 300 to 400 fathoms. The rocks of Drango are seven in number, of a pyramidal figure, rising out of the sea at a small distance from the cliffs, four of which are of a vast height, and have a most magnificent appearance.\n\n\"Eastward from the Sn\u00e6fj\u00f6ld begins the Eifberge, foaring...\"\nThee volcanoes, though so dreadful in their effects, seldom begin to throw out fire without giving warning. A subterraneous rumbling noise heard at a considerable distance, as in other volcanoes, precedes the eruption for several days, with a roaring and cracking in the place from whence the fire is about to burst forth; many fiery meteors are observed, but generally unattended with any violent concussion of the earth, though sometimes earthquakes, of which several instances are recorded, have accompanied these dreadful conflagrations. The drying up of small lakes, streams, and rivulets, is also considered as a sign of an impending eruption; and it is thought to hallow the eruption when a mountain is so covered with ice, that the holes are stopped up through which the exhalations formerly found a free passage. The immediate sign is the bursting of the mass of ice with a dreadful noise; flames then issue forth from the earth, and lightning and fire balls from the smoke; stones, ashes, &c., are thrown out to vast distances. Egbert Olafsen relates, that, in an eruption of Kettle gian in 1753, a stone weighing 290 pounds was thrown to the distance of 24 English miles. A quantity of white pumice stones is thrown up by the boiling waters; and it is conjectured with great probability, that the latter proceeds from the sea, as a quantity of salt, sufficient to load several horses, has frequently been found after the mountain has ceased to burn.\n\nTo enumerate the ravages of so many dreadful volcanoes, which from time immemorial have contributed to render this dreary country still less habitable than it is from the climate, would greatly exceed our limits. It will be sufficient to give an account of that which happened in 1783, and which from its violence seems to have been unparalleled in history.\n\nIts first signs were observed on the 1st of June by a trembling of the earth in the western part of the province of Skipterfall. It increased gradually to the 11th, and became at last so great that the inhabitants quitted their houses, and lay at night in tents on the ground. A continual smoke or steam was perceived rising out of the earth in the northern and uninhabited parts of the country. Three fire-spouts, as they were called, broke out in different places, one in Ulfarfall, a little to the east of the river Skapia; the other two were a little to the westward of the river called Skipterfall. The river Skapia takes its rise in the north-east, and running first westward, it turns to the south, and falls into the sea in a south-east direction. Part of its channel is confined for about 24 English miles in length, and is in some places 200 fathoms deep, in others 100 or 150, and its breadth in some places 100, 50, or 40 fathoms. Along the whole of this part of its course the river is very rapid, though there are no considerable cataracts or falls. There are several other such confined channels in the country, but this is the most considerable.\n\nThe three fire-spouts, or streams of lava, which had broke out, united into one, after having risen a considerable height into the air, arriving at last at such an amazing altitude as to be seen at the distance of more than 200 English miles; the whole country, for double that distance, being covered with a smoke or fleam not to be described.\n\nOn the 8th of June this fire first became visible. Vast quantities of sand, ashes, and other volcanic matters were ejected, and scattered over the country by the wind, which at that time was very high. The atmosphere was filled with sand, brimstone, and ashes, in such a manner as to occasion continual darkness; and considerable damage was done by the pumice stones which fell, red hot, in great quantities. Along with these a tenacious substance like pitch fell in vast quantity; sometimes rolled up like balls, at other times like rings or garlands, which proved no less destructive to vegetation than the other. This shower having continued for three days, the fire became very visible, and at last arrived at the amazing height already mentioned. Sometimes it appeared in a continued stream, at others in flashes or flames seen at the distance of 30 or 40 Danish miles (18 or 240 of ours), with a continual noise like thunder, which lasted the whole summer.\n\nThe same day that the fire broke out there fell a vast quantity of rain, which running in streams on the hot ground tore it up in large quantities, and brought it down upon the lower lands. This rain-water was much impregnated with acid and other salts, so as to be highly corrosive, and occasion a painful inflammation when it fell on the hands or face. At a greater distance from the fire the air was excessively cold. Snow lay upon the ground three feet deep in some places; and in others there fell great quantities of hail, which did very much damage to the cattle and every thing without doors. Thus the grass and every kind of vegetation in those places nearest the fire was destroyed, being covered with a thick crust of sulphurous and foamy matter. Such a quantity of vapour was raised by the contest of the two adverse elements, that the sun was darkened and appeared like blood, the whole face of nature seeming to be changed; and this obscurity seems to have reached as far as the island of Britain; for during the whole summer of 1783, an obscurity reigned throughout all parts of this island; the atmosphere appearing to be covered with a continual haze, which prevented the sun from appearing with its usual splendour.\n\nThe dreadful scene above described lasted in Iceland for several days; the whole country was laid waste, and the inhabitants fled everywhere to the remotest parts of their miserable country, to seek for safety from the fury of this unparalleled tempest.\n\nOn the first breaking out of the fire, the river Skapia was considerably augmented, on the east side of which one of the fire spouts was situated; and a similar overflow of water was observed at the same time in the great river Dverga, which runs into the sea a little\nICE\n\nIceland. little to the eastward of a town called Orrebakla, and into which another river called Tuna, after having run through a large tract of barren and uncultivated land, empties itself. But on the 11th of June the waters of the Skapta were lessened, and in less than 24 hours totally dried up. The day following, a prodigious stream of liquid and red hot lava, which the fire-sprout had discharged, ran down the channel of the river. This burning torrent not only filled up the deep channel above mentioned, but, overflowing the banks of it, spread itself over the whole valley, covering all the low grounds in its neighbourhood; and not having any sufficient outlet to empty itself by, it rose to a vast height, so that the whole adjacent country was overflowed, inundating itself between the hills, and covering some of the lower ones. The hills here are not continued in a long chain or series, but are separated from one another, and detached, and between them run little rivulets or brooks; so that, besides filling up the whole valley in which the river Skapta ran, the fiery stream spread itself for a considerable distance on each side, getting vent between the above mentioned hills, and laying all the neighbouring country under fire.\n\nThe sprouts still\u2014continuing to supply fresh quantities of inflamed matter, the lava took its course up the channel of the river, overflowing all the grounds above, as it had done those below the place whence it issued. The river was dried up before it, until at last it was stopped by the hill whence the Skapta took its rise. Finding now no proper outlet, it rose to a prodigious height, and overflowed the village of Buland, confusing the houses, church, and every thing that stood in its way: though the high ground on which this village stood seemed to ensure it from any danger of this kind.\n\nThe fiery lake still increasing, spread itself out in length and breadth for about 36 English miles; and having converted all this tract of land into a sea of fire, it stretched itself toward the south, and getting out again by the river Skapta, rushed down its channel with great impetuosity. It was still confined between the narrow banks of that river for about six miles (English); but coming at last into a more open place, it poured forth in prodigious torrents with amazing velocity and force; spreading itself now towards the south, tearing up the earth, and carrying on its surface flaming woods and whatsoever it met with. In its course it laid waste another large district of land. The ground where it came was cracked, and sent forth great quantities of steam long before the fire reached it; and every thing near the lake was either burnt up or reduced to a fluid state. In this situation matters remained from the 12th of June to the 13th of August; after which the fiery lake no longer spread itself, but nevertheless continued to burn; and when any part of the surface acquired a crust by cooling, it was quickly broken by the fire from below; and tumbling down among the melted substance, was rolled and tossed about with prodigious noise and crackling; and in many parts of its surface, small sprouts at least ebullitions, were formed, which continued for some length of time.\n\nIn other directions this dreadful inundation proved no less destructive. Having run through the narrow part of the channel of Skapta as early as the 12th of June, it stretched out itself towards the west and southwest, overflowing all the flat country, and its edge being no less than 70 fathoms high at the time it got out of the channel of the river. Continuing its destructive course, it overflowed a number of villages, running in every direction where it could find a vent. In one place it came to a great cataract of the river Skapta, about 14 fathoms in height, over which it was precipitated with tremendous noise, and thrown in great quantities to a very considerable distance. In another place it flooded up the channel of a large river, filled a great valley, and destroyed two villages by approaching only within 100 fathoms of them. Others were overflowed by inundations of water proceeding from the rivers which had been stopped in their courses; until at last all the passages on the south, east, and west, being stopped, and the sprouts still sending up incredible quantities of fresh lava, it burst out to the north and north-east, spreading over a tract of land 48 miles long and 36 broad. Here it dried up the rivers Tuna and Asafjord; but even this vast effusion being insufficient to exhaust the subterraneous resources of liquid fire, a new branch took its course for about eight miles down the channel of the river Hverfjord, when coming again to an open country, it formed what our author calls a final lake of fire, about twelve miles in length and five in breadth. At last, however, this branch also flooded on the 16th of August; the fiery fountains ceased to pour forth new supplies, and this most astonishing eruption came to a period.\n\nThe whole extent of ground covered by this dreadful inundation was computed at no less than 90 miles long and 42 in breadth; the depth of the lava being from 16 to 20 fathoms. Two rivers were dried up, 20 or 21 villages were destroyed, and 224 people lost their lives. The extent above mentioned, however, is that only on the south, east and west; for that towards the north being over uninhabited land, where no body cared to venture themselves, was not exactly known. Some hills were covered by this lava: others were melted down by its heat; so that the whole had the appearance of a sea of red-hot and melted metal.\n\nAfter this eruption two new islands were thrown up from the bottom of the sea. One, about three miles in circumference, and about a mile in height, made its appearance in the month of February 1784, where there was formerly 100 fathoms water. It was about 100 miles south-west from Iceland, and 48 from a cluster of small islands called Gierfugel. It continued for some time to burn with great violence, sending forth prodigious quantities of pumice-stones, sand, &c. like other volcanoes. The other lay to the north-west, between Iceland and Greenland. It burnt day and night without intermission for a considerable time; and was also very high, and larger than the former. Since that time, however, one or both of these islands have been swallowed up.\n\nAll the time of this great eruption, and for a considerable time after, the whole atmosphere was loaded with smoke, steam, and sulphureous vapours. The sun was sometimes wholly invisible; and when it could be seen was of a reddish colour. Most of the fish...\nries were destroyed; the banks where the fish used to \nrefort being so changed, that the fishermen could not \nknow them again; and the smoke was so thick, that \nthey could not go far out to sea. The rain water, \nfalling through this smoke and steam, was so impreg-\nnated with salt and sulphurous matter, that the hair \nand even the skins of the cattle were destroyed; and the \nwhole grass of the island was covered with foot and \npitchy matter, that what had escaped the destructive \neffects of the fire became poisonous; so that the cattle \ndied for want of food, or perished by eating those \nunwholesome vegetables. Nor were the inhabitants \nin a much better situation; many of them having lost \ntheir lives by the poisonous qualities of the smoke and \nsteam with which the whole atmosphere was filled; \nparticularly old people, and such as had any complaint \nin the breast and lungs.\n\nBefore the fire broke out in Iceland, there is said to \nhave been a very remarkable eruption in the uninha-\nbited parts of Greenland; and that in the northern \nparts of Norway, opposite to Greenland, the fire was \nvisible for a long time. It was also related, that when \nthe wind was in the north, a great quantity of ashes, \npumice, and brimstone, fell upon the north and west \ncoasts of Iceland, which continued for the whole sum-\nmer whenever the wind was in that quarter; and the \nair was always very much impregnated with a thick \nsmoke and sulphurous smell.\n\nDuring the fall of the sharp rain formerly mentioned, \nthere was observed at Trondheim, and other places \nin Norway, and likewise at Fos, an uncommon fall of \nsharp and salt rain, which totally destroyed the leaves \nof the trees, and every vegetable it fell upon, by \nscorching them up, and causing them to wither. A \nconsiderable quantity of ashes, sand, and other volcanic \nmatters, fell at Faro, which covered the whole surface \nof the ground whenever the wind blew from Iceland, \nthough the distance between the two places is not \nless than 480 miles. Ships that were sailing betwixt \nCopenhagen and Norway were frequently covered with \nashes and sulphurous matter, which stuck to the masts, \nsails, and decks, befouling them all over with a black \nand pitchy substance. In many parts of Holland, \nGermany, and other northern countries, a sulphurous \nvapour was observed in the air, accompanied with a \nthick smoke, and in some places a light gray-coloured \nsubstance fell upon the earth every night; which, by \nyielding a bluish flame when thrown into the fire, evi-\ndently showed its sulphurous nature. On those nights \nin which this substance fell in any quantity, there was \nlittle or no dew observed. These appearances con-\ntinued, more or less, all the months of July, August \nand September.\n\nSome curious particulars relative to the ancient state \nof this island have lately been published by a Mr \nVorhokely, a native of the country. From his work \nit appears that Iceland, for a very considerable space \nof time, viz. from the beginning of the 10th to the \nmiddle of the 13th century, was under a republican \nform of government. At first the father, or head of \nevery family, was an absolute sovereign; but in the \nprogress of population and improvement, it became ne-\ncessary to form certain regulations for the settlement \nof disputes concerning the frontiers of different estates. \nFor this purpose the heads of the families concerned af-\nsembled themselves, and formed the outlines of a re-\npublic. In the mean time they carried on a prospe-\nrous trade to different parts; sending ships even to the \nLevant, and to Constantinople, at that time celebra-\nted as the only seat of literature and humanity in the \nworld. Deputies were likewise sent from this island \nover land to that capital, for the improvement of their \nlaws and civilization; and this a whole century before \nthe first crusade. In these ancient Icelandic laws, there-\nfore, we meet with evident traces of those of the Greeks \nand Romans. For example, besides a body of written \nlaws which were written every third year to the people, \nthey had two men chosen annually by the heads of fa-\nmilies, with consultative power, not only to enforce the \nlaws then in being, but when these proved deficient, to \nact as necessity required.\n\nThese laws do not appear to have inflicted capital \npunishments upon any person. Murderers were banish-\ned to the woods; that is, to the interior and uncultiva-\nted parts of the island: where no person was allowed \nto approach them within a certain number of fathoms. \nIn cases of banishment for lesser crimes, the friends of \nthe offender were allowed to supply him with necessa-\nries. The culprit, however, might be killed by any \nperson who found him without his bounds; and he \nmight even be hunted and destroyed in his sanctuary, \nprovided he did not withdraw himself from the island \nwithin a twelvemonth after his sentence, which it was \nsupposed he might accomplish by means of the annual \narrival and departure of ships. Every man's person \nwas free until he had forfeited his rights by some crime \nagainst society; and so great was their respect for in-\ndependence, that great indulgence was allowed for the \npower of passion. If any provoking word or beha-\nviour had been used, no punishment was inflicted on the \nparty who resented it, even though he should have killed \nhis adversary.\n\nBy the laws of Iceland, the poor were committed to \nthe protection of their nearest kindred, who had a \nright to their labour as far as they were able to work, \nand afterwards to indemnification if the poor person \nshould acquire any property. Children were obliged \nto maintain their parents in their old age; but if the \nlatter had neglected to give them good education, they \nwere absolved from this duty.\n\nWhile the republic of Iceland continued free and \nindependent, ships were sent from the island to all parts \nof the world. Till very lately, however, not a ship \nbelonged to it, the little commerce it enjoyed being \nmonopolized by a Danish company, until in 1786 it \nwas laid open to all the subjects of Denmark. \"There \nis at present (says Mr Pennant *) a revival of the cod \nfishery on the coast of Iceland from our kingdom. A \ndozen of vessels have of late sailed from the Isle of \nThanet, and a few from other parts of Great Britain. \nThey are either sloops or brigs from 50 to 80 tons bur-\nden.

See Aceti-\n\nPENSER. The word is Greek, formed of \u1f30\u03c7\u03b8\u03cd\u03c2 fish, and \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 glue.\u2014The method of making isinglass was long a secret in the hands of the Ruffians; but hath lately been discovered, and the following account of it published by Humphrey Jackson, Esq., in the 63d volume of the Philo-\n\nlophical Transactions.\n\n\"All authors who have hitherto delivered pro-\n\ncesses for making ichthyocolla, fish-glue, or isinglass, have greatly mistaken both its constituent matter and preparation.\n\n\"To prove this assertion, it may not be improper to recite what Pomet says upon the subject, as he appears to be the principal author whom the rest have copied. After describing the fish, and referring to a cut engrav-\n\ned from an original in his custody, he says: 'As to the manner of making the isinglass, the finev parts of the fish are boiled in water till all of them be dissolved that will dissolve; then the gluey liquor is strained, and set to cool. Being cold, the fat is carefully taken off, and the liquor itself boiled to a just consistence, then cut to pieces, and made into a twist, bent in form of a cres-\n\ncent, as commonly fold; then hung upon a string, and carefully dried.'\n\n\"From this account, it might be rationally con-\n\ncluded, that every species of fish which contained gelatinous principles would yield isinglass; and this parity of reasoning seems to have given rise to the halting con-\n\nclusions of those who strenuously vouch for the extrac-\n\ntion of isinglass from sturgeon; but as that fish is easily procurable, the negligence of ascertaining the fact by ex-\n\nperiment seems inexcusable.\n\n\"In my first attempt to discover the constituent parts and manufacture of isinglass, relying too much up-\n\non the authority of some chemical authors whose veraci-\n\nty I had experienced in many other instances, I found myself constantly disappointed. Glue, not isinglass, was the result of every process; and although, in the same view, a journey to Russia proved fruitless, yet a steady perseverance in the research proved not only successful as to this object, but, in the pursuit, to discover a resi-\n\nnous matter plentifully procurable in the British fisheries, which has been found by ample experience to answer fis-\n\nhur purposes. It is now no longer a secret, that our (a) lakes and rivers in North America are stocked with immense quantities of fish, said to be the same species with those in Muscovy, and yielding the finest isin-\n\nglasses; the fisheries whereof, under due encouragement would doubtless supply all Europe with this valuable article.\n\n\"No artificial heat is necessary to the production of isinglass, neither is the matter dissolved for this purpose;\n\nfor,\n\n(a) As the lakes of North America lie nearly in the same latitude with the Caspian sea, particularly Lake Su-\n\nperior, which is said to be of greater extent, it was conjectured they might abound with the same sorts of fish; and in consequence of public advertisements distributed in various parts of North America, offering premiums for the sounds of sturgeon and other fish, for the purpose of making isinglass, several specimens of fine isinglass, the produce of fish taken in these parts, have been lately sent to England, with proper attestations as to the unlimited quantity which may be procured.\nfor, as the continuity of its fibres would be destroyed by solution, the mass would become brittle in drying, and snap short asunder, which is always the case with glue, but never with isinglass. The latter, indeed, may be resolved into glue with boiling water; but its fibrous re-composition would be found impracticable afterwards, and a fibrous texture is one of the most distinguishing characteristics of genuine isinglass.\n\n\"A due consideration that an imperfect solution of isinglass, called fining by the brewers, possessed a peculiar property of clarifying malt-liquors, induced me to attempt its analysis in cold subacid menstruums. One ounce and a half of good isinglass, steeped a few days in a gallon of stale beer, was converted into good fining, of a remarkably thick consistence: the same quantity of glue, under similar treatment, yielded only a mucilaginous liquor, resembling diluted gum-water, which, instead of clarifying beer, increased both its tenacity and turbidity, and communicated other properties in no respect corresponding with those of genuine fining. On commixing three spoonfuls of the solution of isinglass with a gallon of malt liquor, in a tall cylindrical glass, a vast number of curdly masses became presently formed, by the reciprocal attraction of the particles of isinglass and the feculencies of the beer, which, increasing in magnitude and specific gravity, arranged themselves accordingly and fell in a combined state to the bottom, through the well-known laws of gravitation; for, in this case, there is no elective attraction, as some have imagined, which bears the least affinity with what frequently occurs in chemical decompositions.\n\n\"If what is commercially termed long or short flaked isinglass be steeped a few hours in fair cold water, the entwisted membranes will expand, and reassume their original beautiful (b) hue, and, by a dexterous address, may be perfectly unfolded. By this simple operation, we find that isinglass is nothing more than certain membranous parts of fishes, divested of their native mucosity, rolled and twisted into the forms above-mentioned, and dried in open air.\n\n\"The founds, or air-bladders, of fresh water fish in general, are preferred for this purpose, as being the most transparent, flexible, delicate substances. These constitute the finest sorts of isinglass; those called book and ordinary flake are made of the intestines, and probably of the peritoneum of the fish. The belluga yields the greatest quantity, as being the largest and most plentiful fish in the Mucovoy rivers; but the founds of all fresh-water fish yield, more or less, fine isinglass, particularly the smaller sorts, found in prodigious quantities in the Caspian sea, and several hundred miles beyond Afracan, in the Wolga, Yaik, Don, and even as far as Siberia, where it is called kle or klo by the natives, which implies a glutinous matter; it is the basis of the Russian glue, which is preferred to all other kinds for its strength.\n\n\"The founds, which yield the finer isinglass, consist of parallel fibres, and are easily rent longitudinally; but the ordinary sorts are found composed of double membranes, whose fibres cross each other obliquely, resembling the coats of a bladder: hence the former are more readily pervaded and divided with subacid liquors; but the latter, through a peculiar kind of interwoven texture, are with great difficulty torn asunder, and long resist the power of the same menstruum; yet, when duly resolved, are found to act with equal energy in clarifying liquors.\n\n\"Izinglass receives its different shapes in the following manner:\n\n\"The parts of which it is composed, particularly the founds, are taken from the fish while sweet and fresh, slit open, washed from their slimy folder, deprived of every thin membrane which envelopes the found, and then exposed to stiffen a little in the air. In this state, they are formed into rolls about the thickness of a finger, and in length according to the intended size of the staple: a thin membrane is generally selected for the centre of the roll, round which the rest are folded alternately, and about half an inch of each extremity of the roll is turned inwards. The due dimensions being thus obtained, the two ends of what is called florit flake are pinned together with a small wooden peg; the middle of the roll is then pressed a little downwards, which gives it the resemblance of a heart-shape; and thus it is laid on boards, or hung up in the air to dry. The founds, which compose the long-flake, are longer than the former; but the operator lengthens this sort at pleasure, by interfolding the ends of one or more pieces of the found with each other. The extremities are fastened with a peg, like the former; but the middle part of the roll is bent more considerably downwards, and, in order to preserve the shape of the three obtuse angles thus formed, a piece of round stick, about a quarter of an inch diameter, is fastened in each angle with small wooden pegs, in the same manner as the ends. In this state, it is permitted to dry long enough to retain its form, when the pegs and sticks are taken out, and the drying completed; lastly, the pieces of isinglass are colligated in rows, by running pack-thread through the peg-holes, for convenience of package and exportation.\n\n\"The membranes of the book fort, being thick and refractory, will not admit a similar formation with the preceding; the pieces, therefore, after their sides are folded inwardly, are bent in the centre, in such manner that the opposite sides resemble the cover of a book, from whence its name; a peg being run across the middle, fastens the sides together, and thus it is dried like the former. This fort is interleaved, and the pegs run across the ends, the better to prevent its unfolding.\n\n\"That called cake-isinglass is formed of the bits and fragments of the staple sorts, put into a flat metallic pan, with a very little water, and heated just enough to make the parts cohere like a pancake when it is dried; but frequently it is overheated, and such pieces, as before observed, are useless in the business of fining. Experience has taught the consumers to reject them.\n\n(b) If the transparent isinglass be held in certain positions to the light, it frequently exhibits beautiful prismatic colours.\n\"Ifinglaf is best made in the summer, as froth gives it a disagreeable colour, deprives it of weight, and impairs its gelatinous principles; its fashionable forms are unnecessary, and frequently injurious to its native qualities. It is common to find oily putrid matter, and exuviae of insects, between the implicated membranes, which, through the inattention of the cellarman, often contaminate wines and malt-liquors in the act of clarification. These peculiar shapes might probably be introduced originally with a view to conceal and disguise the real substance of ifinglaf, and preserve the monopoly; but, as the mark is now taken off, it cannot be doubted to answer every purpose more effectually in its native state, without any subsequent manufacture whatever, especially to the principal consumers, who hence will be enabled to procure sufficient supply from the British colonies. Until this laudable end can be fully accomplished, and as a species of ifinglaf, more easily producible from the marine fisheries, may probably be more immediately encouraged, it may be manufactured as follows:\n\n\"The founds of cod and ling bear great analogy with those of the acipenser genus of Linnaeus and Arvedi; and are in general so well known as to require no particular description. The Newfoundland and Iceland fishermen split open the fish as soon as taken, and throw the back-bones with the founds annexed, in a heap; but previous to incipient putrefaction, the founds are cut out, washed from their flimes, and salted for use. In cutting out the founds, the intercostal parts are left behind, which are much the best; the Iceland fishermen are so sensible of this, that they beat the bone upon a block with a thick stick, till the pockets, as they term them, come out easily, and thus preserve the found entire. If the founds have been cured with salt, that must be dissolved by steeping them in water before they are prepared for ifinglaf; the fresh found must then be laid upon a block of wood, whose surface is a little elliptical, to the end of which a small hair-brush is nailed, and with a saw knife the membranes on each side of the found must be scraped off. The knife is rubbed upon the brush occasionally, to clear its teeth; the pockets are cut open with scissors, and perfectly cleansed of the mucous matter with a coarse cloth; the founds are afterwards washed a few minutes in lime-water in order to absorb their oily principle, and finally in clear water. They are then laid upon nets to dry in the air; but if intended to resemble the foreign ifinglaf, the founds of cod will only admit of that called book, but those of ling both shapes. The thicker the founds are, the better the ifinglaf, colour excepted; but that is immaterial to the brewer, who is its chief consumer.\n\n\"This ifinglaf resolves into fining, like the other sorts, in subacid liquors, as stale beer, cyder, old hock, &c., and in equal quantities produces similar effects upon turbid liquors, except that it falls speedier and closer to the bottom of the vessel, as may be demonstrated in tall cylindrical glasses; but foreign ifinglaf retains the consistency of fining preferably in warm weather, owing to the greater tenacity of its native mucilage.\n\n\"Vegetable acids are, in every respect, best adapted to fining: the mineral acids are too corrosive, and even infalubrious, in common beverage.\n\n\"It is remarkable, that, during the conversion of ifinglaf into fining, the acidity of the menstruum seems greatly diminished, at least to taste; not on account of any alkaline property in the ifinglaf, probably, but by its enveloping the acid particles. It is likewise reducible into jelly with alkaline liquors, which indeed are solvents of all animal matters; even cold lime-water dissolves it into a pulpy mass. Notwithstanding this is inadmissible as fining, on account of the menstruum, it produces admirable effects in other respects: for, on commixture with compositions of plaster, lime, &c., for ornamenting walls exposed to vicissitudes of weather, it adds firmness and permanency to the cement; and if common brick-mortar be worked up with this jelly, it soon becomes almost as hard as the brick itself; but, for this purpose, it is more commodiously prepared, by dissolving it in cold water, acidulated with vitriolic acid; in which case, the acid quits the jelly, and forms with the lime a felicitous mass, while, at the same time, the jelly being deprived in some measure of its moisture, through the formation of an indissoluble concrete amongst its parts, soon dries, and hardens into a firm body; whence its superior strength and durability are easily comprehended.\n\n\"It has long been a prevalent opinion, that sturgeon, on account of its cartilaginous nature, would yield great quantities of ifinglaf; but, on examination, no part of this fish, except the inner coat of the found, promised the least success. This being full of rugae, adheres so firmly to the external membrane, which is useless, that the labour of separating them supercedes the advantage. The intestines, however, which in the larger fish extend several yards in length, being cleansed from their mucus, and dried, were found surprisingly strong and elastic, resembling cords made with the intestines of other animals, commonly called catgut, and, from some trials, promised superior advantages when applied to mechanic operations.\"\n\nIfinglaf is sometimes used in medicine; and may be given in a thin acrimonious state of the juices, after the same manner as the vegetable gums and mucilages, regard being had to their different disposition to putrefaction.","sp":73,"ep":75},{"h":"ICHTHYOLOGY","t":"CHAP. I. HISTORY OF ICHTHYOLOGY.\n\nDefinition. Ichthyology (from the Greek \u1f30\u03c7\u03b8\u03cd\u03c2, \"a fish,\" and \u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, \"to describe\"), is that part of zoology which treats of fishes.\n\nFishes are such animals as have a heart with one auricle and one ventricle, with cold red blood, which inhabit water, and breathe by means of gills. Most of the species are likewise distinguished by fins and scales.\n\nThe very element in which fishes live prevents us from studying them from following their motions with exactness, from studying their instincts, and from noting with fidelity their specific differences. Their colours often vary, according to the accidental circumstances of age, sex, climate, season, breeding, &c., and often vanish in the open air, or with the principle of life. On the same shores unknown kinds seldom occur; and, when they do, they may pass unnoticed by the illiterate fisherman. Hence, the natural history of the finny tribe has, in all ages, been involved in greater obscurity than that of land animals, which are more readily subjected to the investigation of the learned and the curious. Hence, Aristotle, Pliny, and Athenian, in treating of fishes, have mingled much fable with some truths, and have even confounded classes which nature has distinctly separated. Such, too, is the ambiguity which now attaches to their vague and unscientific nomenclature, and such, we may add, is the indispensable limitation of our plan, that we shall forbear enlarging on the ichthyological portions of their writings. The classical and inquisitive reader may, however, derive entertainment and some instruction from a careful perusal of their text, and of some of the most ingenious and judicious annotations of more recent scholars and naturalists. To the names just mentioned, we may add that of Athenaeus, who, in the seventh book of his Deipnosophistes, discourses of fishes. Ovid celebrates them in his Halieuticon; and his example has been followed, not without success, by Oppian, a Greek poet, who flourished in the second century, under the reign of Caracalla. Ausonius, a native of Bordeaux, who died towards the conclusion of the fourth century, in his admired poem on the Moselle, has not forgotten to sing of its inhabitants.\n\nIn the more downward periods of the dark and middle ages, no writer of eminence appears in this department of natural history. Indeed, the first who laid the foundation of ichthyological arrangement was Pierre Belon, a French physician, born in 1518, and advantageously known by his travels in Judea, Greece, and Arabia, as well as by his writings in natural history. Some of his divisions of fishes, as the eleventh, which comprises the flat species that are not cartilaginous; the twelfth, those that are both flat and cartilaginous; the thirteenth, which includes the squali, &c., are deduced from natural resemblances; but others are more fanciful; and the wooden cuts are deficient in accuracy and neatness. Belon was an industrious, and rather an acute observer, who wrote with pleasing na\u00efvet\u00e9, and who should rank high in the estimation of the learned world, when we reflect on the few resources of which he could avail himself. His history of fishes appeared in 1551. That of his countryman, Rondelet, was published three years afterwards, and exhibited more accurate descriptions and figures, with many excellent remarks, the result of his own observation. In point of arrangement, however, Rondelet's work is extremely imperfect, and even puerile. He tells us, for example, &c., that, after very mature deliberation, he resolved to begin with the gill-head, because it was best known to the ancients and moderns, and highly prized for its delicacy. He had, however, the merit of exciting a general taste for the study of ichthyology; and Salviani, Boffioli, Conrad Gessner, Pison, &c., who followed him in rapid succession, contributed their share to the stock of scientific facts, though they made few advances to the construction of a natural order.\n\nIn 1605, Aldrovandus, who published a large compilation on natural history, distributed the fishes according to the nature of their residence; thus, his first book treats of those that frequent rocks; the second is devoted to the littoral; the third to the pelagic, &c. Several authors, whom we cannot stay to name, displayed their talents, with more or less felicity, on the same subject. But their labours were eclipsed by those of Willoughby, whose work, entitled De Historia Piscium, was printed at Oxford in 1686, and unfolded by many new and accurate notions relative to the anatomy and physiology of fishes. His arrangement may be considered as an improved modification of that of Belon. The celebrated Ray published, in 1707, his Synopsis Methodica Piscium, which may be regarded as an abridged and corrected view of Willoughby's larger work, and as indicating, if not fixing, a series of genera. This valuable descriptive catalogue continued to be appealed to as a standard, till the combined genius of Araldi and Linnaeus effected an important reform in the science of ichthyology.\n\nAraldi, the countryman and friend of the great Swedish naturalist, had adopted his principles, and was engaged in applying them to the systematic illustration of fishes, when death prematurely arrested the prosecution of his design. His illustrious friend put the finishing hand to his papers, and published them in the form of two octavo volumes, under the title of Bibliotheca Ichthyologica, and Philosophia Ichthyologica, which Walbaum re-edited, in four volumes, in 1792. Thus, then, to Araldi we may ascribe the merit of having first traced the outlines of that classification of fishes which has now become so popular in Europe; for he first instituted orders and genera, and defined the characters on which these divisions are founded. Independently of the cetaceous tribes, which are now generally classified with the mammalia, and of which we have treated in the\nthe article Cytology, his method consisted of four great divisions or orders, namely, the Malacopterygian, Acanthopterygian, Branchiostegous, and Chondropterygian. The first denoted those species which have soft fins, or fins with bony rays but without spines, and included twenty-one genera; the second, those with spiny fins, containing fifteen genera; the third, corresponding to the amphibia nantes of Linnaeus, which want the operculum, or branchiostegous membrane; and the fourth, the Linnaean amphibia nantes, which have not true bones, but only cartilages, and the rays of whose fins hardly differ from a membrane. In his fifth edition of the System of Nature, Linnaeus wholly adopted the Arterian method. With regard to the changes which he afterwards introduced, it would be unnecessary to state them in this rapid historical sketch, especially as we purpose to follow his divisions in our systematic exposition.\n\nThose ichthyologists who have propounded methods in opposition to that of Linnaeus, have usually fallen short of the latter in point of simplicity. Thus Klein, who vainly attempted to rival the professor of Upsala, distributed fishes into three sections, according as they had lungs, and visible or invisible gills; but his subdivisions were so numerous and complex, that his scheme has never been adopted. That of Gronovius was, at least for a few years, much more favourably received. It is principally founded on the presence or absence, and the number or the nature, of the fins. The first class includes all the cetaceous animals, and the second all the fishes. The chondropterygian, and the osseous or bony, form two great divisions; and the osseous are subdivided into branchiostegous and branchial. These last are grouped according to the Linnaean rules; but in the formation of the genera, the number of dorsal fins is admitted as a character, which Linnaeus has, perhaps injudiciously, overlooked, and which gives rise to several genera which are not to be found in the System of Nature.\u2014Brunnich laboured, with much pains and considerable ingenuity, to combine the Linnaean and Arterian divisions; but his system remained without encouragement or support.\u2014Scopoli boldly struck out a new path, and affirmed the position of the anus as the basis of his three primary divisions. His secondary characters sometimes coincide with those of Gronovius, and sometimes with those of Linnaeus; while his third series of distinctions is sometimes drawn from the form of the body, and sometimes from the teeth. Gouan, the celebrated professor of botany at Montpelier, preferred the Linnaean genera, but formed his greater divisions from the union of those of Linnaeus and Artedi. His two principal sections are, of fishes with complete, and of those with incomplete, gills; and the first is divided into two others, viz. acanthopterygian, and malacopterygian, in each of which are ranged the apodal, jugular, thoracic, and abdominal species. The same process is followed in the second section, which includes the branchiostegous and the chondropterygian.\n\nAll the authors who have just passed under our review, with the exception of Belon, Rondelet, and Gronovius, published their works without any regular series of plates illustrative of their descriptions. Among those who embellished their volumes with valuable figures, we have to mention Seba, in his large collection of subjects belonging to natural history,\u2014Catesby, in his History of Carolina,\u2014Broussonet, in his Ichthyologia,\u2014and Bloch, in his Natural History of Fishes, first published at Berlin in German, and in French in 1785, and recently republished in a small form, by Deterville, at Paris, forming part of the extensive work entitled Histoire Naturelle de Buffon, &c. Bloch's original work includes about 600 species of fishes, which are generally described with great accuracy, figured, as nearly as circumstances will admit, of the natural size, and beautifully coloured. The author enters with some minuteness into the history of those which afford food for man, or which suggest facts worthy of remark. He has followed the Linnaean method, and made considerable additions to the number of genera.\n\nLa C\u00e9p\u00e9de, the friend and continuator of Buffon, has Of La C\u00e9p\u00e9de likewise executed an elaborate and extensive undertaking on the natural history of fishes. He divides these classes of animals into two secondary classes, viz. the cartilaginous and the osseous. Each of these subordinate classes consists of four divisions, taken from the combinations of the presence or absence of the operculum, and of the branchial membrane; thus, the first division of the cartilaginous includes those fishes which have neither operculum nor branchial membrane; the second, those which have no operculum, but a membrane; the third, those which have an operculum, but no membrane; and the fourth, those which have both. The same characters, stated in the inverse order, determine the divisions of the osseous species. Each of these divisions is again distributed into the Linnaean orders, and these, in turn, into the Linnaean genera. The contents of the latter, however, do not always correspond with the enumerations in the System of Nature; for the French zoologist has withdrawn many species from their former categories, and ranged them under new genera. His innovations in this respect are, perhaps, not always improvements; and some of his generic appellations, as gobie, gobiofore, gobioide, gobionore, and gobiomoroide, pomacanthe, pomacentre, pomadafys, and pomatone, &c. are too nearly allied in sound and orthography, to be readily discriminated by the memory. We have, moreover, to regret that the plates are not coloured, and that they are executed on too small a scale. Yet, after every deduction which even rigid criticism may require from the merits of this publication, enough will remain to attest the industry and the talents of its author, and to justify the high rank which he has obtained among the writers on ichthyology.\n\nBefore closing even these very condensed notices, it would be unpardonable to omit reminding our readers, that the British fishes have found an able and entertaining expositor in Mr Pennant, to whom the natural history of this country is under many obligations. In the third volume of his British Zoology, this author describes the fishes under the three great divisions of cetaceous, cartilaginous, and bony. The latter, which is by far the most numerous, he subdivides into four sections, entitled, agreeably to the Linnaean orders, apodal, thoracic, jugular, and abdominal.\n\nBesides the sources of information to which we have referred, the curious inquirer into the history of fishes may occasionally resort to Duhamel's General Treatise\nCHAP. II. ANATOMY OF FISHES.\n\nThe shape of the body of fishes is subject to considerable varieties. It is said to be comprised, when the diameter, from side to side, is less than from back to belly; and deprested, on the contrary, when the diameter, from side to side, is greater than from back to belly. It is cylindrical, when it is circular in the greater part of its length; ensiform, or sword-shaped, when the back and belly terminate in a sharp edge, or when the body gradually tapers from the head to the tail; cultrated, or knife-shaped, when the back is somewhat flat, and the angle below acute; carinated, or keel-shaped, when the back is rounded, and the under part of the belly acute, through its length; oblong, when the longitudinal diameter is much longer than the transverse; oval, when the longitudinal diameter not only exceeds the transverse, but the base is circular, and the apex more acute; orbicular, when the longitudinal and transverse diameters are nearly equal; lamellated, or finear-shaped, when oblong, and attenuated at both extremities; cuneiform, or wedge-shaped, when the body gradually flattens towards the tail; conical, when it is cylindrical, and grows gradually more slender towards the tail; ventricose, when the belly is very prominent; gibbous, when the back presents one or more protuberances; annulated, when the body is surrounded by rings, or elevated lines; articulated, when it is covered with connected and bony plates; trigon, tetragon, pentagon, and hexagon, when the sides are plain, with three, four, or six longitudinal angles; if the number of these angles exceed six, it is termed a polygon.\n\nThe surface of the body of fishes is termed naked, when it is destitute of scales; fealy, when provided with them; smooth, when the scales are without angles, furrows, roughnesses, or inequalities; lubricious, or slippery, when invested with a mucous or slimy humour; tuberculated, or rough, when covered with prominent warts or tubercles; papillous, when covered with fleshy points; spinous, when the apertures are elongated, and pointed at their extremities; loricated, or mailed, when the body is inclosed in a hard, callous, or bony integument, or in scales so closely united as to seem but one; fasciatus, or banded, when marked with transverse zones from the back to the belly; striped, when marked with very narrow, scattered, and coloured streaks; varigated, when marked with longitudinal zones along the side, from the head to the tail; reticulated, or chequered, when marked with lines forming the appearance of net-work; pointed, or dotted, when marked with points, either longitudinally disposed, or without order; and variegated, when of different colours.\n\nThe parts of the body are either external, or internal: the former include the head, trunk, and fins; the latter, the skeleton, muscles, and viscera.\n\n1. The head is always placed at the anterior part of the body, and reaches from the extremity of the nose to the gills.\n\nSeveral of the technical terms already defined, are applied to the head as well as to the whole body; but others, which are more appropriate, require to be explained. Obtuse or truncated, denotes that the head is blunt, or terminated by a transverse line; acute, that it terminates in an acute angle; flaring, that it presents an inclined plane, from the top of the anterior part to the extremity of the nose; aculeated, or prickly, that it is armed with sharp points or spines; unarmed, that it is without spines or tubercles; bearded, that it is without cirri, &c.\n\nThe head contains the mouth, nose, jaws, lips, teeth, tongue, palate, nostrils, eyes, branchial opercula, the branchioleotegum membrane, the aperture of the gills, and the nares.\n\nThe mouth is that cavity, which is terminated in front by its own orifice; on the sides, by the branchial opercula; and behind, by the throat. It is superior, when placed at the upper part of the head; inferior, when at the lower part; vertical, when it descends perpendicularly from the upper part; transverse, or horizontal, when it is parallel to the surface of the water when the fish swims; oblique, when it is neither vertical nor horizontal; tubular, or filiform, when the orifice is narrow, round, and deep; fimbriate, or flat-nosed, when the orifice is not prominent or deep.\n\nThe nose, or snout, is the fore part of the head, extending from the eyes to the extremity of the jaws. It is cuspidated, when its apex terminates in a sharp point or brittle; spatula-shaped, when its extremity is flattened and extended; bifid, forked, or lobed, when its extremity is divided into two lobes; trigemous and tetragemous, when it has three or four flat sides; and reflex, when it is incurved towards the belly.\n\nThe jaws are always two in number, and differ in different species chiefly in respect of figure and proportion. They are fimbriate, or awl-shaped, when they are rounded at the base, and are gradually attenuated towards the apex; carinated, or keel-shaped, when the lower jaw is longitudinally ridged, either without or within; equal, when both are of the same length; unequal, when one projects beyond the other; naked, when not covered with lips; labiate, when covered with one or two lips; edentulated, when destitute of teeth; dentated, or toothed, when furnished with teeth of unequal size; dentato-crenated, when the bones are formed into the appearance of teeth; ciliated, or cirrose, when furnished with cirri, or brittle membranaceous appendages, which hang from one or both jaws; vagnated, or fleathed, when the margin of one covers that of the other; arched, or covered, when furnished with a membranaceous veil, attached before, and loole behind,\nbehind, within which, and the upper or under part of the mouth, the fish lays its tongue, or discharges water from its mouth; and moveable, when they can be thrust out or drawn in.\n\nThe lips are obvious only in a few fishes, and are either of a fleshy or bony consistence. They are also distinguished into plicated, or consisting of folds, and retractile, or capable of being drawn out or in, at the pleasure of the animal.\n\nThe teeth are acute, when their extremity terminates in a point; obtuse, when it is rounded; granular, when the teeth are of the size and shape of small grains; plane, when flat on the sides; semi-facinate, when hooked on one side only; serrated, when toothed like a saw on the margin; emarginate, when the extremity is somewhat cleft; recurved, when inclined towards the gullet; parallel, when of the same direction, length, and figure; diverging, when the spines stand wide, or distant from each other; similar, when they are all of the same size and figure; dissimilar, when some are acute, and others obtuse; ordinate, when disposed in one or more rows; confused, when crowded, and not disposed in any regular order.\n\nThe tongue is termed acute or obtuse, according as its extremity terminates in a point, or is rounded; it is emarginate, or bifid, when the extremity is divided into two lobes; carinated, when angulated on the upper or lower surface; dentated, when its surface is furnished with teeth; and papillose, when covered with fleshy points.\n\nThe palate is that part of the mouth which is included between the base of the jaws and the origin of the oesophagus. It is either smooth, when its surface is destitute of tubercles, teeth, and apertures; or denticulated, when furnished with teeth.\n\nThe nostrils are orifices, almost always situated in the rostrum, before the eyes. They are anterior, when they occupy the fore part of the rostrum, and are somewhat distant from the eyes; posterior, when situated at the base of the rostrum, and very near the eyes; superior, when on the crown of the head, between the eyes, and close to them; cylindrical, when they form a tube; single, or solitary, when there is only one on each side of the head; and double, when there are two on each side.\n\nThe eyes are always two, and are composed of two principal parts, which as they are visible from without belong to the description of the external structure. These parts are the pupil and the iris. The first occupies the centre of the globe; and is usually spherical, but sometimes oval; and the second is the coloured circle which surrounds the pupil, and is often furnished with a distinct ring. It is, for the most part black or gold-coloured, but sometimes it assumes a silvery hue.\n\n\u2014The eyes are said to be covered, when they are enveloped in the skin, or in a nictitating membrane; semi-covered, when this membrane is arched, or lunulated, or perforated like a ring; naked, when destitute of a nictitating membrane; vertical, when situated on the crown of the head; lateral, when placed on the sides of the head; binate, when they are both on the same side of the head; plane, or depressed, when the convexity of the ball does not exceed the surface of the head; convex, when the convexity projects beyond this surface; salient, when the eyes are very prominent.\n\nThe branchial opercles, are fleshy or bony processes situated on both sides of the head, behind the eyes, opercles, cloathing the aperture of the gills, and sustaining the branchial membranae. They are termed simple, when composed of a single piece; diphyllous, triphyllous, or tetraphyllous, when consisting of two, three, or four pieces; flexible, or soft, when they can be easily bent; sub-arcuated, when the posterior margin is rounded; fulvous, when the branchial opening seems to be excavated out of the substance of the opercula; acuminated, when the hinder plate runs out into a sharp process; ciliated, when the posterior margin is fringed, or set with membranous fleshy appendages; frenated, or bridled, when connected with the body by means of a membrane; scarrous, when their surface is covered with apertures; striated, when marked with hollow and nearly parallel lines; radiated, when the lines run like rays, from the centre to the edge; graved, when the lines appear in no regular order; aculeated, when the posterior margin is terminated by one or more spines; serrated, when it is cut like the teeth of a saw; fleshy, when the surface of the opercles is covered with scales.\n\nThe branchial, or branchiopterygian membranae, is a true fin, formed of cartilaginous crooked bones, joined by a bony thin membrane, lurking under the opercula, to which it adheres, and is capable of being folded or expanded, as necessity requires. This membrane is said to be patent, when it projects beyond the margin of the opercula; retracted or latent, when it is concealed under them; covered, when concealed under them, yet so as to be visible without hurting them.\n\nThe aperture of the gills, is a cleft commonly lateral, which opens between the opercula and the trunk, by means of the gills. It is arcuated, or arched, when it represents a crescent; operculated, when quite covered by the opercula; pipe-shaped, when in the form of a tube. Its place, in some of the cartilaginous species, is supplied by venous, or spiracles, which are either round, arched, lateral, or inferior, i.e. placed underneath the body.\n\nThe nape is the hind and terminating part of the head, which is attached to the first vertebra of the trunk, in the region of the gills. It is carinated, when its surface is sharply angulated; plane, when flat, and on a level with the body; and fulcated, when ridged or furrowed.\n\n2. The trunk is that part of the body, which extends from the nape and branchial aperture, to the extremity of the tail. It comprehends the gills, throat, thorax, back, sides, abdomen, lateral line, anus, tail, and scales.\n\nThe gills, or branchiae, consist, for the most part, of four crooked, parallel, unequal bones, furnished, on the outer or convex part, with small soft appendages, like the barbs of a feather, and generally of a red colour. They are aculeated, when the concave or interior part has spines instead of tubercles; anomalous, when some are ciliated, others tuberculated, or of a different structure; denuded, when wanting opercles, the branchiopterygian membrane, or both; peciinated, when the convex or exterior part, towards the branchial aperture,\nAnatomy of Fishes\n\nIchthyology.\n\nChap. II\n\nis furnished with red fetaeous rays, or lamellae; withdrawn, when not conspicuous, lying nearer the throat than the aperture; simple, when furnished either with filaments or tubercles; approaching, when they correspond to the same aperture.\n\nThe throat is that part which corresponds to the branchial apertures, and is placed between them. It is swelling, when it exceeds the level of the body and the head; carinated, when angulated underneath; plane, when on a level with the thorax and head.\n\nThe thorax is that part which begins at the extremity of the throat, and is terminated by a line drawn to the insertion of the pectoral fins.\n\nThe back is the upper part of the trunk, extending from the nape to the origin of the tail. It is apterygious, without fins; monopterygious, dipterygious, &c., with one, or two fins; convex, higher in the middle than toward the sides; serrated, having a deep longitudinal furrow for the same purpose.\n\nThe sides are that part of the trunk, which reaches from the gills to the anus, between the back and the abdomen. They are sometimes marked with zones, lines, spots, or points.\n\nThe abdomen is the under part of the trunk, between the posterior extremity of the thorax and the origin of the tail. It is carinated, or acute through its length; serrated, when the scales forming the carina are disposed like the teeth of a saw; plane, when without prominence or depression.\n\nThe lateral line usually commences at the extremity of the branchial opercles, runs along the sides, and terminates at the caudal fin. It is formed by lines, dots, or small tubercles. It is straight, when it presents no inflexion through its length; curved, when it inclines to the back or belly; broken, when divided into two or more parts, which follow different directions; obliterated, when scarcely perceptible; double, when there are two on each side; smooth, when without prickles or tubercles; aculeated, when furnished with spines; defending, when it runs obliquely from the head to the tail; inferior, when situated on the lower part of the side; foricated, or mailed, when rough with small bones, or hard scaly tubercles; mean, when situated in the middle of the side; obsolete, when nearly effaced; porous, when punctured with small holes; finuous, when bent in a waving line; solitary, when there is one line on each side; superior, when on the upper part of the side, near the back; banded, when covered with a longitudinal zone, coloured or flivery.\n\nThe anus is the external orifice of the rectum. It is jugular, when situated under the branchial opercles; pectoral, when under the gills; mean, when equally removed from the head and the extremity of the tail; remote, when near the tail.\n\nThe tail is the solid part of the trunk, which it terminates, being situated behind the anus. It is round, as in the lamprey and eels; carinated, when its surface presents some sharp angle; muricated, when befit with spines or tubercles; apterygious, when destitute of fins; dipterygious, when the fin is divided at the base.\n\nThe scales are pellucid, cartilaginous, or horny teguments, which usually cover the trunk. They are oval, when one extremity is rounded, and larger than the other; orbiculate, when nearly round; smooth, when destitute of sensible angles or asperities; ciliated, when the margin is set with fetaeous processes; serrated, when the margin is toothed like a saw; imbricated, when the scales partly cover one another, like tiles on a roof; rare, when feebly separated from one another; deciduous, when they easily fall off; tenacious, when they are detached with difficulty; remote, when separated from one another; verticillate, when surrounding the body in rings.\n\n3. The fins consist of several rays connected by a thin, tender film, or membrane; and they are raised, expanded, or moved in various directions, by means of appropriate muscles. The rays of the fins are either jointed and flexible small bones, whose extremity is often divided into two parts; or hard and prickly, without division at the extremity. In some cases, those on the back of the fish are furnished with membranaceous appendages, simple, or palmated, and adhering to the apex or sides.\u2014The fins, according to their position, are denominated dorsal, pectoral, ventral, anal, or caudal.\n\nThe dorsal fins are situated on the upper part of the body, between the head and the tail. Their number varies from one to three, and so gives rise to the epithets monopterygious, dipterygious, and tripterygious. If the back has no fin, it is said to be apterygious. The form, size, and situation of the dorsal fins have likewise figured various technical appellations; but few of these require to be particularly defined. We shall notice, therefore, only the floppy, which are covered with a thick skin, or muscular substance; and the ramamentaceous, which are furnished with membranaceous or filamentous appendages.\n\nThe pectoral fins are situated on each side, about the aperture of the gills. In some species, they are wanting; in others, solitary, or one on each side; in a few they are double, i.e., two on each side; in some, they are falcated, or arched above, and concave below.\n\nThe ventral or inferior fins are always placed on the under part of the fish; but at a greater distance from the mouth. They are abdominal, when placed in the belly, behind the pectoral fins, and not fixed in the sternum, but in the osa pelvis; diiform, when they have a spine or cirrus, besides the follicles; jugular, when placed under the throat before the pectoral fins, and fixed to the clavicles; multiradiated, when they have several rays, though seldom exceeding seven; thoracic, when placed under the pectoral fins, often a little behind them, but always fixed to the sternum.\n\nThe anal fin is placed between the anus and the caudal fin. It is bifurcated, or two-forked, when the follicles in the middle are short; coalcing, when united with the caudal fin; longitudinal, when it extends from the anus to the tail; posterior, when placed at the end of the tail, near the caudal fin.\n\nThe caudal fin is situated vertically, at the extremity of the body. It is equal, or entire, when its rays are of equal length; lanceolate, when the rays in the middle are longer than the others; emarginate, when they are shorter than the others; bifid, when they are very short; trifid, when the fin is divided into three lobes; coalcing, when united with the dorsal and anal fins; cuppidated, when attenuated at the apex, or terminating in a fetaeous point; fetiferous, when a filiform appendage proceeds from the division.\n\nInternal\nThe skeleton of a fish is the assemblage of bones which constitutes the framework of its body. The number of these bones is not uniform in each individual, but varies according to age and species. They may be conveniently divided into those of the head, thorax, abdomen, and fins.\n\nThe head contains a considerable number of bones; that of the perch, for example, has eighty. As the limited nature of our plan precludes minute specification, we shall only indicate a few of the most important. The skull covers the whole head, its sides frequently forming the sockets of the eyes, the temples, and the cheeks. The upper and lower jaw-bones are placed on the fore part of the head. The upper is more or less of an arched form. In some fishes it is wanting, and its place supplied by a portion of the skull. The lower jaw is usually arched or triangular, and its length regulates that of the snout, or rostrum. The bones of the palate are, for the most part, four, viz., two on each side of the fauces, oval, and nearly plane, often crowded with teeth, or rough with tubercles, or furrowed transversely, the base of one connected with the apex of the other. The gills are attached to these osicles on each side by a cartilage. The opercular bones are situated at the hind part of the jaws, on each side of the head, and behind the eyes. In some species, they form a part of the upper jaw. The hyoid bone is an osicle situated between the two sides of the lower jaw, serving as a basis for the tongue, presenting the figure of a V, and occasionally furnished with a hook.\n\nThe thorax is a cavity principally formed by the vertebrae, the sternum, the clavicles, and the scapulae. The vertebrae form the back-bone, which reaches from the skull to the extremity of the tail. They are stronger and thicker towards the head, and grow weaker and more slender towards the tail. Each species has a determinate number of vertebrae, which grow with the body. They are furnished with transverse and spiny processes, the former of which are marked by transverse lines, by the number of which, it is supposed, the age of fishes may be known. The spinal marrow is contained in the canal which passes through the vertebrae. The sternum in fishes is not cartilaginous, as in other animals, but always bony. Its form varies considerably, being sometimes triangular, sometimes rounded before, and pointed behind, but most frequently of a rhomboidal figure. It occupies the fore part of the thorax, and closes that cavity. The clavicles are two bones situated transversely behind the opening of the gills; and are sometimes formed by two osicles united. They are attached to the first vertebra. The scapulae are two flat, rhomboidal, or arched bones, situated on the lateral side of the body, under the posterior margin of the clavicles, and serving as a base to the pectoral fins. When the scapulae are wanting, the pectoral fins are attached to the sternum, or to the margin of the clavicles.\n\nThe abdomen forms a cavity always larger than that of the thorax, extending from the extremity of the latter to the anus. It is encompassed by the ribs and the os pelvis. The ribs are bony arches, situated obliquely on the lateral parts of the abdomen, having their upper extremity articulated with the extremity of the transverse processes of the vertebrae. Their number is very variable. In those species which are without ribs, the absence of the latter is compensated by the length and direction of the transverse processes of the vertebrae. The os pelvis are two bones which defend the viscera contained in the abdomen. The ventral fins are usually attached to their posterior margin. When these fins are wanting, or when they are attached under the throat, or on the thorax, the os pelvis are also wanting. The tail is composed of certain bones, which terminate the vertebral column. The processes of each vertebra of the tail are incident to great variety in respect of number and dimensions.\n\nThe fins are formed of a certain number of osicles, connected to one another by firm membranes. The dorsal and anal fins are supported by the inter-spinous bones (osca inter-spinosa), which lie between the pointed processes of the vertebrae, and are connected with them by a ligament. The rays of the anal fin have nearly the same conformation as those of the dorsal.\n\n2. The muscles are an assemblage of small bundles of muscular fibres, partly red, and partly whitish, enveloped in a common membrane. The first of these is called the fleshy portion of the muscle; the second, the tendon. Each muscle thus composed, is susceptible of contraction and dilatation. The former is accompanied by a visible swelling, hardening, wrinkling, and shortening of the muscle, and the latter by its elongation, expansion, and recovery of its former softness and flexibility. Its force, in general, depends on the quantity of fibrous matter which enters into its composition, and its moving power on the length and size of the fibres. The muscles vary much in respect of number, size, and situation. There are two which proceed from the head to the tail, along the sides of the body, and hence denominated lateral muscles. Each of these seems to be composed of several transverse muscles, which are similar and parallel. There are four situated at the caudal fin, namely, three superior, and one inferior. Of the two former, one is straight, and two are oblique. The fourth occupies the half of the lower extremity of the tail. There are likewise four at each pectoral fin, namely, two erectors and two depressors; the two former situated on the external surface of the clavicles and scapulae, and the two latter under these parts. Each ventral fin has three muscles, one erecter and two depressors; the first placed over the whole external face of the os pelvis, and the two latter on the internal surface of the same part. The cardinal muscles of the back and tail are slender, and closely united, occupying the space that is left between the lateral muscles. Their number is always proportioned to that of the dorsal fins. Fishes, for example, which have no dorsal fin, have but one pair of cardinal muscles, those which have one dorsal fin, have two pairs, and those which have two dorsal fins, have three pairs, viz., one pair between the first and second fin, another between the two fins, and a third between the second dorsal and the caudal fin. The proper inter-spinous muscles are those whose office it is to raise or depress the dorsal and anal fins. Each inter-spinous ray is furnished with four, two erectors, and two depressors. The dilating muscle of the branchiostegal membrane is small, and attached by its anterior extremity, partly under the angle of the lower...\nAnatomy lower jaw, and partly to the sides of the os pelvis. It is fixed to the branchial membrane by as many tendons as there are tendons in the membrane.\n\n3. Organs and viscera.\u2014The brain of fishes is a very small organ, relative to the size of the head. It is divided into three equal lobes, of which the two anterior are contiguous; the third being placed behind, and forming the cerebellum. These three lobes are surrounded by a frothy matter, resembling saliva. In this region the optic and olfactory nerves are easily discovered.\n\nThe esophagus, or gullet, begins at the bottom of the throat, and descends, in a straight line, to the upper orifice of the stomach. It is membranous, smooth, and lined with a mucous humour.\n\nThe stomach is a membranous sack, sometimes cylindrical or spherical, and sometimes divided into two lobes.\n\nThe swimming, or air-bladder, or sound, is an oblong, white, membranous bag, sometimes cylindrical, sometimes elliptical, and sometimes divided into two or three lobes, of different lengths. It is usually situated between the vertebrae and the stomach, and included within the peritoneum. In some fishes it communicates with the stomach, and in others, with the esophagus. The flat fishes are unprovided with this organ.\n\nThe intestines, which in man are placed transversely, have a longitudinal position in fishes, and are all connected with the substance of the liver. They are in general very short, making only three turns, the last of which terminates in a common outlet or vent. The appendices, or secondary intestines, are very numerous, composing a group of worm-like processes, all ultimately terminating in two large canals, opening into the first intestine, into which they discharge their peculiar fluid.\n\nThe liver is commonly of a yellowish colour. It is situated on the right or left side, or in the anterior region of the abdomen, of whose cavity it fills about two thirds. It is sometimes simple, and sometimes divided into two, three, or more lobes. It usually contains a large portion of oil or fat.\n\nThe gall-bladder is oval or oblong, and lies under the right side of the liver. It communicates with the stomach or the intestines, by means of the cecile duct and the choledochic canal.\n\nThe spleen varies in form and position. Sometimes it is all of a piece; sometimes divided into many lobes, which adhere only by very slender filaments. In some individuals it is black, in others it has the red hue of clotted blood. It is placed near the backbone, and at a place where it is subject to an alternate contraction and dilatation, from the pressure of the air-bag, which is situated in its neighbourhood.\n\nAlmost all fishes are provided with the urinary bladder. Its form is nearly oval. It terminates under the tail; and has no communication with the rectum.\n\nThe kidneys are two flat bodies, of a pyramidal form, as long as the abdomen, and of a reddish colour. They are attached to the vertebrae, separated from the cavity of the abdomen by the peritoneum, and frequently prolonged from the diaphragm to the region of the urinary bladder.\n\nThe diaphragm is a white and shining membranous which separates the thorax from the abdomen. This partition is partly fleshy and partly tendinous.\n\nThe peritoneum, or membrane investing the contents of the abdomen, is thin and of a blackish colour.\n\nThe ovaria, in the females, are divided into two large oblong bodies, one on each side of the abdomen; and the milt or soft-roe, in the male, appears in a similar form in the same part.\n\nThe pericardium is a small bag which contains the heart.\n\nThe heart is a viscus situated on the sternum, under the posterior gills. It varies considerably in form, being sometimes flat, frequently triangular or pyramidal, &c. Its position is not transverse, as Arreda has alleged, but longitudinal, as in quadrupeds. It consists of one ventricle and one auricle. The sides of the former are rugose, and exhibit many small cavities. The latter is a very slender muscular bag, with a larger cavity than that of the ventricle, and forming the communication between the heart and\n\nThe venous sinus. The capacity of this last is still greater than that of the auricle. Its position is transverse, corresponding to that of the diaphragm. It communicates with the auricle by a large aperture, and receives at the other end three large trunks of veins.\n\nThe aorta is an artery attached to the apex of the heart, and sending out numberless branches to the gills, on which it is subdivided into ramifications so minute as to escape the eye unless assisted by a glass.\n\nThe blood of fishes is red, and the red particles are not round as in the mammalia, but oval as in the amphibia.\n\nDr Monro's elaborate description of the absorbent system in fishes, is thus stated by Dr Shaw in the fourth volume of his General Zoology.\n\n\"On the middle of the belly, immediately below the outer skin, a lymphatic vessel runs upwards from the vent, and receives branches from the sides of the belly and the fin below the vent; near the head this lymphatic passes between the two pectoral fins, and having got above them, receives their lymphatics: it then goes under the juncture of the two bones which form the thorax, where it opens into a net-work of very large lymphatics which lie close to the pericardium, and almost surrounds the heart: this net-work, besides that part of it behind the heart, has a large lymphatic on each side, which receives others from the kidney, runs upon the bone of the thorax backwards, and when it has got as far as the middle of that bone, sends off a large branch from its inside to join the thoracic duct; after detaching this branch, it is joined by the lymphatics of the thoracic fins, and soon after by a lymphatic which runs upon the side of the fish; it is formed of branches, which give it a beautiful penniform appearance. Besides these branches, there is another set lying deeper, which accompanies the ribs; after the large lymphatic has been joined by the above-mentioned vessels, it receives others from the gills, orbit, nose, and mouth: a little below the orbit another net-work appears, consisting in part of the vessels above described, and of the thoracic duct; this net-work is very complete, some of its vessels lying on each side the muscles of the gills, and from its internal part a trunk is sent out, which terminates in the jugular vein.\n\n\"The lacteals run on each side of the mesenteric arteries,\"\nPhysiology teries, anatolomolog frequently across those vessels; the receptacle into which they enter is very large in proportion to them, and consists at its lower part of two branches, one of which lies between the duodenum and the stomach, and runs a little way upon the pancreas, receiving the lymphatics of the liver, pancreas, lower part of the stomach, and the lacteals from the greatest part of the small intestines; the other branch of the receptacle receives the lymphatics from the rest of the alimentary canal. The receptacle formed by these two branches lies on the right side of the upper part of the stomach, and is joined by some lymphatics in that part, and also by some from the sound and gall-bladder: the thoracic duct takes its rise from the receptacle, and lies on the right side of the oesophagus, receiving lymphatics from that part; and running up about half an inch, divides into two ducts, one of which passes over the oesophagus to the left side, and the other goes straight upon the right side, passing by the upper part of the kidney, from which it receives some final branches, and soon afterwards is joined by a branch from the large lymphatic that lies above the bone of the thorax, as formerly mentioned: near this part it likewise sends off a branch to join the duct of the opposite side; and then, a little higher, is joined by those large lymphatics from the upper part of the gills and from the fauces.\n\n\"The thoracic duct, after being joined by these vessels, communicates with the net-work near the orbit, where its lymph is mixed with that of the lymphatics from the posterior part of the gills, and from the superior fins, belly, &c., and then from this net-work a vessel goes into the jugular vein just below the orbit. This last vessel, which may be called the termination of the whole system, is very small in proportion to the net-work from which it rises; and indeed the lymphatics of the part are so large as to exceed by far the size of the sanguiferous vessels.\n\n\"The thoracic duct from the left side, having passed under the oesophagus from the right, runs on the inside of the vena cava of the left side, receives a branch from its fellow of the opposite side, and joins the large lymphatics which lie on the left side of the pericardium, and a part of those which lie behind the heart, and afterwards makes, together with the lymphatics from the gills, upper fins, and side of the fish, a net-work, from which a vessel passes into the jugular vein of this side: in a word, the lymphatics of the left side agree exactly with those of the right. Another part of the system is more deeply seated, lying between the roots of the spinal processes of the back-bone. This part consists of a large trunk that begins from the lower part of the fish, and as it ascends receives branches from the dorsal fins and adjacent parts of the body: it goes up near the head, and sends a branch to each thoracic duct near its origin.\"\n\nCHAP. III. PHYSIOLOGY AND HABITUDES OF FISHES.\n\nMOST of the observations which belong to this section may be referred to the general topics of respiration, external senses, motion, nourishment, reproduction, and duration.\n\n1. Respiration.\n\nThis important animal function is performed, in fishes, by means of gills, which supply the place of lungs. Though all fishes live in water, the presence of air is not less necessary to their existence than to our own. If a carp, for example, be put into a large vase of water, from which the air is extracted by the air-pump, a number of bubbles are observable on the surface of the fish's body; soon after, the animal breathes faster and with greater difficulty; it then rises to the surface to get more air; the bubbles on its surface begin to disappear; next, the belly, which was swollen, will suddenly fall, and the fish sinks to the bottom, convulsed and expiring. For the same reason, if the external air be excluded from a small pond by a sufficient and durable covering of ice, the fish within it will be killed: or if a hole be made in the ice, before it be too late, they will all come near it for a fresh supply of air. In ordinary cases, a fish in the water first receives a quantity of that element by the mouth, from which it is driven to the gills; these close, and prevent the water so swallowed from returning by the mouth, at the same time that their bony covering prevents it from passing through them, until the proper quantity of air has been drawn from it. The covers then open, and give it a free passage: by which means the gills also are again opened, and admit a fresh body of water.\n\nShould the free play of the gills be suspended, or their covers kept from moving, by a string tied round them, the fish would soon fall into convulsions, and die in a few minutes. Though the branchial apparatus be comprised in a small compass, its surface, if fully extended, would occupy a very considerable space, since that of the common lobe is equal to the surface of the human body. This single fact may convince us of the numberless convolutions and ramifications in which the included water is elaborated and attenuated in the course of giving out its air in the respiratory process. This process, in fishes, as in the human subject, is carried on during sleep, and is repeated about twenty-five times in a minute.\n\nAtmospheric air, though in small quantities, is thus imparted to the blood at the ramifications of the gills, without, however, depriving it of a large body of the share of the hydrogenated and carbonized substances furnished by the aliment; and, consequently, without communicating to it so much of the vermilion tinge as is observable in warm-blooded animals with lungs. Hence the oily quality of the blood of fishes, and the greatly congestions which take place in their livers, and in the abdominal regions of animals whose respiration is slow or scanty. The act of breathing is, in reality, a species of combustion; and the temperature of animals in whose system this combustion is imperfectly performed, is necessarily low. As that of fishes is little elevated above the mean temperature of water, some species, as eels and gudgeons, are occasionally benumbed by the winter's cold, and remain concealed in the mud or sand, without motion, food, or breathing, till the warmth of spring roules them from their torpor. As\nPhylogeny the bottom of the sea, however, probably preserves a pretty equal degree of heat at all times, the myriad tribes which inhabit it are permanently secured against the inclemency of the sea. The tardy circulation of the blood in fishes may likewise, in some measure, depend on their mode of respiration. The heart of the carp contracts only thirty-five times in the course of a minute, or about half as often as that of a man. In the carnivorous species of fishes, as the shark, pike, salmon, &c., the heart is comparatively larger, the circulation more rapid, and the breathing more powerful. Active, robust, and courageous, they are also less encumbered with fat, and their liver is less buttery than in the other species. It deserves to be remarked, however, that the blood in fishes, after being thrown by the heart into the ramifications of the gills, is collected again by a vast number of small veins, somewhat in the same manner as in the mammalia; but instead of returning to the heart again, these vessels unite and form a descending aorta, without the intervention of an auricle and ventricle, a circumstance which may also materially contribute to the flowness of the circulation.\n\nFor some time it was believed, that the cartilaginous fishes were provided with internal lungs, an idea which has been abandoned by later physiologists, who have proved, that the supposed lungs are only a peculiar modification of gills. To the want of lungs we may ascribe the want of voice; for, though some kinds of fishes, as those of the genus Balistes, when seized, discharge a quantity of air and water with a rustling noise, and the rubbing of the fins on the scales sometimes produces an indistinct rattling sound; yet both are very different from anything like audible language that can be understood among the individuals of a species.\n\n2. External Senses.\n\nThat fishes possess the sense of hearing, is evident from the accuracy with which they direct their motions to the objects of their pursuit. Their organs of vision, too, are admirably adapted to the circumstances of their condition. As their eyes are not placed in the forepart, but in the sides of the head, they cannot look, at the same time, with both on one object, so conveniently as quadrupeds. Their optic nerves, accordingly, are not confounded with one another, in their middle progress betwixt their origin and the orbit, but the one passes over the other without any communication; so that the nerve which comes from the left side of the brain, goes distinctly to the right eye, and vice versa. As fishes are continually exposed to injuries in the uncertain element in which they reside, and as they are in perpetual danger of becoming a prey to the larger ones, it was necessary that their eyes should never be shut; and as the cornea is sufficiently washed by the element in which they live, they are not provided with eye-lids; yet, as in the current itself, the eye must be exposed to several injuries, it is defended by a firm pellucid membrane, being a continuation of the same transparent cuticle which covers the rest of the head, and which, being inflexible and destitute of vessels, is not liable to obstructions and opacities. We may likewise observe, that the optic nerve and crystalline lens are larger than in other animals, that the choroides is composed of two separate membranes, and that all these parts are differently modified and arranged, according to the manners and habits of different species. Those fishes which undertake long voyages, and traverse much space in a short time, as the trout, salmon, salvelin, &c., have the conformation of the eye like that of birds; whose sight is very acute. Were we, indeed, to form our judgment of the power of vision in fishes merely from the external appearance of their eyes, we should conclude, that it is far from perfect, and that the final convexity of the cornea would occasion very little refraction in the rays of light; but this defect is sufficiently compensated by the structure of the crystalline lens, which is almost spherical, and more dense than in terrestrial animals. In its natural state, it is transparent, and not much harder than a jelly; and it forms that little hard pea-like substance which is found in the eyes of fishes after boiling. As the rays fall on this convex humour, undergo a powerful refraction, gradually approach one another, and unite at the axis of the eye, where they form their impressions. In most fishes the eyes are naked; but those of the skate tribe are distinguished by a digitated curtain, which hangs over the pupil, and which may exclude the light when the animal rests; and, in the genera Gadus and Blennius, the eyes are covered with an internal inciting membrane.\n\nThat fishes possess the sense of hearing, has been alternately maintained and denied by the most celebrated naturalists, since the days of Aristotle. Among the moderns, Ardei, Linnaeus, and Govan have contended for the non-existence of this faculty, although some very ordinary facts naturally lead to an opposite conclusion. It is well known that fishes are affected by noise, and that they seem to be alarmed at loud explosions. On the coast of Brittany, they are frequently chased into nets by the sound of a drum; in China, by that of the tam-tam; and in ponds, they have been taught to assemble at the ringing of a bell. These sounds, however, it has been alleged, produce certain changes or vibrations in the water, which are seen by the animals, or which affect them in some way different from acting on the organ of hearing, an organ which naturalists and anatomists had long laboured in vain to discover. As the eruptions of Etna are sometimes felt at Malta, and an earthquake will sometimes visibly agitate the sea, at the distance of many leagues, it is supposed that smaller commotions in the atmosphere may communicate similar impressions to the finny tribes, independently of the medium of hearing. The laborious Klein spared no pains in searching for some hidden organ, by which he hoped to demonstrate that fishes are not more defective of the faculty of hearing than other animals; but though his investigations proved fruitless, we are indebted to him for many curious observations on the number and figure of the small bones which are to be found in the head of various species. Geoffroi also made some important discoveries, but without arriving at decisive results. At length, the abbe Nollet proved, that water is a conductor of sound, and that even the tones and articulation of the human voice may be transmitted through its medium. All that now remained to let the question completely at rest, was to detect the parts of the auditory organ in fishes, and there the celebrated Camper has distinctly revealed in consequence of numerous dissections. For his particular description of the figure and mechanism of\nPhysiology of the whole apparatus, we must refer our readers to the seventh volume of the Harlem Memoirs, and to a paper which he has inserted in one of the volumes of the Journal des Savans \u00c9trangers. Suffice it for the present to note, that this curious organ is contained in the cavity of the head, and that it consists of three semicircular, cartilaginous canals, and an elastic bag, which includes one or two very moveable follicles, floating in a jelly more or less thick, and slightly adhering to the contiguous parts. The moment that the vibration of the water, which is analogous to that of the air, is communicated to the fish's head, the impulsion is transmitted to the follicles, which, acting in the ratio of their mass multiplied by the force of the impulse, impart their movement to the whole of the elastic bag and to the semicircular canals. The sentient principle is more or less alive to the action of the follicles on the nerves, that is to say, in Camper's own language, \"that the fish perceives sound, but found peculiar to the watery element.\" Hunter, who observed the same organs in the head of fishes, remarks that their structure varies in different species. His minute and ingenious observations on this subject are published in the 77th volume of the Philosophical Transactions. \"Fishes, particularly of the skate kind,\" says Dr Shaw, \"have a bag at some distance behind the eyes, which contains a fluid, and a soft cretaceous substance, and supplies the place of the vestibule and cochlea: there is a nerve distributed upon it, similar to the portio mollis in man: they have semicircular canals, which are filled with a fluid, and communicate with the bag: they have likewise a meatus externus, which leads to the internal ear. The cod-fish, and others of the same shape, have an organ of hearing somewhat similar to the former; but instead of a soft substance contained in the bag, there is a hard cretaceous stone.\"\n\nThe sense of touch is probably very imperfect in fishes, because it results from the contact and immediate application of the surface of some object to that of the animal, and all parts of the body are not equally fit to be applied to the surface of foreign substances. The hand alone, which is divided into several flexible and moveable parts, and is capable of being applied to different portions of the same surface, at the same time, seems peculiarly destined to convey the ideas of size and form, and even it would ill discharge such an office, if its contact with objects should be intercepted by any intermediate substance, as hair, feathers, shells, scales, &c. A rough and hard skin blunts the sense of touch, while a fine and delicate one renders it more lively and exquisite. Hence, we may presume, that fishes, which are destitute of palmed extremities, are incapable of recognizing the forms of bodies. Besides, as they are invested with a rough skin, which is frequently covered with tubercles, or numberless scales, they appear to be unsuited to that delicacy of feeling which nature has bestowed on many of the quadrupeds.\n\nIn the mouth of man, and of those animals which are endowed with flexibility of taste, there are numberless nervous papillae, large, porous, constantly supplied with an abundance of lymph, and covered with a delicate skin, or invested in sheaths of very unequal lengths. The favorable matters are arrested by these asperities, diluted by the lymph, and absorbed by the pores, which convey them to the nervous papillae, on which they act as stimulants. The tongue is the principal seat of this system of organs, and is extremely susceptible of impression, being composed of fleshy fibres, encompassed by a medullary tissue. In fishes, however, few pores have been discovered in the interior region of the mouth, the lymph is constantly carried off by the passage of the water, the tongue is sometimes imperfect and sometimes cartilaginous, and the palate is generally hard and bony. If to these circumstances we add the want of mastication, we may justly infer, that fishes are nearly destitute of the discriminating powers of taste. Accordingly, they are remarked for voracity, rather than for particular relishes; and they will often swallow substances which can afford them no nourishment.\n\nThe organ of smelling, on the other hand, is large, and the animals have a power of contracting and dilating the entry to it as they have occasion. All have one or more nostrils; and even those which have not the holes perceptible without, yet have the proper formation of the bones for smelling within. The olfactory nerves, which are extended over the nostrils, are probably the instruments by which they are enabled to distinguish their food. A fish will discover a worm that is thrown into the water, at a considerable distance; and that this is not done by the eye, is manifest from the consideration, that after the same worm has remained for some time in the water, and lost its smell, no fishes will come near it; but if you make several little incisions into it, so as to let out more of the odoriferous effluvia, the creatures again approach it. \"We may frequently observe them,\" says the intelligent naturalist quoted above, allowing themselves to be carried down with the stream, that they may ascend again leisurely against the current of the water; thus the odoriferous particles swimming in that medium, being applied more forcibly to their organs of smell, produce a stronger sensation.\"\n\n3. Motion.\n\nMost fishes present us with the same external form, being sharp at either end, and swelling in the middle, whereby they are enabled to traverse their native fluid with greater ease and celerity. We wisely encourage them to imitate this peculiar shape in the construction of vessels designed to sail with the greatest swiftness; yet, the progress of a machine moved forward in the water by human contrivance, is nothing to the rapidity of an animal formed to reside in that element. The large fishes are known to overtake a ship in full sail with the greatest ease to play round it, without effort, and to outstrip it at pleasure. The flight of an arrow is not more rapid than the darting of a tunny, a salmon, or a gilt-head, through the water. It has been calculated that a salmon will glide over 86,400 feet in an hour, and 24 feet in a second, that it will advance more than a degree of the meridian of the earth in a day, and make the tour of the world in the course of some weeks. Every part of the body seems exerted in this dispatch; the fins, the tail, and the motion of the whole back-bone assist progression; and it is to that flexibility of body which mocks the efforts of art, that fishes owe their great velocity.\n\nThe chief instruments in a fish's motion are its fins, Instruments air-bladder, and tail. With at least two pair, and three single\nsingle fins, it will migrate with great rapidity, and take voyages of a thousand leagues in a season, without indicating any visible symptoms of languor or fatigue. But it does not always happen, that fishes which have the greatest number of fins, have also the swiftest motion: the shark, for example, which is reckoned one of the swiftest swimmers, wants the ventral fins; while the haddock, which has its full complement of fins, is more tardy in its progress.\n\nThe fins serve not only to assist the animal in progression, but in rising or sinking, in turning, or even in leaping out of the water. To answer these purposes, the pectoral fins, like ears, serve to push the animal forward, and have, therefore, not unaptly, been compared to the wings of a bird. By their help and continued motion, the flying-fish is sometimes seen to dart out of the water, and to fly above a hundred yards. The pectoral fins likewise serve to balance the head, when it is too large for the body, and prevent it from tumbling prone to the bottom, as happens to large-headed fishes, when the pectoral fins are cut off. The ventral fins, which lie flat in the water, in whatever situation the fish may be, serve rather to raise or depress the body, than to assist its progressive motion. The dorsal fin acts as a poiser, in preserving the animal's equilibrium, at the same time that it aids the forward movement. The anal is designed to maintain the vertical or upright position of the body.\n\nBy means of the air-bladder, fishes can increase or diminish the specific gravity of their body. When they contract it, or press out the included air, by means of the abdominal muscles, the bulk of the body is diminished, its weight in proportion to the water is increased, and the fish swims easily at a great depth. On relaxing the operation of the abdominal muscles, the swimming-bladder again acquires its natural size, the body increases in bulk, consequently becomes lighter, and enables the fish to swim easily near the surface. So fishes which have no air-bladder, or whose bladder has been injured, keep always at the bottom.\n\nLastly, the tail may be regarded as the directing instrument of motion, to which the fins are only subservient. To illustrate all this by a simple experiment\u2014If we take a live carp, and put it into a large vessel, the fish, when in a state of repose, will be seen to spread all its fins, and to rest on the pectoral and ventral near the bottom; and, if it fold up either of its pectoral fins, it will incline to the side on which the folding takes place. When it desires to have a retrograde motion, striking with the pectoral fins, in a contrary direction, effectually produces it. If it desires to turn, a blow from the tail sends it about; but if the tail strike both ways, the motion is progressive. If the dorsal and ventral fins be cut off, the fish reels to the right and left, and endeavours to supply its loss by keeping the rest of its fins in constant exercise. If the right pectoral fin be cut off, the fish leans to that side; and, if the ventral fin on the same side be cut away, it loses its equilibrium entirely. When the tail is removed, the fish loses all motion, and abandons itself to the impulse of the water.\n\nThe slimy glutinous matter which is secreted from the pores of most fishes, not only defends their bodies from the immediate contact of the surrounding fluid, but facilitates their progressive motion.\n\nThe pelagic tribes of fishes, which traverse large portions of the ocean, as the salmon, tunny, and several species of corvphenia, gadus, sparus, etc., are furnished with large and strong fins, to enable them to struggle against large waves and rapid currents; whereas those which frequent the shores and fresh waters have their fins smaller and weaker; while those with soft fins seldom expose themselves to the fury of the storm, and confine themselves to depths that are not affected by the most impetuous winds. A more ample explanation of these particulars will be found in Borelli's work de Motu Animalium.\n\nNotwithstanding the astonishing agility of their movements, fishes often remain in a state of inactivity and stupor, till roused by the calls of hunger or love, or stimulated by the dread of an approaching enemy. The periodical and extensive migrations of certain tribes of fishes are not irreconcilable with this remark, since the want of food, or the important occupation of breeding, may induce them to change their station. But we cannot give implicit credit to the relations of those naturalists, who, copying from one another, affect on this subject the language of wonder and mystery. In regard to the reputed migrations of immense shoals of migration herrings from the polar regions to the south of Europe, and which have been generally ascribed to the depredations of the cetaceous tribes, we may be allowed to ask, why these small fishes proceed some hundreds of leagues beyond the reach of their enemies, and why they return in winter to the very haunts of their gigantic destroyers? If it be alleged, that these monstrous animals drive them into bays and inlets; why do they equally abound in the North Sea and the Baltic, which are not frequented by whales? If mere want of food compels the herrings to detach their crowded colonies; how happens it that the migration always takes place at the same time, and at the same season of the year? It is difficult to conceive, that their stock of provisions should regularly be exhausted at the year's end? Besides, if the Arctic pole be the native country of the herrings, as has been usually supposed, they should make their appearance, like birds of passage, in numerous troops at certain seasons, and very few or none should be seen during the rest of the year. Yet it is well known, that great quantities of them are caught in Norway, during the whole of summer; in the same country, and in Swedish Pomerania, the fishery is very productive from January to March; on the coast of Gothland, from October to December; in the north of Holland, in February, March, and April; and in Sweden, in the middle of winter. That part of the migrating shoal regularly directs its course to the coast of Iceland, is an assertion unanswerable by respectable testimony. Horrebow, who passed some years on that island, affirms, that a single herring will sometimes not be seen for many years; and Olafsen, \u00c6gidius, Otho-Fabricius, and others, corroborate his assertions.\n\nTo account, then, for the movements of the herring, cod, tunny, anchovy, &c., it is in vain to have recourse to the capacity of the whale, or to the urgent pressure of hunger; and least of all should we adopt the marvellous tales of periodical voyages, performed with the utmost order and exactitude. M. Bloch explains in a much more simple and natural manner the arrival and disappearance of the respective shoals. According to him, herrings...\nherrings have the same propensity as other fishes, and usually live in the depths of the water, till stimulated by the desire of reproducing their species. They then quit their retreat, and suddenly appear in places where they were not formerly seen; and, as the spawning time occurs sometimes sooner, and sometimes later, according to the temperature of the water, and the age of the fishes, we can easily conceive why those species which are reputed migratory, should be observed at different times. Those sea fishes which ascend rivers in spring, only return to their several haunts in autumn. The herrings are, doubtless, guided by an analogous instinct; and if we may be allowed to suppose, that they sometimes spawn more than once in the course of the year, we shall be at no loss to account for the circumstances of their wandering.\n\n4. Nourishment.\n\nAmong fishes, as among quadrupeds and birds, some search for their food in the mud; others live on worms, insects, or marine plants. The former have their anterior extremity adapted to the extraction of peculiar juices from the earth; the latter have the conformation of their jaws or teeth suited to the capture and destruction of their appropriate prey. The greatest number of species, however, are carnivorous and extremely voracious, subsisting chiefly on other fishes, and frequently not sparing even their own offspring. When taken out of the water, and almost expiring, they will often greedily swallow the very bait which lured them to their ruin. In the sequel, we shall have occasion to adduce some striking instances of the violent and indiscriminate appetite of several fishes. The digestive power of their stomach is no less remarkable, and seems to increase with the quantity of food received into it. This food, though reduced to a gelatinous state, usually preserves its natural form; a circumstance which leads us to conclude, that the process of digestion is performed by the solvent power of some particular menstruum, and not by any trituration.\n\nFishes, in general, manifest a predilection for whatever they can swallow possessed of life. Some that have very small mouths, feed on worms and the spawn of other fish; others, whose mouths are larger, seek larger prey; it matters not of what kind, whether of another or their own. Those with the largest mouths, pursue almost every thing that has life; and often meet each other in fierce opposition, and the victor devours his antagonist. Thus are they irritated by the continual desire of satisfying their hunger; and the life of a fish, from the smallest to the greatest, is but one scene of hostility, violence, and evasion. The smaller fry, which stand no chance in the unequal combat, resort to those shallows, where the greater are unable or too heavy to pursue. There they become invaders in turn, and live on the spawn of large fishes, which they find floating on the surface of the water, till they are imprisoned and leisurely devoured by the mussel, oyster, or scallop, which lie in ambush at the bottom.\n\nNotwithstanding the astonishing voracity of fishes, some of them are capable of suffering at least the apparent want of food for a long time. This is particularly the case with the gold and silver fishes which are kept in vases, and which seem to enjoy perfect health, though deprived of sustenance for months. But they may probably feed on minute invisible insects, or be endowed with the power of decomposing water, and of converting its elements into the means of subsistence. Much, in fact, remains to be discovered on the interesting subject of the food of fishes; for while the incessant craving and gluttony of some are obvious to the most superficial observation, the methods by which others are maintained in existence have only been surmised by conjecture. Meanwhile, it is of importance to remark, that in the water, as on the land, nature has nicely adjusted the balance of destruction and renovation, thus providently guarding against an overwhelming accumulation of putrid carcases, and multiplying, at the same time, the sources and centres of vitality and animal enjoyment.\n\n5. Reproduction.\n\nIn most, if not in all fishes, there is a difference in sex, though Bloch and others make mention of individuals, which seemed to unite the two sexes, and to be real hermaphrodites. The number of males, it has been remarked, is about double that of females; and were it not for this wise provision of nature, a large proportion of the extruded eggs would remain unfecundated. A few species, indeed, as the eel, blenny, &c., are viviparous; but by far the greater number are produced from eggs. These last compose the roe or ovary, oviparous, of the females, which lie along the abdomen. The milt of the males is dispensed along the back-bone, in one or two bags, and consists of a whitish glandular substance, which secretes the spermatic fluid. Though the history of the generation of fishes be still involved in considerable obscurity, it seems to be ascertained, that no sexual union takes place among the oviparous kinds, and that the eggs are fructified after exclusion. They are of a spherical form, and consist of a yolk, a white part, and a bright crescent-like spot, or germ. The yolk, which is usually surrounded by the white, is round, and not placed in the middle, but towards one of the sides; and the clear spot, or embryo, is situated between the yolk and the white. In this spot there is observable, on the day after fecundation, a moveable point, of a somewhat dull appearance. On the third day, it assumes the appearance of a thickish mass, detached on one side, and on the other strongly adhering to the yolk, and presenting the contour of the heart, which, at this period, receives an increase of motion, while the disengaged extremity, which forms the rudiments of the tail, is perceived to move at intervals. On the fourth day, the pulsations of the heart and the movements of the whole body occur in quicker succession. On the fifth, the circulation of the humours in the vessels may be discerned, when the fish is in a particular position. On the sixth, the back-bone may be distinctly recognized. On the seventh, two black points, which are the eyes, and the whole form of the animal, are visible to the naked eye. Although the yolk gradually diminishes as the embryo enlarges, the included animal cannot yet stretch itself at length, and makes a curve with its tail. Its motions are then so brisk, that when it turns its body, the yolk turns with it; and these motions become more and more frequent, as the moment of birth, which happens between the seventh and ninth day, approaches. By repeated strokes of the tail, the covering of the egg at length...\nPhysiology length gives way, and the fish comes forth, first by the tail, redoubling its efforts, till it detach its head; and then it moves nimbly, and at liberty, in its new element. Such, at least, are the results of some particular observations; but it is obvious, that they must vary considerably according to circumstances; particularly, that the spawn must continue in the egg state in some species longer than in others, and this in proportion to the animal's size. The embryo salmon, for instance, continues in the egg from the beginning of December to the beginning of April, and the carp not above three weeks.\n\nFishes have different seasons for depositing their spawn. Some which live in the depths of the ocean, are said to choose the winter months; but, in general, those with which we are acquainted, choose the hottest months in summer, and prefer such water as is somewhat tepidified by the beams of the sun. They then leave the deepest parts of the ocean, which are the coldest, and shoal round the coasts, or swim up the fresh-water rivers, which are warm as they are comparatively shallow, depositing their eggs where the sun's influence can most easily reach them, and seeming to take no farther charge of their future progeny.\n\nOf the eggs thus deposited scarcely one in a hundred brings forth an animal, as they are devoured by all the lesser fry which frequent the shores, by aquatic birds near the margin, and by the larger fish in deep water. Still, however, the sea is amply supplied with inhabitants; and, notwithstanding their own capacity, and that of various tribes of fowls, the numbers that escape are sufficient to relieve the wants of a considerable portion of mankind. Indeed, when we consider the fecundity of a single fish, the amount will seem astonishing. If we should be told, for example, that a single being could in one season, produce as many of its kind as there are inhabitants in England, it would strike us with surprize; yet the cod annually spawns, according to Lewenhoeck, above nine million of eggs contained in a single roe. The flounder is commonly known to produce above one million; and the mackerel above five hundred thousand; a herring of a moderate size will yield at least ten thousand; a carp, of 14 inches in length, contained, according to Petit, two hundred and sixty-two thousand, two hundred and twenty-four; and another, 16 inches long, contained three hundred and forty-two thousand, one hundred and forty-four; a perch deposited three hundred and eighty thousand, six hundred and forty; and a female sturgeon, seven million, six hundred and fifty-three thousand, two hundred.\u2014The viviparous species are by no means so fruitful; yet the blemmy brings forth two or three hundred at a time, all alive and playing round the parent together.\n\nSome naturalists have suspected, that there are fishes which undergo certain metamorphoses in the early period of their existence, like the tadpoles of frogs. Mademoiselle Merian, in her splendid work on the Insects of Surinam, even describes frogs, which are transformed into fishes. Spelmann makes mention of aquatic animals of an ambiguous nature, which he met with at all seasons of the year, and which he terms proteyes; and Schranck and Laurenti have remarked in the Tyrolian lakes particular races of animals, which seem to form a gradation between tadpoles and branchioleotegous fishes. Perhaps they are larvae, or imperfect animals, whose development is still obscure; yet it is not improbable that some fishes may undergo transformations analogous to those of young frogs and salamanders. The history of the gilracion and diodon families will warrant such a supposition; and the sirex lacertina of Linnaeus seems to be alike connected with reptiles and fishes.\n\nFor several curious and interesting experiments relative to the artificial fecundation of the spawn of fishes, we must refer our readers to M. Jacob's Memoir, inserted in the Berlin Transactions for 1764. By pressing the contents of the milt of salmon and trout on the spawn of these fishes, he succeeded in rendering the ova fruitful, and obtained live fish. Among these were several monsters, such as trouts with two heads, others in the form of a cross, &c., none of which lived beyond six weeks, exhausting in that time the juices of their own stomach, and the yolk of the egg to which they were attached.\n\n6. Duration.\n\nIt is extremely difficult to ascertain the precise term which nature has assigned to the existence of those creatures which inhabit a medium different from our own. It is probable, that the life of fishes which escape the numerous snares that are laid for them, is considerably longer than their mere size would seem to indicate. In the first stages of their existence, their growth is, no doubt, rapid; but their fibres quickly become hard, and less susceptible of extension. When newly excluded from its egg, the fish grows four lines in the short space of eight hours; but three weeks at least elapse, before it acquire an additional line. Nor is the rate of growth at all equal in different species. Thus a carp attains only to the length of six or seven inches in three years, and to the weight of twelve pounds in ten years. The growth of the tench is still more tardy, since twelve years are required to give it the length of twenty inches.\n\nThere have been two methods devised for determining the age of fishes, the one, by the circles of the scales, the other, by the transverse section of the backbone. When a fish's scale is examined through a microscope, it will be found to consist of a number of circles, one within another, in some measure resembling those which appear on the transverse section of a tree, and which are supposed to afford the same information. For, as in trees, we can tell their age by the number of their circles, so in fishes, we can tell theirs by the number of circles in every scale, reckoning one ring for every year of the animal's existence. By this method, the count de Buffon found a carp, whose scales he examined, to be not less than a hundred years old. Gellner adduces an instance of one of the same age, and Albertus of one more than double that period.\u2014The age of the skate and the ray, which are deliquescent of scales, may be known by the other method, which consists in separating the joints of the back-bone, and then minutely observing the number of rings which the surface where it was joined exhibits. But whatever degree of precision we may attach to such evidence, we have no reason to doubt the great age of some fishes. Those persons who have ponds often know the oldest by their superior size, and other indications. The carp which were...\nCHAP. IV. SYSTEMATIC EXPOSITION OF FISHES.\n\nTHE Linnaean orders of fishes have been instituted from the situation, presence, or absence of the ventral fins.\n\n1. Such as are entirely destitute of these fins, are termed pisces apod\u00e6, apod\u00e6, or footless fishes.\n\n2. The jugularis, or jugularis, are those which have ventral fins placed more forward than the pectoral fins, or under the throat.\n\n3. The thoracici, or thoracic, include those whose ventral fins are placed immediately under the pectoral fins, or on the breast.\n\n4. The abdominales, or abdominalis, comprise those whose ventral fins are situated behind the pectoral fins, or on the abdomen.\n\n5. There still remains a particular tribe, denominated cartilagin\u00e6, which, as their name imports, have a cartilaginous instead of a bony skeleton. This tribe was by Linnaeus separated from the rest, on the mistaken idea, that the individuals which compose it were furnished both with lungs and gills, and should be ranked in the class of amphibious animals.\n\nThe genera which pertain to the preceding orders are determined by the number of rays in the branchiofugalous membrane, the condition of the teeth, the figure of the body, and of other remarkable parts.\n\nThe characters of the species are taken chiefly from the number of rays in the fins, which differs in the different species. But, as the precise enumeration of these rays is sometimes a matter of difficulty, and, as they are likewise subject to variation, it is necessary to have recourse to other marks, and, to adopt, as subsidiary characters, the form and situation of particular fins, the proportion of the head to the body, the condition of the lateral line, the number of the vertebre and ribs, &c.\n\nI. APODAL.\n\nThe fishes of this order approach very near to the amphibia, and some of them even resemble the serpent tribe. They have a smooth slippery skin, which is, in general, naked, or covered in some species only, with small, soft, and dilatant scales. Their body is long and slender; they have teeth in the jaws, and live in the sea; but some are found in rivers and standing waters. They feed on other animals.\n\nGenus I. Mur\u00e6na.\n\nHead smooth; nostrils tubular; eyes covered by the common integument; gill membrane ten-rayed; body nearly cylindrical, smooth, and slippery; dorsal, caudal, and anal fins united; spiracles behind the head or pectoral fins.\n\nRoman mur\u00e6na, or murey. No pectoral fins; body helena, eel-shaped, and variegated; spiracle on each side the neck.\u2014The colour of this fish is a dusky-greenish brown, diversified with dull yellow patches, and forming a kind of obscure net-work. The head is rather small; the mouth moderately wide, and the teeth sharp. The fins are of a dusky colour, with whitish spots. The murey is capable of living with equal facility in fresh or salt water, though principally found in the latter, especially on the coasts of the Mediterranean. It attains to a size at least equal, if not superior to the common eel, which it much resembles in its manners and voracity. The Romans prized it as an exquisite luxury, and kept it in appropriate reservoirs.\n\nSnake eel, or sea serpent. Snout lengthened; tail ophiusa pointed, and finless; body round. The head of this species is long and slender, the gape very wide, the teeth very sharp, and the colour a very pale yellow with brown above, and bluish white beneath. It is a native of the Mediterranean and northern seas, where it often arrives at a very considerable size, and has probably given rise to the marvellous tales of huge sea serpents in the northern ocean.\u2014The anguilla ophiusa, or spotted eel of Shaw, seems to be a distinct species, or else a marked variety, being spotted with brown, and chiefly found in the Indian seas, though sometimes also in the Mediterranean, &c.\n\nCommon eel.\u2014The lower jaw longer than the upper anguilla.\nper; body olive-brown above, somewhat silvery beneath. The figure and appearance of this species are too well known to require a particular description. It is a native of almost all the waters of the ancient continent, frequenting not only rivers but stagnant pools, and occasionally salt marshes and lakes. In spring it is found even in the Baltic and other seas. In some places near the mouths of the Baltic, they are taken in such abundance that they cannot be used fresh, but are smoked and salted, and conveyed by waggon-loads into Saxony, Silesia, &c. We are told that 2000 have been taken in Jutland at a single sweep of the net, and 60,000 in the Garonne in one day, by a single net. It is generally alleged that the eel cannot bear the water of the Danube; and it is rarely found either in that river or the Wolga, though very common in the lakes and rivers of Upper Austria. Its ordinary size is from two to three feet, though it has been known to attain to the length of six feet, and to weigh fifteen pounds. Dale and others mention some of uncommon magnitude, but which were probably congers. Though impatient of heat and cold, the eel can live longer out of the water than any other fish, and is extremely tenacious of life, as its parts will move a considerable time after it has been skinned, and cut into pieces. It sometimes quits the water, and wanders about meadows and moist grounds in quest of particular food, as snails, worms, &c. It is also said to be fond of new-sown peas, and to have sometimes taken refuge from severe frosts in adjoining hay-ricks. Its usual food consists of water-insects, worms, and the spawn of fishes. It will also devour almost any decayed animal substance. It is viviparous, producing its young about the end of summer; though both eggs, and ready-formed young are occasionally observed in the same individual. Its skin, which is proverbially slippery, from the large proportion of mucus with which it is furnished, serves, in some countries, from its toughness and pellucidity, as tackle for carriages, &c., and glaas for windows. Though we learn from Athenaeus, that the Sybarites exempted from every kind of tribute the vendors of eels, the Romans seem to have held this fish very cheap as an article of food. In modern times it is reckoned highly nutritious, though somewhat difficult of digestion, and hurtful when taken to excess.\n\nConger eel.\u2014Two tentacula at the rostrum, the lateral line whitish and dotted. The first of these characters is not constant. But the conger may be distinguished from the common eel by other marks, such as its darker colour, larger eyes, its shorter lower jaw, and the greater size to which it usually attains. Specimens from the Mediterranean have sometimes been taken of the length of ten feet, and of the weight of more than a hundred pounds. It is likewise an inhabitant of the northern seas, and of those which surround some of the American islands. The conger is only an occasional migrant of fresh water, frequenting the mouths of rivers in spring. In the mouth of the Severn incredible quantities of the fry are taken in April, under the name of elvers. In its full-grown state the conger is also reckoned a useful article of food in many parts of Europe. The great quantities that are taken on the coast of Cornwall are chiefly exported to Spain and Portugal. Much of their abundant oil is drained away in the process of drying, the weight being reduced nearly eighty per cent. Congers are extremely voracious, preying on other fishes, and on various kinds of crustacea, particularly on the small crabs during their soft state after they have cast their shell.\n\nSouthern murana.\u2014No pectoral fins; brown, with echidna black variegations; depressed head and very turgid neck. This species, which inhabits the southern ocean, has a repulsive appearance, grows to a very considerable size, and affords excellent food.\n\nThe firen.\u2014Pectoral fins like hands with four fingers, gill membrane with three pinnatifid bones. This is the firen lacertina of former editions of the System of Nature. It is peculiar to the muddy swamps of South Carolina, preys on serpents, which it seizes and holds with its strong and firm teeth. It is sometimes a foot and a half in length; its heart has but one ventricle; it has ribs and a bony tail; and is so fragile, that if cast on the ground it breaks into three or four pieces.\n\nThe other species are, colubrina, serpens, myrus, guttata, ceca, catenata, reticulata, africana, zebra, melagratis, and viridis.\n\nGen. 2. Synbranchus.\n\nBody eel-shaped; no pectoral fins; spiracle single beneath the neck.\n\nMarbled synbranchus.\u2014Olive-brown, marbled with blackish spots; the body yellow beneath. Native of the fresh waters of Surinam.\n\nPlain synbranchus.\u2014Of a plain unvariegated brown colour. A native of Surinam.\n\nGen. 3. Monopterus.\n\nBody eel-shaped; nostrils placed between the eyes; fin cadal.\n\nJavan monopterus.\u2014Livid brown or blackish, with javanicus, a very sharp-pointed tail. This fish, which has the appearance and habits of a murana, is a native of the Indian seas, and very common about the coasts of Java, where it is considered as an excellent food.\n\nGen. 4. Gymnotus.\n\nHead with lateral opercula; two beards or tentacula on the upper lip; eyes covered by the common integument; gill membrane five-rayed; body compressed, without dorsal fin (in most species), but carinated by a fin beneath.\n\nCarapo gymnotus.\u2014Brown, with the vent-fin of the carapo; length of the attenuated tail, and the upper jaw longer than the lower. This fish is a native of the American seas, and is said to be most frequent about the coast of Surinam. Its ordinary length is from one to two feet. It is reckoned excellent by the South Americans.\n\nElectrical gymnotus, or cramp-fish.\u2014Without scales electricus, or dorsal fin; the caudal very obtuse, and joined to the anal fin. This fish bears a considerable resemblance to a large eel, though somewhat thicker, and commonly of an uniform blackish-brown. It was first announced to the philosophers of Europe on account of its remarkable electrical or galvanic properties, in 1677, by M. Richer, who was commissioned by the French Academy to make some mathematical observations in Cayenne.\nIt would be tedious to recite all the remarks and experiments of succeeding observers, which con\ufb01rme to prove the voluntary electricity of the gymnus, which, however, occasionally exhibits some variations from the phenomena of common electricity. If a person touches the animal with one hand, in such a manner as to irritate it considerably, while the other is held at a small distance from it in the water, he will experience as strong a shock as from a charged Leyden phial. The shock is also readily communicated through a circle of eight or ten persons at once, the person at one extremity putting his hand in the water near the fish, while the other touches the animal. It is by this extraordinary faculty that the gymnus supports its existence, the smaller fishes and other animals which happen to approach it being instantly stupe\ufb01ed, and then falling an easy prey. It is even capable of depriving those who approach it in its native waters, of sense and motion. It is a native of the warmer regions of Africa and America, in which last it inhabits the larger rivers, particularly those of Surinam. In Africa, it is said to occur chiefily in the branches of the Senegal. In the 6th volume of the Philosophical Transactions, our readers will \ufb01nd an accurate description of the external form of the electrical gymnus, by the late ingenious Dr Garden, and one equally accurate of its internal structure by the celebrated Mr John Hunter.\n\nNeedle gymnus. Naked, with \ufb01nless tail and belly, the anal \ufb01n of sixty rays, terminating before it reaches the tip of the tail. The only European species yet discovered, being a native of the Mediterranean, and described by Brunnich in his history of the \ufb01sh of Marseille.\n\nTo the same genus belong fasciatus, albus, albifrons, rostratus, notopterus, and afaticus.\n\nGen. 5. Trichurus.\n\nHead stretched forwards, with lateral gill covers; teeth ensiform, semi-sagittated at the points, the fore teeth the largest; gill-membrane seven-rayed; body compressed and ensiform, with a fulbate and \ufb01nless tail.\n\nSilvery trichurus, or gymnogaster.\u2014The lower jaw longer than the upper. This \ufb01sh is distinguished by the singularity of its shape, and the silver brilliancy of its colour. It is from two to three feet long, very voracious, and a rapid swimmer. In the pursuit of its prey, it sometimes leaps into small vessels which happen to be passing by. It frequents the rivers and larger lakes of South America, and is also said to occur in some parts of India and China.\n\nIndian or electrical trichurus.\u2014Jaws of equal length. Inhabits the Indian seas, and is said to possess a degree of electrical power.\n\nGen. 6. Anarchichas.\n\nHead somewhat obtuse; fore teeth both above and below, conical, diverging, strong; six or more grinders in the under jaw, and palate rounded; gill-membrane six-rayed, body roundish, caudal \ufb01n distinct.\n\nWolf \ufb01sh, sea wolf, or ravenous wolf \ufb01sh.\u2014Of a blackish gray colour, the sides, anal and caudal \ufb01ns, and abdomen lighter. This is one of the few \ufb01shes which have four teeth and grinders. Of three specimens examined by Dr Black, one had six rows of grinders in the upper jaw, and as many in the lower; another had six rows above, and four below; and a third had five above, and three below. The disposition and structure of all the teeth are excellently adapted for breaking and comminuting the crabs, lobsters, scallops, large whelks, &c., which this voracious animal grinds to pieces, and swallows with the shells. When caught, it falls on anything within its reach. Schonfeld relates, that it will seize on an anchor and leave the marks of its teeth behind; and we are informed by Steller, that one which he saw taken on the coast of Kamchatka, seized with great violence a cutlass with which it was attempted to be killed, and broke it in pieces as if it had been made of glass. The fishermen, dreading its bite, endeavour as soon as possible to beat out its fore teeth, and then kill it by striking it on the head. Its \ufb02at and grinding teeth are often found in a fossil state, and known by the name of bufonites, or toad-stones, to which many superstitious virtues were formerly ascribed. The sea wolf grows to a very considerable size, being frequently four, and sometimes even seven feet in length. It has small scales and a lateral line, though described by most naturalists as de\ufb01cient of both. It commonly frequents the deep parts of the sea, in the northern regions of the globe, and some parts of the British coasts, approaching the shores in spring, to deposit its spawn among the marine plants. It swims slowly, and with the serpentine motion of the eel. Owing to its forbidding appearance, it is not generally brought to market; but the fishermen, the Greenlanders, and the Scotch \ufb01nd it excellent food. The latter call it the sea cat, and take off the head and skin before dressing it. The frigulus is now generally admitted to be only a variety of the preceding.\n\nSmaller wolf \ufb01sh.\u2014With very sharp cartilaginous minor teeth. Inhabits the coast of Greenland.\n\nPanther wolf \ufb01sh.\u2014Yellow, or fulvous, spotted with panther-brown. In other particulars it agrees with the common species. Native of the northern seas.\n\nGen. 7. Odontognathus.\n\nMouth furnished with a strong moveable lamina or thus, process on each side of the upper jaw; gill-membrane \ufb01ve-rayed.\n\nAculeated odontognathus.\u2014Abdomen aculeated. Native of the American seas, and common about the coasts of Cayenne, where it ranks among the edible \ufb01shes.\n\nGen. 8. Triurus.\n\nSnout cylindrical; one tooth in each jaw; dorsal and anal \ufb01n extended beyond the tail.\n\nCommeronian triple-tail.\u2014The branchial orifice closed at pleasure by a valve. In general appearance and size it resembles a herring. It is distinguished from the whole class of \ufb01shes by the circumstance noted in the speci\ufb01c character. Native of the Indian seas.\n\nGen. 9. Ammodytes.\n\nHead compressed, narrower than the body; upper lip doubled, the lower jaw narrow, and pointed; teeth small.\nsmall and sharp; gill-membrane seven-rayed; body long, roundish, with very small scales; tail distinct.\n\nSand lancee, or sand eel.\u2014The lower jaw longer than the upper. A native of the northern parts of Europe, commonly frequenting the coasts, and lying imbedded in the sand, in the summer months, at the depth of half a foot, or a foot, with its body rolled into a spiral form. In this situation it is taken at the receds of the tide, either for bait, by the fishermen, or as an article of food, being regarded as a delicacy. It lives on worms and small fishes, not even excepting its own species; and it itself preyed on by the porpoise, and larger fishes, particularly by the mackerel. Most of the older ichthyologists have erroneously represented it as destitute of scales, and Klein has improperly divided it into two species.\n\nGen. 10. Ophidium.\n\nHead somewhat naked; teeth in the jaws, palate, and fauces; gill-membrane seven-rayed, patulous; body sword-shaped.\n\nBarbatum. Bearded ophidium.\u2014Four cirri on the lower jaw. This species, which is frequent in the Mediterranean and Red seas, grows to ten or twelve inches long, is of a silvery hue, with a shade of pink, and marked with irregular linear spots; its skin is covered with soft oblong scales, adhering at their anterior edge. According to Belon, the Romans prized its flesh, which is white, but rather coarse.\n\nBeardless ophidium.\u2014Jaws beardless; tail rather obtuse; in other respects, much allied to the former. Inhabits the Mediterranean, and has also been taken near Weymouth.\n\nViride, aculeatum, and mastacembalus, the other species, are but imperfectly known.\n\nGen. 11. Stromateus.\n\nHead compressed; teeth in the jaws and palate; body oval, broad, and slippery; tail bifid.\n\nFiatola. Striped stromateus.\u2014Marked with transverse undulated bands. This species, which is beautifully variegated, inhabits the Mediterranean and Red sea, and is known to the modern Romans by its specific appellation.\n\nParu. Paru stromateus.\u2014Gold-coloured back, and silvery abdomen. General size, that of a turbot. Much esteemed as a food. Native of South America and Tranquebar. The cumaren of Gmelin's Linnaeus seems to be only a variety of this.\n\nCinerous. Ash-coloured stromateus.\u2014Tail forked, the lower lobe longer than the upper. Native of the Indian seas, and served at table, as a dainty, under the name of pamper.\n\nArgenteus. Silver stromateus.\u2014With the lobes of the tail equal. Nearly allied to the preceding, a native of the same seas, and equally esteemed as an article of food.\n\nViger. Black stromateus.\u2014Entirely of a blackish colour. This also frequents the Indian seas; but is seldom prepared for the table, on account of its colour and the circumstance of its feeding on wood-lice, which are sometimes found in its mouth.\n\nGen. 12. Xiphias.\n\nHead with the upper jaw terminating in a sword-shaped Xiphias; mouth without teeth; gill-membrane eight-rayed; body roundish, and scaleless.\n\nCommon or Sicilian sword-fish.\u2014The dorsal fin at gladius, attenuated at the hind part. The body of the sword-fish is long, round, and gradually tapers towards the tail; the head is flattish, and the mouth wide, both jaws terminating in a point, but the upper stretched to a great distance beyond the lower, forming what is commonly called the sword, by which it pierces and kills the smaller kinds of fishes. It sometimes measures twenty feet in length, and is of an active and ravenous disposition. The method of taking it, described by Strabo, exactly agrees with the modern practice. A man ascends one of the cliffs that overhang the sea, and as soon as he spies the fish, gives notice by voice or signal of the course it takes. Another person in a boat climbs up the mast, and on seeing the fish, directs the rowers to it. The moment that he thinks they have got within reach, he descends and taking his spear in his hand, strikes into the fish, which, after wearying itself with its agitations, is seized and dragged into the boat. Its flesh is much esteemed by the Sicilians, who cut it in pieces and salt it. The pieces from the belly and tail are most esteemed, and the salted fins are sold under the name of callo. The sword-fish is frequently found in the Mediterranean, especially on the coasts of Sicily, where the male and female usually appear in pairs. It also occasionally occurs in the northern seas, and sometimes in the Pacific ocean; but \u00c6lian erroneously affirms that it is at the same time a fresh water fish, and an inhabitant of the Danube.\n\nBroad-finned sword-fish.\u2014Distinguished from the pre-platypterus by a very broad back fin, and very long sharp-pointed thoracic appendages. Found not only in the Brazilian and East Indian seas, but also in the Northern ocean. It is said to have frequent combats with whales. The bottom of an East Indiaman was pierced by a fish of this species, in such a manner, that the sword was driven through almost to its base, and the animal killed by the violence of the effort. The wood, together with the sword imbedded in it, is now in the British Museum. When this species does not exceed four feet, it is considered as an eatable fish; but it is found of the length of twenty feet, and sometimes even much longer.\n\nShort-snouted sword-fish.\u2014Blackfish; with snout of makaira. Middling length, and two bony tubercles on each side of the tail. Resembles the common sword-fish, except that the snout is much shorter and thicker.\n\nGen. 13. Sternoptyx.\n\nHead obtuse; mouth turning up; teeth very small; no gill-membrane; body compressed, without visible scales; breast carinated, and folded both ways; abdomen pellucid.\n\nTransparent sternoptyx.\u2014Silvery; with carinated diaphana; breast, and pellucid abdomen; two or three inches long, broad, and compressed, the back rising into a sharp edge, and the abdomen terminating in a carina. Native of the American seas.\n\nGen. 14.\nGen. 14. Leptocephalus.\n\nHead narrow; body very thin, and compressed; no pectoral fins.\n\nMorris launce, or Anglesea morris.\u2014First discovered on the coast of Anglesea by Mr Morris, and described by Pennant under his name. Four inches in length; the head very small; the body extremely thin, and almost transparent.\n\nGen. 15. Stylephorus.\n\nEyes pedunculated, standing on a short thick cylinder; snout lengthened, directed upwards, retractile towards the head by means of a membrane; mouth without teeth; gills three pair beneath the throat; pectoral fins small; dorsal, the length of the back; caudal, short, with finny rays; body very long, compressed.\n\nChordatus. Chordated stylephorus.\u2014Silvery; with an extremely long caudal thread. We shall here transcribe Dr Shaw's description of this very extraordinary species.\n\n\"The rostrum or narrow part which is terminated by the mouth, is connected to the back part of the head by a flexible leathery duplicature, which permits it to be either extended in such a manner that the mouth points directly upwards, or to fall back, so as to be received into a sort of cleft formed by the upper part of the head. On the top of the head are placed the eyes, which are of a form very nearly approaching to those of the genus cancer, except that the columns or parts on which each eye is placed, are much broader or thicker than in that genus; they are also placed close to each other, and the outward surface of the eyes when magnified, does not show the least appearance of a reticulated structure. The colour of the eyes, as well as of the columns on which they stand, is a clear chestnut brown, with a sort of coppery gloo. Below the head, on each side, is a considerable compressed semicircular space, the fore part of which is bounded by the covering of the gills, which covering seems to consist of a single membrane, of a moderately strong nature. Beneath this, on each side, are three small pair of branchiae. The body is extremely long, and compressed very much, and gradually diminishes as it approaches the tail, which terminates in a string or process of an enormous length, and finishes in a very fine point. This string, or caudal process, seems to be strengthened throughout its whole length, or at least as far as the eye can trace it, by a sort of double fibre or internal part. The pectoral fins are very small, and situated almost immediately behind the cavity on each side the thorax. The dorsal fin, which is of a thin and soft nature, runs from the head to within about an inch of the tail, when it seems suddenly to terminate, and a bare space is left of about a quarter of an inch. I am, however, not altogether without my doubts whether it might not, in the living animal, have run on quite to the tail, and whether the specimen might not have received some injury in that part. From this place commences a smaller fin which constitutes part of the caudal one. The caudal fin itself is furnished with five remarkable spines, the roots or originations of which may be traced to some depth in the thin part of the tail.\"\n\nThe general colour of this fish is a rich silver, except on the flexible part belonging to the rostrum, which is of a deep brown; the fins and caudal process are also brown, but not so deep as the part just mentioned. There is no appearance of scales on this fish. From the very singular figure and situation of the eyes, I have given it the generic name of stylephorus, and as the trivial name cannot be taken from any circumstance more properly than from the extraordinary thread-like process of the tail, I have applied to it the title of chordatus. It is a native of the West Indian seas, and was taken between Cuba and Martinico, near a small cluster of little islands about nine leagues from thence, where it was observed near the surface. The whole length of this uncommon animal, from the head to the extremity of the caudal process, is about 32 inches, of which the process itself measures 22.\"\n\nII. Jugular.\n\nThe fishes of this order have their ventral fins situated before the pectoral fins, and, as it were, under the throat. They are mostly inhabitants of the sea. Their body is sometimes covered with scales, and sometimes not. With a very few exceptions, they have spines in the dorsal and anal fins; and their gills have bony rays.\n\nGen. 1. Callionymus.\n\nThe upper lip doubled; eyes near each other; the gill-membrane six-rayed; two breathing apertures in the hind part of the head; opercula close; body scaleless; ventral fins very distant.\n\nGemmous dragoon.\u2014The first ray of the first dorsal lyra, fin as long as the body. In this beautiful species, the pupils of the eyes are of a rich sapphire, the irides of a fine flame colour; the pectoral fins light brown, and the body yellow, blue, and white. \"The blue,\" says Mr Pennant, \"is of an inexpressible splendour; the richest cerulean, glowing with a gemmeous brilliancy; the throat black.\" Dr Tyton has described it, in the 24th volume of the Philosophical Transactions, under the improper appellation of the yellow gurnard. It grows to the length of 10 or 12 inches; the body is slender, round, and smooth; and the membranes of all the fins extremely thin and delicate. It is found as far north as Norway and Spitzbergen, and as far south as the Mediterranean, and is not unfrequent on the Scarborough coasts, where it is taken by the hook, in 30 or 40 fathoms water. It is often found in the stomach of the cod fish. Its flesh is white, and well flavoured. Rondelet compares it to that of the gudgeon. Pontoppidan, who never saw it, affirms, with his usual credulity, that it can fly in the air to the distance of several mackerel shot.\n\nSordid dragonet.\u2014The rays of the first dorsal fin dracunculus shorter than the body. In most other respects, it agrees with the preceding.\n\nThis genus likewise comprises indicus, baikalenius, aculeatus, sagitta, and japonicus.\n\nGen. 2. Uranoscopus.\n\nHead depressed; rough and large, mouth turned up; the upper jaw shortest; gill-membrane papillary and dentated;\ndentated; with five rays, gill-covers membranaceous and ciliated; anus in the middle of the body.\n\nBearded star-gazer.\u2014Back smooth; usual length about 12 inches. The head is large, squareish, and covered with a bony case. The mouth is wide, and opens in an almost vertical direction. The eyes are situated very near each other on the top of the head. A long cirrhus, or beard extends beyond the lips, which are themselves edged with smaller ones; frequenting shallows near the shores; it lies concealed in the mud, exposing only the tip of the head, and waving its beards in various directions, thus decoying the smaller fishes and marine insects, which mistake these organs for worms. It is said to sleep during the day. Is found chiefly in the Mediterranean. Its flesh is white, but tough, coarse, and meagre.\n\nJapanese star-gazer.\u2014Back rough, with a series of spinous scales. Body roundish; yellow above; white underneath. Native of the coasts of Amboyna.\n\nTrachinus.\n\nGen. 3. Trachinus.\n\nHead slightly rough, compressed; gill-membrane fixed; inferior plate of the gill-covers serrated; vent near the breast.\n\nDragon weever. Somewhat silvery hue, with transverse yellowish streaks; the first dorsal fin black, and five-rayed; of a lengthened shape, much compressed, and covered with small deciduous scales. The mouth and eyes, in respect of position, resemble those of the star-gazer. The usual length of this fish is from 10 to 12 inches. It frequently imbeds itself in the sand, and if trodden on, endeavours to wound the aggressor with the spines of its first dorsal fin. The punctures are very troublesome and painful, though it does not appear that the spines contain any poisonous matter. It feeds principally on marine insects, worms, and small fishes, and is very tenacious of life, being capable of existing many hours out of the water. From this circumstance the French call it vive et vivier, which we have corrupted into weever. It frequents not only the Mediterranean, but the northern seas, and is found abundantly on the coasts of Holland and East Frieseland. Its flesh is well flavoured, easy of digestion, and highly esteemed by the Dutch. The greater weever, described by Pennant, hardly deserves to be considered as a distinct species.\n\nOfbeckian weever. White, spotted with black; both jaws of equal length. Native of the Atlantic; found about the isle of Ascension, &c., and described by Ofbeck in his voyage to China.\n\nGadus.\n\n4. Gadus.\n\nHead smooth; gill-membrane with seven round rays; body oblong, with deciduous scales; fins covered with a common skin; more dorsal and anal fins than one; the rays not prickly; the pectoral fins attenuated to a point.\n\n* With three dorsal fins, cirrhi at the mouth.\n\nHaddock. Whitish; the tail bilobated, the upper jaw the longest. Another distinguishing character may be deduced from the large black spot on each side above the pectoral fins. Superstition affixes this mark to the impression which St Peter left with his finger and thumb, when he took the tribute out of the mouth of a fish of this species, and which has been continued to the whole race. The haddock is usually of a moderate size, measuring about 18 inches or two feet in length, and the best for the table weighing from two to four pounds. It is found in the northern seas in prodigious shoals, visiting particular coasts at stated seasons, and for the most part attended by immense quantities of dog-fish, which, with seals, and other inhabitants of the ocean, are its constant devourers. Its food consists of small fishes, worms, crabs, and sea insects, and it fattens on herrings. In January, it deposits its spawn on the fucii near the shore, and is out of season till May. Its flesh is white, firm, delicate, and easy of digestion.\n\nDove. Varied, with an even tail, and upper jaw longer. Somewhat smaller than the haddock, seldom exceeding the weight of two pounds. Its colour is subject to vary with age and seasons. It inhabits the northern seas, the Baltic, and the Mediterranean. Otto Fabricius found in its stomach the sea-scorpion, sand-eel, crabs, and different species of sea-worms. It spawns in January and February, is taken both by the line and net, and is reckoned delicate eating.\n\nCommon cod.\u2014Tail nearly equal, the first ray of the anal fin armed with a spine. This well-known and important species, which yields food and wealth to large districts of country, is found in immense shoals. It measures from two to three feet long, is of a cinereous colour, with yellowish spots above and white below, and has larger scales than the other species of this genus. The young are sometimes reddish, with orange-coloured spots. It feeds on lepide, crabs, and fishes, not even sparing its own species, catching at any small body it perceives moved by the water, and throwing up what it does not digest. Its range of climate lies principally between the latitudes 50\u00b0 and 66\u00b0. The great rendezvous of cod is on the banks of Newfoundland, and the other sand-banks that lie off the coasts of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, and New England. This fish likewise abounds off the Hebrides, Ireland, the coast of Holland, &c., and is generally fat and most numerous where the greatest sea runs. In our seas they begin to spawn in January; though some continue in roe till the beginning of April. As they recover sooner after spawning than most other fish, it is customary to take some good ones all the summer. When out of season they are thin-tailed and lousy; and the lice chiefly fix themselves on the inside of their mouths. Those most esteemed for the table are of a middling size, and are chosen by their plumpness and roundness, especially near the tail, by the depth of the furrow behind the head, and by the regular undulated appearance of the sides, as if they were ribbed. The glutinous parts about the head lose their delicate flavour after it has been four-and-twenty hours out of the water. The fish itself dies on being removed from salt-water, or put into fresh. The fishermen are well acquainted with the use of the air-bladder, and dexterously perforate the living fish with a needle, in order to let out the air; for without this operation the fish could not be kept under water in the well-boats, and brought fresh to market. The fowds, when salted, are reckoned a delicacy,\ndelicacy, and are often brought in this state from Newfoundland. The Icelanders prepare from this part of the fish a species of ilinglais. Pennant makes mention of a cod taken at Scarborough in 1755, which was five feet eight inches in length, and weighed 78 pounds. But the general weight of these fish in the Yorkshire seas is from 14 to 42 pounds.\n\nBil.\u2014The first ray of the ventral fin fleshy; about a foot long; body deep, and sides compressed; eyes covered with a loose membrane, so as to be blown up at the pleasure of the animal. The mouth is small, and under the chin is a cirrhus about an inch long. Native of the European seas, and prized as an article of food.\n\nbarbatus. Whiting pout.\u2014Seven punctures on each side of the lower jaw. Much deeper in proportion to its length than any of the genus, rarely exceeding a foot in length; and one of that size being nearly four inches in the broadest part. Inhabits the Mediterranean and northern seas; burrows in the sand, and feeds on the blenny, salmon, and even young crabs. Its flesh is white and delicate, but somewhat dry.\n\nminutus. Poor.\u2014Vent in the middle of the body. Little more than six inches long; a small beard on the chin, and the eyes covered with a loose membrane. The abdomen is lined with a black peritoneum. The poor is supposed to feed chiefly on worms and insects, or on the young and soft testaceous animals. It occurs in the Baltic and Mediterranean, and in some parts of the northern seas. It is reckoned a wholesome food, but is not fit for being salted or dried.\n\nblennioides. Blennoid gadus.\u2014With didactyle ventral fins. Has the habit of a whiting, and frequents the Mediterranean.\n\nfaida. Saida gadus.\u2014Bluish, with brown back, white abdomen, and the second ray of the ventral fins terminating in a long bristle. Length about eight inches. Eatable, but dry and juiceless. A native of the White sea.\n\n** Three dorsal fins, and no cirri.**\n\nvirens. Green gadus.\u2014Greenish back and forked tail. Nearly resembles the pollack. Abounds in the northern seas.\n\nWhiting.\u2014White; the upper jaw longest. Usual length about ten or twelve inches, and the largest seldom exceeding twenty. Specimens from four to eight pounds in weight have been taken in the deep water at the edge of the Dogger bank. It is a fish of an elegant make; the body rather long, and covered with small round filvery scales; the head and back are of a pale brown, and the sides are slightly streaked with yellows. Though found in the Baltic, it is much more numerous in the north seas, and appears in shoals on the coasts of Holland, France, and England, during the spring, keeping at the distance of from half a mile to three miles from the shore. The whiting feeds on small crabs, worms, and young fishes, and is particularly fond of sprats and young herrings, with which the fishermen generally bait for it, and in default of them, with pieces of fresh herring. This species begins to spawn at the end of the year, and continues to the beginning of February. Its flesh is white, tender, and delicate; but insipid when the fish is out of season. The chief time of the whiting fishery in France is in January and February, though in England and Holland it is practised at a much later period.\n\nGadus fimbria.\u2014The under jaw longest, the lateral line straight. When full grown, this species will frequently measure two feet and a half in length, and four or five inches in breadth, and is distinguished from its congeners by its very dark or black colour, though the young are brown or olive. It is of an elegant tapering shape, with a pretty large and forked tail. It inhabits the Baltic, the northern, and Mediterranean seas, and swarms round our rocky and deep coasts, particularly those of Scotland and the Orkneys, affording by its fry, subsistence to numbers of the poor. In its full grown state it is coarse food.\n\nPollachius.\u2014The under jaw longest, the lateral line curved. This species is broad, and of a brown colour; feeds chiefly on small fishes, especially launces; and seldom grows to a very large size, though some have been taken at Scarborough which weighed nearly 28 pounds. It is found in the Baltic and northern sea, and is very common on many of our rocky coasts. During summer it is seen frolicking on the surface of the water, and will bite at any thing that appears on the top of the waves. It is reckoned a good eating fish.\n\n*** With two dorsal fins.***\n\nHake.\u2014Bearded; the under jaw longest. Con-merlucci considerably lengthened, measuring from one to two feet; the body pale all-colour on the back, and whitish on the sides and abdomen. This fish, which is very voracious, frequents the Mediterranean and northern seas. Its flesh is eatable and flaky, but little esteemed. It is salted and dried as food for the lower orders of people. One of the most considerable hake-fisheries is carried on about the coasts of Brittany, both by the hook and net. It is practised chiefly by night. The baits principally used are launces, sardines, and other small fishes.\n\nLing.\u2014Bearded; the upper jaw longest. Long and molva flender; the sides and back sometimes of an olive hue, and sometimes cinereous; abdomen and ventral fins white, and the tail marked near the end with a transverse black bar, and tipped with white. Its ordinary length is from three to four feet, but it will sometimes grow to seven. It is an inhabitant of the northern seas, chiefly frequenting deep water, living on small fishes, shrimps, &c.; and depositing its spawn in June, among the fuci in oozy bottoms. In the Yorkshire seas, it is in perfection from the beginning of February to the beginning of May, during which season the liver is very white, and abounds with a fine flavoured oil. In many places ling is salted both for exportation and home consumption. An excellent ilinglais is prepared from its spawn.\n\nLeverian gadus.\u2014Somewhat cinereous, with ocellated leverian-whitish spots. Supposed to be a native of the Southern ocean.\n\nWhitfish gadus.\u2014Bearded; ventral fins didactyle and albidus elongated. Inhabits the Mediterranean.\n\nToad gadus.\u2014Bearded; gill-covers with three spines; the first dorsal fin with three rays. Native of the American and Indian seas.\n\nBurbot.\u2014Bearded; the jaws of equal length. Body lota, much lengthened, somewhat cylindrical, of a brownish-yellow\nyellow colour, and white below; but the shades vary at different seasons, and in different individuals. It is a fresh-water fish, affecting clear lakes and rivers; feeding voraciously on all the smaller fishes, as well as on frogs, worms, and aquatic insects; spawning in the finest season of the year, and rapidly attaining to full growth. The largest which are taken in England rarely exceed the weight of three pounds; but in some parts of Europe they are found of more than double that weight, and of the length of three feet and more. They occur in great plenty and perfection in the lake of Geneva, and are by no means rare in many places in Europe, Siberia, and India. In England it frequents the lakes of the northern counties, some of the Lincolnshire fens, and the rivers Witham and Trent. Its flesh is white, delicate, and easy of digestion; and its liver, when in season, is reputed a peculiar dainty. Aldrovandus makes mention of an old German countess who expended the greatest part of her income in the purchase of this dish. According to Black the burbot fishery once proved so productive in the Oder, that the fattest were cut into narrow thongs, which were dried, and used as matches.\n\n**With one dorsal fin.**\n\n*Mediterranean gadus.*\u2014Two cirri on the upper lip, and one on the lower. Native of the Mediterranean. Confounded by La Cep\u00e8de as a blennius.\n\n*Torf,* or *ruffe.*\u2014Mouth bearded; tail oval and acute. About twenty inches in length; colour of the head dusky, of the back and sides yellow, of the belly white. Inhabits the northern seas, about the Shetland islands, and is not observed lower than the Orkneys. Both barrelled and dried, it forms a considerable article of commerce.\n\n**Gen. 5. Blennius.**\n\nHead sloping, and covered with scales; gill-membrane six-rayed; body lanceolate; ventral fins with two spineless processes, the anal fin detached.\n\n*With crested head.*\n\n*Crested blenny.*\u2014Crest transverse, and skinny. Length about four or five inches; body long, compressed, and slippery. The crest erected or depressed at pleasure. Inhabits the European seas, and is sometimes found about the rocky coasts of Great Britain.\n\n*Cirratus.*\u2014Longitudinal fleshy crest between the eyes. Native of the Indian seas.\n\n*Coronatus.*\u2014Simple ray between the eyes; and single dorsal fin. Inhabits the Indian seas.\n\n*Ocellaris.*\u2014Blueish-green; subfasciated with brown broad dorsal fin, marked by a black ocellated spot. Length about six or eight inches. Inhabits the Mediterranean, among the rocks and sea-plants near the shore. Its flesh is meagre and not much esteemed.\n\n*Fasciatus blenny.*\u2014Two simple cirri between the fasciatus eyes; the vent fin with 19 rays. Native of the Indian seas.\n\n*Salient blenny.*\u2014Brown, streaked with black, with a saliens simple cirrus on the head, and very large pectoral fins. Observed by Commerson about some of the southern islands, particularly those of New Britain. It was seen swimming by hundreds; and, as it were, flying over the surface of the water, occasionally springing up and down with great rapidity among the rocks.\n\n*Gattorugine.*\u2014Small palmated fins on the eyebrows and nape. Inhabits the Mediterranean and Atlantic; and is reckoned eatable.\n\n*Supercilious blenny.*\u2014With palmated superciliary cirri, the lateral line curved. Grows to the length of about twelve inches; is viviparous; and inhabits the Indian seas.\n\n*Tentaculated blenny.*\u2014A simple cirrus over the eyes, and a large ocellated spot on the back fin. Nearly allied to the horned species; and is found in the Mediterranean.\n\n*Simus blenny.*\u2014With a very small cirrus over the eyes; dorsal fin united behind to the caudal fin, and crooked lateral line. Length about three inches and a half. Described by Swieb, from a specimen in the museum of the Peterburgh Academy.\n\n*Hake blenny,* or *forked hake.*\u2014Nostrils somewhat physic crested, a cirrus on the upper lip, and two dorsal fins. Grows to be eighteen inches long; inhabits the Mediterranean, and occurs on the coast of Cornwall. Improperly classified by Pennant among the gadus.\n\n**Head plain, or cretules.**\n\n*Trifurcated blenny,* or *trifurcated hake.*\u2014Brown trifurcated with white lips, and three-rayed open ventral fins. Much allied to *gadus tau,* was first discovered by Mr Davies near Beaumaris, and described by Mr Pennant as a gadus.\n\n*Punctulated blenny.*\u2014Whitish, scaly, with irregular punctula-brown points, and elongated ventral fins. Head large; size about five inches. Described from a specimen in the Paris museum.\n\n*Smooth blenny.*\u2014The lateral line curved, and sub-pholis bifid. This species, which frequents the northern and Mediterranean seas, lying among stones and sea-weed, and occasionally entering the mouths of rivers, will grow to the length of seven or eight inches, but is usually much smaller. It bites fiercely, when first taken, and is so tenacious of life, that it may be kept 24 hours out of water. It feeds on smaller fishes and their spawn, as well as on shell-fish, sea-insects, &c. It is smooth, and covered with mucus. Being a coarse fish, it is principally used as bait.\n\n*Bofcinus blenny.*\u2014Olivaceous, with brown and whitish bofcianus clouds; vent in the middle of the body. Very much allied to the preceding. Native of the American seas, and very common in the bay of Charlestown. It has its name from M. Boce, by whom it was discovered.\n\n*Gunnel,* or *spotted blenny,* or *butter fish.*\u2014The dorsal gemellas fin marked with ten ocellated black spots. About nine or ten inches in length; head small, body compressed,\nThoracic pressed, and the colour of the body yellow-brown, clouded and freckled with deeper specks. This species inhabits the Baltic, Mediterranean, and northern seas. Though coarse, it is often dried and eaten by the Greenlanders. The number of spots on the back fin varies from nine to twelve.\n\n**mystelaris.** *Wegsel blenny.*\u2014The anterior dorsal fin three-rayed.\n\nNative of the Indian seas.\n\n**viviparus.** *Viviparous blenny.*\u2014Two tentacula at the mouth. Is sometimes found of the length of a foot, or even of 15 inches. Of a somewhat slender form, with a smooth flippery skin, covered with small scales of a yellowish olive colour, paler beneath, and marked on the upper parts by several moderately large dark spots, forming a kind of bars on the dorsal fin and over the back. The rays of all the fins are soft. This species is a littoral fish, frequenting the coasts of the Mediterranean, Baltic, and northern seas; sometimes entering the mouths of rivers, and feeding like its congeners on the smaller fishes, insects, &c. Its ova are hatched internally, and the young acquire their perfect form before the time of their birth. Not less than two or even three hundred of these have been sometimes observed in a single fish. When the latter is advanced in its pregnancy, it is scarcely possible to touch the abdomen without causing the immediate exclusion of some of the young, which are immediately capable of swimming with great vivacity. It probably breeds more than once in the course of the year; at least naturalists have assigned different seasons to the production of its young. Its flesh is white and fat; but a prejudice has been entertained against it, because the bones, like those of the gar-fish, become green by boiling. According to the observation of Linn\u00e6us, they are also phosphorescent in the dark.\n\n**lumponus.** *Areolated blenny.*\u2014Yellowish, with subcylindric body, marked on the back by brown patches. Inhabits the deep sandy shores of the Mediterranean, and conceals itself among fuci, stones, &c. Sometimes grows to 10 or 12 inches.\n\n**raninus.** *Frog blenny.*\u2014Brown, with obscurely five-cleft ventral fins, and gular cirrus. Native of the northern seas and of the Swedish lakes; in habit resembling the *gadus tau.* Is not eatable, and is said to frighten away other fish.\n\n**murcenoides.** *Murcenoid blenny.*\u2014Gill-membrane three-rayed; ventral fins one-rayed, with very minute spines. Body compressed, sword-shaped, smooth, and without visible scales. Described by Swief from a specimen in the Museum of the Petersburgh academy.\n\n**Kurtus.**\n\nGen. 6. **Kurtus.**\n\nBody carinated above and below, back elevated, gill-membrane two-rayed.\n\n**indicus.** *Indian kurtus.*\u2014Silvery with gold-coloured back. Inhabits the Indian seas. Length, including the tail, about ten inches, and the greatest breadth somewhat more than four inches. Feeds on shell-fish, small crabs, &c.\n\n### III. THORACIC.\n\nThe fishes of this order have the ventral fins at the breast, or nearly under the pectoral fins. They are generally voracious, preying on other fishes; they are mostly inhabitants of the sea; and their skins, with a few exceptions, are furnished with scales. None of them are viviparous.\n\n**Gen. 1. C\u00e6pola.**\n\nHead roundish and compressed; mouth turning up, a single row of curved teeth; gill-membrane five-rayed; body sword-shaped and scaleless; the abdomen scarcely so long as the head.\n\n**Common band-fish ribband-fish, or tape-fish.**\u2014*tania.*\n\nCaudal fin attenuated, head very obtuse. Very thin, and almost transparent, so that its vertebrae are visible. Grows to the length of four or five feet. It swims with rapidity, and haunts the muddy or weedy shores of the Mediterranean. Scarcely eatable, having little or no flesh.\n\n**Rubescens band-fish.**\u2014Caudal fin attenuated, jaws pointed. A rare species, and not very distinctly described by authors. It is said to inhabit the Mediterranean.\n\nThe other species are *trachyptera* and *hermanniana.*\n\n**Gen. 2. Gymnetrus.**\n\nBody very long and compressed; teeth numerous and subulate; gill-membrane four or five-rayed; anal fin wanting.\n\n**African gymnetus.**\u2014Silvery, speckled longitudinally with brown points, and with the ventral cirri dilated at the tips. This singular fish, which is but imperfectly described in the *Icones Rerum Naturalium* of Professor Afcanianus, is distinguished by the peculiar conformation of its ventral fins, which have more the appearance of long single rays or processes terminated by a small ovate and expanded tip. It is said either to precede or accompany the shoals of herrings in the northern seas, and is popularly denominated *king of the herrings.* That described by Dr Shaw, from a drawing and notes in the possession of Dr Ruffel, is perhaps either a variety or sexual difference of the *afcanianus.*\n\n**Hawkenian or Blochian gymnetus.**\u2014Bluish, silvery, hawkenii, with oblique, linear, brown bands, and rounded spots, red fins, and four long ventral processes. Described by Dr Bloch, from a drawing communicated by J. Hawkins, Esq. In general appearance, much allied to the other kinds of gymnetus; from which, however, it is readily distinguished by its two pair of ventral processes with their finny extremities, and large distant round spots on the body. A native of the Indian seas. A specimen was thrown on the coast of Cornwall in February 1798.\n\n**Cepedian gymnetus.**\u2014Described by La C\u00e9p\u00e9de, from a coloured Chinese drawing, therefore very imperfectly known.\n\n**Gen. 3. Vandellius.**\n\nBody very long and sword-shaped; gill membrane five or five-rayed; teeth subulate, and those in front larger.\n\n**Lusitanian vandell.**\u2014Silvery, with forked tail. Occurs, though very rarely, in the Mediterranean and Atlantic seas. It has been sometimes taken near Lisbon.\nDr Vandelli considers it as nearly related to the genus *trichurus*. There is in the British Museum a dried specimen, which is four feet eight inches in length, the breadth three inches and a half, and the thickness very slight in proportion.\n\n**Gen. 4. Echeneis.**\n\nHead oily, naked, and depressed, flat above, and emarginated, transversely fulcated, and the fulci serrated; gill-membrane ten-rayed; body scaleless.\n\n*Mediterranean remora*, or *sucking-fish.*\u2014Tail forked; head with eighteen thorns or bars. This number, however, is subject to vary, and cannot be safely assumed as a certain character. Grows to the length of about eighteen inches, and is usually of an uniform brown colour. It is remarkable for the apparatus on its head, by which it firmly adheres to rocks, ships, or animals, being incapable of swimming easily to any considerable distance. From this adhesive property arose the marvellous account of the ancients, who alleged that the remora could arrest a ship under full sail in the midst of the ocean. They also pretended, that it completely subdued the passion of love. Five individuals of this species have been found fastened to the body of a single shark. The latter fish, it is said, will not swallow them. The Indians of Cuba and Jamaica formerly kept and fed sucking-fishes for the purpose of catching others. The owner, on a calm morning, would carry one of them out to sea, secured to his canoe by a small but strong line, many fathoms in length; the creature fastened on the first fish in its way. The Indian, meanwhile, loosed and let go the line, which was provided with a buoy to mark the course which the sucking-fish had taken; and he pursued it in his canoe, until he perceived his game to be nearly exhausted. He then gradually drew the line towards the shore, the remora still so inflexibly adhering to his prey, as not easily to be removed. Oviedo says, he has known turtle taken by this mode, of a weight that no single man could support. This species inhabits the ocean and the Mediterranean. Its flesh is said to taste like fried artichokes.\n\n*Indian remora*, or *longest sucking-fish.* Tail entire; 24 bars on the head. Occurs more frequently in the Indian and American seas than in those of Europe, and is very common about the Mozambique coast, where it is used in catching turtle. It is found of the length of two or three feet, or even of seven. The upper parts of the body are olive green, and the under parts are whitish. Its flesh is tough and meagre.\n\n*Lineata.*\u2014Tail wedge-shaped; head with ten bars, two longitudinal white lines on each side of the body. Inhabits the Pacific ocean.\n\n**Gen. 5. Coryphaena.**\n\nHead much sloping and truncated; gill membrane five-rayed; the dorsal fin of the length of the back.\n\n*Common coryphaena*, or *dolphin.* Forked tail. Inhabits the Mediterranean, Indian, and Atlantic seas, often appearing in large schools, playing round ships, and eagerly devouring any articles of food that happen to be thrown overboard. It will even swallow indigestible substances, such as iron nails, &c. Like its congeners, it exhibits splendid and vivid hues in the water, being of a bright and beautiful blue-green, accompanied by a golden gloss. When taken out of the water, this fine combination of colouring gradually vanishes with the principle of life. Its ordinary length is about three feet; but it is often seen of four, or even five feet in length. It is strong and voracious, pursuing the smaller fishes, and especially persecuting the flying-fish. In spring and autumn it frequents shores, to deposit its spawn. As its flesh is much esteemed, it is taken both with the line and net. Though popularly called dolphin, it is not to be confounded with the *delphinus* of the ancients.\n\nOf the following, which more or less resemble the preceding, the history is too obscure to detain us:\n\n*equifascis, plumieri, cerulea, pentadactyla, novacula, chrysura, pompilus, fasciata, velifer, pituitosa, leucorhoides, acuta, fima, viridis, hemiptera, branchiopaga, japonica, chypenta, lineata,* and *sinensis.*\n\n**Gen. 6. Macrocerus.**\n\nHead and eyes large; body at the hind part attenuated into the tail.\n\n*Long-tailed imminens.* Two dorsal fins, of which the first has the first ray toothed at the back. This is the *coryphaena rupestris* of Linnaeus.\u2014It chiefly occurs about the coasts of Greenland and Iceland, where it is regarded as a dainty. The head is large and thick, and the body is covered with rounded scales, each of which is furnished with a toothed carina, ending in a pointed tip, so that the hand is wounded by drawing it over the fish from the tail towards the head. When taken, its body swells, as if with rage, and its eyes project in a hideous manner.\n\n**Gen. 7. Gobius.**\n\nHead small, with two approximated pores between the eyes, one pore placed before the other; gill-membrane four-rayed; body small, compressed on both sides, covered with small scales, and furnished with a pimple behind the vent; the ventral fins coalescing into an oval shape; two dorsal fins.\n\n*Common, or black goby, sea gudgeon, or miller's-nigger.* Thirteen rays in the second dorsal fin. Grows to the length of six inches. The body is wedge-shaped, soft, and slippery, and overspread with small dusky or blackish specks.\u2014This species is said to affix itself to the rocks by the union of its ventral fins in the form of a funnel, from which circumstance it is sometimes called *rock-fish.* It is a native of the Mediterranean and southern seas, frequenting the shores in the beginning of summer, when it deposits its spawn. It is edible, but not held in particular estimation.\n\nTo this numerous genus also belong *bicolor, cruentatus, paganelus, arabicus, nebulosus, eleotris, aphya, minutus, jossa, petitiariostris, schloefleri, melanurus, boddaerti, lagoccephalus, cyprinoides, lanceolatus, bofii, ceruleus, brunneofasciatus, plumieri, ocellaris, ater,* and *anguillaris.*\n\n**Gen. 8. Gobiomorus.**\n\nHabit as in the preceding genus; ventral fins distinct.\n\n*Southern gobiomorus.* Gobius *fragatus* of Linnaeus. Blue\nGen. 9. Cottus.\n\nHead broader than the body, and armed with spines; eyes vertical, furnished with a nictitating membrane; gill-membrane five-rayed; body round, without scales, attenuated towards the tail; dorsal fins more than one.\n\nMailed or armed bull-head, or pogge. Covered with a hard crust; two bifid warts on the rostrum; head furnished with cirri below. General length about five or six inches. The head large, bony, and rugged; the body octagonal, and covered with a number of strong bony curts. Frequent the European seas, and is plentiful on our own coasts, living on worms and water insects, particularly young crabs, and spawning in the month of May. It is drest for the table, but not esteemed a luxury.\n\nFour-horned bull-head, with four bony tubercles on the head.\u2014Native of the Mediterranean, Baltic, and northern seas. Used chiefly as a bait.\n\nGrinning bull-head. Throat flanged with cirri; body naked.\u2014When first taken, it utters, like some of the gunards, a kind of abrupt grunting sound, by the sudden expulsion of air from the internal cavities, through the gill-covers and mouth. It is reckoned excellent; but the liver is said to be hurtful. Native of the Indian and American seas.\n\nLuther bull-head, or father-luther. Several spines on the head; the upper jaw rather longer than the lower. Inhabits the Mediterranean, and the northern ocean of Europe and America.\u2014It is very strong, swims with great rapidity, and is very voracious, preying on the blennies, cod, herring, salmon, as well as on smaller fishes and insects. It is very frequent in Greenland, where it sometimes attains to the length of six feet, and where it is much relished as an article of food. It is said to be able to live a considerable time out of water, having the power of closing the gill-covers so as to exclude the effects of atmospheric air. Like the grunting bull-head, it utters a strong sound when first taken.\n\nRiver bull-head, or miller's thumb. Smooth, with two spines on the head.\u2014Inhabits the clear rivers and brooks of Europe and Siberia, generally lying on the gravel, or concealing itself beneath the stones, preying on worms, water insects, and very young fishes. It deposits its spawn in March or April. In this country its length seldom exceeds three inches and a half; but in other parts of Europe it seems to arrive at a superior size, and is even found of the length of seven inches. It is of a yellow olive colour, has a large head, slippery skin, and tapers to the tail. It is most readily caught during the night, and its flesh, which grows red by boiling, is esteemed good and wholesome.\n\nInfidius bull-head. Head marked above by sharp lines, and on each side by two spines.\u2014Native of the Arabian seas, in which it conceals itself under the sand, and springs on such of the smaller fishes as happen to approach its haunts.\n\nTo this genus also appertain seaber, japonicus, massificus, monopterygius, madagascariensis, niger, and auriflalis.\n\nGen. 10. Scorpaena.\n\nHead large, aculeated, cirrated, obtuse, scaleless, and Scorpaena subcompressed; eyes approximated; teeth in the jaws, palate, and fauces; gill membrane seven-rayed; body flethy; one dorsal fin, long; the first rays spinous.\n\nPorcine scorpaena, little sea scorpion, or sea devil.\u2014Porcus. Cirri at the eyes and nostrils. Common in the Mediterranean. Seldom exceeds a foot in length. Wounds with the spines of its dorsal fin. Flesh tough, and scarcely eatable.\n\nRufous scorpaena, or larger sea scorpion.\u2014Two cirri, spina, on the under lip. Larger than the preceding, being sometimes four feet in length. It preys not only on the smaller fishes, but, occasionally, on marine birds. Inhabits the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and northern seas.\n\nHorrid scorpaena.\u2014Scattered over with callous tu-horrida, bercles. Of a very uncouth and forbidding aspect. Measures from 12 to 15 inches in length, and inhabits the Indian seas.\n\nFlying scorpaena.\u2014Thirteen rays in the dorsal fin; volitans, six cirri, the pectoral fins longer than the body. Like fishes of the exocetus and trigla genus, it uses its pectoral fins for the purposes of occasional flight. Native of the rivers of Japan, Amboyna, &c., where it is reckoned excellent food.\n\nBesides the preceding, naturalists reckon plumieri, commersonii, bicapillata, brachiate, aculeata, barbata, antennata, capensis, spinosa, and americana.\n\nGen. 11. Zeus.\n\nHead compressed, and flopping; upper lip arched with a transparent membrane; tongue fimbriated; gill membrane with seven perpendicular rays, the lowest transparent; body compressed, thin, and shining, the rays of the first dorsal fin ending in filaments.\n\nBrazilian dory.\u2014The second ray of the dorsal and vomer, anal fin very long. Of a rhomboidal shape, about six or eight inches long, very thin, and scaleless. Native of the American seas, and sometimes seen in those of the north of Europe. Edible, but not much in request.\n\nInfidius dory.\u2014With a narrow mouth. Native of infidiator, the rivers and fresh waters of India.\n\nIndian dory.\u2014The tenth ray of the dorsal and the second of the anal fin longer than the body. Native of the American and Indian seas.\n\nCiliated dory.\u2014With some of the rays in the dorsal ciliaris, and anal fin very long. Native of the Indian seas.\n\nCommon dory.\u2014The tail rounded; a brown central spot on each side of the body; two anal fins. Grows to nearly 18 inches in length, and weighs from 10 to 12 pounds. The head is abrupt, the mouth wide, the back much arched, and furnished with a row of strong small prickers. The body is covered with very minute scales, dusky brown above, and of a shining greenish yellow on the sides. 'We are indebted (says Mr Pennant) to that judicious actor and bon vivant, the late Mr Quin, for adding a most delicious fish to our table, who overcoming all the vulgar prejudices on account of its deformity, has effectually established its reputation.'\nThe dory is extremely voracious, and, when first taken, makes the same kind of sound, as the gurnards and scorpions. It is a native of the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and northern seas. It is fished on the southern coasts of England; but the largest are found in the bay of Biscay.\n\nRed dory.\u2014Tail even; body reddish. Resembles the preceding, but is much smaller. Native of the Mediterranean.\n\nOpal dory.\u2014Tail somewhat lunate; body reddish, with white spots. This beautiful species measures from four to five feet in length; the general colour sometimes a brilliant silvery green, and sometimes a bright gold colour, variegated with pretty numerous, and moderately large, oval white spots; while the fins and tail are bright scarlet. It is the *scus lunus* of Linnaeus. Found, though rarely, in the Mediterranean and northern seas.\n\nSquare dory.\u2014Tail even; body cinereous, with transverse bulky bars. Native of the coasts of Jamaica.\n\nGen. 12. Pleuronectes.\n\nHead small; eyes spherical, both on the same side of the head, and near each other; mouth arched; jaws with teeth, and unequal; gill-membrane, with four to seven rays; the gill-cover, in most of the species, consisting of three plates; body compressed, carinated; the one side somewhat convex, answering to the back; the other, of a paler colour, to the belly; the vent nearer the head than the tail.\n\nThe fishes of this genus are remarkable for having both eyes on one side of the head; and they are divided into two sections, according as they have the eyes towards the right, when the animal is laid with its coloured side upwards, with its abdomen towards the spectator; or to the left, when the fish is in the same situation.\n\n*With eyes towards the right.*\n\nHolibut.\u2014The whole body smooth. Dusky above, pure white beneath. Narrow in respect to its length. Individuals have been taken on the English coast, which weighed from 200 to 300 pounds; and the Icelanders have caught some which weighed 400 pounds. Olafsen mentions, that he saw one which measured five ells; and we are told by the Norwegian fishermen, that a single holibut will sometimes cover a whole skiff. This species, then, is more entitled to the epithet maximus, than that to which it is applied. Though it inhabits the Mediterranean, it arrives at a larger size in the northern seas of Europe and America. It is so voracious, that it devours rays, crabs, haddock, and even lump-fish, of which it seems to be very fond. The part of the body nearest the fins, is fat and delicate, but surfeiting; the rest of the fish is regarded as coarse food. The Greenlanders cut it into thin slips, and dry them in the sun. This fish deposits its spawn in spring, among rocks near the shore.\n\nSmaller holibut.\u2014Body smooth, oblong; teeth obtuse; tail roundish. Very like the preceding, but smaller, and more relished as an article of food. Native of the northern seas.\n\nPlaice.\u2014Body smooth, with six tubercles on the head. Readily distinguished by its very broad and flat shape, its pale brown colour above, and the orange-coloured spots with which it is marked. One of eight or nine pounds is reckoned a large fish, though instances occur of their weighing 15 pounds. They spawn in the beginning of May, and are common in the Baltic and northern seas. The best are said to be taken off Rye, on the Sussex coast, and near Holland. They are in considerable request in the fish-market, though far inferior to the sole and turbot.\n\nFlounder.\u2014With a rough lateral line, and a series of spines at the base of the fins. Easily distinguished from the rest of the genus by the specific character; and very generally known, as it inhabits every part of the British sea, and even frequents our rivers at a considerable distance from salt water. It likewise occurs in the northern, Baltic, and Mediterranean seas. In size, it is much inferior to the plaice; but it affords a light and wholesome food.\n\nDab.\u2014Scales ciliated; small spines at the origin of the dorsal and anal fins; teeth obtuse. Of a very broad, ovate shape, yellowish brown above, and white beneath. Inhabits the same seas as the plaice and flounder; but is less common, of a smaller size, and more prized as an article of food.\n\nSmear-dab, or kit.\u2014Yellowish brown, with smooth scales; five dusky spots, white beneath. Caught on the Cornish coast.\n\nLong dab.\u2014Body oblong and rough, lateral line straight and broad. Much longer than the dab. Inhabits the northern seas, and is esteemed at table.\n\nRose-coloured flounder.\u2014Colour of a delicate rose; rosy, and general proportions those of a flounder. Taken in the Thames, and preserved in the Leverian museum.\n\nSoles.\u2014Body oblong and rough; upper jaw long; more narrow and oblong than any other of the genus. Sometimes grows to the length of more than two feet, and to the weight of eight pounds. Its general size, however, is much smaller. Those of moderate size are generally in most request for the table; and, next to the turbot, are reckoned the most delicate of the genus. The sole is an inhabitant of the northern, Baltic, Mediterranean, and American seas. On the west coast of Great Britain it attains to a much larger size than on the east. The principal sole-fishery is at Brixham, in Torbay.\n\nSmooth sole.\u2014White, transparent, with small, thin, diaphanous deciduous scales. Found about the coasts of Cornwall, where it is called lantern-sole.\n\n*With eyes towards the left.*\n\nWhiff.\u2014Body broad and rough. Native of the punctatus, northern sea.\n\nPearl.\u2014Body smooth; pale brown above, marked rhombus, by scattered yellowish, or rufous spots, and white beneath. Resembles the turbot, but is inferior in size. Native of the European seas.\n\nTurbot, or brei; pleuronectes maximus of Linnaeus\u2014tuberculata. Body rough. This fish, which is reckoned such delicate eating, is found both in the Mediterranean and northern seas. It is broader and squarer than any of the genus, except the pearl, and is of a dark brown above, marbled with blackish spots of different sizes, and white beneath. Like the rest of this genus, the turbot generally lies in deep water, preying on worms, shell-fish, small fishes, &c. It is taken in great quantities.\ntities about the northern coasts of England, as well as on those of France, Holland, &c. They are so extremely delicate in their choice of baits as not to touch a piece of herring, or haddock that has been 12 hours out of the sea. Though the turbot and holibut are often confounded in our markets, the former may be easily recognized by the large, unequal, and obtuse tubercles on its upper part.\n\nIn this numerous genus are also classified trichodonstyleus, melba, plagifera, ocellatus, rondeletii, lingualis, glaucialis, platycephalus, argenteus, barbatus, marmoratus, pavoninus, lineatus, bilineatus, ornatus, dentatus, macrolepidotus, passer, papillofus, argus, stellatus, and japonicus.\n\nGen. 13. Chaetodon.\n\nHead small; mouth narrow, with retractile lips; teeth generally feteaceous, flexible, moveable, equal, very numerous, and close; eyes round, small, vertical, and furnished with a nictitating membrane; gill-membrane from three to five-rayed; body broad, thin, compressed, covered with hard scales, and coloured; dorsal and anal fins rigid, flabby, fleshy, and generally terminated with prickles.\n\nTo avoid much unnecessary repetition, we shall observe, in general, that upwards of 60 species of chaetodons have been distinctly ascertained; that they are mostly natives of the American and Indian seas; that they are distinguished by the great depth and highly compressed form of the body, which is often beautifully variegated by transverse, oblique, or longitudinal bands, and covered with strong scales, finely denticulated on the margins; and that the dorsal and anal fin are remarkably broad, and, in many species, of an unusual length.\n\nOne of the most remarkable species of this genus is the rostratus, rostrated or beaked chaetodon, with an entire tail, nine spines in the dorsal fin, an ocellated spot on the sides, and the beak cylindrical. It is of a roundish-ovate shape, about six or eight inches in length, of a whitish colour, with a dusky tinge on the back, and marked by fine transverse and nearly equidistant brown bands, with milk-white edges. It is a native of the fresh waters of India, and feeds principally on flies and other small winged insects which hover about the surface of its native waters. When it feeds a fly at a distance, alighted on any of the plants in the shallow water, it approaches very slowly, and with the utmost caution, coming as much as possible perpendicularly under the object. Then putting its body in an oblique direction, with the mouth and eyes near the surface, it remains a moment immovable. Having fixed its eyes directly on the insect, it darts at it a drop of water from its tubular mouth, but without shewing its mouth above the surface, from which only the drop seems to rise, and that with such effect, that, though at the distance of four, five, or six feet, it very seldom fails to bring its prey into the water. With the closest attention the mouth could never be discovered above the surface, although the fish has been seen to spout several drops successively, without leaving the place, or in the smallest apparent degree moving its body. This very singular mode of attacking its prey was reported to M. Homel, governor of the hospital at Batavia, and so far excited his curiosity, that he ordered a large tub to be filled with sea-water, and had some of the fishes caught and put into it. When they were reconciled to their confinement, he caused a slender stick, with a fly fastened at the end, to be placed in such a manner on the side of the vessel, as to enable the fish to strike it; and it was not without inexplicable delight, that he daily saw them exercising their skill in shooting at it, with amazing force, and seldom missing their mark. This faculty is possessed by a few other species belonging to very different genera. The flesh of the rostrated chaetodon is white and well-taught.\n\nAngel chaetodon, or angel-fish of Cateby, is of a fine catebeii. gold-green colour, with the scales covered by smaller ones. The pectoral, ventral fins, and tail, are of a vivid orange; and the dorsal and anal, violet-blue at the base, and bright crimson towards the tips.\u2014It is common off Carolina and the Bahama isles, where it is much esteemed for its delicacy.\n\nImperial chaetodon, is a magnificent species, growing imperator: to the length of a foot or more. Its ground colour is a golden-yellow, which is longitudinally, though somewhat obliquely, striped with very numerous bright blue parallel rays. It is a native of Japan, and said to be superior to the salmon in flavour.\n\nSea bat, or bat chaetodon, surpasses all the other species vespertilio. in the great extent and breadth of the dorsal and anal fin, both which nearly equal the body itself in size, and are of a somewhat triangular shape.\u2014It is a native of Japan.\n\nRed-striped chaetodon, is distinguished by numerous setifer. red stripes on the body, and an eye-shaped spot and bristle on the dorsal fin.\n\nThree-coloured chaetodon, is golden-yellow on the tricolor. fore-part, jet black behind, except the tail, which is yellow, and red near the end, while the edges of the gill-covers, and of all the fins, are bright red.\n\nGen. 14. Acanthurus.\n\nTeeth small, and in most species lobated; tail aculeated on each side. This genus comprises such species of the Linnaean chaetodon as, in contradiction to the principal character of that genus, have moderately broad and strong teeth, rather than slender and fetaeous ones.\n\nUnicorn acanthurus. Gray-brown; with a frontal unicornis. horn projecting over the snout, and two spines on each side of the tail. Of the length of three feet or upwards. Its horn-shaped process is strong and conical, terminating rather obtusely.\u2014It is a native of the Indian and Arabian seas, in the latter of which it is usually seen in shoals of two or four hundred, swimming with great strength, and feeding principally on the different kinds of sea-weed. It is singular that so remarkable a fish should have been entirely overlooked by Linnaeus, even in the twelfth edition of the Systema Naturae.\n\nThe other species are denominated nasus, teuthir, nigricans, militaris, trigleagus, harpurus, sohal, nigro-filicetus, achilles, lineatus, umbratus, melanogris, and velifer.\n\nGen. 15. Eques.\n\nTeeth in several rows; body banded.\n\nAmerican knight-fish. Chaetodon lanceolatus, Lin.americanus. Body oblong; yellowish, with three black bands, the nut.\nfirst across the eyes, the second across the thorax, and the third along the body. Native of the American seas.\n\nTrichopus.\n\nGen. 16. Trichopus.\n\nBody compressed; ventral fins, with a very long filament.\n\ngoramy. Goramy trichopus. Rufescient, with a silvery cast on the sides; and the second ray of the ventral fins extremely long. Native of the fresh waters of China, where it is much prized as an article of food.\n\narabicus. Arabian trichopus. Labrus gallus, Lin. Greenish, with violet and blue stripes, and second ray of the ventral fins very long. Native of the Arabian seas.\n\nsatyrus. Satyr trichopus. With finking forehead, projecting chin, and extremely long, fingle rayed, ventral fins. Native of the Indian seas.\n\npallasi. Pallasi's trichopus. Labrus trichopterus, Lin. Brown, with pale undulations, a black spot on each side of the body and tail, and long fingle-rayed ventral fins. Native of the Indian seas.\n\nmonodactylus. Monodactylus trichopus. Silvery, with brownish back, and short, fingle-rayed, rigid ventral fins. Native of the Indian seas.\n\nSparus.\n\nGen. 17. Sparus.\n\nStrong cutting or canine teeth, with obtuse and close-set grinders; lips double; gill membrane five-rayed, gill covers fealy; body compressed, lateral line curved behind; pectoral fins rounded.\n\nOf this very extensive genus, most of the species are exotic; and their history is very imperfectly known. Confiderable confusion takes place with respect to the characters by which they ought to be discriminated from the labri, a family to which they are much allied. We shall briefly notice only a few of the most striking and best known species.\n\namata. Gilt-head, has a lunulated spot between the eyes. A more permanent character may be assumed from the six cutting teeth in each jaw. This species is about 15 inches long, but sometimes of a much larger size. It is of a silvery bluish cast, with gold-coloured brown, and sometimes with several brownish longitudinal stripes. The body is broad and thin, and the back elevated. The gilt-head is a native of the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and Indian seas; frequenting deep water on bold rocky shores; and living chiefly on tunicate animals. It is said to sleep at flated times, and to be very susceptible of cold. The Greeks and Romans reckoned it a most delicate morsel, and the former held it to be consecrated to Venus.\n\nerythrinus. Rose sparus, is remarkable for its beautiful rose-red colour. In size and shape, it resembles the perch. It is a native of the Mediterranean and Indian seas, in the latter of which it is said to acquire noxious qualities.\n\nfasciatus. Fasciatus sparus, is of a quarrifh elongated shape; with transverse dusky bands, and the fins edged with black. It is a native of Japan.\n\nchlororus. Green-tailed sparus, is a native of the American seas, and a highly elegant species; having its yellowish and large scales crossed by a green band, green fins, and rose-coloured gill-covers. The green tail is strongly lunulated, and marked by minute pale specks.\n\nA striking disposition of colours likewise distinguishes, the chrysurus, or gold-tailed sparus, which is found in the seas of South America. Its general complexion is a bright rofe-red, which is deepest on the back; a gold yellow stripe runs on each side from the gills to the tail, and a second on each side of the bottom of the abdomen.\n\nSpined sparus, has the dorsal spines recumbent, and spinifer, the fin in the middle filiform, and elongated. It is of a reddish silvery hue, with the back and the lines on the body dusky; shape ovate; and length, a foot and a half. It inhabits the Red sea; and is reckoned a delicious fish for the table.\n\nSquirrel sparus, squirrel-fish, or grunt.\u2014Gray-brown, with large scales bordered with yellow, and head marked longitudinally by numerous blue and yellow lines. According to Bloch, the blue lines also run along the body. Native of the American seas. It is the perca formosa of Linnaeus.\n\nInfidus sparus.\u2014Red, yellowish on the sides; tail infidulator, sub-forepainted. Length about ten inches. Native of the Indian seas, where, through its long tubular snout, it shoots a drop of water at the insects on which it feeds, in the same manner as the refracted chaetodon.\n\nGalilean sparus.\u2014Greenish, with whitish abdomen. galileus. Very common in the lake of Genesareth, and therefore supposed to have been the principal species in the miraculous draught of fishes recorded by St Luke.\n\nDesfontaine's sparus.\u2014With 23 rays in the dorsal desfontain fin, ii in the anal, and a black spot on the gill-covers. nii. Inhabits the warm waters of Caffa in Tunis, which, in January, are about 30 degrees of Reaumur's thermometer above the freezing point; but it is also found in the cold and brackish waters surrounding the date plantations at Tozzar.\n\nArgus sparus.\u2014Of a silvery blue; with many ocellated brown spots. A very elegant species, of which the native country is uncertain.\n\nClimbing sparus.\u2014Olive-green, with yellowish abdo-fsandens, men, and gold-coloured eyes. Length about a span; skin covered by a blackish mucus. \"This fish (says Dr Shaw) is remarkable for its power of climbing, which it performs by the assistance of the spines of its gill-covers, moving itself at pleasure up the stems of trees growing near the waters it frequents. In this situation it was observed in the month of November 1791, at Tranquebar, by Lieutenant Daldorff, who communicated its description to Sir Joseph Banks. It was seen ascending a fissure in the stem of the palm called borafus flabelifer, growing near a pool of water, and was observed to move itself forwards by alternately applying the spiny sides of the gill-covers to the sides of the fissure, afflicting itself at the same time by the spines on each side of the tail, and had already ascended to the height of more than five feet above the water when it was first observed: it was found to be very tenacious of life, moving about on dry sand, many hours after it was taken.\"\n\nGen. 18.

Native of the Mediterranean; where it feeds principally on fuci, and swins in shoals. It was in high esteem with the ancients as a food, and considered by the Romans as one of the principal delicacies of the table.\n\n*Ballan labrus,* or *ballan wrasse.*\u2014Yellow, with fulvous spots, reflex lips, and ramentole dorsal fin. Weighs about five pounds. Appears annually in great shoals off Filey-bridge, near Scarborough.\n\n*Ancient labrus,* ancient wrasse, or old wife.\u2014Beak tinctured upwards; end of the tail circular. Size and habit of a tench. Native of the European seas, and usually found in deep waters, about rocky coasts. Liable to vary much in colour.\n\n*Parakeet labrus.*\u2014Green, with three longitudinal red stripes on each side, and yellow dorsal fin marked with a longitudinal red band. A beautiful species, which inhabits the American seas.\n\n*Beautiful labrus.*\u2014Red, with longitudinal, interrupted, flexuous, blue streaks; and fins edged with blue.\n\n*Jurella labrus.*\u2014Sides bluish, both marked by a longitudinal, fulvous, and dentated band. Length about eight inches, and form somewhat lengthened. Occurs in shoals in the Mediterranean. The more ancient ichthyologists erroneously considered it as poisonous, and as the most beautiful of the finny tribes.\n\n**Gen. 21. Ophicephalus.**\n\nHead coated with dissimilar scales; body elongated.\n\n*Punctatus ophicephalus.*\u2014Dusky, paler beneath, with punctatus; the head pierced by pores, and the body speckled with black points. Length about ten inches. Frequents rivers and lakes in India; and is reckoned a delicate and wholesome food.\n\n*Striated ophicephalus.*\u2014Dusky, with the abdominal striatus; and fins striated with dusky and whitish variegations. Length about twelve inches. Native of India; inhabiting lakes, and equally esteemed with the former as food.\n\n**Gen. 22. Longchurus.**\n\nHead fleshy; ventral fins separate; tail lanceolate.\n\n*Bearded longchurus.*\u2014Ferruginous-brown; with flight-barbatus; lengthened nose; two beards at the lower jaw; and the first ray of the ventral fins elongated into a bristle. Length about twelve inches. Native of Surinam.\n\n**Gen. 23. Scena.**\n\nThe whole head covered with scales; gill-membrane fixed; a furrow on the back, in which the dorsal fin is seated.\n\nMost of the species of this genus are exotic, and but obscurely known.\nCirrhosa or bearded sciaena, has the upper jaw longer than the lower, and a beard on the latter. It has the habit of a carp, and measures from one to two feet. Native of the Mediterranean. Was valued by the Greeks and Romans as an article of food.\n\nLabrax.\n\nBassus sciaena, or bass. Perea labrax of Lin.\u2014Sub-argentaceous, with brown back, yellowish-red fins, and dusky tail. Habit of a salmon. Native of the Mediterranean and northern seas; frequently entering rivers. Known to the ancients by the names of labrax and lurp, and greatly prized, particularly by the Romans.\n\nPerca.\n\nGen. 24. Perca.\n\nJaws unequal, armed with sharp-pointed and incurved teeth; gill-covers consisting of three plates, of which the uppermost is serrated; gill-membrane seven-rayed, the lateral line following the arch of the back; the scales hard and rough; fins spiny; and vent nearer the tail than the head.\n\nFlavialitis.\n\nCommon perch. The second dorsal fin with 16 rays, of a brown olive, sometimes accompanied by a slight gilded tinge on the sides, and commonly marked by five or six broad, blackish, transverse bars. This well-known fish usually measures from ten inches to two feet, and weighs from two to four pounds, though some have weighed eight, nine, or ten pounds. The perch inhabits clear rivers and lakes in most parts of Europe, haunts deep holes in gently flowing rivers, spawns early in spring, is of a gregarious disposition, very voracious, and so tenacious of life, that it may be carried to the distance of 60 miles in dry straw, and yet survive the journey. It feeds on aquatic insects and the smaller fishes, and is preyed on by the pike, eel, &c. Its flesh is firm and delicate, and was held in repute at the table of the ancient Romans. In some of the northern countries a sort of infusions is prepared from the skin.\n\nLucioperca.\n\nSander perch.\u2014The second dorsal fin with 23 rays; of a larger size, and more like a pike than the preceding. Native of clear rivers and lakes in the middle parts of Europe.\n\nCernua.\n\nRuffe perch, or ruffe.\u2014Dorsal fin with 27 rays, of which 15 are spiny. Length from six to eight inches, and shape more slender than that of the common perch. Feeds on worms, insects, and young fishes, and is frequently preyed on by the pike, larger fishes, and aquatic fowls. Spawns in March and April; inhabits clear rivers in many parts of Europe, especially towards the north; and affords excellent food.\n\nPusilla.\n\nSmall perch. Body ovate, compressed, rough. Scarce-ly exceeding the length of an inch and a half. Native of the Mediterranean.\n\nMarina.\n\nSea perch.\u2014The dorsal fin with 15 spiny rays, and 14 soft ones; the body variegated with dusky lines. Colour red, marked with dusky transverse lines on the sides. Inhabits the Northern, Mediterranean, and Atlantic seas, and is in high esteem for the table.\n\nHolocentrus.\n\nHabit of the genus perca; gill-covers scaly, ferrated, and aculeated; scales in most species, hard and rough.\n\nSogo holocentrus.\u2014Silvery red, with longitudinal yellow lines on each side. A highly beautiful species, about a foot in length. Native of the Mediterranean, Thracian, India, and American seas, and considered as an excellent fish for the table.\n\nSpur-gilled holocentrus.\u2014Subargentaceous, with brown calciferous back, large scales, and spurred gill-covers. Native of Japan.\n\nSurinam holocentrus.\u2014Brownish; with yellowish furinaculous clouds, red head, and anterior gill-covers ciliated with menisci. Native of Surinam, where it is reckoned one of the best fishes which the country produces.\n\n26. Bodianus.\n\nHabit of the genus perca; gill-covers scaly, ferrated, and aculeated; scales in most species smooth.\n\nPurple-backed bodian.\u2014Gold yellow, with purple bodianus back. Shape like that of a trout; length about 14 inches. Native of the South American seas.\n\nFive-spined bodian.\u2014Rose-coloured, with silvery abdomen, and dorsal fin yellow on the fore part. Native of the Brazilian seas. Accounted good food.\n\nAya bodian.\u2014Red, with silvery abdomen, single aya, spined gill-covers, and lunated tail. This highly beautiful species is said to grow to the length of three feet. It is found in the Brazilian seas, and regarded as a delicacy.\n\nLarge scaled bodian.\u2014Gray brown, with large round macrolepidotus scales identified at the edges. Length about apidous foot.

Native of the Indian seas.\n\nStar-eyed bodian.\u2014Silvery, with yellowish back, and shellifer; orbits spiny beneath. Native of the seas about the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nGen. 27. Gasterosteus.\n\nHead oblong and smooth, the jaws armed with small teeth; tongue short and obtuse; palate smooth; eyes moderately sized, scarcely prominent, lateral; gill- membrane\nmembrane fix or seven-rayed; gill-cover consisting of two plates, rounded and triated; body at the tail carinated at both sides, and covered with shields, distinct prickles before the dorsal fin; the back and lateral line parallel and straight; the ventral fins behind the pectoral, but above the sternum.\n\n**aculeatus.** *Common stickleback, bunglickle, flarpingle,* &c. with three spines on the back. Length two inches, or three at most. In the early part of summer, the gills and abdomen are of a bright red, the back a fine olive green, and the sides silvery. Lives only two or three years, is very active and very voracious, devouring the young and spawn of other fishes, worms, insects, and their larvae. The stronger inhabitants of the waters shun it on account of its spines; but it is infested by intestinal worms. In April and May it deposits its spawn in small quantities on aquatic plants, especially on the white and yellow water lily. It occurs very commonly in ponds, rivers, and marshes, and in some parts, as about Dantzie and the fens of Lincolnshire in extreme profusion. At Spalding, according to Mr Pennant, they appear in the Welland once in seven or eight years in such amazing floats that they are used as manure, and a man has got for a considerable time four shillings a day by selling them at the rate of a halfpenny per bulbed.\n\n**saltatrix.** *Skipping stickleback.* Eight dorsal spines connected by a membrane. Native of the seas about Carolina, where it is often observed skipping out of the water.\n\n**pungitius.** Smaller or ten-spined stickleback.\u2014Ten dorsal spines. The number of spines is sometimes only nine, and sometimes, though rarely, eleven. This is smaller than the common species, seldom exceeding an inch and three quarters. It is found both in seas and lakes, and enters the mouths of rivers in spring.\n\n**spinachia.** Fifteen-spined stickleback. Fifteen dorsal spines. From five to seven inches long, of a slender form, with the head produced, and somewhat tubular. Frequent shallow places in the European seas, and preys on marine insects, and the spawn and fry of other fishes.\n\n**spinarella.** Minute stickleback.\u2014Four serrulated spines at the hind part of the head; the lateral ones as long as the abdomen. Native of India.\n\nTo the same genus belong *japonicus, carolinus, canadus.*\n\n---\n\n**Gen. 28. SCOMBER.**\n\nHead compressed and smooth; gill-membrane seven-rayed; body smooth, the lateral line carinated behind, often spurious fins towards the tail.\n\n* Spinous finlets distinct.\n\n**Comber.** Common mackerel.\u2014With five finlets. Its ordinary length is from 12 to 16 inches, though it has sometimes been found of a much greater size. Its elegant shape and the beauty of its colouring are too well known to require particular description, and its qualities as an edible fish have been long duly appreciated. It dies very soon after it is taken out of the water, exhibits for a short time a phosphoric light, and partly loses the brilliancy of its hues. It is very voracious, and makes great havoc among the floats of herrings. It dwells in the European and American seas, chiefly affecting the regions within the Arctic circle, and appearing at stated seasons about particular ranges of coast. Its alleged migrations, like those of the herring, begin to be questioned by some acute observers, and it is more probable that it resides at the bottom of the waters during winter at no great distance from the places where it visibly abounds in summer. A film grows over its eye in winter, when it probably conceals itself in muddy bottoms, and becomes torpid. It is very prolific, and deposits its spawn among the rocks about the month of June. The tenderness of its flesh renders it unfit for carriage in a fresh state; but in Cornwall, and several parts of the continent, it is preserved by salting and pickling. Caviar is prepared from the roes on the coasts of the Mediterranean; and the celebrated garum of the Romans is said to have been a condiment prepared from this fish.\n\n**Coly mackerel.** Bright green and azure. Somewhat colias, smaller than the preceding, which it very much resembles. Found on the coasts of Sardinia.\n\n**Bonito mackerel.** Seven inferior finlets; body marked on each side by four black lines. Resembles the tunny, but is more slender. Frequent the Atlantic and tropical seas, persecuting flying fishes and other species, and tormented in turn by internal worms.\n\n**Tunny.** Eight finlets above and below. Usual length thynnus, about two feet, but sometimes grows to eight, or even ten. The upper part of the body is of a dusky blue, and the abdomen silvery. The tunny is gregarious, and inhabits the Mediterranean, Northern, Indian, and American seas, preying with ferocity on all kinds of smaller fish, and persecuting the mackerel and flying fish. The Greeks and Romans admired its flesh, though rather coarse, and established their tunny-fisheries on various parts of the Mediterranean coast, where this species is still taken in great quantities. The smaller fishes are chiefly sold fresh, and the larger cut in pieces and salted.\n\n***Spurious finlets connate.***\n\n**Scad or Horse mackerel.** Dorsal fin recumbent, lateral line marked. Length from 12 to 18 inches. Native of the European seas, and nearly equal to the common kind in point of flavour.\n\nWe forbear to enumerate several other species which have been recently defined, but whose history is still very incomplete, and shall terminate this abridged account of the genus by the\n\n**Pilot mackerel, or pilot fish; gastrophilus duftor of Linn\u00e6us.** Silvery bluefish, with four transverse blue bands; four dorsal spines, and tail barred with black. Length about 18 inches; general shape that of the tunny, but the head much shorter. Inhabits the American and Indian seas, and has its name from often swimming near or before sharks, which, it is said, it guides to its prey.\n\n**Gen. 29. CENTROGASTER.**\n\nHead compressed, smooth; gill-membrane generally seven-rayed; body depressed and smooth; fins spiny; ventral fins united by a membrane, which is furnished with four acute spines and six soft rays.\n\n**Brownish centrogaster.** Brownish, whitish beneath; *fuscocentr.* tail somewhat forked. Native of the Japanese seas.\n\nSilvery.\nSilvery centrogaster.\u2014Silvery, with a large brown spot on the nape, and a blackish one on the dorsal fin. Native of the Japanese seas.\n\nSaddled centrogaster.\u2014Finlets and dorsal fin connate. Native of the Arabian seas.\n\nRhombic centrogaster.\u2014Ventral fins one-rayed. Native of the Red sea.\n\nGen. 30. Mullus.\n\nHead compressed, sloping, covered with scales; eyes oblong, approximated, and vertical, with a nictitating membrane; nostrils small and double; jaws and palate rough, with very small teeth; tongue short, narrow, smooth and motionless; gill-membrane three-rayed; gill covers consisting of three finely striated plates; the aperture moderate; body round, elongated, red, with large and deciduous scales.\n\nRed furmullet.\u2014Two cirri; the body red. Length from 12 to 15 inches; colour a fine rose-red, with an olive tinge on the back, and a silvery hue towards the abdomen. It is found in the Mediterranean and northern seas, is very strong and active, and feeds principally on smaller fishes, worms, and insects. The Roman epicures expended large sums in purchasing this fish for their tables; contemplated, with inhuman pleasure, the changes of its colours, during its slow expiration; and feasted on it with delight, when it was drested with rare and costly sauces.\n\nStriped furmullet.\u2014Two cirri, and light-yellow longitudinal lines. Nearly resembling the preceding, and equally delicate as a food. Inhabits the Mediterranean, and is sometimes found in the Atlantic.\n\nThe other species are japonicus, auriflamma, indicus, bandi, vittatus, trifasciatus, bifasciatus, maculatus, aureovittatus, and imberbis.\n\nGen. 31. Trigla.\n\nHead large, mailed, with rough lines; eyes large, round, and placed near the top of the head; gape wide, palate and jaws set with acute teeth; nostrils double; gill-aperture large; cover consisting of one radiated aculeated plate; gill-membrane seven-rayed; body covered with small scales; back straight, with a longitudinal furrow, fenny on both sides; lateral line near the back, straight, belly thick; ventral and pectoral fins large; at each of the latter free and articulated finger-flaped processes.\n\nMailed gurnard.\u2014Double fingers, snout forked, and elongated; body mailed; length about 12 inches. Native of the Mediterranean.\n\nPiper gurnard.\u2014Triple fingers; nostrils tubular; length from one to two feet; bright rose-red, silvery beneath. Native of the European seas; considered as an excellent fish for the table.\n\nGray gurnard.\u2014Triple fingers; back marked with black and red spots; length of the preceding. Native of the European seas, and not uncommon about our own coasts. Feeds on tefaceous and crustaceous animals, spawns in May and June, and is good eating.\n\nTub fish, or sapphire gurnard.\u2014Triple fingers, lateral line aculeated. Size of the gray gurnard. Native of the European seas. Occasionally springs out of the water to some distance.\n\nFlying gurnard.\u2014Sextuple fingers, connected by a abdominal membrane. A highly singular and beautiful species, which inhabits the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and Indian seas, where it swims in shoals, and frequently flies out of the water to a considerable distance.\n\nThe carolina, alata, minuta, cavillone, punctata, adriatica, pinii, chabrontera, cuculus, luerna, lineata, afatia, and evolans, also belong to this genus.\n\nGen. 32. Trachichthys.\n\nHead rounded in front; eye large; mouth wide, toothless, defending; gill-membrane furnished with eight rays, of which the four lowermost are rough on the edges; scales rough; abdomen mailed with large carnated scales.\n\nSouthern trachichthys.\u2014Mailed abdomen. The whole australis of this curious fish is strongly coated, and of a bright pink ferruginous colour. It is a native of the coasts of New Holland, and is minutely described by Dr Shaw, in his Naturalists Miscellany, and in the fourth volume of his General Zoology; a work from which we have derived much assistance in the compilation of the present article.\n\nIV. ABDOMINAL.\n\nThe fishes of this order have the ventral situated behind the pectoral fins, or on the abdomen. They are mostly inhabitants of the fresh waters.\n\nGen. 1. Cobitis.\n\nHead small, oblong, and scaleless; eye in the upper part of the head; nape flat; gill-membrane from four to six-rayed; gill-covers formed of a single plate, fluctuating close below; body covered with mucus and small deciduous scales, and variegated with bands and spots, almost equal; the tail towards the caudal fin being a little narrowed; back straight, with a fin-like fin; lateral line scarcely visible; vent near the tail, and the tail rounded.\n\nCommon, or bearded loche.\u2014Six beards; head smooth barbatula, and comprimfed. About three inches in length; mouth small, toothless, and placed beneath. Common in clear rivulets in many parts of Europe. Lives on aquatic insects, worms, &c. Spawns in spring, is very prolific, dies very soon after being taken out of the water, and even where placed for any length of time in still water. It is very delicate eating, but quickly loses its fine flavour.\n\nSpiny loche, or the armed loche.\u2014Six beards, a spine tenia, below the eyes. Resembles the preceding, and is found in various parts of Europe, concealing itself below stones, feeding on worms, aquatic insects, and the spawn and fry of fishes. It is about five inches long, is tenacious of life, utters a hissing sound when handled, and is seldom eaten by man.\n\nGreat loche.\u2014Eight beards; a spine above the eye. Solfilis. The largest of the genus, inhabiting large lakes, and marlhes in the midland countries of Europe. Refuges on the approach of stormy weather.\n\nThe other known species are heteroclitia and japonica.\n\nGen. 2.\nGen. 2. Anableps.\n\nHead somewhat depressed; mouth terminal; teeth small, and placed on the jaws; eyes protuberant, with double pupils; gill-membrane fixed-rayed.\n\nFour-eyed anableps. Cobitis anableps of Linn\u00e6us.\u2014Yellowish-gray, with longitudinal black lines on each side. Length from six to eight or ten inches. Its general appearance like that of a loche; but its eyes differ from those of every known fish, each being apparently divided into two distinct eyes, united in a common receptacle; on dissection, however, this observation is found to apply only to the anterior half of the organ. This fish is a native of South America, principally frequenting the rivers of Surinam, near the sea-coasts.\n\nGen. 3. Amia.\n\nHead bony, naked, rough, and furnished with sutures; teeth acute, and close in the jaws and palate; two beards at the nose; gill-membrane twelve-rayed; body scaly.\n\nCarolinian amia.\u2014With a black spot at the tail; small, of a roundish form, and seldom eaten. Inhabits Carolina.\n\nGen. 4. Silurus.\n\nHead naked, large, broad, and compressed; mouth furnished with beards; gape and throat wide; lips thick; jaws dentated; tongue thick, smooth, and very short; eyes small; gill-membrane furnished with from four to fifteen rays; body elongated, compressed, scaleless, covered with viscid slime; lateral line near the back; the first ray of the pectoral fins, or of the dorsal fin, spiny, and dentated backward.\n\nSly, or European silurus.\u2014One soft dorsal fin; five beards. Grows to the length of eight, ten, or even fifteen feet, and to the weight of three hundred pounds; but its ordinary size is from two to three or four feet. It is sluggish, and usually lies half imbedded in the soft bottoms of the rivers which it frequents, with its mouth half-open, moving about its beards, which the smaller fishes mistaking for worms, lay hold of, and are entrapped. It inhabits the larger rivers of Europe, as well as some parts of Asia and Africa, but is in no high estimation as a food.\n\nElectric silurus.\u2014With one adipose dorsal fin, and five beards. About twenty inches long, very broad in the fore-part, depressed, and of a cinereous colour, with some blackish spots towards the tail. Is found in some rivers in Africa, and when struck, gives a galvanic shock, though not so strong as that from the torpedo and gymnusus. It is used as food.\n\nSilurus catfish.\u2014Brown, ash-coloured beneath, with beards longer than the body; forked tail, and eleven rays in the anal fin. The young of this species are excluded in the form of large ova, the integuments of which they soon break, but adhere to the parent till the yolk is consumed. Native of India.\n\nCat silurus.\u2014The hinder dorsal fin adipose; twenty rays in the anal fin, and eight beards. Inhabits the sea and rivers of North America, preying on all kinds of smaller fishes, and not sparing even those of its own kind. Tastes like an eel, and is much relished by the Abdominal Fishes.\n\nThe other species are denominated militaris, bagre, herrsbergii, inermis, galeatus, nodofur, bimaculatus, fuscatus, clarus, quadrimaculatus, erythropterus, bairachus, folilis, vitatus, atheneoides, afolius, mystus, anguillaris, undecimalis, cornutus, felis, cous, carinatus, docmac, chienis, and bajad.\n\nGen. 5. Platystacus.\n\nHabit of silurus; mouth beneath, bearded with cirri; body scaleless, depressed; tail long, compressed.\n\nAcetabulated platystacus. Silurus asprodo of Linn\u00e6us. cotylepo\u2014Grows to the length of a foot or more, has a very un-rus- couth appearance, and is remarkable for the many small acetabular processses, or suckers, with which the body is beset. Native of the Indian seas and rivers.\n\nSmooth platystacus.\u2014Eight beards, and plain abdo-levis. men. Very like the preceding, but wants the abdominal suckers.\n\nWarted platystacus.\u2014Brown, marked above by lon-verrucitudinal warted lines, with short anal fin. Smaller, fus. and less elongated than the two preceding. Native of the Indian seas.\n\nEel-shaped platystacus.\u2014Brown, with longitudinal anguilla-white stripes, and the second dorsal, anal, and caudal ris. fin united. Length twelve or fifteen inches. Native of the Indian seas.\n\nGen. 6. Loricaria.\n\nHead smooth, depressed; mouth without teeth, and retractile; gill-membrane six-rayed; body covered with a hard crust.\n\nRibbed loricaria. Silurus cyphatus of Linn\u00e6us.\u2014Yel-cyphata, lowlith brown, mailed with a single row of shields on each side; tail forked. This is a species of great strength and boldness, which inflicts very painful and dangerous wounds with its spines. It is a native of the Indian and American seas.\n\nArmed loricaria.\u2014One dorsal fin, two beards; length cata-about ten or twelve inches. Much allied to the pre-phraa, ceding, but has a rounded tail. Native of the American seas.\n\nSoldier loricaria. Silurus callichthys of Linn\u00e6us.\u2014callich-Brown; with depressed rounded head, double row of thys. scales on each side, and rounded tail. Native of South America, where it is in considerable esteem as a food.\n\nSpeckled loricaria.\u2014Yellow, with brownish back; punctata, double row of scales on each side; fins speckled with black; and forked tail. Only five or six inches long, but very elegant. Native of the rivers of Surinam.\n\nToothed loricaria.\u2014Lengthened; yellowish brown; dentata. with toothed, bearded mouth, and slightly pointed snout. Native of the Indian seas.\n\nYellowloricaria. Loricaria plecostomus of Linn\u00e6us.\u2014flava. Yellow, spotted with brown; two dorsal fins; and tail marked by transverse bands. Native of the Indian seas.\n\nGen. 7. Salmo.\n\nHead smooth and compressed; mouth large; lips small; tongue white, cartilaginous, and moveable; eyes middle-sized; lateral teeth in the jaws and tongue; gill-membrane furnished with four to ten rays; gill-\ncover consisting of three plates; body elongated, covered with round scales minutely striated; back straight; lateral line straight, and near the back; hinder dorsal fin adipose; ventral fins many-rayed.\n\nMost of the fishes of this genus frequent pure and rapid streams, a few of them inhabit the sea, but enter rivers for the purpose of depositing their spawn in spring, and return to the sea in autumn. They feed on insects and other fishes, and their flesh is much relished as a food. We shall confine our notices to a few of the most important and remarkable species.\n\nCommon salmon.\u2014The upper jaw projecting beyond the under. The general length of the salmon is from two and a half to three feet; but is said to be sometimes found the length of six feet, and Mr Pennant mentions one of 74 pounds weight as the largest he ever heard of. The general colour of both sexes is a silvery gray, of a much darker cast on the back; the sides of the male are marked with many small, dusky and copper-coloured spots, while the markings on the female are larger, more distant, and roundish, or ovalated. The male is also of a more slender form than the female. This fish, which is so highly esteemed for the delicacy of its flavour, and which forms such an important article of commerce, occurs chiefly in the fast and fresh waters of the northern regions, being unknown in the Mediterranean and other warm climates; but frequenting some of the rivers in France, which empty themselves into the ocean, and being found as far north as Greenland and the northern parts of North America. It quits the sea at certain periods to deposit its spawn in the gravelly beds of rivers, often ascending to a great distance from their mouths, forcing itself against the most rapid streams, and leaping with surprising agility over cataracts of considerable height. On the river Liffey, the salmon are often observed to fall back before they surmount the cataract, which is 19 feet high; and baskets are placed near the edge of the stream to catch them in their fall. At the falls of Kilmorack in Scotland, where the salmon are very numerous, the country people are accustomed to lay branches of trees on the edge of the rocks, and thus intercept such of the fish as miss their leap. Alongside one of these falls the late Lord Lovat ordered a kettle full of water to be placed over a fire, and many minutes had not elapsed before a large salmon made a false leap and fell into it. When the salmon enter the fresh water in winter, they are more or less infected with the salmon-louse, (Lernaea salmonae Lin.) and are then reckoned to be in high season. These infects, however, soon die and drop off, and the fish becomes lean at spawning time. The male and female unite in forming a receptacle in the sand or gravel, about 18 inches deep, for the ova, and having covered up the latter, which are not hatched till the ensuing spring, hasten to the fast water much emaciated, and soon recover their plumpness. The fry appear about the end of March, and are five or six inches in length, in the beginning of May, when they are called salmon fry or smolts. The first flood sweeps them in immense swarms into the sea. About the middle of June, the largest of these begin to return into the rivers. Towards the end of July, they are called grilse, and weigh from six to nine pounds. Their food is other fish, insects, and worms; but as no food is found in their stomach during spawning time, it is probable that they neglect it during that season. The fishing season commences in the Tweed on the 30th of November, and ends about old Michaelmas day. A particular account of this fishery occurs in the third volume of Pennant's British Zoology, to which we beg leave to refer our readers.\u2014A person of the name of Graham (says Mr Bingley), who farms the sea-coast fishery at Whitehaven, has adopted a successful mode of taking salmon, which he has appropriately denominated salmon-hunting. When the tide is out, and the fish are left in shallow waters, intercepted by sand banks, near the mouth of the river; or when they are found in any inlets up the shore, where the water is not more than from one foot to four feet in depth, the place where they lie is to be discovered by their agitation of the pool. This man, armed with a three-pointed barbed spear, with a shaft of 15 feet in length, mounts his horse, and plunges, at a swift trot, or moderate gallop, belly deep, into the water. He makes ready his spear with both hands; when he overtakes the salmon, he lets go one hand, and with the other strikes the spear, with almost unerring aim, into the fish; this done, by a turn of the hand he raises the salmon to the surface of the water, turns his horse head to the shore, and runs the salmon on dry land without dismounting. This man says, that by the present mode he can kill from 40 to 50 in a day; ten are however no despicable day's work for a man and horse. His father was probably the first man that ever adopted this method of killing salmon on horseback.\"\u2014In the intestinal canal of salmon is often found a species of taenia, about three feet in length; and Dr Bloch mentions, that in a specimen which had been three weeks dead, he found one of these worms still living.\n\nGray salmon, or gray.\u2014With ash-colored spots, the eriox, extreme part of the tail equal. Weighs from 13 to 20 pounds. The head is larger in proportion than in the preceding species; it is a strong fish, and does not ascend the fresh water till August, when it rushes up with great violence, and is seldom taken.\n\nSalmon trout, sea trout, or bull trout.\u2014Marked with trufa, black ocellated spots, the middle brownish, fix dots on the pectoral fins. The general appearance very like the common salmon, but seldom equal to it in size. Like the salmon, it inhabits the European seas, passing into rivers to deposit its spawn. Its flesh, too, is of equal delicacy. The viscid mucus which covers the skin possesses the quality of exhibiting phosphoric light.\n\nCommon trout.\u2014With red spots, the lower jaw rather longer than the upper. The general length of this species is from 12 to 15 or 16 inches; the ground colour yellowish gray, darker on the back, and marked on the sides by several straggling, round, bright-red spots, each surrounded by a tinge of pale blue gray. The colouring however, is subject to considerable variety. The trout is a common inhabitant of European streams and lakes, preferring those that are clear and cold, living on worms, small fishes, and aquatic insects and their larvae. Like the salmon, it occasionally springs over obstacles in its course. It usually spawns in September, or October. Those which are in most request for the table, are natives of the clearest waters.\u2014The gillaroo trouts which are found in the lakes of Galway, in Ireland, are not specifically different from the common, but their stomachs acquire an extraordinary degree\nAbdominal gree of thickness and muscular force, a circumstance which is ascribed to their living much on shell-fish, and swallowing small stones.\n\n**Ichthyology**\n\n**Gen. 8. Acanthonotus.**\nBody elongated, without dorsal fin. Several spines on the back and abdomen.\n\n**Snouted acanthonotus.**\u2014Gray, with the back trans-nasus, verily barred with brown. The only known species of this genus. The specimen described by Bloch measured two feet and a half. Native of the Indian seas.\n\n**Gen. 9. Fistularia.**\nFistularia.\n\nSnout cylindrical, with jaws at the apex; gill membrane seven-rayed.\n\n**Slender fistularia, or tobacco-pipe fish.**\u2014Tail bifid and tabacaria, fetiferous. Length three or four feet, shape resembling that of an eel; the head about nine inches long, from the eyes to the tip of the mouth. From the middle of the curvature of the tail, proceeds a very long and thickish brittle, like whalebone, which gradually tapers to a very fine point. The spine of this singular fish is also of a very peculiar structure, the first vertebra being of moderate length, the three next much shorter, and the rest gradually decreasing as they approach the tail. It infests its long fin into the hollows of rocks, under stones, &c., to lay hold on the smaller fishes, worms, and sea insects on which it chiefly feeds. Inhabits America and Japan, and is edible.\n\n**Chinese fistularia, or chinese trumpet fish.**\u2014Simple chinensis, rounded tail. Body thicker in proportion than in the preceding species. Native of the Indian seas, though its fossil imprints have been found under the volcanic strata of Monte Boka, near Verona.\n\n**Paradoxical fistularia.**\u2014Finely reticulated, with paradoxes, slightly prominent lines, and lanceolate tail. Length from two to four inches, body angular, and the whole fish bearing a close resemblance to a Syngnathus. Native of the Indian seas.\n\n**Gen. 10. Esox.**\nEsox.\n\nHead somewhat flat above; mouth and gullet wide; jaws dentated, unequal; the upper plane, under punctured; tongue broad and loose; palate smooth; eyes round, middle fixed, and lateral; nostrils double; near the eyes rays; body elongated, covered with hard scales, convex above, compressed at the sides; lateral line straight, nearest the back, scarcely conspicuous; dorsal and anal fins very short and opposite.\n\n**Sea-pike, or spit-fish.**\u2014Two dorsal fins, the anterior sphyraena; spiny. Of a filvery bluish colour, dusky on the back, and slightly tinged with yellow on the head and about the gills. Grows to the length of nearly two feet. Inhabits the Mediterranean and Atlantic; and has somewhat the flavour of the cod.\n\n**Bony-scaled pike.**\u2014Upper jaw the longest, scales bony, offcut. This last character gives it a veryingular appearance. It attains to the length of three to four feet, inhabits the American lakes and rivers, is very voracious, and is an excellent fish for the table.\n\n**Common pike or pickerel.**\u2014Snout depressed, and nearly lucius; equal. Head very flat; the teeth very sharp and numerous, being disposed not only in front of the upper jaw,\nAbdominal jaw, but in both sides of the lower, in the roof of the mouth, and often on the tongue, amounting to at least 700. The ordinary colour of this fish is pale olive gray, deepening on the back, and marked on the sides by several yellowish spots; the abdomen is white, slightly spotted with black. According to Pennant, the largest specimen of English growth weighed 35 pounds. Those of Lapland sometimes measure eight feet. It is a proverbially voracious species. \"We have known one,\" says Mr Pennant, \"that was choked by attempting to swallow one of its own species that proved too large a morsel. Yet its jaws are very loosely connected, and have on each side an additional bone like the jaw of a viper, which renders them capable of greater dilatation when it swallows its prey. It does not confine itself to feed on fish and frogs; it will devour the water rat, and draw down the young ducks as they are swimming about.\n\nIn a manuscript note, which we found, p. 244, of our copy of Plutarch's History of Staffordshire, is the following extraordinary fact: \"At Lord Gower's canal at Trentham, a pike seized the head of a swan as she was feeding under water, and gorged so much of it as killed them both. The servants perceiving the swan with its head under water for a longer time than usual, took the boat, and found both swan and pike dead.\"\u2014The smaller fishes manifest the same uneasiness and horror at the presence of the pike, as little birds at the sight of the hawk or owl. If we may credit some naturalists of name, the longevity of the pike is not less remarkable than its voracity. Rzaezynski, in his Natural History of Poland, tells us of one that was 90 years old; but Geber relates, that in the year 1497, one was taken near Hallburn, in Swabia, with a brazen ring affixed to it, on which were these words in Greek characters: \"I am the fish which was first of all put into this lake by the hands of the Governor of the Universe, Frederick the Second, the 5th of October 1230.\"\u2014The pike spawns in March and April, and is said to be of very quick growth.\n\nGar-pike, gar-fish, or horn-fish.\u2014Both jaws subulated. General length from two to three feet, the body slender, and the belly flat. The back is of a very fine green, beneath which is a rich changeable blue and purple cast, while the sides and belly are of a bright silver colour. The jaws are very long and slender, and the edges of both are armed with numerous short slender teeth. Native of the European seas, arriving in shoals on the British coasts, preceding the mackerel. The spine and bones acquire a green colour by boiling, notwithstanding which it is eaten with perfect safety.\n\nThe other species are barracuda, vulpes, malabaricus, synodus, hepsetus, argenteus, gymnocephalus, brahminis, chlorocentrus, chinensis, auroraviridis, beccuna, fuscus, cepedianus, chilenis, viridis, and flomias.\n\nGen. 11. POLYPTERUS.\n\nNilotic polypterus.\u2014Green, with the abdomen spotted with black. Of a long and serpentine shape, the body being nearly cylindrical, and covered with strong and adhering scales. The pectoral and ventral fins are attached by a scaly base; and the dorsal, to the number of 16, 17, or 18, and of an ovate shape, run along the whole length of the back. Native of the Nile, and one of the best fishes which that river produces, but very rare. The Egyptians call it bichir.\n\nGen. 12. ELOPS.\n\nHead smooth; numerous small teeth in the margin of the jaw and in the palate; gill-membrane with 30 rays, and armed in the middle externally with five teeth.\n\nSauria elops, great saury, sein-fish, or sea gally-wasp, saurus.\u2014The tail armed above and below with a spine. About 14 inches long, and has some resemblance to a salmon, but wants the adipose fin. Native of the American seas.\n\nGen. 13. ARGENTINA.\n\nTeeth in the jaws and tongue; gill-membrane eight-rayed; vent near the tail; ventral fins with many rays.\n\nPearl-bladdered argentine.\u2014Anal fin nine-rayed, Asphyrena, small brilliant fish, inhabiting the Mediterranean, and affording, by its air-bladder and scales, some of the best kind of silvery matter used in the preparation of artificial pearls.\n\nThe other species are gloffodonta, carolina, and machnata.\n\nGen. 14. AITHERINA.\n\nThe upper jaw somewhat flat; gill-membrane six-rayed, a silvery stripe along the side.\n\nMediterranean atherine.\u2014About 12 rays in the anal bepetus, fin. An elegant species, of the length of six or seven inches, and shaped like a mulet. Native of the Mediterranean and Red seas. Also found on the coast of Southampton, where they are often called by the name of muds.\n\nTo the same genus belong menidia, shama, japonica, brofonii, and pinguis.\n\nGen. 15. MUGIL.\n\nLips membranaceous, the under one carinated within; no teeth, but a denticle above the opening of the mouth; gill-membrane 7-rayed; gill-covers smooth, rounded; body whitish.\n\nMullet, or common mullet.\u2014Five rays in the first cephalus, dorsal fin.\u2014Length from 12 to 16 inches; colour bluish gray, darker on the back, and silvery on the abdomen. Very common in the Mediterranean and northern seas, chiefly haunting the shallows near the shores, and feeding on marine worms, insects, and plants. It likewise occurs in the Indian and Atlantic oceans. In the spring and early summer months, it ascends rivers. The roe is often prepared into an inferior kind of caviar, called botarga; and the fish itself, though not fashionable in our own country, is reckoned excellent for the table. In plentiful seasons, it is dried and salted.\n\nThe other species are crenilabris, albulia, malabaricus, tang, plumieri, ceruleomaculatus, chilenis, and chanos.\n\nGen. 16. EXOCETUS.\n\nHead scaly, no teeth; jaws convex on both sides; gill-membrane ten-rayed; body whitish, belly angulated; pectoral fins very long, adapted to flying; the rays carinated before.\nAbdominal Oceanic flying fish.\u2014Abdomen carinated on both sides. Of a bright silver colour, gradually deepening into purplish brown on the back; the pectoral fins dusky, the dorsal and anal yellowish, and the ventral fins and tail reddish. It is a native of the American and Indian seas, but is occasionally observed in the Mediterranean; and Pennant mentions an instance of its being seen about the British coasts. The largeness of the air-bladder, and the peculiar structure of the mouth, which can be closed while the jaws are open, assist its power of flight.\n\nMediterranean flying fish.\u2014The ventral fins reaching to the tail. The general length of this species is from 12 to 15 or 16 inches; and its general shape is not unlike that of a herring, to which it is also compared as an edible fish. It is of a bright silvery cast, with a blue or dusky tinge on the upper part. It is frequently observed in the Mediterranean and Atlantic, sometimes singly, and sometimes in shoals. During the decline of its flight, it sometimes falls into ships; the height, however, at which it generally exercises its flight, is about three feet above the surface of the water. From the length and size of the pectoral fins, it is enabled to continue this motion through the air to the distance of 200 or 300 feet, when the fins becoming dry, it is again obliged to have recourse to the water. Here it is persecuted by the dorado, bonito, dolphin, and other predacious fishes, while, in its aerial career, it is equally harried by the gull and the albatross.\n\nAmerican flying fish.\u2014Silvery bluish, with the ventral fins situated on the middle of the abdomen. Native of the Atlantic ocean.\n\nCommerfordii.\u2014With a dark blue spot on the dorsal fin. Native of the Indian seas.\n\nGen. 17. Polynemus.\n\nHead compressed and scaly; snout very obtuse and prominent; gill-membrane with five or seven rays, separate finger-like processes at the pectoral fins.\n\nParadise polyneme, the fish of Paradise, or mango fish.\u2014Seven fingers, and forked tail. Grows to the length of about 12 or 15 inches, and the thoracic filaments are very long, the outer ones often extending beyond the tail, and the others gradually shortening. It inhabits the Indian seas, and is reckoned by much the most delicate fish at Calcutta.\n\nPlebeian polyneme.\u2014Five fingers, the first reaching beyond the vent, the others gradually shorter. Resembles a mullet, except that the head is much blunted. It sometimes measures upwards of four feet, is a native of the Indian and American seas, and is considered as an excellent fish for the table.\n\nQuingarius, niloticus, decadactylus, indicus, tetradactylus, virginicus, commerfordii, and plumieri, compose the rest of the genus.\n\nGen. 18. Clupea.\n\nHead compressed; mouth compressed, and denticulated within; jaws unequal, the upper furnished with serrated side-plates; tongue short, rough, with teeth turned inwards; eyes middle-sized, round and marginal; gills internally fleshy, their covers consisting of three or four plates, the membranes eight-rayed; body compressed, elongated, covered with scales, lateral line straight, near and parallel to the back; under part of the abdomen forming a serrated ridge; ventral fins often with nine rays, caudal long and forked.\n\nHerring.\u2014Without spots; the under jaw the long-barengust. In size, this well-known fish is found to vary very considerably, though the general length may be reckoned from 10 to 12 or 13 inches. The back is of a dusky blue or greenish, and in the recent or living fish, the gill-covers are marked by a reddish or violet-coloured spot. The scales are rather large, and adhere tightly. The fins are rather small, and the tail is much forked. In most specimens, the anal fin has 17 rays. The herring inhabits the northern seas of Europe, and the Atlantic ocean, and is seldom found farther south than the coast of France. Its food principally consists of small fishes, sea worms, and a minute species of crab, cancer halieum, which abounds in the Norwegian seas. When it has fed on this last, its intestines are filled with the red ova of the insect, and is unfit for being salted. At spawning time its stomach is always empty, which seems to indicate that, like the salmon, and some other fishes, it is, at that season, quite negligent of food. Herrings spawn at different seasons, some in spring, some in summer, and some in autumn, when they approach our shores in immense shoals. But the reality of their long and periodical migrations is by no means ascertained. On the contrary, it is more probable, that, like the mackerel, they pass the winter in deep water, or in the soft mud at the bottom, at no very great distance from the shores. They are, in fact, found about some of the European coasts at almost every season of the year; and the alleged rapidity of their northern voyages greatly exceeds the swiftest progress of which they are capable. They are the chiefest prey of several of the cetaceous tribe of animals, of various fishes, and of different sorts of sea fowl, particularly of the gannet, or solan goose. Notwithstanding the great importance of this fish to the inhabitants of modern Europe, we find no certain description of it in any of the Greek or Roman writers. The Dutch engaged in the herring-fishery in 1164, and the discovery of the pickling process is ascribed to William Beukelen, of Biervlet, near Sluyss. He died in 1397; and Charles V., in honour of his memory, paid a solemn visit to his tomb.\n\nPilchard.\u2014Silvery, with dusky back, and large pilchardus strongly adherent scales. Very like the preceding, but smaller and thicker, with larger scales, and the dorsal fin placed exactly in the centre of gravity. Very frequent on some of the European coasts. Usually visits the shores of Cornwall in vast shoals, about the middle of July, and disappears on the commencement of winter. On the 5th of October, 1767, there were included in St Ives' Bay 7000 hogheads, each of which contained 35,000 fish, in all 24 millions.\n\nSprat.\u2014With 16 or 17 rays in the dorsal fin. Asprattus, very small species, like the fry of herring; but it has a strongly serrated abdomen, and only 48 vertebrae in the back-bone, whereas the herring has 56. Inhabits the northern and Mediterranean seas, and approaches the shores in countless swarms, in autumn.\n\nShad.\u2014Black spots on the sides, the snout bifid. In alofa, general appearance resembles the pilchard; but is much larger.\nAbdominal larger, and much thinner in proportion. Native of the Mediterranean and northern seas. In spring, it ascends rivers for the purpose of depositing its spawn. Like the herring, it dies almost immediately on being taken out of the water. Though prepared for the table in many countries, it is rather coarse and insipid.\n\n**Anchovy.**\u2014The upper jaw longest. Usual length from three to four inches, of a somewhat lengthened form, and covered with large, thin, and easily deciduous scales. Native of the Mediterranean, northern, and Atlantic seas. Spawns from December to March. It is in great request as a pickle, the bones dissolving entirely in boiling. The principal anchovy fishery is about the small island of Gorgona, near Leghorn.\n\nThe remaining species are malabarica, africana, fennisi, thrissa, gigantea, atherinoides, setirostris, dorab, tuberculata, chrysoptera, fasciata, nasus, macrocephala, and tropica.\n\n**Cyprinus.**\n\nGen. 19. Cyprinus.\n\nWithout teeth; mouth in the apex of the head, and bifurcated; gill-membrane three-rayed; body smooth and whitish; ventral fins generally nine-rayed.\n\nMost of the cyprini inhabit the fresh waters, and are much esteemed as food. They live on clay, mould, worms, insects, and leguminous and aquatic plants, though some of them also prey on other fishes. Most of them spawn in April or May.\n\n**Barbel.**\u2014Anal fin seven-rayed, four beards; second ray of the dorsal fin serrated on both sides. Has somewhat the habit of a pike, and is usually found in deep and rapid rivers in most of the middle and southern parts of Europe. It is easily distinguished by its two pair of long and unequal beards. Its ordinary length is from 18 inches to two feet. Though capable of swimming with strength and rapidity, it sometimes allows itself to be taken by the hand by divers employed for the purpose. It is a coarse fish; and the roe is said to operate as an emetic and cathartic.\n\n**Carp.**\u2014Anal fin nine-rayed, four beards, the second ray of the dorsal fin serrated behind. The most common colour of this species is a yellowish olive, much deeper on the back, with a gilded tint on the side. In our own country it measures from 12 to 16 inches in length; but in warmer climates attains to a much larger size, and sometimes weighs from 20 to 40 pounds. It feeds chiefly on worms and water insects, and frequents the lakes and small rivers in the southern parts of Europe, usually decreasing in size the farther it is removed into a northern region. It is very tenacious of life, and may be kept for a considerable time in any damp place, though not immersed in water; and well authenticated instances are quoted of its attaining to the age of more than a century. It is said to have been introduced into England about the year 1514. In Germany and Poland, it is cultivated as a considerable article of commerce. A carp of three pounds weight will produce 237,000 ova, and one of nine pounds, 621,600. A green pigment is obtained from its bile, and inflats from its air-bladder. It is reckoned one of the most delicate of fresh-water fishes. A variety occurs in some parts of Germany, with very large scales, and termed by Bloch rex cyprinorum.\n\n**Gudgeon.**\u2014Anal fin eleven-rayed, two beards. General length from four to five or six inches; the body short and somewhat cylindrical, for the most part of a pale olive brown above, the sides silvery, and the abdomen white. This is a very prolific species, and deposits its spawn, at intervals, in the spring. Inhabits small lakes and gently flowing rivers in most parts of Europe, and is particularly abundant in some parts of Germany, especially in autumn. In request for the table.\n\n**Tench.**\u2014Anal fin with 25 rays; tail entire; body linea, flimy; two beards. The ordinary length of the tench is about 12 or 14 inches; but it varies considerably both in size and colour, according to its situation. It resides in stagnant waters with muddy bottoms, in most parts of the globe, deposits its minute greenish ova in May and June, is very prolific, of quick growth, and is supposed by some to hibernate in the mud of the waters which it inhabits. It is reputed a delicate fish for the table. In Mr Daniel's Rural Sports, we find the following remarkable passage. \"A piece of water, at Thornville Royal, Yorkshire, which had been ordered to be filled up, and wherein wood, rubbish, &c. had been thrown for years, was, in November, 1801, directed to be cleared out. Perfoms were accordingly employed, and, almost choked up by weeds and mud, so little water remained, that no person expected to see any fish, except a few eels; yet nearly 200 brace of tench, of all sizes, and as many perch were found. After the pond was thought to be quite free, under some roots there seemed to be an animal, which was conjectured to be an otter; the place was surrounded, and on opening an entrance among the roots, a tench was found of a most singular form, having literally assumed the shape of the hole, in which he had of course for many years been confined. His length from fork to eye, was two feet nine inches; his circumference, almost to the tail, was two feet three inches; his weight 11 pounds, nine ounces and a quarter: the colour was also singular, his belly being that of a char, or a vermilion. This extraordinary fish, after having been inspected by many gentlemen, was carefully put into a pond; but, either from confinement, age, or bulk, it at first merely floated, and at last, with difficulty, swam gently away. It is now alive and well.\"\n\n**Grufian.**\u2014Anal fin ten-rayed, lateral line straight. Length from eight to ten inches; shape very deep, with considerable thickness; colour deep olive yellow, with a silvery tint on the abdomen. Inhabits ponds and large stagnant waters in many parts of Europe. Grows slowly, and is much infested by the terneae cyprinaceae. Spawns but once in two years, and is in considerable esteem as an eatable fish.\n\n**Golden carp, or gold fish.**\u2014Two anal fins, the caudal tranverse and forked. This favourite ornament of our houses and gardens, is a native of the southern parts of China, and exists in its natural state in a large lake in the province of Kiang, whence it has been diffused over the country, and cherished with fondness and attention. It is said to have been first introduced into England in 1691. In its domestic state, it is subject to very considerable variations in colour, form, and even number of fins. It may be fed with fine bread crumbs, small worms, water-snails, yolk of eggs dried and powdered, &c. and should be supplied with a frequent change of water.\n\n**Minnow.**\nAbdominal Minow.\u2014Anal fin eight-rayed; a brown spot at the tail; body transparent. A small, but elegant and familiar species, frequenting the small gravelly streams in many parts of Europe and Siberia. In our own country it appears first in March, and disappears about the beginning of October, when it secrets itself in the mud. It is gregarious, and fond of warmth, often swimming in pools near the surface of the water, in clear hot weather. It feeds on herbs and worms, is very prolific, and of a delicate flavour, though seldom prepared for the table, on account of its smallness. It is more frequently used as bait for other fishes.\n\nDace, or dare.\u2014Eighteen rays in the anal, and nine in the dorsal fin. Length from six to eight or ten inches. In manners, allied to the roach, and inhabits lakes and rivers in many parts of Europe. Little esteemed for the table.\n\nRoach.\u2014Anal fin with 12 rays; ventral rays of a blood-red colour. Silvery, with a cast of dull yellow, more dusky on the upper parts; fins red. Frequent deep, still, and clear rivers in most of the middle parts of Europe, often appearing in large shoals, preceded by one or more, apparently stationed as a kind of guard. It spawns about the middle of May, and is very prolific. It usually weighs about a pound, or a pound and a half. Its flesh is white, firm, and well tasted, but not held in any great repute.\n\nOrf.\u2014Thirteen rays in the anal fin. Length from 10 to 12 inches, or more. Resembles the gold-fish, and kept in small ponds on account of its beautiful appearance. Native of many parts of Germany, Russia, &c.\n\nRud.\u2014Anal fin with 15 rays; fins red. About 8 or 10 inches long. Native of several parts of Europe, in lakes and rivers with a gravelly bottom. Reputed edible, and in season in summer.\n\nChub.\u2014Fourteen rays in the anal fin; snout rounded. Resembles the tench, but has a more lengthened form, and a thicker head in proportion. Ordinary length from 14 to 18 inches. Native of many parts of Europe, and not uncommon in Great Britain, occurring chiefly in clear and rapid rivers. Rather coarse and unpalatable, and apt to acquire a yellow colour in boiling.\n\nBleak.\u2014Twenty rays in the anal fin. Length five or six inches; shape slender; colour bright silvery. From its scales is prepared the silvery matter used in the manufacture of artificial pearls.\n\nBream.\u2014Twenty-seven rays in the anal fin; the fins brown. Of a very broad or deep shape, and from two feet to two and a half long. Of an olive hue, with a pale or flesh-coloured tinge on the under parts. Inhabits the lakes and rivers of many parts of Europe. As an article of food, it is reckoned rather coarse and inferior.\n\nBesides the above, this genus likewise comprehends the rondeletii, gibelo, blacea, ballerus, pomeranicus, fimbriatus, cirrhosus, fulcatus, americanus, bicornis, farenus, griffagene, hygini, bulatmae, capaxa, caucus, malchus, julus, buphilalmus, quadrilobus, tincereus, ferrugineus, nigro-auratus, viridi-violaceus, punctatus, amarus, feroces, capito, cultratus, cephalus, afipius, idus, nafus, ferta, dobula, lanceolatus, murja, regius, labo, lepocephalus, cataphractus, galan, clupeoides, gonorynchus, aphyo, and rivularis.\n\nGen. 20. Mormyrus.\n\nSnout produced; mouth terminal; teeth several, and emarginated; aperture without gill-cover; gill-membrane single-rayed; body falcate.\n\nIn consequence of Geoffroy's recent investigations, this hitherto obscure genus is ranked in the abdominal order; and the number of species has been increased from three to nine. They are all natives of the Nile.\n\nAnguilliform mormyrus, has a sharp snout, equal anguilliform jaws, 26 rays in the dorsal fin, and a bifid acute lepidot tail.\n\nThe other species are kannume, oxyrynchus, salahia, bebe, herle, cyprinoides, ban\u00e9, and hasselquifti.\n\nV. CARTILAGINOUS.\n\nThe fishes of this order have their fins furnished with cartilaginous rays. Their lungs are more similar to the gills of fishes than to the pulmonary system of the mammalia and amphibia; and in some of the genera are found both lungs and gills.\n\nGen. 1. Ostracion.\n\nTeeth pointing forward; body mailed by a bony covering.\n\nTriquetral or three-sided trunk-fish.\u2014Body triangular, far and unarmed. This species is of a trigonal shape, measures about 12 inches in length, and except to within a small distance from the tail, is completely enveloped in a bony covering, divided into hexagonal spaces. Its prevailing colour is brown, with a white spot in the centre of each hexagon, which is also marked by fine rays diverging from the centre to the edges. Native of the Indian and American seas, and highly esteemed as an eatable fish among the East Indians.\n\nThe generic characters of the trunk-fishes are readily recognised; but the specific marks are not easily ascertained. Dr Shaw enumerates, in addition to the preceding, trigonus, biaculeatus, cornutus, tricornis, quadricornis, turritus, concretatus, nefus, cubicus, meleagris, auritus, striatus, tuberculatus, and gibbosus.\n\nGen. 2. Tetradon.\n\nJaws bony, divided at the tip; body roughened beneath; no ventral fins.\n\nThe fishes of this genus, like the diodon, have the power of inflating their body at pleasure, by means of an internal membrane for that purpose; and during the time of inflation, the small spines dispersed over their sides and abdomen are raised in such a manner as to operate as a defence against their enemies. They are chiefly natives of the tropical seas, though sometimes seen in the higher northern and southern latitudes, and are supposed to live principally on the crustaceous and teflaceous animals.\n\nElectric tetradon.\u2014Body brown above, yellow on the electricus, sides, sea green beneath, and varied with red, green, and white spots. Length seven or eight inches. Inhabits rocky places among the corals, in the Indian and American seas; and, when touched, affects the hand with a galvanic shock.\n\nOccultated\n**Ichthyology**\n\n**Gen. 3. Diodon.**\nJaws bony, undivided; body beset with moveable spines.\n\n*Porcupine diodon.*\u2014Of a spherical form, with triangular spines. Of a considerable size, sometimes measuring two feet in length. It possesses the power of inflating and contracting itself at pleasure, remarkable instances of which property it is said to exhibit when taken with a line and hook. Its flesh is coarse, though sometimes eaten by the inhabitants of the West-Indian islands.\n\n*Oblong diodon.*\u2014With round spines. Nearly allied to the preceding, and considered as poisonous.\n\nThe remaining species are denominated *orbicularis*, *plumieri*, and *lituratus*.\n\n**Gen. 4. Cephalus.**\nJaws bony; body terminating abruptly, so as to resemble the head of a fish.\n\n*Short jun-fish,* or *short diodon.* Tetrodon mola of Linnaeus.\u2014Body suborbicular, very short and broad, terminating abruptly on the hind part, where it is edged by a shallow fin. The general colour brown, with a silvery cast on the sides and abdomen. Native of the northern seas, where it sometimes arrives at the length of eight or even ten feet, and to the weight of 500 pounds. Also a native of the Atlantic and Ethiopian sea. It is said to exhibit a strong phosphoric light during the night. The oblong is probably only a variety of this species, as La C\u00e9p\u00e9de has observed intermediate gradations between the two. The variegated is distinguished by whitish undulations and spots; and the pallidus by its silvery hue, brownish back, and spiny carinated abdomen.\n\n**Gen. 5. Syngnathus.**\nSnout tubeylindrical, with terminal mouth; body lengthened, jointed, and mailed; no ventral fins.\n\n*Great pipe-fish,* or *longer pipe-fish.*\u2014Caudal, anal, and pectoral fins radiated; body hexangular. Generally from twelve to fifteen inches long, but sometimes from two to three feet; of a very slender form, and of a pale yellowish brown colour, with broad alternate zones of a deeper brown. In spring, as in others of this genus, the ova appear in an appropriate channel at the lower part of the abdomen, and the young are excluded from them completely formed. Native of the European seas. The typhle, or smaller pipe-fish, seems to be only a variety.\n\n*Sea-horse,* or *sea-horse pipe-fish.*\u2014Tail quadrangular, without a terminating fin; body heptangular and tuberculated. General length from six to ten inches; body much compressed; colour greenish brown, varied with darker and lighter specks. In its living state, the head and tail are carried nearly straight, but when dry or contracted, it resembles the skeleton of a horse. It is a native of the Mediterranean, northern, and Atlantic seas.\n\n*Foliated pipe-fish.*\u2014Blackish olive, with white specks, foliatus, and leaf-shaped appendages. These last are situated on very strong, rough, square spines or processes attached to the back, tail, and abdomen, and give the whole animal a very grotesque and anomalous appearance. This curious species is a native of the Indian seas; but nothing particular seems to be known relative to its habits or natural history.\n\nThe ophidion, biaculeatus, pelagicus, arquoreus, and barbarus, require no particular description.\n\n**Gen. 6. Pegasus.**\nMouth beneath, with a retractile proboscis; upper jaw elongated, denticulated, ensiform under the snout and linear; gill-aperture fimple, placed before the pectoral fins; body compressed, articulated with bony inclosures, and covered with a hard crust; ventral fins placed behind the pectoral.\n\n*Little or dragon pegasus.*\u2014Snout conical. Only draconis, three or four inches long, with large pectoral fins, which enable it to support itself for some moments in the air, when it springs occasionally over the surface of the water. Native of the Indian seas.\n\n*Flying pegasus.*\u2014Snout ensiform and denticulated. Volans. Length three inches. Native of the Indian seas.\n\n*Swimming pegasus.*\u2014Snout ensiform and unarmed. Natans. Length three or four inches; more slender than the preceding. Native of the Indian seas.\n\n**Gen. 7. Centriscus.**\nHead produced into a very narrow snout; no teeth; the lower jaw longest; gill-aperture waving; body compressed; abdomen carinated; ventral fins united.\n\n*Mailed or shielded trumpet-fish.*\u2014Back smooth, with seataus, a hard shield, like a thin plate; eight inches long. Native of the Indian seas.\n\n*Snipe centriscus.*\u2014Body scaly and rough; tail strait, scolopax, and extended. Smaller than the preceding. Native of the Mediterranean and Indian seas. Ranked among edible fishes.\n\n*Light-armed centriscus.*\u2014Half-shielded, silvery, with velians, subrecumbent dorsal spine. Length about two inches. Native of the Indian seas.\n\n**Gen. 8. Balistes.**\nHead compressed, and an apparent continuation of the trunk, in some species, armed with a spine between the eyes; mouth narrow; eight teeth in each jaw; the two foremost longer than the rest; three interior teeth on both sides, resting against as many lateral ones; gill-aperture narrow, above the pectoral fins; gill-covers wanting; gill-membrane two-rayed; body compressed, carinated on the sides, with scales growing on the skin, and rough with sharp prickles.\nMost of the species of this genus are natives of the Indian and American seas. They can in some degree inflate their abdomen by means of a strong bone, rough with small prickles, which lies under the skin. They feed on other fishes. Some of them are very large, and some remarkable for the brilliancy and variegations of their colours. In general, they are reckoned poisonous.\n\n**Unicorn file-fish.**\u2014A fin of one ray on the head; rays of the caudal fin carinated. The body is of an oval form, from one to two feet long, and covered all over with very minute spines. The general colour is gray, inclining to brown on the upper parts, and varied with irregular wavings and spots. Just above the eyes is a single spine of considerable length, a little curved, and ferrated on the hind part. Its food chiefly consists of crustaceous and tefaceous animals.\n\n**Mediterranean file-fish.**\u2014Violet-gray, with red or blue variegations, single ventral fin, and rounded tail. Length of the preceding, and shape ovate. Almost the only species found in the European seas. The rays of the first dorsal fin are continued as to act in concert with considerable force in raising the fin at the pleasure of the animal.\n\n**Ancient file-fish, or old wife.** First dorsal fin three-rayed, ventral fin longitudinal; caudal bifid. Length from one to two feet, or more, general colour yellowish-olive, paler beneath. Several blue streaks on the front and cheek, and some transverse and longitudinal strips on the body. This species is supposed to have obtained its name from the mouth, when viewed in front, or from the slightly murmuring noise which it utters when first taken.\n\n**Undulated file-fish.**\u2014Black, but waved by oblique red lines. Observed about the shores of Sumatra by Mr Mungo Park.\n\nThe other sorts described by the most recent ichthyologists are, *hippoides*, *tomentosus*, *papilloides*, *chinenis*, *ringens*, *lituratus*, *levis*, *sonnerati*, *bicolor*, *virens*, *fasciatus*, *unimaculatus*, *cineraceus*, *maculatus*, *aculeatus*, *verrucosus*, *binucleatus*, *forcipatus*, *signatus*, *punctatus*, *capistratus*, *kleini*, *curaffavus*, and *affinis*.\n\n**Gen. 9. CYCLOPTERUS.**\n\nHead obtuse; mouth standing forward; tongue short and thick; jaws armed with small sharp teeth; gill-membrane four-rayed; gill-cover of one plate; body short, thick, and scaleless; ventral fins united into an orbicular membrane.\n\n**Lump-fucker, lump-fish, sea-owl or cock paddle.** Body angulated, with bony tubercle; grows to the length of 19 inches, and to the weight of seven pounds. It is of a deep and very thick shape, and swims edge-wise; the back is sharp and elevated, and the belly flat. There are four rows of large tubercles, and the whole skin is rough with smaller ones. On the upper part of the back is a thick ridge, destitute of spines. Beneath the pectoral fins is an oval aperture, surrounded with a fleshy muscular substance, edged with small filiform processes, which act as claspers. By means of this organ it adheres very strongly to any thing it pleases. The belly is of a bright crimson colour. Inhabits the northern, American, and Indian seas. Deposits its orange-coloured ova near the shore in April and May. The Greenlanders boil the roe, which is very large, and eat both it and the fish. In England, nous Fishes the latter is sometimes stewed, but is flabby and insipid. The lump-fuckers are frequently devoured by seals, which leave the skins; numbers of which, thus emptied, may often be found in the spring, along those districts of shore which are frequented by this species, \"It is easy, (adds Mr Pennant), to distinguish the place where seals are devouring this or any unwholesome fish, by a smoothness of the water immediately above the spot.\"\n\nThe *pavoninus*, or *pavonian sucker*, agrees with this species in all particulars, except size, and is therefore, probably only a variety. The *gibbus* of Willoughby, or *pyramidal sucker*, seems also to belong to the same species, and to be distinguished only by the pyramidal elevation of the back.\n\n**Small sucker.**\u2014Body naked; snout marked above the minutest mouth by three tubercles. A very small species, which inhabits the Atlantic ocean, and seems to be allied in habit to the common lump-fish. The body is compressed, of a whitish colour, and has two white unequal tubercles on each side.\n\n**Unctuous or snail-sucker.**\u2014Body naked; dorsal, anal, liparis, and caudal fins united. The length varies from five to eighteen inches. The shape is elongated, thick, compressed; the skin thin and lax, and covered with a viscid humour, like a snail. It is brownish, with darker stripes above, white beneath, and slightly yellow on the head and sides. It inhabits the northern seas, and sometimes ascends rivers.\n\n**Cornish or jura sucker, or lesser sucking-fish.**\u2014Of cornubien a purplish brown colour, with lengthened front. About six inches long; skin without scales, and slippery. Native of the European seas. Found by Dr Borlase on the coast of Cornwall, and by Mr Pennant in the sound of Jura.\n\n**Bimaculated sucker.**\u2014Body without scales; pectoral bimacula fins placed very high; a round black spot on each side, of the ventral membrane. About an inch and a half long; the colour of the head and body fine pink. Inhabits the sea about Weymouth.\n\nThe remaining known species of this genus are, *dentex*, *gelatinosus*, *ventricosus*, *lineatus*, and *bilipinicus*.\n\n**Gen. 10. LOPHIUS.**\n\nHead depressed; many sharp-pointed teeth; tongue broad; and armed with teeth; eyes on the upper part of the head; nostrils small; gills three; one lateral aperture; pectoral fins placed on the long branchiae; dorsal and anal fins opposite, and near the tail; body scaleless, covered with a thin and lax skin; vent in the middle; no lateral line.\n\nThe fishes of this genus are of a singularly uncouth appearance; the body being thick and shapeless; the head excessively large, and the fins short and broad.\n\n**European or common angler, frog-fish, toad-fish, pike-catcher, fishing-frog, sea-devil, &c.**\u2014Depressed; head rounded. The ordinary length of this species is from two to four feet, though it sometimes measures six or even seven feet. Its form resembles that of a tadpole. The skin of the trunk is smooth, but that of the upper parts marked by various inequalities. The eyes are large and whitish; the lower jaw is considerably longer than the upper. Two or three long, thread-like processes proceed...","sp":75,"ep":115},{"h":"ICHTHYOLOGY","t":"Gen. II. Accipenser.\n\nHead obtuse; mouth placed under the head; retractile, toothless; four beards under the snout and before the mouth.\n\nThe fishes of this genus are among the largest of the tribe. They are all inhabitants of the sea, though some occasionally ascend rivers in great shoals. All the species are large, seldom measuring, when full grown, less than three or four feet in length. Their flesh is reckoned delicate and nutritious; and they form a very considerable article of commerce on the banks of the Caspian sea, and many parts both of Europe and America. They feed principally on worms and other fish.\n\nCommon sturgeon.\u2014Snout obtuse; the transverse diameter of the mouth equal to the longitudinal; the beards on the snout near the end of it; lips bifid. Of a long, slender, and pentagonal form, attaining sometimes to eighteen feet in length, and weighing five hundred pounds. The whole length of the body is covered by five rows of large, strong, and bony tubercles, rounded at the base, radiated from the centre, and terminated above by a sharp curved point in a reversed direction. The whole skin, on the upper parts and sides, is also roughened with very small tubercles of a similar structure. The general colour is cinereous above, and whitish or yellowish beneath. Though generally a sluggish fish, it sometimes springs out of the water with great force. It feeds on fishes, particularly the herring, salmon, mackerel, and coal-fish. It spawns in spring, and is amazingly prolific, Lewinbock having found in the roe of one of them 150,000,000,000 ova! It inhabits the ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Red, Black, and Caspian seas, especially such parts of them as are not remote from the estuaries of large rivers, which they occasionally ascend in great multitudes. In some of the rivers of Virginia they are so numerous that six hundred have been taken in two days merely by a pole, with a strong hook fixed to the end of it. The flesh is very delicate, white, and firm, and when roasted, is said to resemble veal. In this country it is usually served in a pickled state, being imported from America and the Baltic. It is sometimes, however, taken in our rivers in the salmon-nets. The sturgeon was a fish in high repute with the Greeks and Romans, and according to Pliny, was brought to table with much pomp, and ornamented with flowers, the slaves who carried it being also ornamented with garlands, and accompanied by music. Caviar is made of the dried and salted roe. The skin makes a good covering for carriages.\n\nSterlet sturgeon.\u2014Brownish, with the sides spotted rufus, with pale red, and the body shielded above by a triple series of tubercles. The smallest and most delicate species of the genus. Native of the Caspian sea, found also in the Volga and Ural, and occasionally in the Baltic. In feasts when this fish happened to be unusually dear, Prince Potemkin paid three hundred rubles for a single tureen of sterlet soup, which formed the mere prelude to his repast.\n\nIlinglas sturgeon, or beluga.\u2014Snout very obtuse, bufo. Transverse diameter of the mouth less than the longitudinal; beards near the mouth; lips not cleft. Larger than the common species, and sometimes measuring 25 feet in length. The tubercles are smaller than those of the sturio, and seem to fall off with age. Inhabits the northern, Caspian, and Mediterranean seas. Ilinglas is prepared from its sound or air-bladder, and an inferior sort from the skin, tail, stomach, and intestines. See Ichthyocolla.\n\nTo these may be added schupa, and fellatus; the first perhaps only a smaller variety of sturio, and the latter distinguished by the star-like marks on its head.\n\nGen. 12. Chim\u00e6ra.\n\nHead sharp-pointed; spiracles solitary, in four divisions under the neck; mouth under the head; upper lip with five divisions; fore teeth like cutting-teeth, two in each jaw; body long, with a single spine on the back; the tail ending in a brittle, and longer than the rest of the body.\n\nSea-monster, northern chim\u00e6ra.\u2014Punctured folds below the finout. A singularly grotesque species, inhabiting the northern and Atlantic ocean; frequenting the deepest recesses, preying on smaller fishes and mollusca and telesaces; and rarely approaching the shore, except during the breeding season. It is from three to four feet long, of a lengthened and compressed form, tapering to the tail, which is produced into a long and slender filament. The head and eyes are very large; and at the base of each ventral fin, in the male, is a lengthened process, rough with numerous sharp prominences in a reversed direction. The whole body is of a yellow-brown above the lateral line, and of a bright filvery colour beneath it, variegated with numerous irregular deep brown or blackish spots and patches. Its flesh is considered as coarse and unpalatable.\n\nElephant fish, or southern chim\u00e6ra.\u2014Snout produced beneath into an inflected lip. Native of the southern seas.\n\nGen. 13. Squalus.\n\nHead obtuse, from four to seven semilunar spiracles on the sides of the neck; eyes oblong, half covered, placed before the temporal opening; mouth in the under part of the head, armed with several rows of serrated\nferrated sharp-pointed teeth, some of which are moveable, some fixed, and of different forms; body oblong, round, rough, with slender prickles; ventral fins, for the most part, less than the pectoral, close placed about the vent, and in the males about the organs of generation.\n\nThe animals which compose this tribe are entirely marine, and more frequent in the hot than in the temperate climates. In general they are solitary, and often wander to great distances, devouring almost everything that comes in their way, and that they are capable of swallowing. Some of them will follow vessels several hundred leagues for the carcasses and offals. They sometimes attain to an enormous size, as they often weigh from one to four thousand pounds each. Some few species are gregarious, and live on the mollusca and other marine worms. They are all viviparous, and like the rays, protrude their young in pellucid horny cases, terminated at the four corners by long, slender filaments, and which are generally found twisted round corallines, sea-weed, and other fixed substances. Their flesh is so tough, coarse, and unsavoury, that even the young are hardly eatable. Their bodies emit a phosphoric light in the dark.\n\n**Canicula.**\n\n*Panther shark*, greater or *spotted dog-fish*.\u2014Nostrils surrounded by a small lobe, and a vermiform appendage; ventral fins separated. Three or four feet long; brownish, with red or black spots; body cylindrical, but compressed at both extremities; skin rough, and when dried, used for polishing and other purposes. Inhabits the sea almost everywhere. The female breeds frequently, and brings about nineteen young at a time.\n\n**Catulus.**\n\n*Spotted shark*, or *lesser spotted dog-fish*.\u2014Nostrils surrounded by a small lobe and a vermiform appendage; ventral fins united. Length from two to three feet. Colour pale brick-red, with very numerous, small dusky spots. Very common in the European seas, very voracious, and a great annoyance to the fishermen. According to Pennant, it breeds from nine to thirteen at a time. Its liver is said to be highly noxious, inducing long continued stupor, succeeded by an universal itching and loss of the cuticle.\n\n**Galeus.**\n\n*Tope*.\u2014Teeth nearly triangular, and denticulated on the upper margin. Grows to five feet or more, is round and elongated, and often weighs upwards of 27 pounds. It is of a lighter or darker cinereous hue above, and whitish below. It smells very rank, and is so bold as to pursue its prey to the very edge of the shore. It inhabits the European ocean, and is frequently seen about the British coasts.\n\n**Mygalea.**\n\n*Hammer-headed shark*, or *balance-fish*.\u2014Head very broad and transverse, somewhat in the shape of a hammer. This deformed species measures from five to fifteen or seventeen feet. The body is rather slender, and somewhat cylindrical; the head dilated on each side to a great extent, with the eyes which are very large, placed at each extremity. It is brown above; and paler, or whitish beneath. Native of the Mediterranean and Indian seas, where it attacks such as are accidentally exposed to its fury, or are inadvertently bathing or swimming in its neighbourhood. The natives of Otaheite, trifling to their dexterity in swimming, appear to hold it in contempt.\n\n**Heart-headed shark.**\u2014Head very broad and heart-shaped. In other respects greatly allied to the preceding, but is much more rare, and chiefly inhabits the South American seas.\n\n**Blue shark.**\u2014Sides of the tail smooth, a cavity on the back of the tail. Of a more slender and elegant shape than the other species, measures from ten to fourteen feet, is of a blue-green above and white beneath. It is very bold and voracious; inhabits the European seas, and frequents several of the British coasts, especially those of Cornwall, during the pilchard season.\n\n**Porbeagle shark**\u2014A longitudinal fold on each side cornubi of the tail. Length from three to eight feet; shape cus round, except near the tail, where it is depressed; colour deep on the back, and white or silvery beneath. Inhabits the sea about Cornwall. The *monensis*, or *Beaman's shark* of Pennant, is now regarded only as a variety of *carnubius*.\n\n**Basking shark.**\u2014With conical teeth, not serrated. *maximus*. Body slender, and from three to twelve yards in length, of a deep lead colour above, and white below. The upper jaw is blunt at the end, and much longer than the lower. The mouth is furnished with a great multitude of small teeth, of which those in front are much bent, and the remote ones conical and sharp pointed. It has two dorsal, two pectoral, two ventral fins, and one small anal fin. This species inhabits the northern seas, and derives its name from its propensity to lie on the surface of the water, as if to bask in the sun, generally on its belly, and sometimes on its back. It feeds on sea-plants and medusae, and betrays none of that ferocity of disposition which characterizes most of the shark tribe; on the contrary, it seems so little afraid of mankind, as often to suffer itself to be patted and stroked. These animals frequent our seas during the warm summer months, and appear in shoals on the Welsh and Scottish coasts, after intervals of a certain number of years. They are observed in the frith of Clyde and among the Hebrides in small troops of seven or eight, or more commonly in pairs, about midsummer, and disappear about the latter end of July. They swim very deliberately, and generally with their upper fins above water. Sometimes they may be seen sporting among the waves, and springing several feet above the surface. They are pursued and taken by the fishermen for the sake of the oil contained in the liver; that viscus sometimes weighing a thousand pounds, and yielding eight barrels of oil, and two of useless sediment. When pursued, they do not quicken their motion till the boat is almost in contact with them, when the harpooner strikes his weapon into the body, as near the gills as he can. Sometimes they remain in the same place till the united strength of two men is exerted to force the instrument deeper. Then they plunge headlong to the bottom, and frequently coil the rope round their bodies, and endeavour to get rid of the harpoon by rolling on the ground. Discovering that these efforts are vain, they swim with such strength and rapidity, that one instance has occurred of a basking shark towing to some distance a vessel of 70 tons burthen, against a fresh gale. They sometimes run off with 200 fathoms of line, and two harpoons in them, and will employ the men from 12 to 24 hours before they are subdued. A large fish has afforded the captors a prize.\nA male of this species (says Dr Shaw) was taken in the year 1821, at Abbotsbury in Dorsetshire entangled in a fishing seine, and after a violent resistance, was dragged ashore. It is said to have received 17 musket-balls before it expired; its length was 28 feet, and its circumference in the thickest part about 20 feet; its tail, from point to point, near eight feet; the teeth, according to its proprietor, who took pains to count them, amounted to the number of four thousand.\" The skin make excellent flaggreen.\n\nWhite shark.\u2014Triangular serrated teeth. This species, so remarkable for its powers of destruction, is a native of most seas, but occurs more frequently in the warm than the cold latitudes. It arrives at the length of more than 30 feet, and is rather thicker and broader than most of its congeners. The mouth is very wide, and furnished on the margin of each jaw with from three to six rows of strong, flat, triangular, sharp-pointed, and finely serrated teeth, which can be raised or depressed at pleasure. The general colour of the animal is a pale ash, darker or browner on the upper parts. So great is the strength of the tail, that a young shark of six feet in length, is able by a stroke of this part to break a man's leg; hence it is usual for sailors to cut off the tail the instant they drag a shark on board. Gillius quotes a specimen which weighed four thousand pounds, and another in whose belly was found an entire human body; and M\u00fcller affirms, that in one taken at the isle of St Margaret, there was found a horse which had probably been thrown overboard from some ship. The size of the fossil teeth of this species, so often found in the isle of Malta, &c., affords a convincing proof of the enormous specimens which have once existed. Sharks are the dread of sailors in all hot climates, where they constantly attend the ships in expectation of what may drop overboard; and a man who has that misfortune is almost instantly devoured. In the pearl-fisheries of South America, every negro, to defend himself against these animals, carries with him into the water a sharp knife, which, if the fish offers to assault him, he endeavours to strike into its belly, on which it generally swims off. The officers who are in the vessels keep a watchful eye on these voracious creatures, and on discovering them, shake the ropes fastened to the negroes, to put them on their guard. Many, when the divers have been in danger, have thrown themselves into the water, with knives in their hands, and fastened to their defence; but too often all their dexterity and precaution have been of no avail.\n\nSaw-snouted shark, or saw-fish.\u2014With a long flat snout, let with teeth on both sides through its whole length. Inhabits the southern and northern oceans, grows to fifteen feet in length, and is readily distinguished by its produced and saw-like snout, which is often preserved in museums.\n\nPicked shark, or picked dog-fish.\u2014Dorsal fin spinous; body somewhat round. Length from three to four feet; colour brownish ash above and white beneath; rough, with minute prickles, hooked backwards. Common in the European seas, especially about the coasts of Scotland and Norway. When split and dried, it is eaten by the common people.\n\nAngel shark, or angel-fish.\u2014Pectoral fins very large and emarginated before. A deformed species, with cartilaginous large head and pectoral fins, and depressed body, attaining to five or eight feet in length. It is a native of the European seas, and is extremely voracious, fierce, and dangerous. It produces twelve or thirteen young at a birth.\n\nThe other known species of this genus are vulpes, stellaris, mystelus, spinax, centrina, philippinus, cinereus, spinofus, jabella, cirrhatus, barbatus, africanus, ocellatus, griseus, americanus, squamosus, denticulatus, punctulatus, zebra, gronovianus, tentaculatus, and semi-guttatus.\n\nGen. 14. Spatularia.\n\nSpiracles single on each side of the neck, concealed by a large gill-cover; stout produced, and shaped like a spatula; mouth beneath the head, large, and furnished with sharp serrated teeth.\n\nReticulated spatularia.\u2014In habit and appearance this remarkable species is allied to the sharks, but distinguished by its thin snout, of the form of a spatula, and nearly equal in length to the whole remainder of the animal. Its history and manners are very imperfectly known.\n\nGen. 15. Raja.\n\nSpiracles on the under part of the neck, ten on each side, oblique; mouth under the head, small, acuminate, as if continuous with the breast, transverse and dentated; body thin, depressed, and of a rhomboid figure.\n\nThe species of this genus are entirely confined to the sea, and, being destitute of an air-bladder, live chiefly at the bottom, generally in deep water, covering themselves in winter in sand or mud. They live on shell-fish, or other animal substances that fall in their way. Some of them become of a size so large as to weigh two hundred pounds and upwards. They seldom produce more than one young at a time, which, as in the sharks, is inclosed in a four-cornered capsule, ending in slender points, but not, as in the former, produced into long filaments. The liver is large, and often produces a great quantity of oil. They are mostly edible.\n\nTorpedo, torpedo ray, cramp ray, cramp fish, &c.\u2014torpedo. Wholly smooth. The body of this species is of a somewhat circular form, slightly convex above, marked along each side of the spine by several small pores, about eighteen inches, or two feet in length, and for the most part of a pale reddish brown on the upper surface, sometimes marked by five large circular and dusky spots, and whitish or flesh-coloured beneath. It inhabits most seas, but seems to thrive best in the Mediterranean, usually lying in water of about forty fathoms depth, in company with some of its congeners. It preys on smaller fish, which it is supposed to stupefy by its electric or galvanic faculty. This property, which has been so much exaggerated both by ancient and modern writers, is nevertheless, sufficiently remarkable. From some experiments which were made by Mr Walh on a very stout and healthy fish, it appears that no spark could be discovered to proceed from it, and that pith-balls were never found to be affected by it. When insulated, it gave a shock to persons who were likewise insulated.\nChap IV.\n\n**Ichthyology**\n\nCartilaginous Fishes\n\n**Batis.**\n\nSkate.\u2014Back smooth in the middle, with one row of spines. Common in the European seas. The general colour on the upper parts is a pale ash-brown, varied with several dusky undulations, and of the under parts white, marked with numerous distant black spines. In the male, the pectoral fins are bent towards their tips or edges with numerous small spines. In October, the skate is usually poor and thin, but begins to improve in November, and is reckoned to be in the highest perfection in May. Willoughby makes mention of a single skate of two hundred pounds weight, which was sold in the fish market at Cambridge to the cook of St John's College in that university, and was found sufficient to dine the whole society, consisting of more than 120 persons.\n\n**Exyrianchus.**\n\nSharp-nosed ray.\u2014Ten aculeated tubercles along the middle of the back. In shape resembles the preceding, but has a longer and sharper snout in the form of a pontoon. Native of the Mediterranean and northern seas.\n\n**Miraletus.**\n\nMirror ray.\u2014Back and belly smooth; spines at the region of the eyes, and a triple row of them at the tail. Each of the pectoral fins is marked about the middle, or near the body, with a large circular, eye-shaped spot, consisting of a purplish or dusky circle, with a whitish or yellowish centre. Inhabits the Mediterranean.\n\n**Rubus.**\n\nRough ray.\u2014One row of prickles on the back, and three on the tail. Greatly allied to the thorn-back; and rough, with many spines. Inhabits the Mediterranean and other seas.\n\n**Pastinaca.**\n\nSting ray.\u2014Body smooth; long serrated spine on the fore part of the tail; no dorsal fin. Shape somewhat rhomboidal; snout pointed; colour of the body yellowish olive above, and whitish beneath. With its long flattened spine, which is finely serrated in a reverse direction on both sides, it is capable of inflicting very severe wounds. As it is annually cast, the new spine sometimes arrives at a considerable size before the old one drops off, in which state the animal has been occasionally described as a distinct species. Though formerly supposed to contain a very active poison, this weapon is found to be wholly destitute of any venomous quality. Inhabits the European, Red, and Indian seas, and is ranked among the edible rays.\n\n**Clavata.**\n\nThorn-back.\u2014Prickly; teeth tuberculated; a transverse cartilage on the abdomen. Resembles the common skate, but is somewhat broader in proportion, and is easily distinguished from it by the very strong curved spines with which its upper surface is covered. It is an inhabitant of the Mediterranean and other seas, and esteemed as a food. The thorn-back begins to be in season in November, and continues so later than the skate; but the young of both are good at all times of the year.\n\nTo complete the specific catalogue of this genus, we have to add *fullonica*, *eglantaria*, *acuta*, *nigra*, *picta*, *un*., *Cartilaginosa*, *alba*, *margarina*, *chagrinea*, *aquila*, *guiana*, *far*., *ious filies*, *ciata*, *lymna*, *cuculatus*, *fesben*, *tuberculata*, *pocillina*, *diadema*, *bolus*, *manatia*, *girma*, *fabroniana*, *bankiana*, *bimbrata*, *maculata*, *bicolor*, *sinensis*, *rhinobatos*, *thouimiana*, *djidendenis*, and *curvata*.\n\n**Gen. 16. Petromyzon.**\n\nPetromyzon.\n\nHead more slender than the body; mouth larger above than below; teeth orange-coloured, hollow within, surrounded with a fleshy rim, curved above, broad below; seven spiracles at the sides of the neck; a filiform opening at the back part of the head; no pectoral or ventral fins.\n\nLamprey, great lamprey, or sea lamprey.\u2014Mouth minute, within covered with papillae; the hinder dorsal fin separate from the tail. In general appearance, approaches nearly to the eel tribe, especially to the murenae. Though it sometimes exceeds three feet in length, the British specimens are usually of inferior size. Its general colour is a dull brownish olive, clouded with yellowish white variegations; the fins are tinged with dull orange, and the tail with blue. On the top of the head is a small orifice for the discharge of the superfluous water taken in at the mouth and gills. Among the cartilaginous fishes, none is so destitute of all appearance of real bone as the lamprey, in which, the spine itself is no other than a mere soft cartilage, without any processes or protuberances. The heart, instead of being inclosed in a soft pericardium, as in other animals, is guarded by a strong cartilaginous one; and the liver is of a fine grass-green colour. It inhabits the ocean, and ascends rivers chiefly during the latter end of winter and the early months of spring. It is viviparous; and the young are of slow growth. Though capable of swimming with rapidity, it is more commonly seen attached by the mouth to some large stone or other substance, and that with such power of adhesion, that a weight of more than twelve pounds may be raised without forcing the fish to forego its hold. It is supposed to live principally on worms and young fish. Like the eel, it is remarkably tenacious of life, the several parts, when cut in pieces, continuing to move, and the head strongly attaching itself for several hours to a stone, though by far the greater part of the body be cut away from it.\n\n\"As an article of food,\" (observes Dr Shaw) \"the lamprey has for many ages maintained its credit as on exquisite dainty; and has uniformly made its appearance at the most splendid of our ancient entertainments. The death of King Henry I. it is well known, is attributed to a too luxurious indulgence in this his favourite dish. It still continues to be in high esteem; and we are told by Mr Pennant, that the city of Gloucester continues to fend yearly, at Christmas, a present of a rich lamprey pie to the king. It sometimes happens that the lampreys at that season are so rare, that a guinea is demanded for the price of a single fish. They are most in season during March, April, and May, and are observed to be much more firm when fresh arrived from sea than when they have been a considerable time in fresh water. They are found in several of the British rivers, but that which is most celebrated for them is the Severn.\"\n\nLesser lamprey or lampern.\u2014The hinder dorsal fin fluvialitis angulated.\nCartilaginous fish. From 10 to 15 inches long; the back brown or dusky, sometimes clouded, or mixed with blue; the upper part of the body marked by numerous annular lines, and the whole under-sides silvery. Inhabits the sea, and ascends, in spring, most of the European rivers, in which it is found much more frequently and plentifully than the great lamprey. It is often potted with the latter, and by some preferred to it, on account of its milder taste. The Dutch purchase vast quantities of this species as bait for their cod and turbot fisheries. In the river Bauter, in Courland, great quantities are taken from beneath the ice, with nets; they are much larger than those found elsewhere, and are packed in snow, and sent to any distance; and, when put into cold water, recover themselves. This species is so tenacious of life, that it will live many days out of the water.\n\nMinute lamprey or pride.\u2014The hinder dorsal fin linear; the lips behind lobated. Has a worm-like appearance; measures from four to seven inches in length; is not observed to adhere to other bodies; inhabits the European rivers, and is more frequent in the Iffs than elsewhere, in England.\n\nThe remaining species are planteri, ruber, sanguifuga, argenteus, plumbeus, and bicolor.\n\nGen. 17. GASTROBRANCHUS.\n\nBody eel-shaped; mouth beneath, with numerous pectinate teeth; two spiracles beneath the abdomen.\n\nBlind gastrobranchus. Myxine glutinosa, Lin.\u2014Livid, paler beneath; with eight beards at the mouth. Removed to the class of fishes, in consequence of Dr Bloch's accurate examination of its external and internal structure. In general appearance, in the situation of the mouth, and in the orange colour of the teeth, it approaches very near to the lamprey. But it is remarkable for the total want of eyes, no vestige of any such organ being discoverable by the most attentive examination. The body is destitute of scales, lateral line, and fins, except that shallow one which forms the tail. Beneath the body, from head to tail, runs a double row of equitant pores. The spiracles, which are a pair of oval apertures, are situated beneath the body, at some distance from the head. This singular species is said to enter into the bodies of such fishes as it happens to find on the fisherman's hooks, and which consequently have not the power of escaping its attack, and by gnawing its way through the skin, to devour all the internal parts, leaving only the bones and the skin remaining. Such is its uncommon glutinous nature, that, if put into a large vessel of sea water, it soon renders the whole so viscid, as easily to be drawn out into the form of threads. It inhabits the northern seas, and seems also to occur in those of the southern hemisphere.\n\nDombeyan gastrobranchus.\u2014Head tumid. Much larger than the European species; the head rounded, and larger than the body; four beards on the upper lip, the number of those on the lower uncertain, the specimen being described in a dried state. Eyes and nostrils imperceptible. Native of the South American seas. Observed by M. Dombey, and described by La C\u00e9p\u00e9de from the dried skin in the Paris museum.\n\nBefore we conclude this article, it may be proper to direct the reader's attention to M. Nouel's paper relative to two methods of multiplying fishes. The first consists in conveying from the lakes to the rivers, and from the rivers to the lakes, fish found only in one of them; the second, in introducing into fresh water, as it were infinitely, and by means of artificial ponds, fish produced in salt water, giving the preference to those species, which by their habits and manner of living, might be most adapted to this kind of naturalization.\n\nThe first of these methods has been successfully practiced in Germany, with regard to the thad, in ponds and clear flagrant waters, with a bottom of sand or gravel. Perch and trout have, in like manner, been conveyed into lakes and rivers in Scotland, and have thriven remarkably well. The carp, which affects a warm temperature, has been successively introduced into the rivers and ponds of Prussia, Denmark, and England. M. Poivre first brought the gourami of Bengal into the isle of France, where it has greatly multiplied.\n\n\"Our rivers,\" says this judicious writer, \"do not contain more than about twenty indigenous species, and some migratory fishes, which at certain periods of the year ascend to a certain distance from their mouths, or, like the salmon, swim towards their sources as far as they can. The small rivers possess still fewer species; the greatest part even are confined to the tench, the trout, eels, and some smaller fish of little value. How advantageous would it be to introduce into these rivers a multitude of foreign fish, which, in these waters could find aliment more agreeable to their taste, and which would enjoy a temperature as analogous to their wants, as favourable to their reproduction!\n\n\"The Seine, which I shall take as an example, nourishes many species of salmo and cyprinus: but how many other fish of the same kind might be propagated in it! If the Seine possesses the salmon, it wants the thymallus, the umber of Auvergne, the lavaretus, the murcena of Germany, the grilfe of Scotland, the pala of Switzerland, the ferra of the lake of Geneva, &c. Why should not the carp of the lago di Guarda, and the schwarz-ritter of the lakes of Berchtoldgaden, an excellent kind of salmon, highly praised by Baron de Moll, a naturalist of Salzburg, succeed in France, if that bottom, to which they are most attached, were procured for them, at the foot of the Cevennes or the Vosges? Why might they not be afterwards gradually introduced into our small rivers? Can it be believed, that the numerous tribe of the trout kind, which swarm in the rivers of Scotland, would refuse to supply our colonies with their species? No. There can be no doubt that they would bring thither that fecundity, abundance, and riches, which render them so valuable to their native streams. The case would be the same with the boulldes and higlings presented to us by the lakes of Switzerland, and with the gudgeon, the cyprinus ballerus, and the salmo umbra, bred in the rivers of Lower Germany. Let us open, then, with these countries a philosophical and liberal exchange of the best fish of France for those of which we wish to be possessed.\"\n\nNature herself seems to point to the success of the second method. In many instances, salmon and sturgeon have habituated themselves to a fresh-water residence.\nNaturalization of Fishes.\n\nPallas discovered the sea-dog in the lake Baikal; and Liancourt found the herring in several of the rivers of North America. It likewise deserves to be remarked that the large plaice, transported from the North sea to the ponds of East Friesland, have increased by myriads, and imparted great value to water which was formerly unproductive.\n\n\"In the year 1799, (continues M. Nouel), I had the honour of reading, in one of the fittings of the National Institute, a memoir on the means and advantages of naturalizing the herring, a salt-water fish, in the waters of the Seine, near its mouth, &c. The account of the processes for accomplishing this end, which I there pointed out, are not susceptible of analysis, and cannot, therefore, be introduced into this essay; it will be sufficient for me to say, that the report of Lac\u00e9p\u00e9de, Cuvier, and T\u00e9ssier, was entirely in their favour. At present, I am still more convinced of the efficacy of the means which I then proposed; and I have no doubt that, if artificial ponds were formed on the edges of rivers, the experiment would be attended with complete success. 'Every man,' (says Dr Franklin), who catches a fish, draws from the water a piece of money.' Let not the maxims and example of this philosopher be lost to posterity; let them rather produce fruit, like strong and vigorous seed sown in a fertile soil. Having observed in New England, that the herrings ascended from the sea into one river of that country, while a single individual was never seen in another river, separated from the former by a narrow tongue of land, and which communicated also with the sea, this philosopher took the leaves of some plants on which the herrings had deposited their ova, already fecundated, and conveyed them to the river which was deprived of the annual visit of these fish. The success of this experiment surpassed his expectations; the ova were completely productive; and the following year the river was peopled with a numerous shoal of herrings, which, since that time, have continued to frequent it.\n\n\"This fish is not the only one which I which to see naturalized in fresh water; to the herring I would add several species of pleuronectes\u2014also the mullet, goby, whitling, gar-fish, and perhaps, one or two species of the gurnard. I would pay the greatest attention possible to the nature of the water proper for each species. This happy choice is the principal condition, and that which could ensure success; but I would select in particular for this colonization, the fish found in lakes, which, though little known, are more numerous than is commonly supposed, and ought to be so.\"\n\nBy the adoption of this plan, which is susceptible of more ample development, society would gain an increased quantity of provision, and the naturalist would multiply his opportunities of observation.\n\nFor the modes of preserving fish in cabinets, see Preserving Fish, means of.","sp":115,"ep":121},{"h":"ICHTHYOPHAGI","t":"FISH-EATERS, a name given to a people, or rather to several different people, who lived wholly on fishes; the word is Greek, compounded of \u1f30\u03c7\u03b8\u03cd\u03c2, \u03c0\u1fd6\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2, \"fish,\" and \u1f10\u03b4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5, \"to eat.\"\n\nThe Ichthyophagi spoken of by Ptolemy are placed by Sanfon in the provinces of Nanquin and Xantong.

The word is Greek, formed from \u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd image, and \u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u03af\u03c9 rumpere, \"to break.\"\n\nIn this sense, not only the reformed, but some of the eastern churches, are called ICONOCLASTES, and esteemed by them heretics, as opposing the worship of the images of God and the saints, and breaking their figures and representations in churches.\n\nThe opposition to images began in Greece under the reign of Bardanes, who was created emperor of the Greeks a little after the commencement of the eighth century, when the worship of them became common. See IMAGE. But the tumults occasioned by it were quelled by a revolution, which, in 713, deprived Bardanes of the imperial throne. The dispute, however, broke out with redoubled fury under Leo the Isaurian, who issued out an edict in the year 726, abrogating, as some say, the worship of images, and ordering all the images, except that of Christ's crucifixion, to be removed out of the churches; but according to others, this edict only prohibited the paying to them any kind of adoration or worship. This edict occasioned a civil war, which broke out in the islands of the Archipelago, and by the suggestions of the priests and monks, ravaged a part of Asia, and afterwards reached Italy. The civil commotions and insurrections in Italy were chiefly promoted by the Roman pontiffs, Gregory I. and II. Leo was excommunicated, and his subjects in the Italian provinces violated their allegiance, and rising in arms either massacred or banished all the emperor's deputies and officers. In consequence of these proceedings, Leo assembled a council at Constantinople in 730, which degraded Germanus, the bishop of that city, who was a patron of images; and he ordered all the images to be publicly burnt, and inflicted a variety of severe punishments upon such as were attached to that idolatrous worship. Hence arose two factions; one of which adopted the adoration and worship of images, and on that account were called ICONODULI or ICONOLATRES; and the other maintained that such worship was unlawful, and that nothing was more worthy the zeal of Christians than to demolish and destroy those statues and pictures which were the occasions of this gross idolatry; and hence they were distinguished by the titles of ICONOMACHI (from \u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd image, and \u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 I contend,) and ICONOCLASTAE. The zeal of Gregory II. in favour of image worship, was not only imitated, but even surpassed by his successor Gregory III., in consequence of which the Italian provinces were torn from the Grecian empire.\n\nConstantine, called Copronymus, from \u03bf\u1f34\u03ba\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \"house,\" and \u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1 \"name,\" because he was said to have defiled the sacred font at his baptism, succeeded his father Leo in 741, and in 754 convened a council at Constantinople, regarded by the Greeks as the seventh ecumenical council, which solemnly condemned the worship and use of images. Those who, notwithstanding this decree of the council, raised commotions in the state, were severely punished; and new laws were enacted, to fet bounds to the violence of monastic rage. Leo IV. who was declared emperor in 775, pursued the same measures, and had recourse to the coercive influence of penal laws, in order to extirpate idolatry out of the Christian church. Irene, the wife of Leo, poisoned her husband in 780; assumed the reins of empire during the minority of her son Constantine, and in 786 summoned a council at Nice in Bithynia, known by the name of the second Nicene council, which abrogated the laws and decrees against the new idolatry, restored the worship of images and of the cross, and denounced severe punishments against those who maintained that God was the only object of religious adoration. In this contest, the Britons, Germans, and Gauls, were of opinion, that images might be lawfully continued in churches, but they considered the worship of them as highly injurious and offensive to the Supreme Being. Charlemagne distinguished himself as a mediator in this controversy: he ordered four books concerning images to be composed, refuting the reasons urged by the Nicene bishops to justify the worship of images, which he sent to Adrian the Roman pontiff in 790, in order to engage him to withdraw his approbation of the decrees of the last council of Nice. Adrian wrote an answer; and in 794, a council of 300 bishops, assembled by Charlemagne at Francfort on the Maine, confirmed the opinion contained in the four books, and solemnly condemned the worship of images. In the Greek church, after the banishment of Irene, the controversy concerning images broke out anew, and was carried on by the contending parties, during the half of the ninth century, with various and uncertain success. The emperor Nicephorus appears upon the whole to have been an enemy to this idolatrous worship. His successor, Michael Curapolates, named Rhangabe, patronized and encouraged it. But the scene changed on the accession of Leo the Armenian to the empire; who assembled a council at Constantinople in 814, that abolished the decrees of the Nicene council. His successor Michael, named Balbus, disapproved the worship of images, and his son Theophilus treated them with great severity. However, the empress Theodora, after his death, and during the minority of her son, assembled a council at Constantinople in 842, which reinstated the decrees of the second Nicene council, and encouraged image worship by a law. The council held at the same place under Photius, in 879, and reckoned by the Greeks the eighth general council, confirmed and renewed the Nicene decrees. In commemoration of this council, a festival was instituted by the superstitious Greeks, called the feast of orthodoxy. The Latins were generally of opinion, that images might be suffered as the means of aiding the memory of the faithful, and of calling to their remembrance the pious exploits and virtuous actions of the persons whom they represented; but they detested all thoughts of paying them the least\nIconoclast marks of religious homage or adoration. The council of Paris, assembled in 824 by Louis the Meek, resolved to allow the use of images in the churches, but severely prohibited rendering them religious worship. Nevertheless, towards the conclusion of this century, the Gallican clergy began to pay a kind of religious homage to the images of saints, and their example was followed by the Germans and other nations. However, the Iconoclasts still had their adherents among the Latins; the most eminent of whom was Claudius bishop of Turin, who, in 823, ordered all images, and even the crosses, to be cast out of the churches, and committed to the flames; and he wrote a treatise, in which he declared both against the use and worship of them. He condemned relics, pilgrimages to the Holy Land, and all voyages to the tombs of saints; and to his writings and labours it was owing, that the city of Turin, and the adjacent country, was, for a long time after his death, much less infected with superstition than the other parts of Europe. The controversy concerning the sanctity of images was again revived by Leo bishop of Chalcedon, in the 11th century, on occasion of the emperor Alexius's converting the figures of silver that adorned the portals of the churches into money in order to supply the exigencies of the state. The bishop obstinately maintained that he had been guilty of sacrilege; and published a treatise, in which he affirmed, that in these images there resided an inherent sanctity, and that the adoration of Christians ought not to be confined to the persons represented by these images, but extended to the images themselves. The emperor assembled a council at Constantinople, which determined, that the images of Christ and of the saints were to be honoured only with a relative worship; and that invocations and worship were to be addressed to the saints only as the servants of Christ, and on account of their relation to him as their master. Leo, dissatisfied even with these absurd and superstitious decisions, was sent into banishment. In the western church, the worship of images was disapproved and opposed by several considerable parties, as the Petrobrusians, Albigenses, Waldenses, &c. till at length this idolatrous practice was entirely abolished in many parts of the Christian world by the Reformation.

In criminal cases, therefore, idiots and lunatics are not chargeable for their own acts, if committed when under these incapacities: no, not even for treason itself. Also, if a man in his sound memory commits a capital offence, and before arraignment for it he becomes mad, he ought not to be arraigned for it: because he is not able to plead to it with that advice and caution that he ought.

Indeed, in the bloody reign of Henry VIII., a statute was made, which enacted, that if a person, being compos mentis, should commit high treason, and after fall into madness, he might be tried in his absence, and should suffer death, as if he were of perfect memory. But this savage and inhuman law was repealed by the statute 1 & 2 Ph. & M. c. 10. For, as is observed by Sir Edward Coke, \"the execution of an offender is for example, ut pena ad paucos, metus ad omnes perveniat:\" but so it is not when a madman is executed; but should be a miserable spectacle, both against law, and of extreme inhumanity and cruelty, and can be no example to others.\" But if there be any doubt whether the party be compos or not, this shall be tried by a jury. And if he be found, a total idiocy, or absolute insanity, excuses from the guilt, and of course from the punishment, of any criminal action committed under such deprivation of the senses; but if a lunatic hath lucid intervals of understanding, he shall answer for what he does in those intervals, as if he had no deficiency. Yet, in the case of absolute madness, as they are not answerable for their actions, they should not be permitted the liberty of acting unless under proper control; and, in particular, they ought not to be suffered to go loose, to the terror of the king's subjects. It was the doctrine of our ancient law, that persons deprived of their reason might be confined till they recovered their senses, without waiting for the forms of a commission or other special authority from the crown; and now, by the vagrant acts, a method is chalked out for imprisoning, chaining, and sending them to their proper homes.\n\nThe matrimonial contract likewise cannot take place in a state of idiocy. It was formerly adjudged, that the issue of an idiot was legitimate, and his marriage valid. A strange determination! since consent is absolutely requisite to matrimony, and neither idiots nor lunatics are capable of consenting to anything. And therefore the civil law judged much more feebly, when it made such deprivations of reason a previous impediment, though not a cause of divorce if they happened after marriage. And modern regulations have adhered to the sense of the civil law, by determining that the marriage of a lunatic, not being in a lucid interval, was absolutely void. But as it might be difficult to prove the exact state of the party's mind at the actual celebration of the nuptials, upon this account (concurring with some private family reasons *), *See Priz. the statute 15 Geo. II. c. 30. has provided, that the vate alis, marriage of lunatics and persons under phrenises (if 23 Geo. II. found lunatics under a commission, or committed to c. 6. the care of trustees under any act of parliament) before they are declared of sound mind by the lord chancellor, or the majority of such trustees, shall be totally void.\n\nIdiots and persons of non-fane memory, as well as infants and persons under dures, are not totally disabled either to convey or purchase, but sub modo only. For their conveyances and purchases are voidable, but not actually void. The king indeed, on behalf of an idiot, may avoid his grants or other acts. But it hath been said, that a non compos himself, though he be afterwards brought to a right mind, shall not be permitted to allege his own insanity in order to avoid such grant; for that no man shall be allowed to flatter himself, or plead his own disability. The progress of this notion is somewhat curious. In the time of Edward I., non compos was a sufficient plea to void a man's own bond; and there is a writ in the register for the alienor himself to recover lands aliened by him during his insanity; dum fuit non compos mentis fuerit, ut dictum, &c. But under Edward III., a scruple began to arise, whether a man should be permitted to blemish himself, by pleading his own insanity; and, afterwards, a defendant in affrege having pleaded a release by the plaintiff since the last continuance, to which the plaintiff replied (are tenuis, as the manner then was) that he was out of his mind when he gave it, the court adjourned the affrege; doubting, whether as the plaintiff was sane\u2014both then and at the commencement of the suit, he should be permitted to plead an intermediate deprivation of reason; and the question was asked, how he came to remember to release, if out of his senses when he gave it? Under Henry VI., this way of reasoning, (that a man shall not be allowed to disfigure himself, by pleading his own incapacity, because he cannot know what he did under such a situation) was seriously adopted by the judges in argument; upon a question whether the heir was barred of his right of entry by the seisinment of his insane ancestor? And from these loose authorities, which Fitzherbert does not scruple to reject as being contrary to reason, the maxim that a man shall not flatter himself, hath been handed down as settled law; though later opinions, feeling the inconvenience of the rule, have in many points endeavoured to restrain it. And, clearly, the next heir or other person interested, may, after the death of the idiot or non compos, take advantage of his incapacity and avoid the...\nthe grant. And so, too, if he purchases under this disability, and does not afterwards upon recovering his senses agree to the purchase, his heir may either waive or accept the estate at his option. In like manner, an infant may waive such purchase or conveyance, when he comes to full age; or, if he does not then actually agree to it, his heir may waive it after him. Persons, also, who purchase or convey under duress, may affirm or avoid such transaction, whenever the duress is ceased. For all these are under the protection of the law; which will not suffer them to be imposed upon through the imbecility of their present condition; so that their acts are only binding in case they are afterwards agreed to when such imbecility ceases. Yet the guardians or committees of a lunatic, by the statute 11 Geo. III. c. 23, are empowered to renew in his right, under the directions of the court of chancery, any lease for lives or years, and apply the profits of such renewal for the benefit of such lunatic, his heirs, or executors.

In China it is a maxim, that if there be a man who does not work, or a woman that is idle, in the empire, somebody must suffer cold or hunger: the produce of the lands not being more than sufficient, with culture, to maintain the inhabitants; and therefore, though the idle person may shift off the want from himself, yet it must in the end fall somewheres. The court also of Areopagus at Athens punished idleness, and exerted a right of examining every citizen in what manner he spent his time; the intention of which was, that the Athenians, knowing they were to give an account of their occupations, should follow only such as were laudable, and that there might be no room left for such as lived by unlawful arts. The civil law expelled all sturdy vagrants from the city; and, in our own law, all idle persons or vagabonds, whom our ancient statutes describe to be \"such as wake on the night and sleep on the day, Blackfriars and haunt customary taverns and ale-houses, and routs Comment about; and no man wot from whence they come, ne whether they go?\" or such as are more particularly described by statute 17 Geo.

The ornaments were various, and wholly designed to blind the eyes of the ignorant and stupid multitude, who are chiefly taken with show and pageantry. Then followed the consecration and oration, which were performed with great solemnity among the Romans. See IMAGE.","sp":138,"ep":138},{"h":"IDOLATRY","t":"or the worship of idols, may be distinguished into two sorts. By the first, men adore the works of God, the sun, the moon, the stars, angels, demons, men, and animals: by the second, men worship the work of their own hands, as statues, pictures, and the like: and to these may be added a third, that by which men have worshipped the true God under sensible figures and representations. This indeed may have been the case with respect to each of the above kinds of idolatry; and thus the Israelites adored God under the figure of a calf.\n\nThe stars were the first objects of idolatrous worship, on account of their beauty, their influence on the productions of the earth, and the regularity of their motions, particularly the sun and moon, which are considered as the most glorious and refulgent images of the Deity: afterwards, as their sentiments became more\nIdolatry, more corrupted, they began to form images, and to entertain the opinion, that by virtue of consecration, the gods were called down to inhabit or dwell in their statues. Hence Arnobius takes occasion to rally the Pagans for guarding so carefully the statues of their gods, who, if they were really present in their images, might save their worshippers the trouble of securing them from thieves and robbers.\n\nAs to the adoration which the ancient Pagans paid to the statues of their gods, it is certain, that the wiser and more sensible heathens considered them only as simple representations or figures designed to recall to their minds the memory of their gods. This was the opinion of Varro and Seneca; and the same sentiment is clearly laid down in Plato, who maintains, that images are inanimate, and that all the honour paid to them has respect to the gods whom they represent. But as to the vulgar, they were stupid enough to believe the statues themselves to be gods, and to pay divine worship to stocks and stones.\n\nSoon after the flood, idolatry seems to have been the prevailing religion of all the world: for wherever we cast our eyes at the time of Abraham, we scarcely see anything but false worship and idolatry. And it appears from Scripture, that Abraham's forefathers, and even Abraham himself, were for a time idolaters.\n\nThe Hebrews were indeed expressly forbidden to make any representation of God: they were not to much as to look upon an idol: and from the time of the Maccabees to the destruction of Jerusalem, the Jews extended this precept to the making the figure of any man: by the law of Moses, they were obliged to destroy all the images they found, and were forbidden to apply any of the gold or silver to their own use, that no one might receive the least profit from anything belonging to an idol. Of this the Jews, after they had imitated for their idolatry, were so sensible, that they thought it unlawful to use any vessel that had been employed in sacrificing to a false god, to warm themselves with the wood of a grove after it was cut down, or to shelter themselves under its shade.\n\nBut the preaching of the Christian religion, wherever it prevailed, entirely rooted out idolatry; as did also that of Mahomet, which is built on the worship of one God. It must not, however, be forgotten, that the Protestant Christians charge those of the church of Rome, with paying an idolatrous kind of worship to the pictures or images of saints and martyrs: before these they burn lamps and wax candles; before these, they burn incense, and, kneeling, offer up their vows and petitions; they, like the Pagans, believe that the saint to whom the image is dedicated, resides in a particular manner about its shrine, and works miracles by the intervention of its image; and that if the image was destroyed or taken away, the saint would no longer perform any miracle in that place.","sp":138,"ep":139},{"h":"IDOMENEUS","t":"in fabulous history, succeeded his father Deucalion on the throne of Crete.

This was no other than his son, who came to congratulate his father upon his safe return. Idomeneus performed his promise to the god; and the inhumanity and ruthlessness of this sacrifice rendered him so odious in the eyes of his subjects, that he left Crete, and migrated in quest of a settlement. He came to Italy, and founded a city on the coast of Calabria, which he called Salentum. He died in extreme old age, after he had had the satisfaction of seeing his new kingdom flourish and his subjects happy. According to the Greek scholiast of Lycophron, v. 1217, Idomeneus, during his absence in the Trojan war, intrusted the management of his kingdom to Leucos, to whom he promised his daughter Clitihere in marriage at his return. Leucos at first governed with moderation, but he was persuaded by Nauplius king of Euboea to put to death Meda the wife of his master, with her daughter Clitihere, and to seize the kingdom.

In this last capacity, he signalized himself by his valour; and was wounded in both legs at the siege of Pamplona, in 1521. To this circumstance the Jesuits owe their origin; for, while he was under cure of his wound, a Life of the Saints was put into his hands, which determined him to forsake the military for the ecclesiastical profession. His first devout exercise was to dedicate himself to the blest virgin as her knight; he then went a pilgrimage to the Holy Land; and on his return to Europe, he continued his theological studies in the universities of Spain, though he was then 33 years of age. After this he went to Paris; and in France laid the foundation of this new order, the institutes of which he presented to Pope Paul III., who made many objections to them, but at last in 1540 confirmed the institution. The founder died in 1555, and left his disciples two famous books; 1. Spiritual exercises; 2. Constitutions or rules of the order. But it must be remembered, that though these avowed institutes contain many privileges obnoxious to the welfare of society, the most diabolical are contained in the private rules, intitled Monita secreta, which were not discovered till towards the close of the last century; and most writers attribute these, and even the Constitutions, to Laynez, the second general of the order.","sp":175,"ep":175},{"h":"IGNATIUS","t":"St., surnamed Theophrytus, one of the apostolical fathers of the church, was born in Syria, and educated under the apostle and evangelist St John, and intimately acquainted with some other of the apostles, especially St Peter and St Paul. Being fully instructed in the doctrines of Christianity, he was, for his eminent parts and piety, ordained by St John, and confirmed about the year 67 bishop of Antioch, by the two apostles, who first planted Christianity in that city, where the disciples also were first called Christians. Antioch was then not only the metropolis of Syria, but a city the most famous and renowned of any in the east, and the ancient seat of the Roman emperors, as well as of the viceroys and governors. In this important seat he continued to sit somewhat above 40 years, both an honour and safeguard of the Christian religion, till the year 107, when Trajan the emperor, flushed with a victory which he had lately obtained over the Scythians and Daci, about the ninth year of his reign, came to Antioch to make preparations for a war against the Parthians and Armenians. He entered the city with the pomp and solemnities of a triumph; and, as his first care usually was about the concerns of religion, he began presently to inquire into that affair. Christianity had by this time made such a progress, that the Romans grew jealous and uneasy at it. This prince, therefore, had already commenced a persecution against the Christians in other parts of the empire, which he now resolved to carry on here. However, as he was naturally of a mild\nIgnatius, mild disposition, though he ordered the laws to be put in force against them if convicted, yet he forbade them to be sought after.\n\nIn this state of affairs, Ignatius, thinking it more prudent to go himself than stay to be sent for, of his own accord presented himself to the emperor; and, it is said, there palled a long and particular discourse between them, wherein the emperor expressing a surprise how he dared to transgress the laws, the bishop took the opportunity to assert his own innocence, and to explain and vindicate his faith and freedom. The issue of this was, that he was cast into prison, and this sentence passed upon him, That, being incurably overrun with superstition, he should be carried bound by soldiers to Rome, and there thrown as a prey to wild beasts.\n\nHe was first conducted to Seleucia, a port of Syria, at about 16 miles distance, the place were Paul and Barnabas set sail for Cyprus. Arriving at Smyrna in Ionia, he went to visit Polycarp bishop of that place, and was himself visited by the clergy of the Asian churches round the country. In return for that kindness, he wrote letters to several churches, as the Ephesians, Magnesians, and Trallians, besides the Romans, for their instruction and establishment in the faith; one of these was addressed to the Christians at Rome, to acquaint them with his present state, and passionate desire not to be hindered in the course of martyrdom which he was now hastening to accomplish.\n\nHis guard, a little impatient of their stay, set sail with him for Troas, a noted city of the lesser Phrygia, not far from the ruins of old Troy; where, at his arrival, he was much refreshed with the news he received of the persecution ceasing in the church of Antioch: hither also several churches sent their messengers to pay their respects to him; and hence too he dispatched two epistles, one to the church of Philadelphia, and the other to that of Smyrna; and, together with this last, as Eusebius relates, he wrote privately to Polycarp, recommending to him the care and instruction of the church of Antioch.\n\nFrom Troas they sailed to Neapolis, a maritime town in Macedonia; thence to Philippi, a Roman colony, where they were entertained with all imaginable kindness and courtesy, and conducted forwards on their journey, passing on foot through Macedonia and Epirus, till they came to Epidamnum, a city of Dalmatia; where again taking shipping, they sailed through the Adriatic, and arrived at Rhegium, a port-town in Italy; directing their course thence through the Tyrrhenian sea to Puteoli, whence Ignatius desired to proceed by land, ambitious to trace the same way by which St Paul went to Rome: but this wish was not complied with; and, after a stay of 24 hours, a prosperous wind quickly carried them to the Roman port, the great harbour and station for their navy, built near Oria, at the mouth of the Tyber, about 16 miles from Rome; whither the martyr longed to come, as much desirous to be at the end of his race, as his keepers, weary of their voyage, were to be at the end of their journey.\n\nThe Christians at Rome, daily expecting his arrival, were come out to meet and entertain him, and accordingly received him with a mixture of joy and sorrow; but when some of them intimated, that possibly the populace might be taken off from desiring his death, he expressed a pious indignation, intreating them to cast no rubs in his way, nor do anything that might hinder him; now he was hastening to his crown. There are many such expressions as this in his epistle to the Romans, which plainly show that he was highly ambitious of the crown of martyrdom. Yet it does not appear that he rashly sought or provoked danger. Among other expressions of his ardour for suffering, he said, that the wild beasts had feared and refused to touch some that had been thrown to them, which he hoped would not happen to him. Being conducted to Rome, he was presented to the prefect, and the emperor's letters probably delivered concerning him. The interval before his martyrdom was spent in prayers for the peace and prosperity of the church. That his punishment might be the more pompous and public, one of their solemn festivals, the time of their Saturnalia, and that part of it when they celebrated their Sigillaria, was pitched on for his execution; at which time it was their custom to entertain the people with the bloody conflicts of gladiators, and the hunting and fighting with wild beasts. Accordingly, on the 13th kal. January, i.e. December 20, he was brought out into the amphitheatre, and the lions being let loose upon him, quickly dispatched their meal, leaving nothing but a few of the hardest of his bones. These remains were gathered up by two deacons who had been the companions of his journey; and being transported to Antioch, were interred in the cemetery, without the gate that leads to Daphne; whence, by the command of the emperor Theodore, they were removed with great pomp and solemnity to the Tycheon, a temple within the city, dedicated to the public genius of it, but now consecrated to the memory of the martyr.\n\nSt Ignatius stands at the head of those Antinicene fathers, who have occasionally delivered their opinions in defence of the true divinity of Christ, whom he calls the Son of God, and his eternal world. He is also reckoned the great champion of the doctrine of the episcopal order, as distinct and superior to that of the presbyter and deacon.

Instead of a throne, Macdonald stood on a stone seven feet square, in which there was an impression made to receive his feet; here he was crowned and anointed by the bishop of Argyle and seven inferior priests, in presence of the chieftains. This stone still exists. The ceremony (after the new lord had collected his kindred and vassals) was truly patriarchal. After putting on his armour, his helmet, and his sword, he took an oath to rule as his ancestors had done; that is, to govern as a father would his children; his people in return swore that they would pay the same obedience to him as children would to their parent. The dominions of this potentate, about the year 1586, consisted only of Ilay, Jura, Knapdale, and Cantyre; so reduced were they from what they had been before the deprivation of the great earl of Rothes in the reign of James III. Near this is another little isle, where he assembled his council, \"Ilan na Corlie,\" or \"the isle of council;\" where 13 judges constantly sat to decide differences among his subjects; and received for their trouble the 11th part of the value of the affair tried before them. In the first isle were buried the wives and children of the lords of the isles; but their own persons were deposited in the more sacred ground of Iona. On the shores of the lake are some marks of the quarters of his Carnauch and Gilli-glashees, \"the military of the isles;\" the first signifying a strong man, the last a grim-looking fellow. The first were light-armed, and fought with darts and daggers; the last with sharp hatchets. These are the troops that Shakespeare alludes to, when he speaks of a Donald, who\n\nFrom the Western isles\nOf Kerns and Gallow-glashees was supplied.\n\nBesides those already mentioned, the lords had a house and chapel at Laggan, on the south side of Lochindaal: a strong castle on a rock in the sea, at Dunowall, at the south-east end of the country; for they made this isle their residence after their expulsion from that of Man in 1304.\u2014There is a tradition, that while the isle of Man was part of the kingdom of the isles, the rents were for a time paid in this country: those in silver were paid on a rock, still called Creig-a-nisne, or \"the rock of the silver rent;\" the other, Creig-a-nairrid, or \"the rock of rents in kind.\" These lie opposite to each other, at the mouth of a harbour on the south side of this isle. There are several forts built on the isles in fresh water lakes, and divers caverns in different parts of the isle, which have been used occasionally as places of strength. The isle is divided into four parishes, viz. Kildalton, Killarow, Kilchoman, and Kilmenie. The produce is corn of different kinds; such as bear, which sometimes yields eleven fold; and oats six fold. Much flax is raised here, and about \u00a32000. worth sold out of the isle in yarn, which might better be manufactured on the spot, to give employ to the poor natives. Notwithstanding the excellency of the land, above \u00a31000. worth of meal is annually imported (a). Ale is frequently made in this isle of the young tops of heath, mixing two-thirds of that plant with one of malt, sometimes adding hops. Boethius relates, that this liquor was much used among the Piets; but when that nation was extirpated by the Scots, the secret of making it perished with them. Numbers of cattle are bred here, and about 1700 are annually exported at the\n\n(a) This might have been the case in the time of Pennant, from whom the above account is taken. It is not now, although the population has increased to nearly 12,000. Il\u00e0 indeed enjoys the peculiar advantages of being not only a grazing but a corn country, and can thus afford a very considerable exportation of both species of produce. The number of cattle now exported far exceeds that stated above by Pennant.\nthe price of 50 shillings each. The island is often overcrowded, and numbers die in March for want of fodder. None but milch-cows are housed; cattle of all other kinds, except the fiddle-horses, run out during winter.\n\nThe number of inhabitants, when Ilay was visited by Pennant, is computed to have been between seven and eight thousand. About 700, says he, are employed in the mines and in the fishery; the rest are gentlemen-farmers, and subtenants or servants. The women spin. The servants are paid in kind; the sixth part of the crop. They have houses gratis; the master gives them the seed for the first year, and lends them horses to plough annually the land annexed.\n\nThe quadrupeds of this island, as enumerated by Mr Pennant*, are dogs, weasels, otters, and hares: the last small, dark-coloured, and bad runners. The birds are eagles, peregrine falcons, black and red game, and a very few ptarmigans. Red-breasted goosanders breed on the shore among the loofe stones, wild geese in the moors, and herons in the island in Loch-guirm. The fish are plaice, fineardab, large dabs, mullets, balan, lump-fish, black goby, greater dragonet, and that rare fish the lepadogaiter of M. Gouan. Vipers swarm in the heath; the natives retain the vulgar error of their stinging with their forked tongues (b); that a sword on which the poison has fallen will hit in water like a red-hot iron; and that a poultice of human ordure is an infallible cure for the bite.\n\nIn this island, Mr Pennant informs us, several ancient diversions and superstitions are still preserved: the last indeed are almost extinct, or at most lurk only amongst the very meanest of the people. The late wakes or funerals, like those of the Romans, were attended with sports, and dramatic entertainments composed of many parts, and the actors often changed their dresses suitably to their characters. The subject of the drama was historical, and preserved by memory.\u2014The power of fascination is as strongly believed here as it was by the shepherds of Italy in times of old.\n\nNescio quis teneros oculis milii fascinat agnos?\n\nBut here the power of the evil eye affects more the milch-cows than lambs. If the good housewife perceives the effect of the malicious on any of her kine, she takes as much milk as she can drain from the enchanted herd (for the witch commonly leaves very little). She then boils it with certain herbs, and adds to them flints and untempered steel; after that she secures the door, and invokes the three sacred persons. This puts the witch into such an agony, that she comes willing-willing to the house, begs to be admitted, to obtain relief by touching the powerful pot: the good woman then makes her terms; the witch restores the milk to the cattle, and in return is freed from her pains. But sometimes, to save the trouble of those charms (for it may happen that the disorder may arise from other causes than an evil-eye), the trial is made by immersing in milk a certain herb, and if the cows are supernaturally affected, it instantly distils blood. The unsuccessful lover revenges himself on his happy rival by charms potent as those of the shepherd Alpheibaeus, and exactly similar:\n\nNettle tribus nodis ternor, Amarylli, colorer:\nNette, Amarylli, modo.\n\nDonald takes three threads of different hues, and ties three knots on each, three times imprecating the most cruel disappointments on the nuptial bed: but the bridegroom, to avert the harm, stands at the altar with an untied shoe, and puts a sixpence beneath his foot.\n\nHistory furnishes very few materials for the great events or revolutions of Ilay. It seems to have been long a seat of empire, probably jointly with the Isle of Man, as being most conveniently situated for the government of the rest of the Hebrides; for Crovan the Norwegian, after his conquest of that island in 1066, retired and finished his days in Ilay. There are more Danish or Norwegian names of places in this island than any other; almost all the present farms derive their titles from them; such as Peribus, Torridale, Torribolfe, and the like. On the retreat of the Danes it became the seat of their successors the lords of the illes; and continued, after their power was broken, in the reign of James III. in their descendants the Macdonalds, who held or ought to have held it from the crown. It was in the possession of a Sir James Macdonald, in the year 1598, the same who won the battle of Traill-dhruinard. His power gave umbrage to James VI. who directed the lord of Macleod, Cameron of Lochiel, and the Macneiles of Barra, to support the Macleans in another invasion. The rival parties met near the hill of Benbigger, east of Kilbarrow; a fierce engagement ensued, and the Macdonalds were defeated and almost entirely cut off. Sir James escaped to Spain; but returned in 1620, was pardoned, received a pension, and died the same year at Glasgow; and in him expired the last of the great Macdonalds. But the king, irritated by the disturbances raised by private wars waged between these and other clans, refused the grant made by his predecessor, and transferred it to Sir John Campbell of Calder, who held it on paying an annual feu-duty of five hundred pounds sterling, which is paid to this day. The island was granted to Sir John as a reward for his undertaking the conquest; but the family considered it as a dear acquisition, by the loss of many gallant followers, and by the expenses incurred in support of it.","sp":179,"ep":180},{"h":"ILCHESTER","t":"a town of Somersetshire in England, situated on the river Yeo, 129 miles from London, is so called, because it once had a castle, and stands on the river Ivel. It is a place of great antiquity, as appears by the Roman coins which are sometimes dug up. It is likewise evident, from the ruins and from two towers on the bridge, that it was once a large place, and encompassed with a double wall. It also had several parish-churches, though now but one. It is governed by two bailiffs, who with the twelve burgesses are lords of the manor.

Ilchester is an earldom in the Fox family.","sp":180,"ep":181},{"h":"ILDEFONSO","t":"Sr., a celebrated royal residence of Spain, distant about two miles from Segovia. It was erected by Philip V. in the midst of a solitary wood, and in the bosom of steep mountains. It is chiefly remarkable for its gardens. There is nothing magnificent in the palace, particularly in its exterior appearance. The front on the side of the garden is of the Corinthian order, and not destitute of elegance. Here are the king's apartments, which look upon a parterre surrounded with vases and marble statues, and a cascade which, for the richness of its decorations, may be compared with the finest of the kind.\n\nThe purity and clearness of the water is indeed incomparable. Philip V. could not, in this respect, be better served by nature. From the mountains which thine the palace descend several rivulets, which supply the reservoirs. These waters answer the double purpose of supplying numerous fountains, and of diffusing life and verdure through the magnificent gardens, the sight of which alone is a sufficient recompense for a journey into Spain. They are on the inside a league in circumference. The inequality of the ground affords every moment new points of view. The principal alleys answer to different summits of neighbouring mountains; and one in particular produces the most agreeable effect. It is terminated at one end by the grand front of the palace. From this point are seen, at one view, five fountains, ornamented with elegant groups, rising into an amphitheatre, above which appear the summits of lofty mountains. The most elevated of these groups is that of Andromeda fastened to a rock. When seen at a little distance it is perhaps defective, because the rock appears too diminutive by the side of the monster which threatens Andromeda; and of Perseus, by whom it is attacked; but the whole contributes to the beauty of the view. The most remarkable of the five groups is that of Neptune.\n\n\"Genius (says M. Bourgoanne) prefixed at the composition and in the choice of the situation; the deity of the ocean appears erect, surrounded by the marine court. His attitude, his threatening countenance, and the manner of holding his trident, announce that he has just imposed silence on the mutinous waves; and the calm which reigns in the basin, defended from every wind by the triple wall of verdure by which it is surrounded, seems to indicate that he has not issued his commands in vain. Often have I seated myself, with Virgil in my hand, by the side of this silent water, under the shade of the verdant foliage, nor ever did I fail to recollect the famous Quos Ego?\n\n\"There are other fountains worthy of the attention of the curious; such as that of Latona, where the limpid heaves, some perpendicularly, and others in every direction, fall from the horde throats of the Lycian peasants, half transformed into frogs, and spouting them forth in such abundance, that the statue of the goddess disappears under the wide mantle of liquid crystal; that also of Diana in the bath, fur-\n\nVol. XI. Part I.\nIldelfonso, fenced by thick shades. Some hollows, overshadowed by arching trees, seem to be the abodes of the Naiades. Disturb them not by indireet loquacity, but silently admire and meditate.\n\n\"It is impossible, however, not to go to the source of these waters; let us follow the meandering of their course, and observe the winding paths which there terminate, after appearing and disappearing at intervals through the copse. Let us listen to the bubbling of the rivulets which from time to time escape from our sight, and hasten to the rendezvous assigned them by the descendants of Louis XIV. They formerly lost themselves in the valleys, where they quenched the thirst of their humble inhabitants, but are now consecrated to the pleasures of kings. Ascending the back of the pyramidal mountain, behind which their source is concealed, we arrive at the wall which confines a part of them in the garden, and which was hidden by the trees; nothing, however, ought here to recall to mind exclusive property and slavery. Woods, waters, and the majestic solitude of mountains, which are at a distance from the tumult of courts and cities, are the property of every man.\u2014Beyond this wall, which forms the exterior enclosure of the gardens, is an empty and flat ground, where the infant Don Louis, brother to the king, chose a place which he consecrated to cultivation. Farther on, the mountain becomes more steep, and is covered with trees to its summit. Let us now return; as we seek amusement and not fatigue. We will follow the course of the waters, they descend in bubbling streams from one level of the gardens to the other. In their course, in one place they water the feet of the trees, in others they crook an alley to nourish more slowly the plants of a parterre. From the basin of Andromeda they run between two rows of trees in the form of a canal, the too sudden inclination of which is taken off by cascades and windings. They receive and carry with them from the gardens the rivulets; which after having played amongst the gods and nymphs, and moistened the throats of the swans, tritons, and lions, humbly descend under ground, and run on into the bosom of the neighbouring meadows, where they fulfill purposes less brilliant but more useful.\n\n\"We must not quit these magnificent gardens without stopping at a place which appears to promise much, but produces not any very great effect. This is the square of the eight alleys, Plaza de las ocho calles. In the centre is the group of Pandora, the only one which is of whitened stone, all the others are of white marble or lead painted of a bronze colour. Eight alleys answer to this centre, and each is terminated by a fountain. Plots of verdure fill up the intervals between the alleys, and each has an altar under a portico of white marble by the side of a basin sacred to some god or goddess. These eight altars, placed at equal distances, and decorated among other jets-d'eau, have two which rise in the form of tapers on each side of their divinities. This cold regularity displeased Philip V., who a little before his death, when visiting the gardens, made some severe reproaches to the inventor upon the subject. Philip had not the pleasure of completely enjoying what he had created; death surprized him when the works he had begun were but half finished. The undertaking was however the most expensive one of his reign. The finances of Spain, so deranged under the princes of the house of Austria, (thanks to the wife calculations of Orry, to the subsidies of France, and still more to the courageous efforts of the faithful Castilians) would have been sufficient for three long and ruinous wars, and for all the operations of a monarchy which Philip V. had conquered and formed anew, as well as to have resettled the flocks of ambition and political intrigue; but they sunk beneath the expensive efforts of magnificence.\"\n\nIt is singular that the castle and gardens of St Ildefonso should have cost about 45,000,000 of piastras, precisely the sum in which Philip died indebted. This enormous expense will appear credible, when it is known that the situation of the royal palace was at the beginning of this century the sloping top of a pile of rocks; that it was necessary to dig and hew out the stones, and in several places to level the rock; to cut out of its sides a paillage for a hundred different canals, to carry vegetative earth to every place in which it was intended to facilitate cultivation for fertility, and to work a mine to clear a paillage to the roots of the numerous trees which are there planted. All these efforts were crowned with success. In the orchards, kitchen-gardens, and parterres, there are but few flowers, espaliers, or plants, which do not thrive; but the trees, naturally of a lofty growth, and which consequently must strike their roots deep into the earth, already prove the insufficiency of art when it attempts to struggle against nature. Many of them languish with withered trunks, and with difficulty keep life in their almost naked branches. Every year it is necessary to call in the aid of gunpowder to make new beds for those which are to supply their place; and none of them are covered with that tufted foliage which belongs only to those that grow in a natural soil. In a word, there are in the groves of St Ildefonso, marble statues, basins, cascades, limpid waters, verdure, and delightful prospects, everything but that which would be more charming than all the rest, thick shades.\n\nThe court of Spain comes hither annually during the heat of the dog-days. It arrives towards the end of July, and returns at the beginning of October. The situation of St Ildefonso, upon the declivity of the mountains which separate the two Castiles, and fronting a vast plain where there is no obstacle to the paillage of the north wind, renders this abode delightful in summer. The mornings and evenings of the hottest days are agreeably cool. Yet as this palace is upwards of 20 leagues from Madrid, and half of the road which leads to it crosses the broad tops of mountains, extremely steep in many places, it is much more agreeable to the lovers of the chase and solitude than to others.","sp":181,"ep":182},{"h":"ILERDA","t":"in Ancient Geography, the capital of the Ilargentes; situated on an eminence between the rivers Sicoris and Cinga: An unhappy city, often besieged, and often taken, because lying exposed to the incursions from Gaul; and under Gallienus it was destroyed by the Germans.

Besides the writers of books, there were artists whose profession was to ornament and paint manuscripts, who were called illuminators; the writers of books first finished their part, and the illuminators embellished them with ornamented letters and paintings. We frequently find blanks left in manuscripts for the illuminators, which were never filled up. Some of the ancient manuscripts are gilt and burnished in a style superior to later times. Their colours were excellent, and their skill in preparing them must have been very great.\n\nThe practice of introducing ornaments, drawings, emblematical figures, and even portraits, into manuscripts, is of great antiquity. Varro wrote the lives of 700 illustrious Romans, which he enriched with their portraits, as Pliny attests in his Natural History (lib. xxxv. chap. 2.). Pomponius Atticus, the friend of Cicero, was the author of a work on the actions of the great men amongst the Romans, which he ornamented with their portraits, as appears in his life by Cornelius Nepos (chap. 18.). But these works have not been transmitted to posterity. There are, however, many precious documents remaining, which exhibit the advancement and decline of the arts in different ages and countries. These ineffable paintings and illuminations display the manners, customs, habits ecclesiastical, civil, and military, weapons and instruments of war, utensils and architecture of the ancients; they are of the greatest use in illustrating many important facts relative\nIlluminative to the history of the times in which they were executed. In these treasures of antiquity are preserved a great number of specimens of Grecian and Roman art, which were executed before the arts and sciences fell into neglect and contempt. The manuscripts containing these specimens form a valuable part of the riches preserved in the principal libraries of Europe. The Royal, Cottonian, and Harleian libraries, as also those in the two universities in England, the Vatican at Rome, the imperial at Vienna, the royal at Paris, St Mark's at Venice, and many others.\n\nA very ancient MS. of Genesis, which was in the Cottonian library, and almost destroyed by a fire in 1734, contained 250 curious paintings in water colours. Twenty-one fragments, which escaped the fire, are engraved by the society of antiquarians of London. Several specimens of curious paintings also appear in Lambecius's catalogue of the imperial library at Vienna, particularly in vol. iii., where 48 drawings of nearly equal antiquity with those in the Cottonian library are engraved; and several others may be found in various catalogues of the Italian libraries. The drawings in the Vatican Virgil made in the fourth century, before the arts were entirely neglected, illustrate the different subjects treated of by the Roman poet. A miniature drawing is prefixed to each of the gospels brought over to England by St Augustin in the 6th century, which is preserved in the library of Corpus Christi college, Cambridge; in the compartments of those drawings are depicted representations of several transactions in each gospel. The curious drawings, and elaborate ornaments in St Cuthbert's gospels made by St Ethelwald, and now in the Cottonian library, exhibit a striking specimen of the state of the arts in England in the 7th century. The same may be observed with respect to the drawings in the ancient copy of the four gospels preserved in the cathedral church of Litchfield, and those in the Codex Ruthwonthianus in the Bodleian library at Oxford. The life of St Paul the hermit, now remaining in Corpus Christi college, Cambridge, (G. 2.), affords an example of the style of drawing and ornamenting letters in England in the 8th century; and the copy of Prudentius's Physiognomia in the Cottonian library (Cleop. c. 8.) exhibits the style of drawing in Italy in the 9th century. Of the 10th century there are Roman drawings of a singular kind in the Harleian library (No. 2820). Nos. 2820, 1802, and 432, in the same library, contain specimens of ornamented letters, which are to be found in Irish MSS. from the 12th to the 14th century. Cadmon's Poetical Paraphrase of the book of Genesis, written in the 11th century, which is preserved amongst F. Junius's MSS. in the Bodleian library, exhibits many specimens of utensils, weapons, instruments of music, and implements of husbandry used by the Anglo-Saxons. The like may be seen in extracts from the Pentateuch of the same age in the Cottonian library (Claud. B. 4.). The manuscript copy of Terence in the Bodleian library (D. 17.) displays the dresses, masks, &c. worn by comedians in the 12th century, if not earlier. The very elegant Psalter in the library of Trinity college, Cambridge, exhibits specimens of the art of drawing in England in the same century. The Virgil in the Lambeth library of the 13th century (No. 471.), written in Italy, shows both by the drawings and writing, that the Italians produced works much inferior to ours at that period. The copy of the Apocalypse in the same library (No. 259.), contains a curious example of the manner of painting in the 14th century.\u2014The beautiful paintings in the history of the latter part of the reign of King Richard II. in the Harleian library (No. 1349.), afford curious specimens of manners and customs, both civil and military, at the close of the 14th and in the beginning of the 15th century; as does No. 2278. in the same library.\u2014Many other instances might be produced; but those who desire farther information may consult Strutt's Regal and Ecclesiastical Antiquities, 4to, and his Horda-Angel-cymyn lately published in 3 vols.\n\nThis art was much practised by the clergy, and even by some in the highest stations in the church. \"The famous Osmond (says Bromton), who was consecrated bishop of Salisbury, A.D. 1076, did not disdain to spend some part of his time in writing, binding, and illuminating books.\" Mr Strutt, as already noticed, has given the public an opportunity of forming some judgment of the degree of delicacy and art with which these illuminations were executed, by publishing prints of a prodigious number of them, in his \"Regal and Ecclesiastical Antiquities of England,\" and \"View of the Customs, &c. of England.\" In the first of these works we are presented with the genuine portraits, in miniature, of all the kings, and several of the queens of England, from Edward the Confessor to Henry VII., mostly in their crowns and royal robes, together with the portraits of many other eminent persons of both sexes.\n\nThe illuminators and painters of this period seem to have been in possession of a considerable number of colouring materials, and to have known the arts of preparing and mixing them, so as to form a great variety of colours: for in the specimens of their miniature-paintings, that are still extant, we perceive not only the five primary colours, but also various combinations of them. Though Strutt's prints do not exhibit the bright and vivid colours of the originals, they give us equally a view, not only of the persons and dresses of our ancestors, but also of their customs, manners, arts, and employments, their arms, ships, houses, furniture, &c., and enable us to judge of their skill in drawing. The figures in these paintings are often stiff and formal; but the ornaments are in general fine and delicate, and the colours clear and bright, particularly the gold and azure. In some of these illuminations the passions are strongly painted.

They placed them in the vestibules of their houses; and they were to stay there, even if the houses happened to be sold, it being accounted impious to displace them. Appius Claudius was the first who brought them into the temples, in the year of Rome 259, and he added inscriptions to them, showing the origin of the persons represented, and their brave and virtuous achievements.\u2014It was not, however, allowed for all, who had the images of their ancestors in their houses, to have them carried at their funerals; this was a thing only granted to such as had honourably discharged themselves of their offices; for those who failed in this respect forfeited that privilege; and in case they had been guilty of any great crime, their images were broken in pieces. See IGNOBILES and Jus.\n\nThe Jews absolutely condemn all images, and do not so much as suffer any statues or figures in their houses, much less in their synagogues or places of worship.\n\nThe use and adoration of images are things that have been a long time controverted in the world.\n\nIt is plain, from the practice of the primitive church, recorded by the earlier fathers, that Christians, for the first three centuries after Christ, and the greater part of the fourth, neither worshipped images nor used them in their worship. However, the greater part of the Popish divines maintain, that the use and worship of images were as ancient as the Christian religion itself; to prove this, they allege a decree, said to have been made in a council held by the Apostles at Antioch, commanding the faithful, that they may not err about the object of their worship, to make images of Christ and worship them. Baron. ad ann. 102. But no notice is taken of this decree, till 700 years after the Apostolic times, after the dispute about images had commenced. The first instance that occurs in any credible author of images among Christians, is that recorded by Tertullian de Pudicit. c. 10. of certain cups, or chalices, as Bellarmine pretends, on which was represented the parable of the good shepherd carrying the lost sheep on his shoulders: but this instance only proves, that the church, at that time did not think emblematical figures unlawful ornaments of cups or chalices. Another instance is taken from Eusebius, Hist. Eccel. lib. vii. cap. 18. who says, that in his time there were to be seen two brass statues in the city of Paneas or Cesarea Philippi; the one of a woman on her knees, with her arms stretched out, the other of a man over against her, with his hand extended to receive her; these statues were said to be the images of our Saviour\nand the woman whom he cured of an illifie of blood. From the foot of the statue representing our Saviour, says the historian, sprung up an exotic plant, which, as soon as it grew to touch the border of his garment, was said to cure all sorts of distempers. Eusebius, however, vouches none of these things; nay, he supposes that the woman who erected this statue of our Saviour was a pagan, and ascribes it to a pagan custom. Farther, Philostorgius, Eccl. Hist. lib. vii. c. 3, expressly says, that this statue was carefully preserved by the Christians, but that they paid no kind of worship to it, because it is not lawful for Christians to worship bras, or any other matter. The primitive Christians abstained from the worship of images, not, as the Papists pretend, from tenderness to heathen idolaters, but because they thought it unlawful in itself to make any images of the Deity. Justin Mart. Apol. ii. p. 44. Clem. Alex. Strom. i. Strom. i. and Protr. p. 46. Aug. de Civit. Dei. lib. vii. c. 5. and lib. iv. c. 32. Id. de Fide et Symbol. c. 7. Lactant. lib. ii. c. 3. Tertull. Apol. c. 12. Arnob. lib. vi. p. 202. Some of the fathers, as Tertullian, Clemens Alexandrinus, and Origen, were of opinion, that, by the second commandment, the arts of painting and engraving were rendered unlawful to a Christian, flinging them evil and wicked arts. Tert. de Idol. cap. 3. Clem. Alex. Admon. ad. Gent. p. 41. Orig. contra Celsum. lib. vi. p. 182. The use of images in churches as ornaments, was first introduced by some Christians in Spain, in the beginning of the fourth century; but the practice was condemned as a dangerous innovation, in a council held at Eliberis in 325. Epiphanius, in a letter preserved by Jerome, tom. iii. ep. 6. bears strong testimony against images, and may be considered as one of the first Iconoclasts. The custom of admitting pictures of saints and martyrs into the churches (for this was the first source of image-worship) was rare in the latter end of the fourth century; but became common in the fifth; however, they were still considered only as ornaments; and even in this view, they met with very considerable opposition. In the following century the custom of thus adorning churches became almost universal, both in the east and west. Petavius expressly says (de Incar. lib. xv. cap. 14.), that no statues were yet allowed in the churches; because they bore too near a resemblance to the idols of the Gentiles. Towards the close of the fourth or beginning of the fifth century, images, which were introduced by way of ornament, and then used as an aid to devotion, began to be actually worshipped. However, it continued to be the doctrine of the church in the sixth and in the beginning of the seventh century, that images were to be used only as helps to devotion, and not as objects of worship. The worship of them was condemned in the strongest terms by Pope Gregory the Great; as appears by two letters of his written in 601. From this time to the beginning of the eighth century, there occurs no single instance of any worship given or allowed to be given to images by any council or assembly of bishops whatever. But they were commonly worshipped by the monks and populace in the beginning of the eighth century; insomuch, that in the year 726, when Leo published his famous edict, it had already spread into all the provinces subject to the empire.\n\nThe Lutherans condemn the Calvinists for breaking the images in the churches of the Catholics, looking on it as a kind of sacrilege; and yet they condemn the Romanists (who are professed image-worshippers) as idolaters; nor can the last keep pace with the Greeks, who go far beyond them in this point; which has occasioned abundance of disputes among them. See Iconoclasts.\n\nThe Mahometans have a perfect aversion to images; which was what led them to destroy most of the beautiful monuments of antiquity, both sacred and profane, at Constantinople.\n\nImage, in Rhetoric, also signifies a lively description of any thing in discourse.\n\nImages in discourse are defined by Longinus, to be, in general, any thoughts proper to produce expressions, and which present a kind of picture to the mind.\n\nBut, in the more limited sense, he says, images are such discourses as come from us, when, by a kind of enthusiasm, or an extraordinary emotion of the soul, we seem to see the things whereof we speak, and present them before the eyes of those who hear us.\n\nImages, in rhetoric, have a very different use from what they have among the poets: the end principally proposed in poetry is, astonishment and surprize; whereas the thing chiefly aimed at in prose, is to paint things naturally, and to show them clearly. They have this, however, in common, that they both tend to move, each in its kind.\n\nThe images, or pictures, are of vast use, to give weight, magnificence, and strength, to a discourse. They warm and animate it; and when managed with art, according to Longinus, seem, as it were, to tame and subdue the hearer, and put him in the power of the speaker.\n\nImage, in Optics, a figure in the form of any object, made by the rays of light issuing from the several points of it, and meeting in so many other points, either at the bottom of the eye, or on any other ground, or on any transparent medium, where there is no surface to reflect them. Thus we are said to see all objects by means of their images formed in the eye.\n\nImaginary Quantities, or Impossible Quantities, in Algebra, are the even roots of negative quantities; which expressions are imaginary, or impossible, or opposed to real quantities; as $\\sqrt{-a}$, or $4\\sqrt{-a}$, &c. For as every even power of any quantity whatever, whether positive or negative, is necessarily positive, or having the sign $+$, because $+$ by $+$, or $-$ by $-$, gives equally $+$; hence it follows that every even power, as the square for instance, which is negative, or having the sign $-$, has no possible root; and therefore the even roots of such powers or quantities are said to be impossible or imaginary. The mixt expressions arising from imaginary quantities joined to real ones, are also imaginary; as $a - \\sqrt{-a}$, or $b + \\sqrt{-a}$.\n\nImaginary Roots of an equation, are those roots or values of the unknown quantity, which contain some imaginary quantity. Thus, the roots of the equation $xx + a = 0$, are the two imaginary quantities $+\\sqrt{-a}$ and $-\\sqrt{-a}$, or $+\\sqrt{-a}$ and $-\\sqrt{-a}$.\n\nImagination, a power or faculty of the mind, whereby it conceives and forms ideas of things communicated to it by the outward organs of sense.

The word properly signifies what we call a prelate, antistes, one who presides over others; but the Mussulmans frequently apply it to a person who has the care and tendency of a mosque, who is always there at first, and reads prayers to the people, which they repeat after him.\n\nIMAM is also applied, by way of excellence, to the four chiefs or founders of the four principal sects in the Mahometan religion. Thus Ali is the imam of the Perisan, or of the sect of the Schiites; Abu-beker the imam of the Sunnites, which is the sect followed by the Turks; Saphii, or Safi-y, the imam of another sect, &c.\n\nThe Mahometans do not agree among themselves about this imamate or dignity of the imams. Some think it of divine right and attached to a single family, as the pontificate of Aaron.\u2014Others hold, that it is indeed of divine right, but deny it to be so attached to any single family, as that it may not be transferred to another. They add, that the imam is to be clear of all gross sins; and that otherwise he may be deposed, and his dignity may be conferred on another. However this be, it is certain, that after an imam has once been owned as such by the Mussulmans, he who denies that his authority comes immediately from God is accounted impious; he who does not obey him is a rebel; and he who pretends to contradict what he says is esteemed a fool, among the orthodox of that religion.

See GEORGIA.\n\nThe capital, where Prince David resides, is called Curtays. The remains of a church announce that Curtays was formerly a large city; but at present it can scarcely be accounted a village.\n\nSolomon, the father of the present sovereign, ordered the city to be destroyed as well as the ramparts of the city; for he thought, and very wisely, that Caucasus was the only fortification capable of being defended by an army of 6000 men undisciplined and destitute of artillery.\n\nThe number of the inhabitants of Imeretta is reckoned to be 20,000 families; but the greater part of them live neither in towns nor villages, but are dispersed throughout the level country, each of them possessing a small hut or cottage. These people have fewer strangers among them, and they are more engaging in their appearance, than the Georgians. They are of a milder and less puffed-up character; and the principal branch of their commerce consists in wines, a considerable quantity of which they export in skins as far as the confines of Georgia. They are acquainted with no other trade; for they are poor and miserable, and greatly oppressed by their lords.\n\nThe ordinary revenues of Imeretta, like those of Georgia, arise from a tythe which vassals are obliged to pay in wines, cattle, and corn, and some subsidies furnished annually by neighbouring princes. The extraordinary revenues for the most part arise from confiscations of every kind; but notwithstanding this, the finances of the prince are so limited, that he is often under the necessity of going from house to house, to live at the expense of his vassals, never quitting their habitations until the pressing wants of his hosts absolutely compel him. It is therefore probable, that the court of the sovereign of Imeretta is as deficient in brilliancy as his table is in splendour when he dines at home. His principal dishes consist of a certain food called gom, which is a kind of millet boiled, and a piece of roast meat, with some highly-seasoned sauce. He never eats but with his fingers, for forks and spoons are unknown in Imeretta. At table he generally gives audiences respecting affairs of the first consequence, which he determines as he thinks proper; for in every country subject to his dominions there is no other law but his will.\n\nOn Friday, which is the market day, all his new edicts are published by a kind of herald, who climbs up into some tree, in order to proclaim the will of his sovereign. The Imerettans profess the religion of the Greek church. Their patriarch must be of the royal family; but it is seldom that he can either read or write; the priests who compose the rest of the clergy are not much more enlightened. The greater part of their churches are pitiful edifices, which can scarcely be distinguished from the common huts of the inhabitants but by a paneboard crucifix, and a few coarse paintings of the Virgin, which are seen in them.","sp":187,"ep":187},{"h":"IMFANELLING","t":"in Law, signifies the writing down or entering into a parchment, list, or schedule, the names of a jury summoned by the sheriff to appear for such public services as juries are employed in.","sp":189,"ep":189},{"h":"IMITATION","t":"derived from the Latin imitare, to \"represent or repeat,\" a sound or action, either exactly or nearly in the same manner as they were originally exhibited.","sp":187,"ep":187},{"h":"IMITATION","t":"in Music, admits of two different senses.

Yet we must either be deceived beyond all possibility of cure, or we have felt the power of imitative harmony in a high degree. We are certain that the fury, the impetuosity, the rapid vicissitudes, of a battle, may be successfully and vividly represented in harmony. We have participated the exultation and triumph of a conquest, inspired by the sound of a full chorus. We have felt all the solemnity and grandeur of devotion from the slow movement, the deep chords, the swelling harmony, of a sentimental composition played upon the organ. Nor do we imagine harmony less capable of presenting the tender depression, the fluctuating and tremulous agitation, of grief. As this kind of imitation is the noblest effort of music, it is astonishing that it should have been overlooked by M. d'Alembert. He has indeed apologized, by informing us, that his treatise is merely elementary; but we are uncertain how far this apology ought to be regarded as sufficient, when it is at the same time considered, that he has given an account of imitation in its mechanical, or what Rousseau calls its technical, sense; which, however, to prevent ambiguity, we should rather choose to call mymefix, or anacephalofix. To Rousseau's account of the word in this acceptation, we return.\n\n\"Imitation (says he), in its technical sense, is a reiteration of the same air, or of one which is similar, in several parts where it is repeated by one after the other, either in unison, or at the distance of a fourth, a fifth, a third, or any other interval whatever. The imitation may be happily enough pursued even though several notes should be changed; provided the same air may always be recognized, and that the composer does not deviate from the laws of proper modulation. Frequently, in order to render the imitation more sensible, it is preceded by a general rest, or by long notes which seem to obliterate the impression formerly made by the air till it is renewed with greater force and vivacity by the commencement of the imitation. The imitation may be treated as the composer chooses; it may be abandoned, resumed, or another begun, at pleasure; in a word, its rules are as much relaxed as those of the fugue are severe; for this reason, it is despised by the most eminent masters; and every imitation of this kind too much affected, almost always betrays a novice in composition.\"","sp":187,"ep":188},{"h":"IMITATION","t":"in Oratory, is an endeavour to resemble a speaker or writer in those qualities with regard to which we propose them to ourselves as patterns.

The first is a want of some physical principle, necessary to an action; or where a being is absolutely defective, or not free and at liberty to act. The second only imports a great difficulty; as a strong habit to the contrary, a violent passion, or the like.\n\nIMPOBENCY is a term more particularly used for a natural inability to coition. Impotence with respect to men is the same as sterility in women; that is, an inability of propagating the species. There are many causes of impotence; as, a natural defect in the organs of generation, which seldom admits of a cure; accidents or diseases; and in such cases the impotence may or may not be remedied, according as these are curable or otherwise.\u2014The most common causes are, early and immoderate venery, or the venereal disease. We have instances, however, of untimely generation in men by an impediment to the ejection of the semen in coition, from a wrong direction which the orifice at the verumontanum got, whereby the seed was thrown up into the bladder. M. Petit cured one patient under such a difficulty of emission, by making an incision like to that commonly made in the great operation for the stone.\n\nOn this subject we have some curious and original observations by the late Mr John Hunter in his Treatise on the Venereal Disease*. He considers impotence as depending upon two causes. One he refers to the mind; the other to the organs.\n\n1. As to impotence depending upon the mind, he observes, that as the parts of generation are not necessary for the existence or support of the individual, but have a reference to something else in which the mind has a principal concern; so a complete action in those parts cannot take place without a perfect harmony of body and of mind: that is, there must be both a power of body and disposition of mind; for the mind is subject to a thousand caprices, which affect the actions of those parts.\n\n2. Copulation is an act of the body, the spring of which is in the mind; but it is not volition: and according to the state of the mind, so is the act performed. To perform this act well, the body should be in health, and the mind should be perfectly confident of the powers of the body; the mind should be in a state entirely disengaged from every thing else: it should have no difficulties, no fears, no apprehensions, not even an anxiety to perform the act well; for even this anxiety is a state of mind different from what should prevail; there should not be even a fear that the mind itself may find a difficulty at the time the act should be performed. Perhaps no function of\n\n---\n\n* P. 207. &c. ad edit.\nImpotency, the machine depends so much upon the state of the mind as this.\n\n\"The will and reasoning faculty have nothing to do with this power; they are only employed in the act, so far as voluntary parts are made use of; and if they ever interfere, which they sometimes do, it often produces another state of mind which destroys that which is proper for the performance of the act; it produces a desire, a wish, a hope, which are all only diffidence and uncertainty, and create in the mind the idea of a possibility of the want of success, which destroys the proper state of mind or necessary confidence.\n\n\"There is perhaps no act in which a man feels himself more interested, or is more anxious to perform well; his pride being engaged in some degree, which if within certain bounds would produce a degree of perfection in an act depending upon the will, or an act in voluntary parts; but when it produces a state of mind contrary to that state on which the perfection of the act depends, a failure must be the consequence.\n\n\"The body is not only rendered incapable of performing this act by the mind being under the above influence, but also by the mind being, though perfectly confident of its power, yet conscious of an impropriety in performing it; this, in many cases, produces a state of mind which shall take away all power. The state of a man's mind respecting his filter takes away all power. A conscientious man has been known to lose his powers on finding the woman he was going to be connected with unexpectedly a virgin.\n\n\"Shedding tears arises entirely from the state of the mind, although not so much a compound action as the act in question; for none are so weak in body that they cannot shed tears; it is not so much a compound action of the mind and strength of body joined, as the other act is; yet if we are afraid of shedding tears, or are desirous of doing it, and that anxiety is kept up through the whole of an affecting scene, we certainly shall not shed tears, or at least not so freely as would have happened from our natural feelings.\n\n\"From this account of the necessity of having the mind independent respecting the act, we must see that it may very often happen that the state of mind will be such as not to allow the animal to exert its natural powers; and every failure increases the evil. We must also see from this state of the case, that this act must be often interrupted; and the true cause of this interruption not being known, it will be laid to the charge of the body or want of powers. As these cases do not arise from real inability, they are to be carefully distinguished from such as do; and perhaps the only way to distinguish them is, to examine into the state of mind respecting this act. So trifling often is the circumstance which shall produce this inability depending on the mind, that the very desire to please shall have that effect, as in making the woman the sole object to be gratified.\n\n\"Cases of this kind we see every day; one of which I shall relate as an illustration of this subject, and also of the method of cure.\u2014A gentleman told me, that he had lost his virility. After above an hour's investigation of the case, I made out the following facts: that he had at unnecessary times strong erections, which showed that he had naturally this power; that the erections were accompanied with desire, which are all the natural powers wanted; but that there was still a defect somewhere, which I supposed to be from the mind. I inquired if all women were alike to him? his answer was, No; some women he could have connection with as well as ever. This brought the defect, whatever it was, into a smaller compass; and it appeared that there was but one woman that produced this inability, and that it arose from a desire to perform the act with this woman well; which desire produced in the mind a doubt or fear of the want of success, which was the cause of the inability of performing the act. As this arose entirely from the state of the mind produced by a particular circumstance, the mind was to be applied to for the cure; and I told him that he might be cured, if he could perfectly rely on his own power of self-denial. When I explained what I meant, he told me that he could depend upon every act of his will or resolution. I then told him, that, if he had a perfect confidence in himself in that respect, he was to go to bed with this woman, but first promise to himself that he would not have any connection with her for six nights, let his inclinations and powers be what they would; which he engaged to do, and also to let me know the result. About a fortnight after, he told me, that this resolution had produced such a total alteration in the state of his mind, that the power soon took place; for instead of going to bed with the fear of inability, he went with fears that he should be possessed with too much desire, too much power, so as to become uneasy to him; which really happened; for he would have been happy to have shortened the time; and when he had once broke the spell, the mind and powers went on together, and his mind never returned to its former state.\"\n\n2. Of impotency from a want of proper correspondence between the actions of the different organs. Our author, in a former part of his Treatise, when considering the diseases of the urethra and bladder, had remarked, that every organ in an animal body, without exception, was made of different parts, whose functions or actions were totally different from one another, although all tending to produce one ultimate effect. In all such organs, when perfect (he observes), there is a succession of motions, one naturally arising out of the other, which in the end produces the ultimate effect; and an irregularity alone in these actions will constitute disease, at least will produce very disagreeable effects, and often totally frustrate the intention of the organ. This principle Mr Hunter, on the present occasion, applies to the \"actions of the testicles and penis: for we find that an irregularity in the actions of these parts sometimes happens in men, producing impotence; and something similar probably may be one cause of barrenness in women.\n\n\"In men, the parts subservient to generation may be divided into two; the essential and the accessory. The testicles are the essential; the penis, &c., the accessory. As this division arises from their uses or actions in health, which exactly correspond with one another, a want of exactness in the correspondence or susceptibility of those actions may also be divided into two: where the actions are reversed, the accessory taking place without the first or essential, as in erections of the penis, where neither the mind nor the testicles are stimulated to action; and the second is where the testicles perform\nImpotence, the action of secretion too readily for the penis, which has not a corresponding erection. The first is called priapism; and the second is what ought to be called seminal weakness.\n\n\"The mind has considerable effect on the correspondence of the actions of these two parts: but it would appear in many instances, that erections of the penis depend more on the state of the mind than the secretion of the semen does; for many have the secretion, but not the erection; but in such, the want of erection appears to be owing to the mind only.\n\n\"Priapism often arises spontaneously; and often from visible irritation of the penis, as in the venereal gonorrhea, especially when violent. The sensation of such erections is rather uneasy than pleasant; nor is the sensation of the glans at the time similar to that arising from the erections of desire, but more like to the sensation of the parts immediately after coition. Such as arise spontaneously are of more serious consequence than those from inflammation, as they proceed probably from causes not curable in themselves or by any known methods. The priapism arising from inflammation of the parts, as in a gonorrhea, is attended with nearly the same symptoms; but generally the sensation is that of pain, proceeding from the inflammation of the parts.\n\n\"It may be observed, that what is said of priapism is only applicable to it when a disease in itself, and not when a symptom of other diseases, which is frequently the case.\n\n\"The common practice in the cure of this complaint is to order all the nervous and strengthening medicines; such as bark, valerian, mule, camphor, and also the cold bath. I have seen good effects from the cold bath; but sometimes it does not agree with the constitution, in which case I have found the warm bath of service. Opium appears to be a specific in many cases; from which circumstance I should be apt, upon the whole, to try a soothing plan.\n\n\"Seminal weakness, or a secretion and emission of the semen without erections, is the reverse of a priapism, and is by much the worse disease of the two. There is great variety in the degrees of this disease, there being all the gradations from the exact correspondence of the actions of all the parts to the testicles acting alone; in every case of the disease, there is too quick a secretion and evacuation of the semen. Like to the priapism, it does not arise from desires and abilities; although when mild it is attended with both, but not in a due proportion; a very slight desire often producing the full effect. The secretion of the semen shall be so quick, that simple thought, or even toying, shall make it flow.\n\n\"Dreams have produced this evacuation repeatedly in the same night; and even when the dreams have been so slight, that there has been no consciousness of them when the sleep has been broken by the act of emission. I have known cases where the testicles have been so ready to secrete, that the least friction on the glans has produced an emission: I have known the simple action of walking or riding produce this effect, and that repeatedly, in a very short space of time.\n\n\"A young man, about four or five and twenty years of age, not so much given to venery as most young men, had these last mentioned complaints upon him. Three or four times in the night he would emit; and if he walked fast, or rode on horseback, the same thing would happen. He could scarcely have connection with a woman before he emitted, and in the emission there was hardly any spasm. He tried every supposed strengthening medicine, as also the cold bath and bathing, but with no effect. By taking 20 drops of laudanum on going to bed, he prevented the night emissions; and by taking the same quantity in the morning, he could walk or ride without the before-mentioned inconvenience. I directed this practice to be continued for some time, although the disease did not return, that the parts might be accustomed to this healthy state of action; and I have reason to believe the gentleman is now well. It was found necessary, as the constitution became more habituated to the opiate, to increase the dose of it.\n\n\"The spasms, upon the evacuation of the semen in such cases, are extremely slight, and a repetition of them soon takes place; the first emission not preventing a second; the constitution being all the time but little affected (A). When the testicles act alone, without the accessory parts taking up the necessary and natural consequent action, it is still a more melancholy disease; for the secretion arises from no visible or sensible cause, and does not give any visible or sensible effect, but runs off similar to involuntary stools or urine. It has been observed that the semen is more fluid than natural in some of these cases.\n\n\"There is great variety in the diseased actions of these parts; of which the following case may be considered as an example. A gentleman has had a stricture in the urethra for many years, for which he has frequently used a bougie, but of late has neglected it. He has had no connection with women for a considerable time, being afraid of the consequences. He has often in his sleep involuntary emissions, which generally awake him at the paroxysm; but what surprizes him most is, that often he has such without any semen passing forwards through the penis, which makes him think that at those times it goes backwards into the bladder. This is not always the case, for at other times the semen passes forwards. At the time the semen seems to pass into the bladder, he has the erection, the dream; and is awakened with the same mode of action, the same sensation, and the same pleasure, as when it passes through the urethra, whether dreaming or waking. My opinion is, that the same irritation takes place in the bulb of the urethra without the semen that takes place there when the semen enters, in consequence of all the natural preparatory steps, whereby the very same actions are excited as if it came into\n\n(A) \"It is to be considered, that the constitution is commonly affected by the spasms only, and in proportion to their violence, independent of the secretion and evacuation of the semen. But in some cases even the erection going off without the spasms on the emission, shall produce the same debility as if they had taken place.\"\nImpotency the pungency: from which one would suppose, that either semen is not fecrated; or if it be, that a retrograde motion takes place in the actions of the accelerates urine. But if the first be the case, then we may suppose, that in the natural state the actions of those muscles do not arise simply from the stimulus of the semen in the part, but from their action being a termination of a preceding one making part of a series of actions. Thus they may depend upon the friction, or the imagination of a friction, on the penis; the testicles not doing their part, and the sperm in such cases arising from the friction and not from the fecration. In many of those cases of irregularity, when the erection is not strong, it shall go off without the emission; and at other times an emission shall happen almost without an erection; but these arise not from debility, but affections of the mind.\n\n\"In many of the preceding cases, washing the penis, scrotum, and perineum, with cold water, is often of service; and to render it colder than it is in some seasons of the year, common salt may be added to it, and the parts washed when the salt is almost dissolved.\"\n\n**Impotency** is a canonical disability, to avoid marriage in the spiritual court. The marriage is not void *ab initio*, but voidable only by sentence of separation during the life of the parties.\n\n**Imprecation**, (derived from *in*, and *precor*, \"I pray?\") a curse or wish that some evil may befall any one.\n\nThe ancients had their goddesses called **imprecatrices**, in Latin *Dire*, i.e. *Deorum irae*, who were supposed to be the executioners of evil consciences. They were called *Dire* in heaven, *Furies* on earth, and *Eumenides* in hell. The Romans owned but three of these **imprecatrices**, and the Greeks only two. They invoked them with prayers and pieces of verses to destroy their enemies.\n\n**Impregnation**, the getting a female with child. See Conception.\n\nThe term **impregnation** is also used, in pharmacy, for communicating the virtues of one medicine to another, whether by mixture, coction, digestion, &c.\n\n**Impressing seamen**. The power of impressing sea-faring men for the sea-service by the king's commission, has been a matter of some dispute, and submitted to with great reluctance; though it hath very clearly and learnedly been shown by Sir Michael Forster, that the practice of impressing, and granting powers to the admiralty for that purpose, is of very ancient date, and hath been uniformly continued by a regular series of precedents to the present time: whence he concludes it to be part of the common law. The difficulty arises from hence, that no statute has expressly declared this power to be in the crown, though many of them very strongly imply it. The statute 2 Rich. II. c. 4, speaks of mariners being arrested and retained for the king's service, as of a thing well known, and practised without dispute; and provides a remedy against their running away. By a later statute, if any waterman, who uses the river Thames, shall hide himself during the execution of any commission of pressing for the king's service, he is liable to heavy penalties. By another (5 Eliz. c. 5.) no fisherman shall be taken by the queen's commission to serve as a mariner; but the commission shall be first brought to two justices of the peace, inhabiting near the sea coast where the mariners are to be taken, to the intent that the justices may choose out and return such a number of able-bodied men, as in the commission are contained, to serve her majesty. And by others, especially protections are allowed to seamen in particular circumstances, to prevent them from being impressed. Ferrymen are also said to be privileged from being impressed, at common law. All which do most evidently imply a power of impressing to reside somewhere; and if anywhere, it must, from the spirit of our constitution, as well as from the frequent mention of the king's commission, reside in the crown alone.\n\n\u2014After all, however, this method of manning the navy is to be considered as only defensible from public necessity, to which all private considerations must give way.\n\nThe following persons are exempted from being impressed: Apprentices for three years; the master, mate, and carpenter, and one man for every 100 tons, of vessels employed in the coal trade; all under 18 years of age, and above 55; foreigners in merchant-ships and privateers; landmen betaking themselves to sea for two years; seamen in the Greenland fishery, and harpooners, employed, during the interval of the fishing season, in the coal-trade, and giving security to go to the fishing next season.\n\n**Impression** is applied to the species of objects which are supposed to make some mark or impression on the senses, the mind, and the memory. The Peripatetics assert, that bodies emit species resembling them, which are conveyed to the common *sensorium*, and they are rendered intelligible by the active intellect; and, when thus spiritualized, are called *expressions*, or *express species*, as being expressed from the others.\n\n**Impression** also denotes the edition of a book, regarding the mechanical part only; whereas *edition*, besides this, takes in the care of the editor, who corrected or augmented the copy, adding notes, &c., to render the work more useful.\n\n**Imprisonment**, the state of a person restrained of his liberty, and detained under the custody of another.\n\nNo person is to be imprisoned but as the law directs, either by the command or order of a court of record, or by lawful warrant; or the king's procefs, on which one may be lawfully detained. And at common law, a person could not be imprisoned unless he were guilty of some force and violence, for which his body was subject to imprisonment, as one of the highest executions. Where the law gives power to imprison, in such case it is justifiable, provided he that does it in pursuance of a statute exactly pursues the statute in the manner of doing it; for otherwise it will be deemed false imprisonment, and of consequence it is unjustifiable. Every warrant of commitment for imprisoning a person, ought to run, \"till delivered by due course of law,\" and \"not until farther order;\" which has been held ill; and thus it also is, where one is imprisoned on a warrant not mentioning any cause for which he is committed. See Arrest and Commitment.\n\n**False Imprisonment**. Every confinement of the person is an imprisonment, whether it be in a common prison, or in a private house, or in the stocks, or even by\nby forcibly detaining one in the public streets. Unlawful or false imprisonment consists in such confinement or detention without sufficient authority; which authority may arise either from some process from the courts of justice; or from some warrant from a legal power to commit, under his hand and seal, and expelling the cause of such commitment; or from some other special cause warranted, for the necessity of the thing, either by common law or act of parliament; such as the arresting of a felon by a private person without warrant, the impressing of mariners for the public service, or the apprehending of waggoners for misbehaviour in the public highways. False imprisonment also may arise by executing a lawful warrant or process at an unlawful time, as on a Sunday; or in a place privileged from arrest, as in the verge of the king's court. This is the injury. The remedy is of two sorts; the one removing the injury, the other making satisfaction for it.\n\nThe means of removing the actual injury of false imprisonment are fourfold: 1. By writ of MAINPRIZE. 2. By writ De ODIO et ATIA. 3. By writ De HOMINE REPUGNANDO. 4. By writ of HABEAS CORPUS. See those articles.\n\nThe satisfactory remedy for this injury of false imprisonment, is by an action of trespass vi et armis, usually called an action of false imprisonment; which is generally, and almost unavoidably, accompanied with a charge of assault and battery also; and therein the party shall recover damages for the injuries he has received; and also the defendant is, as for all other injuries committed with force, or vi et armis, liable to pay a fine to the king for the violation of the public peace.","sp":191,"ep":195},{"h":"IMPORTATION","t":"in *Commerce*, the bringing merchandise into a kingdom from foreign countries; in contradistinction to exportation.

Some were voluntary, as the touching a dead body, or any animal that died of itself, or any creature that was deemed unclean; or the touching things holy, by one who was not clean, or was not a priest; the touching one who had a leprosy, one who had a gonorrhea, or who was polluted by a dead carcass, &c. Sometimes these impurities were involuntary; as when any one inadvertently touched bones, or a sepulchre, or any thing polluted; or fell into such diseases as pollute, as the leprosy, &c.\n\nThe beds, clothes, and moveables, which had touched anything unclean, contracted also a kind of impurity, and in some cases communicated it to others.\n\nThese legal pollutions were generally removed by bathing, and lasted no longer than the evening. The person polluted plunged over head in the water, and either had his clothes on when he did so, or washed himself and his clothes separately. Other pollutions continued ten days, as that which was contracted by touching a dead body. That of women in their monthly courses lasted till this was over with them. Other impurities lasted 40 or 50 days; as that of women who were lately delivered, who were unclean 40 days after the birth of a boy, and 50 after the birth of a girl. Others again lasted till the person was cured.\n\nMany of these pollutions were expiated by sacrifices; and others by a certain water or ley made with the ashes of a red heifer, sacrificed on the great day of expiation. When the leper was cured, he went to the temple, and offered a sacrifice of two birds, one of which was killed and the other set at liberty. He who had touched a dead body, or had been present at a funeral, was to be purified with the water of expiation, and this upon pain of death.

The saints and prophets of the Old Testament were sensible of this; and our Saviour, in the gospel, has strongly inculcated, that they are not outward and corporeal pollutions which render us unacceptable to God, but such inward pollutions as infect the soul, and are violations of justice, truth, and charity.","sp":195,"ep":195},{"h":"IMPUTATION","t":"in general, the charging something to the account of one which belonged to another; thus, the affections of original sin maintain, that Adam's sin is imputed to all his posterity.\n\nIn the same sense, the righteousness and merits of Christ are imputed to true believers.","sp":195,"ep":195},{"h":"INACCESSIBLE","t":"something that cannot be approached, by reason of intervening obstructions, as a river, rock, &c.

The priests drew lots to know who should offer it: the destined person took a large silver dish, in which was a censer full of incense; and being accompanied by another priest carrying some live coals from the altar, went into the temple. There, in order to give notice to the people, they struck upon an instrument of brass placed between the temple and the altar; and being returned to the altar, he who brought the fire left it there, and went away.

See FORTH.\n\nThis monastery was founded about 1123, by Alexander I, on the following occasion. In passing the frith of Forth he was overtaken with a violent storm, which drove him to this island, where he met with the most hospitable reception from a poor hermit, then residing here in the chapel of St Columba, who, for the three days that the king remained there tempest-bound, entertained him with the milk of his cow, and a few shell-fish. His majesty, from the sense of the danger he had escaped, and in gratitude to the saint to whom he attributed his safety, vowed some token of respect; Inchcolm accordingly founded here a monastery of Augustines, and dedicated it to St Columba. Allan de Mortimer, lord of Aberdour, who attended Edw. III., in his Scotch expedition, bestowed half of those lands on the monks of this island, for the privilege of a family burial-place in their church. The buildings made in consequence of the piety of Alexander were very considerable. There are still to be seen a large square tower belonging to the church, the ruins of the church, and of several other buildings. The wealth of this place in the time of Edward III. proved so strong a temptation to his fleet, then lying in the Forth, as to suppress all the horror of sacrilege and respect to the sanctity of the inhabitants. The English landed, and spared not even the furniture more immediately consecrated to divine worship. But due vengeance overtook them; for in a storm which instantly followed, many of them perished; those who escaped, struck with the justice of the judgment, vowed to make ample recompense to the injured saint. The tempest ceased; and they made the promised atonement.\u2014The Danish monument, figured by Sir Robert Sibbald, lies on the south-east side of the building, on a rising ground.

In 1549 the English fleet, sent by Edward VI., to assist the lords of the congregation against the queen-dowager, landed, and began to fortify this island, of the importance of which they grew sensible after their neglect of securing the port of Leith, so lately in their power. They left here five companies to cover the workmen under the command of Cotterel; but their operations were soon interrupted by M. Deffe, general of the French auxiliaries, who took the place, after a gallant defence on the part of the English. The Scots kept possession for some years; but at last the fortifications were destroyed by act of parliament, to prevent it from being of any use to the former.

See ASBESTOS, MINERALOGY Index. On this Cronstedt observes, that the natural store of the asbestos is in proportion to their economical use, both being very inconsiderable. It is an old tradition (says he), that in former ages they made clothes of the fibrous asbestos, which is said to be composed by the word buffer; but it is not very probable, since if one may conclude from some trifles now made of it, as bags, ribbons, and other things, such a dress could neither have an agreeable appearance, nor be of any conveniency or advantage. It is more probable that the Scythians dressed their dead bodies which were to be burned, in a cloth manufactured of this stone; and this perhaps has occasioned the above fable. M. Magellan confirms this opinion of Cronstedt's, and informs us that some of the Romans also inclosed dead bodies in cloth of this kind. In the year 1756 or 1757 he tells us, that he saw a large piece of asbestos cloth found in a stone tomb, with the ashes of a Roman, as appeared by the epitaph. It was kept, with the tomb also, if our author remembers rightly, in the right-hand wing of the Vatican library at Rome. The under-librarian, in order to show that it was combustible, lighted a candle, and let some drops of wax fall on the cloth, which he set on fire with a candle in his presence without any detriment to the cloth.

The hierarchy established by that prince in the churches of her dominions, the vestments worn by the clergy in the celebration of divine worship, the book of common prayer, and above all the sign of the cross used in the administration of baptism, were very offensive to many of her subjects, who during the persecution of the former reign had taken refuge among the Protestants of Germany and Geneva. Those men thought that the church of England resembled, in too many particulars, the antichristian church of Rome; and they called perpetually for a more thorough reformation and a purer worship. From this circumstance they were stigmatized by their adversaries with the general name of Puritans, as the followers of Novatian (A) had been in the ancient church. Elizabeth was not disposed to comply with their demands; and it is difficult to say what might have been the issue of the contest, had the Puritans been united among themselves in sentiments, views, and measures. But the case was quite otherwise. That large body, composed of persons of different ranks, characters, opinions, and intentions, and unanimous in nothing but in their antipathy to the forms of doctrine and discipline that were established by law, was all of a sudden divided into a variety of sects. Of these the most famous was that which was formed about the year 1581 by Robert Brown, a man infirmating in his manners, but unsteady and inconsistent in his views and notions of men and things. See Brown.\n\nThis innovator differed not in point of doctrine either from the church of England, or from the rest of the Puritans; but he had formed notions then new and singular concerning the nature of the church and the rules of ecclesiastical government. He was for dividing the whole body of the faithful into separate societies or congregations; and maintained, that such a number of persons as could be contained in an ordinary place of worship ought to be considered as a church, and enjoy all the rights and privileges that are competent to an ecclesiastical community. These small societies he pronounced independent jure divino, and entirely exempt from the jurisdiction of the bishops, in whose hands the court had placed the reins of spiritual government; and also from that of presbyteries.\n\n(A) The followers of Novatian were called Puritans, because they would not communicate with the Catholic church, under pretence that her communion was polluted by admitting those to the sacred mysteries who through infirmity had sacrificed to idols in times of persecution. These unhappy men were not received by the church till after a long course of penance. The Novatians would not receive them at all, however long their penance, or however sincere their sorrow, for their sin. In other respects, the ancient Puritans were, like the English, orthodox in the faith, and of irreproachable morals.\nand synods, which the Puritans regarded as the supreme visible sources of ecclesiastical authority. He also maintained, that the power of governing each congregation resided in the people; and that each member had an equal share in this government, and an equal right to order matters for the good of the whole society. Hence all points both of doctrine and discipline were submitted to the discussion of the whole congregation; and whatever was supported by a majority of voices passed into a law. It was the congregation also that elected certain of the brethren to the office of pastors, to perform the duty of public instruction, and the several branches of divine worship; reserving, however, to themselves the power of dismissing these ministers, and reducing them to the condition of private members, whenever they should think such a change conducive to the spiritual advantage of the community. It is likewise to be observed, that the right of the pastors to preach was by no means of an exclusive nature, or peculiar to them alone; since any member that thought proper to exhort or instruct the brethren, was abundantly indulged in the liberty of prophesying to the whole assembly. Accordingly, when the ordinary teacher or pastor had finished his discourse, all the other brethren were permitted to communicate in public their sentiments and illustrations upon any useful or edifying subject.\n\nThe zeal with which Brown and his associates maintained and propagated these notions was in a high degree intemperate and extravagant. He affirmed, that all communion was to be broken off with those religious societies that were founded upon a different plan from his; and treated, more especially the church of England, as a spurious church, whose ministers were unlawfully ordained, whose discipline was popish and antichristian, and whose sacraments and institutions were destitute of all efficacy and virtue. The sect of this hot-headed innovator, not being able to endure the severe treatment which their own violence had brought upon them from an administration that was not distinguished by its mildness and indulgence, retired into the Netherlands, and founded churches at Middleburg in Zeeland, and at Amsterdam and Leyden in the province of Holland; but their establishments were neither solid nor lasting. Their founder returned into England; and having renounced his principles of separation, took orders in the established church, and obtained a benefice. The Puritan exiles, whom he thus abandoned, disagreed among themselves, were split into parties, and their affairs declined from day to day. This engaged the wiser part of them to mitigate the severity of their founder's plan, and to soften the rigour of his uncharitable decisions.\n\nThe persons who had the chief merit of bringing about this reformation was one of their pastors called John Robinson, a man who had much of the solemn piety of the times, and no inconsiderable portion of learning. This well-meaning reformer, perceiving the defects that reigned in the discipline of Brown, and in the spirit and temper of his followers, employed his zeal and diligence in correcting them, and in new-modelling the society in such a manner as to render it less odious to its adversaries, and less liable to the just censure of those true Christians, who looked upon charity as the end of the commandments. Hitherto the sect had been called Brownists; but Robinson having, in his Apology, affirmed, C\u00e6tum quemlibet particularis, effe totam, integram, et perfectam ecclesiam ex suis partibus constatentium immediat\u00e8 et independenter (quod alias ecclesias) sub ipso Christo,\u2014the sect was henceforth called Independents, of which the apologist was considered as the founder.\n\nThe Independents were much more commendable than the Brownists. They surpassed them both in the moderation of their sentiments, and in the order of their discipline. They did not, like Brown, pour forth bitter and uncharitable invectives against the churches which were governed by rules entirely different from theirs, nor pronounce them on that account unworthy of the Christian name. On the contrary, though they considered their own form of ecclesiastical government as of divine institution, and as originally introduced by the authority of the apostles, nay by the apostles themselves; they yet had candour and charity enough to acknowledge, that true religion and solid piety might flourish in those communities which were under the jurisdiction of bishops or the government of synods and presbyteries. This is put beyond all doubt by Robinson himself, who expresses his own private sentiments and those of his community in the following clear and precise words: \"Profitemur coram Deo et hominibus, adeo nosl consenire cum ecclesiis reformatis Belgicis in re religiosis, ut omnibus et singulis earumdem ecclesiarum fidei articulis, praet habentur in harmonia confessionalium fidei, parati simus subfervire. Ecclesias reformatas pro veris et genuinis habemus, cum ipsidem in sacris Dei communione profitemur, et quantum in nobis est, colimus.\" They were also much more attentive than the Brownists, in keeping on foot a regular ministry in their communities; for while the latter allowed promiscuously all ranks and orders of men to teach in public, the Independents had, and still have, a certain number of ministers, chosen respectively by the congregations where they are fixed; nor is any person among them permitted to speak in public, before he has submitted to a proper examination of his capacity and talents, and been approved of by the heads of the congregation.\n\nThis religious society still subsists, and has produced divines as eminent for learning, piety, and virtue, as any church in Christendom. It is now distinguished from the other Protestant communities chiefly by the two following circumstances.\n\n1. The Independents reject the use of all creeds and confessions drawn up by fallible men, requiring of their teachers no other test of orthodoxy than a declaration of their belief in the gospel of Jesus, and their adherence to the Scriptures as the sole standard of faith and practice.\n\n2. They attribute no virtue whatsoever to the rite of ordination, upon which some other churches lay so much stress; for the Independents declare, that the qualifications which constitute a regular minister of the New Testament, are, a firm belief in the gospel, a principle of sincere and unaffected piety, a competent stock of knowledge, a capacity for leading devotion and communicating instruction, a serious inclination to engage in the important employment of promoting the everlasting salvation of mankind, and ordinarily an invitation to the pastoral office from some particular society.\nWhere these things concur, they consider a person as fitted and authorized for the discharge of every duty which belongs to the ministerial function; and they believe that the imposition of the hands of bishops or presbyters would convey to him no powers or prerogatives of which he was not before possessed.\n\nWhen the reformers separated from the church of Rome, they drew up public confessions of faith or articles of religion, to which they demanded subscription from their respective followers. Their purpose in this was to guard against dangerous heresies, to ascertain the meaning of Scripture-language, and, we doubt not, to promote the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. These were laudable ends; but of the means chosen for attaining them, the late Dr Taylor of Norwich, the glory of the Independent churches, and whose learning would have done honour to any church, expresses his opinion in the following indignant language: \"How much soever the Christian world vaunteth these creeds and confessions, I confess, for my own part, that I have no opinion of them. But we are told that they were generally drawn up by the ablest divines. But what evidence is there of this? Are divines in vogue and power commonly the most knowing and upright? But granting that the reformers were in those days the ablest divines; the ablest divines educated in populous schools, notwithstanding any pretended learning, might comparatively be very weak and defective in scripture knowledge, which was a thing in a manner new to them. In times of great ignorance they might be men of eminence; and yet far short of being qualified to draw up and decide the true and precise rules of faith for all Christians. Yea, their very attempting to draw up, decide, and establish such rules of faith, is an incontestable evidence of their surprising ignorance and weakness. How could they be able divines, when they imposed upon the consciences of Christians their own decisions concerning gospel-faith and doctrine? Was not this in fact to teach and constrain Christians to depart from the most fundamental principle of their religion, subjection and allegiance to Christ, the only teacher and lawgiver? But if they were able men, were they infallible? No: they publicly affirmed their own fallibility; and yet they acted as if they had been infallible, and could not be mistaken in prescribing faith and doctrine.\n\nBut even if they were infallible, who gave them commission to do what the Spirit of God had done already? Could the first reformers hope to deliver the truths of religion more fully and more clearly than the Spirit of God? Had they found out more apt expressions than had occurred to the Holy Spirit? The Son of God 'spake not of himself; but as the Father said unto him, so he spake,' (John xii. 50.). 'The Spirit of truth spake not of himself; but whatsoever he heard, that he spake,' (John xvi. 13.). 'The things of God the apostles spake, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth,' (1 Cor. ii. 13.). If the Christian revelation was thus handed down to us from the Fountain of Light with so much care and exactness, both as to matter and words, by the Son of God, by the Spirit, and by the apostles, who were the ancient doctors and bishops? or who were the first reformers? or who were any synods or assemblies of divines, that they dared to model Christian faith into their own invented forms, and impose it upon the minds of men in their own devised terms and expressions?\n\nHath Christ given authority to all his ministers to the end of the world, to new-mould his doctrines by the rules of human learning whenever they think fit? or hath he delegated his power to any particular persons? Neither the one nor the other. His doctrines are not of such a ductile nature; but stand fixed, both as to matter and words, in the Scripture. And it is at any man's peril, who pretends to put them, as they are rules of faith, into any new dress or shape. I conclude, therefore, that the first reformers, and all councils, synods, and assemblies, who have met together to collect, determine, and decide, to prescribe and impose matters pertaining to Christian faith, have acted without any warrant from Christ, and therefore have invaded the prerogative of him who is the sole Prophet and Lawgiver to the church. Peace and unity, I know, is the pretended good design of those creeds and confessions. But as God never sanctified them for those ends, to all the world knows they have produced the contrary effects; discord, division, and the spilling of whole seas of Christian blood for 1400 years together.\"\n\nSuch sentiments as these are now maintained by Christians of various denominations; but they were first avowed by the Independents, to whom therefore the merit or demerit of bringing them to light properly belongs. Our readers will think differently of them according to their preconceived opinions; but it is not our province either to confirm or to confute them. They rise almost necessarily out of the independent scheme of congregational churches; and we could not suppress them without deviating from our fixed resolution of doing justice to all religious parties, as well those from whom we differ as those with whom we agree. It ought not, however, to be rashly concluded, that the Independents of the present age, merely because they reject the use of all creeds of human composition, doubt or disbelieve the doctrines deemed orthodox in other churches. Their predecessors in the last century were thought to be more rigid Calvinists than the Presbyterians themselves; as many of those may likewise be who in the present century admit not the confessions and formulas of the Calvinistic churches. They acknowledge as divine truth every doctrine contained in the Scriptures; but they think more necessary that scripture-doctrines are most properly expressed in simple scripture-language; and the same spirit of religious liberty, which makes them reject the authority of bishops and synods in matters of discipline, makes them reject the same authority in matters of faith. In either case, to call any man or body of men their masters, would, in their opinion, be a violation of the divine law, since \"one is their master, even Christ, and they are all brethren.\"\n\nIn support of their scheme of congregational churches, their arguments observe, that the word \u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1, which we translate church, is always used in Scripture to signify either a single congregation, or the place where a single congregation meets. Thus that unlawful assembly at Ephesus gathered together against Paul by the craftsmen, is called \u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1, a church, (Acts xix. 32, 39, 41.). The word, however, is generally applied to a more sacred rule;\nIndependence, but still it signifies either the body assembling, or the place in which it assembles. The whole body of the disciples at Corinth is called the church, and spoken of as coming together into one place, (1 Cor. xiv. 23.) The place into which they came together we find likewise called a church; \u201cwhere ye come together in the church\u2014when ye come together into one place,\u201d (1 Cor. xi. 18, 20.). Wherever there were more congregations than one, there were likewise more churches than one: Thus, \u201cLet your women keep silence in the churches,\u201d (1 Cor. xvi. 41.) The whole nation of Israel is indeed called a church, but it was no more than a single congregation; for it had but one place of public worship, viz., the first tabernacle, and afterwards the temple. The Catholic church of Christ, his holy nation and kingdom, is likewise a single congregation, having one place of worship, viz., heaven, where all the members assemble by faith and hold communion; and in which, when they shall all be fully gathered together, they will in fact be one glorious assembly. We find it called \u201cthe general assembly and church of the first-born, whose names are written in heaven.\u201d\n\nBesides these, the Independent can find no other description of a church in the New Testament; not a trace of a diocese or presbytery consisting of several congregations all subject to one jurisdiction. The number of disciples in Jerusalem was certainly great before they were dispersed by the persecution in which Paul bore so active a part; yet they are never mentioned as forming distinct assemblies, but as one assembly meeting with its elders in one place; sometimes in the temple, sometimes in Solomon\u2019s porch, and sometimes in an upper room. After the dispersion, the disciples who fled from Jerusalem, as they could no longer assemble in one place, are never called a church by themselves, or one church, but the churches of Judea, Samaria, and Galilee, (Acts ix. 31. Gal. i. 22.)\n\nWhence the Independent concludes, that in Jerusalem the words church and congregation were of the same import; and if such was the case there, where the gospel was first preached, he thinks we may reasonably expect to find it so in other places. Thus when Paul on his journey calls the elders of the church of Ephesus to Mileto, he speaks to them as the joint overseers of a single congregation: \u201cTake heed to yourselves, and to all the flock, over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers,\u201d (Acts xx. 28.) Had the church at Ephesus consisted of different congregations united under such a jurisdiction as that of a modern presbytery, it would have been natural to say, \u201cTake heed to yourselves, and to the flocks over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers;\u201d but this is a way of speaking of which the Independent finds not an instance in the whole New Testament. The sacred writers, when speaking of all the Christians in a nation or province, never call them the church of such a nation or province, but the churches of Galatia (Gal. i. 2.), the churches of Macedonia (2 Cor. viii. 1), the churches of Asia (1 Cor. xvi. 10.) On the other hand, when speaking of the disciples in a city or town, who might ordinarily assemble in one place, they uniformly call them a church; saying, the church of Antioch, the church at Corinth, the church of Ephesus, and the like.\n\nIn each of these churches or congregations there were elders or presbyters and deacons; and in every church congregation there seems to have been more than one elder, in some cases more than one. Thus we read (Acts xiv. 23.) of Paul and Barnabas ordaining elders in every church; and (Acts xix. 17) of a company of elders in the church of Ephesus, who were exhorted to \u201cfeed the flock, and take heed to themselves and to the flock over which the Holy Ghost had made them overseers;\u201d but of such elders as are to be found in modern presbyterian churches, who neither teach nor are apt to teach, the Independent finds no vestige in the Scriptures, nor in the earliest uninspired writers of the Christian church. The rule or government of this presbytery or eldership in a church is not their own, but Christ\u2019s. They are not lords over God\u2019s heritage, nor can they pretend to more power over the disciples than the apostles had. But when the administration of the apostles in the church of Jerusalem, and other churches where they acted as elders, is inquired into by an Independent, it does not appear to him that they did any thing of common concern to the church without the consent of the multitude; nay, it seems they thought it necessary to judge and determine in discipline in presence of the whole church (Acts vi. 6\u2014xv. 29. 1 Cor. v. 1, 4, 5.) Excommunication and abjuration were in the power of the church at Corinth, and not of the elders as distinct excommunicated from the congregation (1 Cor. v. 2 Cor. ii.) and abjurant. The apostle indeed speaks of his delivering form unto Satan (1 Tim. i. 20.); but it is by no means clear the power of he did it by himself, and not after the manner pointed at each congregation, that the gift was given unto Timothy by putting on of his hands, that this was not done in the presbytery of a church, as in the other epistle we find it actually was. The trying and judging of false apostles was a matter of the first importance; but it was done by the elders with the flock at Ephesus (Rev. ii. 2. Acts xx. 28.) and that whole flock did in the days of Ignatius all partake of the Lord\u2019s supper, and pray together in one place. Even the power of binding and loosing, or the power of the keys, as\n\n(b) The evidence upon which this is said by Mr. Graf (for the whole of this reasoning is extracted from his works) is probably the following passage in the epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians: \u0395\u03ba \u03b3\u03b5\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03b5\u1f50\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f08\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd, \u201cFor if the prayer of one or two be of such force as we are told, how much more prevalent must that be which is made by the bishop and the whole church? He then that does not come together into the same place with it, is proud, and hath condemned himself; for it is written, God refuseth the proud. Let us therefore respect the bishop, that we may be the servants of God.\u201d\nas it has been called, was by our Saviour conferred not upon a particular order of disciples, but upon the church: \"If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of one or two witnesses every word may be established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. Verily I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound,\" &c. (St Mat. xviii. 15, 16, 17, 18.). It is not said, if he shall neglect to hear the one or two, tell it to the elders of the church; far less can it be meant that the offended person should tell the cause of his offence to all the disciples in a presbytery or diocese consisting of many congregations: but he is required to tell it to that particular church or congregation to which they both belong; and the sentence of that assembly, pronounced by its elders, is in a very solemn manner declared to be final, from which there lies no appeal to any jurisdiction on earth.\n\nWith respect to the constituting of elders in any church or congregation, the Independent reasons in the following manner: The officers of Christ's appointment are either ordinary and permanent in the church, or they were extraordinary and peculiar to the planting of Christianity. The extraordinary were those who were employed in laying the plan of the gospel churches, and in publishing the New Testament revelation. Such were the apostles, the chosen witnesses of our Saviour's resurrection; such were the prophets inspired by the Holy Ghost for explaining infallibly the Old Testament by the things written in the New; and such were the evangelists, the apostles ministers. These can be succeeded by none in that which was peculiar to them, because their work was completed by themselves. But they are succeeded in all that was not peculiar to them by elders and deacons, the only two ordinary and permanent orders of ministers in the church. We have already seen, that it belongs to the office of the elder to feed the flock of Christ: and the only question to be settled is, how men are ordinarily called to that office? for about the office of the deacon there is little or no dispute. No man now can pretend to be so called of God to the ministry of the word as the apostles and other inspired elders were, whom he chose to be the publishers of his revealed truth, and to whose mission he bore witness in an extraordinary manner. But what the apostles were to those who had the divine oracles from their mouths, that their writings are to us; and therefore no man can lawfully pretend a call from God to make any addition to those writings, so neither can any man pretend to be lawfully called to the ministry of the word already written but in the manner which that word directs. Now there is nothing of which the New Testament speaks more clearly than of the characters of those who should exercise the office of elders in the church, and of the actual exercise of that office. The former are graphically drawn in the epistles to Timothy and Titus; and the latter is minutely described in Paul's discourse to the Ephesian elders, in Peter's exhortation to elders, and our Lord's commission to those ministers, with whom he promised to be always present even unto the end of the world. It is not competent for any man or body of men to add to, or diminish from, the description of a gospel minister given in these places, so as to insist upon the necessity of any qualification which is not there mentioned, or to dispense with any qualification as needless which is there required. Neither has Jesus Christ, Arguments the only legislator to the church, given to any mind against the elders or people any power or right whatsoever to call, ordain, elect, or ordain, to that office any person who is not qualified according to the description given in his law; nor has he given any power or right to reject the election of them who are so qualified, and who desire the office of a bishop or elder. Let a man have hands laid upon him by such as could prove an uninterrupted descent by imposition of hands from the apostles; let him be set apart to that office by a company of ministers themselves, the most conformable to the scripture character, and let him be chosen by the most holy people on earth; yet if he answer not the New Testament description of a minister, he is not called of God to that office, and is no minister of Christ, but is indeed running unclean. No form of ordination can pretend to such a clear foundation in the New Testament as the description of the persons who should be elders of the church; and the laying on of hands, whether by bishops or presbyters, is of no more importance in the mission of a minister of Christ, than the waving of one's hand in the air or the putting of it into his bosom; for now when the power of miracles has ceased, it is obvious that such a rite, by whomsoever performed, can convey no powers, whether ordinary or extraordinary. Indeed it appears to have been sometimes used, even in the apostolic age, without any such intention. When Paul and Barnabas were separated to the particular employment of going out to the Gentiles, the prophets and teachers at Antioch \"prayed and laid their hands on them:\" But did this ceremony confer upon the two apostles any new power or authority to act as ministers of Christ? Did the imposition of hands make those shining lights of the gospel one whit better qualified than they were before to convert and baptize the nations, to feed the flock of God, to teach, rebuke, or exhort, with all long-suffering and doctrine. It cannot be pretended. Paul and Barnabas had undoubtedly received the Holy Ghost before they came to Antioch; and as they were apostles, they were of course authorized to discharge all the functions of the inferior and ordinary ministers of the gospel. In a word, whoever in his life and conversation is conformable to the character which the inspired writers give of a bishop or elder, and is likewise qualified by his \"mightiness in the scripture\" to discharge the duties of that office, is fully authorized to administer the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's supper, to teach, and even exhort, and rebuke, with all long-suffering and docility; and has all the call and mission which the Lord now gives to any man; whilst he who wants the qualifications mentioned, has not God's call, whatever he may have, nor any authority to preach the gospel of Christ, or to dispense the ordinances of his religion.\n\nFrom this view of the Independent principles, which is faithfully taken from their own writers, it appears, that, according to them, even the election of a congregation...\nThe first catalogues of this kind were made by the inquisitors; and these were afterwards approved by the council of Trent, after some alteration was made in them by way of retrenchment or addition. Thus an index of heretical books being formed, it was confirmed by a bull of Clement VIII. in 1593, and printed with several introductory rules; by the fourth of which, the use of the Scriptures in the vulgar tongue is forbidden to all persons without a particular licence; and by the tenth rule it is ordained, that no book shall be printed at Rome without the approbation of the Pope's vicar, or some person delegated by the Pope; nor in any other places, unless allowed by the bishop of the diocese, or some person deputed by him, or by the inquisitor of heretical pravity.\n\nThe Trent index being thus published, Philip II. of Spain ordered another to be printed at Antwerp, in 1571, with considerable enlargements. Another index was published in Spain 1584; a copy of which was snatched out of the fire when the English plundered Cadiz. Afterwards there were several expurgatory indexes printed at Rome and Naples, and particularly in Spain.\n\nINDIA. See Hindostan.\u2014By the name of India the ancients understood only the western peninsula, on this side the Ganges, and the peninsula beyond it, having little or no knowledge of the countries which lie farther to the eastward; though by the moderns all those vast tracts from the eastern parts of the Persian empire to the islands of Japan, are confounded under the general name of East Indies. Even the ancients, though originally they were acquainted only with the western parts of Hindoostan, gradually extended the name of India over the other countries they discovered to the eastward; so that probably they would have involved all the red in the same general designation, had they been as well acquainted with them as the moderns are. By whom these countries were originally peopled, is a question which in all probability will never be resolved. Certain it is, that some works in these parts display marks of astonishing skill and power in the inhabitants, such as the images in the island of Elephanta; the rocking stones of immense weight, yet so nicely balanced that a man can move them with his hand; the observatory at Benares, &c. These stupendous works are by Mr Bryant attributed to the Cuthites or Babylonians, the first distinct nation in the world, and who of consequence must for some time have possessed in a manner the sovereignty of the whole earth; and it can by no means appear improbable, that the subjects of Nimrod, the beginning of whose kingdom was in Shinar, might extend themselves eastward, and thus fill the fertile regions of the east with inhabitants, without thinking it worth while for a long time to meddle with the less mild and rich countries to the westward. Thus why the would be formed that great and for some time influential Indians and other countries; so that the western nations knew not ignorant of even of the existence of the Indians but by obscure one another report; while the latter, ignorant of their own origin, invented a thousand idle tales concerning the antiquity of their nation, which some of the moderns have been credulous enough to believe and regard as facts.\n\nThe first among the western nations who distinguished\ned themselves by their application to navigation and commerce, and who were of consequence likely to discover these distant nations, were the Egyptians and Phenicians. The former, however, soon lost their inclination for naval affairs, and held all seafaring people in detestation as profane persons; though the extensive conquests of Scelotris, if we can believe them, must have in a great measure supplied this defect.\n\nWithout regard to the prejudice of his people against maritime affairs, he is said to have fitted out a fleet of 400 sail in the Arabian gulf or Red sea, which conquered all the countries lying along the Erythrean sea (a) to India; while the army led by himself marched through Asia, and subdued all the countries to the Ganges; after which he crossed that river, and advanced to the eastern ocean.\n\nGreat disputes have been carried on with respect to this conqueror, and the famous expedition just now related; but the learned Dr Robertson, in his Disquisition concerning ancient India, declares himself in doubt whether any such expedition ever was made, for the following reasons. 1. Few historical facts seem to be better established than that of the aversion the Egyptians entertained to seafaring people and naval affairs; and the Doctor considers it as impossible even for the most powerful monarch to change in a few years a national habit confirmed by time and sanctified by religion. The very magnitude of the armaments is an argument against their existence; for besides the 400 ships of war, he had another fleet in the Mediterranean; and such a mighty navy could not have been constructed in any nation unaccustomed to maritime affairs, in a few years. 2. Herodotus makes no mention of the conquests of India by Scelotris, though he relates his history at some length. Our author is of opinion that the story was fabricated betwixt the time of Herodotus and that of Diodorus Siculus, from whom we have the first account of this expedition. Diodorus himself informs us that he had it from the Egyptian priests; and gives it as his opinion, that \"many things they related flowed rather from a desire to promote the honour of their country than from attention to truth;\" and he takes notice that both the Egyptian priests and Greek writers differ widely from one another in the accounts which they give of the actions of Scelotris. 3. Though Diodorus declares that he has selected the most probable parts of the Egyptian narrative, yet there are still so many improbabilities, or rather impossibilities, contained in his relation, that we cannot by any means give credit to it. 4. For the reason just mentioned, the judicious geographer Strabo rejected the account altogether, and ranks the exploits of Scelotris in India with the fabulous ones of Bacchus and Hercules.\n\nBut whatever may be determined with regard to the Egyptians, it is certain that the Tyrians kept up a constant intercourse with some parts of India by navigating the Arabian gulf, now the Red sea. Of this navigation they became masters by taking from the Idumeans some maritime places on the coast of the Red sea: but as the distance betwixt the nearest place of that sea and Tyre was still considerable, the land-carriage would have been very tedious and expensive; for which reason it was necessary to become masters of a port on the eastern part of the Mediterranean, nearer to the Red sea than Tyre, so that the goods might be shipped from thence to Tyre itself. With this view they took possession of Rhinvelura, the nearest port on the Mediterranean to the Arabian gulf; and to that port all the goods from India were conveyed by a much shorter and less expensive route than over land.\u2014This is the first authentic account of any intercourse betwixt India and the western part of the world; and to this we are without doubt in a great measure to ascribe the vast wealth and power for which the city of Tyre was anciently renowned; for in other respects the whole territory of Phenicia was but of little consequence. Notwithstanding the frequency of these voyages, however, the ancients are able to give little or no account of them. The most particular description we have of the wealth, power, and commerce of ancient Tyre, is in the prophecies of Ezekiel; so that if the Tyrians themselves kept any journals of their voyages, it is probable that they were entirely lost when the city was destroyed by Alexander the Great.\n\nThough the Jews, under the reign of David and Solomon, carried on an extensive and lucrative commerce with India, there are only two places mentioned to which their ships sailed, viz. Ophir and Tarshish; both of which are now supposed to have been situated on the eastern coast of Africa: the ancient Tarshish, according to Mr Bruce, was the present Mocha; and Ophir the kingdom of Sofala, so remarkable in former times for its mines, that it was called by Oriental writers the golden Sofala*.\n\nThus the Indians continued for a long time unknown to the western nations, and undisturbed by them; probably in subjection to the mighty empire of Babylon, from which the country was originally peopled, or in alliance with it; and the possession of this vast region will easily account for the immense and otherwise almost incredible wealth and power of the ancient Babylonian monarchs. Soon after the destruction of that monarchy by the Persians, however, we find their monarch Darius Hystaspes undertaking an expedition in India against the Indians*. His conquests were not extensive, as they did not reach beyond the territory watered by the Indus; nevertheless, such as they were, the acquisition seems to have been very important, as the revenue derived from the conquered territory, according to Herodotus, was near a third of that of the whole Persian empire. According to his account, however, we must form a much more diminutive opinion of the riches of the Persian monarch than has commonly been done; since Herodotus tells us, that the empire was divided into 20 satrapies or governments; all of which yielded\n\n(a) This must not be confounded with the Red sea, notwithstanding the similarity of names. The Erythrean sea was that part of the ocean which is interposed betwixt the straits of Babelmandel and the Malabar coast, now called the Indian sea or ocean.\nyielded a revenue of 14,560 Euboic talents, amounting in the whole to 2,857,437l. sterling. The amount of the revenue from the conquered provinces of India therefore must have been considerably short of a million. Very little knowledge of the country was diffused by the expedition of Darius, or the voyage of Scylax whom he employed to explore the coast; for the Greeks paid no regard to the transactions of those whom they called Barbarians; and as for Scylax himself, he told so many incredible stories in the account he gave of his voyage, that he had the misfortune to be disbelieved in almost everything, whether true or false.\n\nThe expedition of Alexander is so fully taken notice of under the article Hindostan, that nothing more remains to be said upon it in this place, than that he went no farther into the country than the present territory of the Panjab, all of which he did not traverse. Its south-west boundary is formed by a river anciently called the Hydriates, now the Sutlej. The breadth of the district from Ludhiana on the Sutlej, to Attock on the Indus, is computed to be 259 geographical miles in a straight line; and Alexander's march, computed in the same manner, did not exceed 200; nevertheless, by the spreading of his numerous army over the country, and the exact measurement and delineation of all his movements by men of science whom he employed, a very extensive knowledge of the western part of India was obtained. It is, however, surprising, that having marched through so many countries in the neighbourhood of India, where the people must have been well acquainted with the nature of the climate, the Macedonian conqueror did not receive any information concerning the difficulties he would meet with from the rains which fell periodically at a certain season of the year. It was the extreme difficulties occasioned by them which made his soldiers finally resolve to proceed no farther; and no wonder indeed that they did adopt this resolution, since Diodorus informs us, that it had rained incessantly for 70 days before their departure. These rains, however, according to the testimony both of ancient and modern writers, fall only in the mountainous parts, little or none being ever seen in the plains. Arrian informs us, that in the country through which Alexander marched, though heavy rains fell among the mountains, not a shower was seen in the plains below. The district is now seldom visited by Europeans; but Major Rennell was informed by a person of credit, who had resided in the Panjab, that during great part of the S.W. monsoon, or at least in the months July, August, and part of September, which is the rainy season in most other parts of India, very little rain falls in the Delta of the Indus, except very near the sea, though the atmosphere is generally clouded, and very few showers fall throughout the whole season. Captain Hamilton relates, that when he visited Tatta, no rain had fallen there for three years before. We may have some idea of what the Macedonians suffered by what happened afterwards to Nadir Shah, who, though possessed of vast wealth and power, as well as great experience in military affairs, yet lost a great part of his army in crossing the mountains and rivers of the Panjab, and in battles with the savage inhabitants who inhabit the countries between the Oxus and the frontiers of Persia. He marched through the same countries, and nearly in the same direction, that Alexander did.\n\nBy his voyage down the river Indus, Alexander contributed much more to enlarge our geographical knowledge of India than by all his marches and conquests by land. According to Major Rennell, the space of country through which he sailed on the Indus, from the Hyphasis to the ocean, was not less than 1000 miles; and as, during the whole of that navigation, he obliged the nations on both sides the river to submit to him, we may be very certain that the country on each side was explored to some distance. An exact account not only of his military operations, but of every thing worthy of notice relating to the countries through which he passed, was preserved in the journals of his three officers, Lagus, Nearchus and Arrianobulus; and these journals, Arrian informs us, he followed in the composition of his history. From these authors we learn, that in the time of Alexander, the western part of that vast tract named India was possessed by seven very powerful monarchs. The territory of King Porus, which Alexander first conquered, and then restored to him, is said to have contained no fewer than 2000 towns; and the king of the Pashai had assembled an army of 20,000 cavalry, 2000 armed chariots, and a great number of elephants, to oppose the Macedonian monarch on the banks of the Ganges. The navigable rivers with which the Panjab country abounds, afforded them, and still continue to afford, an intercourse from one part to another by water; and as at that time these rivers had probably many ships on them for the purposes of commerce, Alexander might easily collect all the number he is said to have had, viz. 2000; since it is reported that Semiramis was opposed by double the number on the Indus when she invaded India. When Mahmud Gazni also invaded this country, a fleet was collected upon the Indus to oppose him, consisting of the same number of vessels. From the Ayeen Akbery, also, we learn that the inhabitants of this part of India still continue to carry on all their communication with each other by water; and the inhabitants of the circular of Tatta alone have 40,000 vessels of various contrivances.\n\nUnder the article Hindostan we have mentioned Why Alexander's historians take Dr Robertson accounts for it in another manner. It is remarkable (says he), that neither Nearchus, nor Arrian, once mention the voyage of Scylax. This could not proceed from their being unacquainted with it, for Herodotus was a favourite author in the hands of every Greek who had any pretensions to literature. It was probably occasioned by the reasons they had to distrust the veracity of Scylax, of which I have already taken notice. Accordingly, in a speech which Arrian puts in the mouth of Alexander, he affirms, that, except Bacchus, he was the first who had passed the Indus; which implies that he disbelieved what is related concerning Scylax, and was not acquainted with what Darius Hyphasis is said to have done in order to subject that part of India to the Persian crown. This opinion is confirmed by Megasthenes, who resided a considerable time in India. He affirms that, except Bacchus and Hercules (to whose fabulous expeditions Strabo is astonished\nastonished that he should have given any credit), Alexander was the first who had invaded India. Arrian informs us that the Achaemeni, and other people who inhabited the country now called Candahar, had been tributary first to the Assyrians and then to the Medes and Persians. As all the fertile provinces on the north-west of the Indus were anciently reckoned to be part of India, it is probable that what was levied from them is the sum mentioned in the tribute-roll from which Herodotus drew his account of the annual revenue of the Persian empire, and that none of the provinces to the south of the Indus were ever subject to the kings of Persia.\"\u2014The Doctor differs from Mr Rennell with respect to the surprize which Alexander and his army expressed when they saw the high tides at the mouth of the Indus. This he thinks might very naturally have been the case, notwithstanding what Herodotus had written concerning the flux and reflux observable in the Red sea. All that has been mentioned by Herodotus concerning this phenomenon is, that \"in the Red sea there is a regular ebb and flow of the tide every day.\" No wonder therefore that the Macedonians should be surprised and terrified at the very high tides which presented themselves in the Indian ocean, which the few words of Herodotus above-mentioned had by no means led them to expect. In the like manner, the Romans were surprised at the tides in the Atlantic, when they had conquered some of the countries bordering upon that ocean. Caesar describes the astonishment of his soldiers at a spring tide in Britain which greatly damaged his fleet; and indeed, considering the very little rise of the tide in the Mediterranean, to which alone the Greeks and Romans had access, we may reckon the account given us by Arrian highly probable.\n\nThe country on each side the Indus was found, in the time of Alexander, to be in no degree inferior in population to the kingdom of Porsus already mentioned. The climate, soil, and productions of India, as well as the manners and customs of the inhabitants, are exactly described, and the descriptions found to correspond in a surprising manner with modern accounts. The stated change of seasons now known by the name of monsoon, the periodical rains, the swellings and inundations of the rivers, with the appearance of the country during the time they continue, are particularly described. The descriptions of the inhabitants are equally particular; their living entirely upon vegetable food, their division into tribes or castes, with many of the particularities related under the article Hindoo, are to be met with in the accounts of Alexander's expedition. His military operations, however, extended but a very little way into India properly so called; no farther indeed than the modern province of Lahor, and the countries on the banks of the Indus from Moutan to the sea; though, had he lived to undertake another expedition as he intended, it is very probable that he would have subdued a vastly greater tract of country; nor indeed could anything probably have set bounds to his conquests but death or revolts in distant provinces of his empire. In order to secure the obedience of those countries he subdued, Alexander found it necessary to build a number of fortified cities; and the farther eastward he extended his conquests, the more necessary did he find this task. Three he built in India itself; two on the banks of the Hydaspes, and a third on the Acesines, both navigable rivers, falling into the Indus after they have united their streams. By means of these cities he intended not only to keep the adjacent countries in awe, but to promote a commercial intercourse betwixt different parts both by land and water. With this view also, on his return to Suse, he surveyed in person the course of the Euphrates and Tigris, causing the cataracts or dams to be removed which the Persian monarchs had built to obstruct the navigation of these rivers, in conformity to a maxim of their superstition, that it was unlawful to defile any of the elements, which they imagined was done by navigators. After the navigation was opened in this manner, he proposed that the valuable commodities of India should be imported into the other parts of his dominions by means of the Persian gulf; while through the Red sea they were conveyed to Alexandria in Egypt, and thence dispersed all over Europe.\n\nThe death of Alexander having put an end to all his great schemes, the eastern part of his dominions devolved first on Pytho the son of Agenor, and afterwards on Seleucus. The latter was very sensible of the advantages to be derived from keeping India in subjection. With this view he undertook an expedition into that country, partly to establish his authority more perfectly, and partly to defend the Macedonian territories against Sandracottus king of the Pafrii, who threatened to attack them. The particulars of his expedition are very little known; Julian being the only author that mentions them, and his authority is but of little weight, unless corroborated by the testimony of other historians. Plutarch, who tells us that Seleucus carried his arms farther into India than Alexander, is subject to an imputation of the same kind; but Pliny, whose authority is of considerably greater weight, corroborates the testimony of Plutarch in this instance, though his words are too obscure, that learned men differ in opinion concerning their meaning. Bayer thinks they imply that Seleucus marched from the Hyphasis, the boundary of Alexander's conquests, to the Hydaspes, from thence to Palibothra, and then to the mouth of the Ganges; the distances of the principal stations being marked, and amounting in all to 2244 Roman miles. Notwithstanding this authority, however, Dr Robertson thinks it very improbable that the expedition of Seleucus should have continued so long, as in that case \"the ancients would have had a more accurate knowledge of that part of the country than they seem ever to have possessed.\"\n\nThe career of Seleucus in the east was stopped by Antigonus, who prepared to invade the western part of his dominions. The former was therefore obliged to conclude a treaty with Sandracottus, whom he allowed to remain in quiet possession of his territories; but Dr Robertson is of opinion, that during the lifetime of Seleucus, which continued 42 years after the death of Alexander, no diminution of the Macedonian territories took place. With a view of keeping up a friendly intercourse with the Indian prince, Seleucus sent Megalathenes, one of Alexander's satraps, to Palibothra, capital of the kingdom of the Pafrii, situated on the banks of the Ganges. This city is by Dr Robertson supposed to be the modern Allahabad, seated at the confluence of the Jumna and Ganges, contrary...\ntrary to the opinion of Major Rennel, who supposes it to be Patna. As Megasthenes resided in this city for a considerable space of time, he had an opportunity of making many observations on the country of India in general; and these observations he was induced afterwards to publish. Unhappily, however, he mingled with his relations the most extravagant fables. To him may be traced the ridiculous accounts of men with ears so large that they could wrap themselves up in them; of tribes with one eye, without mouths or noses, &c., whence the extracts from his book given by Arrian, Diodorus, and other ancient writers, can scarcely be credited, unless confirmed by other evidence.\n\nAfter the embassy of Megasthenes to Sandracottus, and that of his son Damacus to Allitrochidas, the successor of Sandracottus, we hear no more of the affairs of India with regard to the Macedonians, until the time of Antiochus the Great, who made a short incursion into India about 197 years after the death of Seleucus. All that we know of this expedition is, that the Syrian monarch, after finishing a war he carried on against the two revolted provinces of Parthia and Bactria, entered India, where he obliged Sophagenus, king of the country which he invaded, to pay a sum of money, and give him a number of elephants. It is probable that the successors of Seleucus were obliged soon after his death to abandon all their Indian territories.\n\nAfter the loss of India by the Syrians, an intercourse was kept up for some time between it and the Greek kingdom of Bactria. This last became an independent state about 69 years after the death of Alexander; and, according to the few hints we have concerning it in ancient authors, carried on a great traffic with India. Nay, the Bactrian monarchs are said to have conquered more extensive tracts in that region than Alexander himself had done. Six princes reigned over this new kingdom in succession; some of whom, elated with the conquests they had made and the power they had acquired, assumed the title of Great King, by which the Persian monarchs were distinguished in their highest splendour. Strabo informs us, that the Bactrian princes were deprived of their territories by the Scythian Nomades, who came from the country beyond the Jaxartes, and were known by the names of Affi, Pafani, Tachari, and Scarauli. This is confirmed by the testimony of some Chinese historians quoted by M. de Guignes. According to them, about 126 years before the Christian era, a powerful horde of Tartars rushed from their native seats on the confines of China, and obliged to move farther to the west, passed the Jaxartes, and, pouring in upon Bactria like an irresistible torrent, overwhelmed that kingdom, and put an end to the dominion of the Greeks after it had lasted near 130 years.\n\nFrom this time to the close of the 1st century, all thoughts of establishing any dominion in India were totally abandoned by the Europeans. The only object now was to promote a commercial intercourse with that country; and Egypt was the medium by which that intercourse was to be promoted. Ptolemy the son of Lagus, and first king of Egypt, first raised the power and splendour of Alexandria, which he knew had been built by Alexander with a view to carry on a trade to India; and in order to make the navigation more secure, he built the celebrated light-house at Pharos; a work so magnificent as to be reckoned one of the wonders of the world. His son Ptolemy Philadelphus prosecuted the same plan very vigorously. In his time the Indian commerce once more began to centre in Tyre; but to remove it effectually from thence, he formed a canal between Arinoe on the Red sea, not far from the place where Suez now stands, and the Pelusiac or eastern branch of the Nile. This canal was 100 cubits broad and 30 deep; so that by means of it the productions of India might have been conveyed to Alexandria entirely by water. We know not whether this work was ever finished, or whether it was found useless on account of the dangerous navigation towards the northern extremity of the Red sea; but whatever was the cause, it is certain that no use was made of it, and a new city named Berenice, situated almost under the tropic, upon the western shore of the Red sea, became the staple of Indian commerce. From thence the goods were transported by land to Coptos, a city distant only three miles from the Nile, to which it was joined by a navigable canal. Thus, however, there was a very tedious land carriage of no less than 258 Roman miles through the barren desert of Theba\u00efs; but Ptolemy caused diligent search to be made everywhere for springs, and wherever they were found, he built inns or caravanserais for the accommodation of travellers; and thus the commerce with India was carried on till Egypt became subject to the Romans. The ships during this period set sail from Berenice, and coaling along the Arabian shore to the promontory of Syagrus, now Cape Raselgate, held their course along the coast of Persia till they arrived at the mouth of the western branch of the river Indus. They either failed up this branch till they came to Pattala, now Tatta, situated at the upper part of the Delta, or continued their course to some other emporium on the western part of the Indian coast. A more convenient course was afterwards found by sailing directly to Zenis, a place concerning which there is now some dispute. Montfiquet will have it to be the kingdom of Sigertis, on the coast adjacent to the Indus, and which was conquered by the Bactrian monarchs; but Major Rennel is of opinion that it was a port on the Malabar coast. Dr Robertson does not pretend to decide this dispute; but is of opinion, that during the time of the Ptolemies very little progress was made in the discovery of India. He contests the opinion of Major Rennel, that \"under the Ptolemies the Egyptians extended their navigation to the extreme point of the Indian continent, and even sailed up the Ganges to Palibothra, now Patna.\" In this case he thinks that the interior parts of India must have been much better known to the ancients than we have any reason to believe they were. He owns indeed that Strabo mentions the sailing up the Ganges, but then it is only cursorily and in a single sentence; \"whereas if such a considerable inland voyage of above 400 miles, through a populous and rich country, had been customary, or even if it had been ever performed by the Roman, Greek, or Egyptian traders, it must have merited a particular description, and must have been mentioned by Pliny, and other writers, as there was nothing similar to it in the practice of navigation among the ancients.\"\u2014The extreme danger of navigating\ngating the Red sea in ancient times (which even in the present improved state of navigation is not entirely got over) seems to have been the principal reason which induced Ptolemy to remove the communication with India from Arinoe to Berenice, as there were other harbours on the same coast considerably nearer to the Nile. After the ruin of Coptos by the emperor Diocletian, the Indian commodities were conveyed from the Red sea to the Nile from Caffir, supposed by Dr Robertson to be the Philoteras Portus of Ptolemy, to Cous, the Vicus Apollinis, a journey of four days. Hence Cous from a small village became an opulent city; but in process of time, the trade from India removed from Cous to Ken\u00e9, farther down the river.\n\nIn modern times such Indian goods as are brought by the Red sea come from Gidda to Suez, and are carried across the Isthmus on camels, or brought by the caravan returning from the pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nIt was to this monopoly of Indian commerce that Egypt owed its vast wealth and power during the time of its Macedonian monarchs; but it appears surprising that no attempt was made by the Syrian monarchs to rival them in it, especially as the latter were in possession of the Persian gulf, from whence they might have imported the Indian commodities by a much shorter navigation than could be done by the Egyptians. For this neglect several reasons are assigned by our learned author. 1. The Egyptians, under their Greek monarchs, applied themselves to maritime affairs; and were in possession of such a powerful fleet as gave them a decided superiority in it. 2. No intercourse by sea was ever kept up between Persia and India, on account of the aversion which the Persians had to maritime affairs. All the Indian commodities were then conveyed in the most tedious and difficult manner over land, and dispersed throughout the various provinces, partly by means of navigable rivers and partly by means of the Caspian sea. 3. Many of the ancients, by an unaccountable error in geography, imagined the Caspian sea to be a part of the great northern ocean; and thus the kings of Syria might hope to convey the Indian commodities to the European countries without attempting to navigate those seas which the Egyptian monarchs deemed their own property. Seleucus Nicator, the first and greatest of the Syro-Macedonian monarchs, formed a project of joining the Euxine and Caspian seas by a navigable canal, which would have effectually answered the purpose, but was abandoned before he could put it in execution, and none of his successors had abilities to execute such an undertaking. Alexander the Great had given orders, a little before his death, to fit out a squadron on the Caspian sea, in order to discover whether it had any communication with the northern ocean, the Euxine sea, or Indian ocean; but Dr Robertson justly thinks it surprising that such errors concerning this sea should have existed among the ancients, as Herodotus had long before described it properly in the following words: \"The Caspian is a sea by itself, unconnected with any other. Its length is as much as a vessel with oars can sail in fifteen days; and its greatest breadth as much as it can sail in eight days.\" Aristotle describes it in like manner, and insists that it ought to be called a great lake, and not a sea.\n\nOn the conquest of Egypt by the Romans, the Indian commodities continued as usual to be imported to Alexandria in Egypt, and from thence to Rome; but besides this, the most ancient communication betwixt the eastern and western parts of Asia seems never to have been entirely given up. Syria and Palestine are separated from Mesopotamia by a desert; but the passage through it was much facilitated by its affording a station which abounded in water. Hence the possession of this station became an object of such consequence, that Solomon built upon it the city called in Syria Tadmor, and in Greek Palmyra. Both these names are expressive of its situation in a spot adorned with palm-trees. Though its situation for trade may to us seem very unfavourable (being 60 miles from the Euphrates, by which alone it could receive the Indian commodities, and 203 from the nearest coast of the Mediterranean), yet the value and small bulk of the goods in question rendered the conveyance of them by a long carriage over land not only practicable but lucrative and advantageous. Hence the inhabitants became opulent and powerful, and long maintained its independence even after the Syrian empire became subject to Rome. After the reduction of Palmyra by the emperor Aurelian, however, it did not any more recover its splendor; the trade gradually turned into other channels, and the city was reduced to ruins, which still exist, and manifest its former grandeur. See PALMYRA.\n\nThe excessive eagerness of the Romans for Asiatic luxuries of all kinds kept up an unceasing intercourse with India during the whole time that the empire continued in its power; and even after the destruction of the western part, it was kept up betwixt Constantinople and those parts of India which had been visited formerly by merchants from the western empire. Long before this period, however, a much better method of navigating to India had been discovered by one Hippalus, the commander of an Indian ship, who lived about 80 years after Egypt had been annexed to the Roman empire. This man having observed the periodical shifting of the monsoons, and how steadily they blew from the east or west during some months, ventured to leave the coast, and sail boldly across the Indian ocean from the mouth of the Arabian gulf to Mafiris, a port on the Malabar coast; which discovery was reckoned a matter of such importance, that the name of Hippalus was given to the wind by which he performed the voyage. Pliny gives a very particular account of the manner in which the Indian traffic was now carried on, mentioning the particular stages, and the distances between them, which are as follow. From Alexandria to Joppa was two miles; and there the cargo destined for India was shipped on the Nile, and carried to Coptos, distant 303 miles, the voyage being usually performed in twelve days. From Coptos they were conveyed by land to Berenice, distant 258 miles, and halting at different stations as occasion required. The journey was finished on the 12th day; but by reason of the heat the caravan travelled only in the night. The ships left Berenice about midsummer, and in 30 days reached Ocelis, now Galla, at the mouth of the Arabian gulf, or Cane (now Cape Faroague) on the coast of Arabia Felix; from whence they sailed in 40 days to Mafiris already mentioned. Their homeward voyage began early in the month of December; when setting sail with...\nwith a north-east wind, and meeting with a south or south-west one when they entered the Arabian gulf, the voyage was completed in less than a year. With regard to the situation of Mufiris, as well as of Barace, another Indian port to which the ancients traded, Major Rennel is of opinion, and Dr Robertson agrees with him, that they stood somewhere between Goa and Tellicherry; and that probably the modern Meerzaw or Merjee is the Mufiris, and Barcelore the Barace of the ancients.\n\nPtolemy, who flourished about 200 years after the commencement of the Christian era, having the advantage of so many previous discoveries, gives a more particular description of India than what is to be met with in any of the ancient writers; notwithstanding which, his accounts are frequently insufficient not only with modern discoveries, but with those of more ancient geographers than himself. A most capital error in his geography is, that he makes the peninsula of India stretch from the Sinus Barygazenus, or gulf of Cambay, from west to east, instead of extending, according to its real direction, from north to south; and this error must appear the more extraordinary, when we consider that Megasthenes had published a measurement of this peninsula nearly conformant to truth, which had been adopted with some variations by Eratosthenes, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, and Pliny. His information concerning the situation of places, however, was much more accurate. With respect to some districts on the eastern part of the peninsula, as far as the Ganges, he comes nearer the truth than in his descriptions of any of the rest. These are particularly pointed out by M. d'Anville, who has determined the modern names of many of Ptolemy's stations, as Kilkare, Negapatam, the mouth of the river Cauveri, Mafulpatam, &c. The river Cauveri is the Chabaris of Ptolemy; the kingdom of Arcot, Avcai Regio; and probably, says Dr Robertson, the whole coast has received its present name of Coromandel from Sor Mandulam, or the kingdom of Sora, which is situated upon it. Ptolemy had likewise acquired so much knowledge concerning the river Ganges, that he describes six of its mouths, though his delineation of that part of India which lies beyond the Ganges is hardly less erroneous than that of the nearer peninsula. M. d'Anville, however, has been at great pains to elucidate these matters, and to illustrate those parts of the writings of Ptolemy which appear to be best founded. According to him, the golden Cheronefus of Ptolemy is the peninsula of Malacca; he supposes the gulf of Siam to be the great bay of Ptolemy, and the Sin Metropolis of the same writer he looks upon to be Sin-hoa in the western part of the kingdom of Cochin-China, though Ptolemy has erred in its situation no less than 50 degrees of longitude and 20 of latitude. M. Goffelin, however, differs from his countryman M. d'Anville, in a late work intitled \"The Geography of the Greeks analysed; or the systems of Eratosthenes, Strabo, and Ptolemy, compared with each other, and with the knowledge which the moderns have acquired.\" In the opinion of M. Goffelin, the Magnum Promontorium of Ptolemy is not Cape Romania at the southern extremity of the peninsula of Malacca, as M. d'Anville supposes, but the point Bragu, at the mouth of the river Ava. The great bay of Ptolemy he supposes not to be the gulf of Siam, but of Martaban.\n\nHe endeavours to prove that the position of Cattipnara, as laid down by Ptolemy, corresponds with that of Mergui, a sea port on the west of Siam; and that Thina, or Sin Metropolis, is not Sin-hoa, but Tana-serim, a city on the same river with Mergui; and he contends, that the Ibbadji insula of Ptolemy is not Sumatra, as D'Anville would have it, but one of the small isles which lie in a cluster off this coast. M. Goffelin is of opinion that the ancients never sailed through the straits of Malacca, nor had any knowledge of the island of Sumatra, or of the eastern ocean.\n\nThe errors of Ptolemy have given occasion to a mistake of more modern date, viz. that the ancients were acquainted with China. This arose from the resemblance betwixt the name of that empire and the Sin of the ancients. The Ayeen Akbery informs us, that Cheen was an ancient name of Pegu; whence, says Dr Robertson, \"as that country borders upon Ava, where M. Goffelin places the great promontory, this near resemblance of names may appear perhaps to confirm his opinion that Sin Metropolis was situated on this coast, and not so far east as M. d'Anville has placed it.\"\n\nThus we see that the peninsula of Malacca was in all probability the boundary of the ancient discoveries of the navigation of the ancients.\n\nThe Romans having extended their dominions as far as the river Euphrates, found this method of conveyance still established, and the trade was by them encouraged and protected. The progress of the caravans being frequently interrupted by the Parthians, particularly when they travelled towards those countries where silk and other of the most valuable manufactures were procured, it thence became an object to the Romans to conciliate the friendship of the sovereigns of those distant countries. That such an attempt was actually made, we know from the Chinese historians, who tell us, that Antoun, by whom they mean the emperor Marcus Antoninus, the king of the people of the western ocean, sent an embassy to Ounti, who reigned in China in the 166th year of the Christian era; but though the fact is mentioned, we are left entirely in the dark as to the issue of the negotiations. It is certain, however, that during the times of the Romans such a trade was carried on; and as we cannot suppose all those who visited that distant region to be entirely defective in science, we may reasonably enough conclude, that by means of some of these adventurers, Ptolemy was enabled to determine the situation of many places which he has laid down in his geography, and which correspond very nearly with the observations of modern times.\n\nWith regard to the Indian islands, considering the few Indian little way they extended their navigation, they could lands differ not be acquainted with many of them. The principal covered by the ancients was that of Ceylon, called by the ancients Taprobane. The name was entirely unknown in Europe before the time of Alexander the Great; but that conqueror, though he did not visit, had somehow or other heard of it; with regard to any particulars, however, he seems to have been very flatteringly informed; and the accounts of ancient geographers concerning it are confused.\nconfused and contradictory. Strabo says, it is as large as Britain, and situated at the distance of seven days according to some reports, or 20 days sailing according to others, from the southern extremity of the peninsula. Pomponius Mela is uncertain whether to consider Taprobane as an island, or the beginning of another world; but inclines to the latter opinion, as nobody had ever sailed round it. The account of Pliny is still more obscure; and by his description he would make us believe, that it was seated in the southern hemisphere beyond the tropic of Capricorn. Ptolemy places it opposite to Cape Comorin, at no great distance from the continent; but errs greatly with regard to its magnitude, making it no less than 15 degrees in length from north to south. And Agathemus, who wrote after Ptolemy, makes Taprobane the largest island in the world, affixing the second place to Britain. From these discordant accounts, some learned men have supposed that the Taprobane of the ancients is not Ceylon, as is generally believed, but the island of Sumatra; though the description of it by Ptolemy, with the figure delineated in his maps, seems to put it beyond a doubt, that Ceylon, and not Sumatra, is the island to which Ptolemy applies the designation of Taprobane. The other islands described by that geographer to the eastward of Taprobane, are, according to Dr Robertson, those called Andaman and Nicobar in the gulf of Bengal.\n\nFrom the time of Ptolemy to that of the emperor Julian, we have no account of any intercourse of the Europeans with India, or of any progress made in the geographical knowledge of the country. Under that emperor one Cosmas, an Egyptian merchant, made some voyages to India, where he acquired the surname of Indicopleustes. Having afterwards turned monk, he published several works; one of which, named Christian Topography, has reached us. In this, though mixed with many strange reveries, he relates with great simplicity and appearance of truth what he had seen in his travels or had learned from others. He describes several places on the western coast of the hither peninsula, which he calls the chief seat of the pepper-trade; and from one of the ports on that coast, named Male, Dr Robertson thinks that the name Malabar may probably be derived, as well as that of Maldives given to a cluster of islands lying at no great distance. Cosmas informs us also, that in his time the island of Taprobane had become a great staple of trade. He calls it not Taprobane, but Sieddibia, derived from Selendib, or Serendib, the name by which it is still known all over the east. From him also we learn, that the Persians having overthrown the empire of the Parthians, applied themselves with great diligence and success to maritime affairs; in consequence of which they became formidable rivals to the Romans in the India trade. The latter finding themselves thus in danger of losing entirely that lucrative branch, partly by reason of the rivalry just mentioned, and partly by reason of the frequent hostilities which took place between the two empires, formed a scheme of preserving some share of the trade by means of their ally the emperor of Abyssinia. In this he was disappointed, though afterwards he obtained his end in a way entirely unexpected. This was introduced by means of two monks who had been employed as missionaries in different parts of the east, and had penetrated as far as the country of the Seres or China. From thence, induced by the liberal promises of Justinian, they brought a quantity of the eggs of the silk-worms in a hollow cane. They were then hatched by the heat of a dunghill; and being fed with the leaves of the mulberry, worked and multiplied as well as in those countries of which they are natives. Vast numbers were soon reared in Greece; from whence they were exported to Sicily, and from thence to Italy; in all which countries silk manufactures have since been established.\n\nOn the conquest of Egypt by the Saracens in the year 640, the India trade was of course transferred to them; and they soon began to pursue it with much more vigour than the Romans had done. The city of Balhara was built by the caliph Omar upon the western banks of the great river formed by the union of the Euphrates with the Tigris. Thus the command of both rivers was secured, and the new city soon became a place of such consequence as scarce to yield to Alexandria itself. Here Dr Robertson takes notice, that from the evidence of an Arabian merchant who wrote in the year 851, it appears, that not only the Saracens, but the Chinese also, were destitute of the main Chinese compass; contrary to the general opinion, that this instrument was known in the east long before it made its appearance in Europe. From this relation, as well as much concurring evidence, says our author, \"it is manifest, that not only the Arabians but the Chinese were destitute of this faithful guide, and that their mode of navigation was not more adventurous than that of the Greeks and Romans. They steered servilely along the coast, seldom stretching out to sea so far as to lose sight of land; and as they layed their course in this timid manner, their mode of reckoning was defective, and liable to the same errors with that of the Greeks and Romans.\" Notwithstanding this disadvantage, however, they penetrated far beyond Siam, which had set bounds to the navigation of the Europeans. They became acquainted with Sumatra and other Indian islands; extending their navigation as far as the city of Canton in China. A regular commerce was now carried on from the Persian gulf to all the countries lying betwixt it and China, and even with China itself. Many Saracens settled in India properly so called, and in the countries beyond it. In the city of Canton particularly, they were so numerous, that the emperor permitted them to have a cadi or judge of their own religion; the Arabian language was understood and spoken in every place of consequence; and ships from China are even said to have visited the Persian gulf.\n\nAccording to the Arabian accounts of those days, State of India when the peninsula of India was at that time divided into four kingdoms. The first was composed of the provinces situated on the Indus and its branches, the capital of which was Mouttan. The second had the city of Canoge, which, from the ruins of it remaining at this day, appears to have been a very large place. The\nIndian historians relate, that it contained 30,000 shops in which betel nut was sold, and 60,000 sets of musicians and fingers who paid a tax to government. The third kingdom was that of Cachmere, first mentioned by Maffoudi, who gives a short description of it. The fourth kingdom, Guzerat, is represented by the same author as the most powerful of the whole. Another Arab writer, who flourished about the middle of the 14th century, divides India into three parts; the northern, comprehending all the provinces on the Indus; the middle, extending from Guzerat to the Ganges; and the southern, which he denominates Comar, from Cape Comorin.\n\nFrom the relation of the Arabian merchant above mentioned, explained by the commentary of another Arabian who had likewise visited the eastern parts of Asia, we learn many particulars concerning the inhabitants of these distant regions at that time, which correspond with what is observed among them at this day. They take notice of the general use of silk among the Chinese; and the manufacture of porcelain, which they compare to glass. They also describe the tea plant, with the manner of using its leaves; whence it appears, that in the ninth century the use of this plant in China was as common as it is at present. They mention likewise the great progress which the Indians had made in astronomy; a circumstance which seems to have been unknown to the Greeks and Romans: they assert, that in this branch of science the Indians were far superior to the most enlightened nations of the west, on which account their sovereign was called the \"King of wisdom.\" The superstitions, extravagant penances, &c., known to exist at this day among the Indians, are also mentioned by those writers; all which particulars manifest that the Arabs had a knowledge of India far superior to that of the Greeks or Romans. The zeal and industry of the Mohammedans in exploring the most distant regions of the east was rivalled by the Christians of Persia, who sent missionaries all over India and the countries adjoining, as far as China itself. But while the western Asiatics thus kept up a constant intercourse with these parts, the Europeans had in a manner lost all knowledge of them. The port of Alexandria, from which they had formerly been supplied with the Indian goods, was now shut against them; and the Arabs, satisfied with supplying the demands of their own subjects, neglected to send any by the usual channels to the towns on the Mediterranean. The inhabitants of Constantinople and some other great towns were supplied with Chinese commodities by the most tedious and difficult passage imaginable. The silk of that country was purchased in the most westerly province named Chenii; from whence it was conveyed by a caravan, which marched 80 or 100 days, to the banks of the Oxus. Here it was embarked, and carried down the river to the Caspian sea; whence, after a dangerous voyage across that sea, it was carried up the river Cyrus as far as that river is navigable; after which it was conducted by a land carriage of five days to the river Phasis, then down that stream into the Euxine, and thence to Constantinople. The passage of goods from Hindostan was less tedious; they being carried either directly to the Caspian or to the river Oxus, but by a passage much shorter than that from China; after which they were conveyed down the Phasis to the Euxine, and thus to Constantinople.\n\nIt is evident that a commerce thus carried on must have been liable to a thousand disadvantages. The goods conveyed over such vast tracts of land could not be sold but at a very high price, even supposing the journey had been attended with no danger; but as the caravans were continually exposed to the assaults of barbarians, it is evident that the price must on that account have been greatly enhanced. In spite of every difficulty, however, even this commerce flourished, and Constantinople became a considerable mart for East Indian commodities; and from it all the rest of Europe was chiefly supplied with them for more than two centuries. The perpetual course of hostilities in which the Christians and Mohammedans were during this period engaged, contributed still to increase the difficulty; and it is remarkable, that the more this difficulty increased, the more devious the Europeans seemed to be of procuring the luxuries of Asia.\n\nAbout this time the cities of Amalfi and Venice, with some others in Italy, having acquired a greater degree of independence than they formerly possessed, began first to exert themselves in promoting domestic manufactures, and then to import the productions of India in much larger quantities than formerly. Some traces of this revival of a commercial spirit, according to Dr Robertson, may be observed from the end of the seventh century. The circumstances which led to this revival, however, are entirely unnoticed by historians; but during the seventh and eighth centuries, it is very probable that no commercial intercourse whatever took place between Italy and Alexandria; for, prior to the period we speak of, all the public deeds of the Italian and other cities of Europe had been written upon paper made of the Egyptian papyrus, but after that upon parchment.\n\nThe mutual antipathy which the Christians and Mohammedans bore against each other, would no doubt for a long time retard the progress of commerce between them; but at last the caliphs, perceiving the advantage which such a traffic would be of to their subjects, were induced to allow it, while the eagerness with which the Christians coveted the Indian products and manufactures, prompted them to carry it on. But the effect of scarcity was the trade begun, when it seemed in danger of being totally interrupted by the crusades. Notwithstanding the enthusiastic zeal of these adventurers, however, there were many to whom commerce was a greater object than religion. This had always been the case with numbers of the pilgrims who visited the holy places at Jerusalem even before the commencement of the crusades: but these, after they took place, instead of retarding the progress of this kind of commerce, proved the means of promoting it to a great degree. Various circumstances (says Dr Robertson) concurred towards this. Great armies, conducted by the most illustrious nobles of Europe, and composed of men of the most enterprising spirit in all the kingdoms of it, marched towards Palestine, through countries far advanced beyond those which they left in every species of improvement. They beheld the dawn of prosperity in the republics of Italy, which had begun to vie with each other in the arts of industry, and in their efforts to engross the lucrative commerce with the\nthe east. They next admired the more advanced state of opulence and splendor in Constantinople, raised to a pre-eminence above all cities then known by its extensive trade, particularly that which it carried on with India and the countries beyond it. They afterwards served in those provinces of Asia through which the commodities of the east were usually conveyed, and became matters of several cities which had been staples of that trade. They established the kingdom of Jerusalem, which subsisted near 200 years. They took possession of the throne of the Greek empire, and governed it about half a century. Amidst such a variety of events and operations, the ideas of the fierce warriors of Europe gradually opened and improved; they became acquainted with the policy and arts of the people whom they subdued; they observed the sources of their wealth, and availed themselves of all this knowledge. Antioch and Tyre, when conquered by the crusaders, were flourishing cities, inhabited by opulent merchants, who supplied all the nations trading in the Mediterranean with the productions of the east; and, as far as can be gathered from incidental occurrences mentioned by the historians of the holy war, who being mostly priests and monks, had their attention directed to objects very different from those relating to commerce, there is reason to believe, that both in Constantinople while subject to the Franks, and in the ports of Syria acquired by the Christians, the long-established trade with the east continued to be protected and encouraged.\n\nOur author next goes on to show in what manner the commerce of the Italian states was promoted by the crusades, until at last, having entirely engrossed the East India trade, they strove with such eagerness to find new markets for their commodities, that they extended a taste for them to many parts of Europe where they had formerly been little known. The rivalry of the Italian states terminated at last in a treaty with the sultan of Egypt in 1425, by which the port of Alexandria and others in Egypt were opened to the Florentines as well as the Venetians; and soon after, that people began to obtain a share in the trade to India.\n\nThe following account of the manner in which the India trade was carried on in the beginning of the 14th century, is given by Marino Sanudo a Venetian nobleman. The merchants of that republic were supplied with the commodities they wanted in two different ways. Those of small bulk and great value, such as cloves, nutmegs, gems, pearls, &c., were carried up the Persian gulf to Baffora, from thence to Bagdad, and afterwards to some port on the Mediterranean. The more bulky goods, such as pepper, cinnamon, and other spices, were brought in the usual manner to the Red sea, and from thence to Alexandria. The goods brought by land, however, were always liable to be seized by barbarians; and therefore the supply that way was scanty, and the price extravagantly dear, while, on the other hand, the sultan of Egypt, by imposing duties upon the East India cargoes to the amount of a full third of the value, seemed to render it impossible that the owners should find purchasers for their goods. This, however, was far from being the case; the demand for India goods continually increased; and thus a communication, formerly unknown, betwixt all the nations of Europe, was begun and kept up. All this time, however, there had been no direct communication betwixt Europe and India, as the Mohammedans would never allow any Christian to pass through their dominions into that country. The dreadful incursions and conquests of the Tartars under Jenghiz-khan, however, had so broken the power of the Mohammedans in the northern parts of Asia, that a way was now opened to India through the dominions of these barbarians. About the middle of the 13th century, therefore, Marco Polo, a Venetian, by getting access to the Marco Khan of the Tartars, explored many parts of the east which had long been unknown even by name to the Europeans. He travelled through China from Peking on its northern frontier to some of its most southerly provinces. He visited also different parts of Hindustan, and first mentions Bengal and Guzerat by their modern names as great and flourishing kingdoms. He obtained also some account of an island which he called Ziapangri, and was probably no other than Japan; he visited Java with several of the islands in its neighbourhood, the island of Ceylon, and the coast of Malabar as far as the gulf of Cambay; to all which he gave the names they have at this day. The discovery of such immense regions unknown before in Europe, furnished vast room for speculation and conjecture; and while the public attention was yet engaged by these discoveries, the destruction of Constantinople by the Turks trade to India ruined gave a very considerable turn to the East India commerce, by throwing it almost entirely into the hands of the Venetians. Hitherto the Genoese had rivalled Constantinople in the commerce we speak of, and they had nipt, possessed themselves of many important places on the coast of Greece, as well as of the port of Caffa on the Black sea. Nay, they had even established themselves at Constantinople, in the suburb of Pera, in such a manner as almost entirely to exclude the Greeks themselves from any share in this commerce; but by the destruction of Constantinople they were at once driven out of all these possessions, and so thoroughly humbled, that they could no longer contend with the Venetians as before; so that, during the latter part of the 15th century, that republic supplied the greater part of Europe with the productions of the east, and carried on trade to an extent far beyond what had been known in former times. The mode in which they now carried on this trade was somewhat different from what had been practised by ancient nations. The Tyrians, Greeks, and Romans, had sailed directly to India in quest of the commodities they wanted; and their example has been imitated by the navigators of modern Europe. In both periods the Indian commodities have been paid for in gold and silver; and great complaints have been made on account of the drain of those precious metals, which were thus buried as it were in India, never to return again. The Venetians, however, were exempted from this loss; for having no direct intercourse with India, they supplied themselves from the warehouses they found, in Egypt from their and Syria, ready filled with the precious commodities they wanted; and these they purchased more frequently by barter than with ready money. Thus, not only the republic of Venice, but all the cities which had the good fortune to become emporia for the India goods imported by it, were raised to such a pitch of power.\npower and splendor as scarce ever belonged to any European state. The citizens of Bruges, from which place the other European nations were for a long time supplied with these goods, displayed such magnificence in their dress, buildings, and manner of living, as excited even the envy of their queen Joan of Navarre who came to pay them a visit. On the removal of the staple from Bruges to Antwerp, the latter soon displayed the same opulence; and in some cities of Germany, particularly Augsburg, the great mart for Indian commodities in the internal parts of that country, there are examples of merchants acquiring such large fortunes as entitled them to high rank and consideration in the empire. The most accurate method, however, of attaining some knowledge of the profits the Venetians had on their trade, is by conferring the rate of interest on money borrowed at that time. This, from the close of the 11th century to the commencement of the 16th, we are told, was no less than 20 per cent, and sometimes more. Even as late as 1500, it was 10 or 12 in every part of Europe. Hence we are to conclude that the profits of such money as was then applied in trade must have been extremely high; and the condition of the inhabitants of Venice at that time warrants us to make the conclusion.\n\n\"In the magnificence of their houses (says Dr Robertson), in richness of furniture, in profusion of plate, and in everything which contributed either towards elegance or parade in their mode of living, the nobles of Venice surpassed the state of the greatest monarch beyond the Alps. Nor was all this display the effect of an ostentatious and inconsiderate dissipation; it was the natural consequence of successful industry, which, having accumulated wealth with ease, is entitled to enjoy it in splendor.\"\n\nThis extensive superiority of wealth displayed by the Venetians could not fail to excite the envy of the other states of Europe. They were at no loss to discover that the East India trade was the principal source from whence their wealth was derived. Some of them endeavored to obtain a share by applying to the sultans of Egypt and Syria to gain admission into their ports upon the same terms with the Venetians; but either by the superior interest of the latter with those princes, or from the advantages they had of being long established in the trade, the Venetians always prevailed. So intent indeed were the other European powers on obtaining some share of this lucrative commerce, that application was made to the sovereign of Russia to open an intercourse by land with China, though the capitals of the two empires are upwards of 6000 miles distant from each other. This, however, was beyond the power of the Russian prince at that time; and the Venetians imagined that their power and wealth were fully established on the most permanent basis, when two events, altogether unforeseen and unexpected, gave it a mortal blow, from which it never has recovered, nor can recover itself. These were the discovery of America and that of the passage to the East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope. The former put Spain in possession of immense treasures; which being gradually diffused all over Europe, soon called forth the industry of other nations, and made them exert themselves in such a manner as of itself must have soon lessened the demand for Indian productions.\n\nThe discovery of the passage to India by the Cape of Good Hope, however, was the most effectual and speedy in humbling the Venetians. After a tedious course of voyages along the western coast of Africa, continued for near half a century, Vasco de Gama, an active and enterprising Portuguese officer, doubled the Cape of Good Hope, and, coasting along the eastern shore of the continent, sailed next across the Indian ocean, and landed at Calicut on the coast of Malabar, on the 22d of May 1498, ten months and two days after leaving the port of Lisbon. On his arrival in India he was at first received with great kindness by the sovereign of that country, styled the Samar\u00edn; but afterwards, from what causes we cannot now well determine, the Indian prince suddenly changed his kindness into mortal enmity, and attempted to cut off Gama with his whole party. The Portuguese admiral, however, found means to escape every plot that was laid against him; and loaded his ships not only with the products of that part of the country, but with many of the valuable products of the more remote regions.\n\nOn his return to Portugal, De Gama was received with all imaginable demonstrations of kindness. The Portuguese nation, nay all the nations in Europe, the guests in Venetians alone excepted, rejoiced at the discovery which had been made. The latter beheld in it the certain and unavoidable downfall of their own power, while the Portuguese, presuming upon their right of prior discovery, which they took care to have confirmed by a papal grant, plumed themselves on the thoughts of having the whole Indian commerce centre in their nation. The expectations of the one, and the apprehensions of the other, seemed at first to be well-founded. A succession of gallant officers sent into the east from Portugal accomplished the greatest and most arduous undertakings. In 24 years after the voyage of De Gama, they had made themselves masters of many important places in India; and among the rest of the city of Malacca, where the great staple of trade throughout the whole East Indies was established. As this city stands nearly at an equal distance from the eastern and western extremities of all the countries comprehended under the name of Indies, it was frequented by the merchants of China, Japan, of all the kingdoms on the continent, the Moluccas and other islands in that quarter, as well as by those of Malabar, Ceylon, Coromandel, and Bengal. Thus the Portuguese acquired a most extensive influence over the internal commerce of India; while, by the settlements they had formed at Goa and Diu, they were enabled to engraft the trade on the Malabar coast, and greatly to obstruct the long established intercourse of Egypt with India by the way of the Red sea. Their ships now frequented every port in the east where any valuable commodities were to be had, from the Cape of Good Hope to the river of Canton in China; and all along this immense extent of more than 4000 leagues, they had a chain of forts and factories established for the convenience of protecting their trade. They had likewise made themselves masters of several stations favourable to commerce along the southern coast of Africa, and in many islands lying between Madagascar and the Moluccas. In all places where they came, their arms had struck such terror, that they not only carried on their trade without any rival or control, but even prescribed\nto the natives the terms of their mutual intercourse; nay, sometimes they set what price they pleased upon the commodities they purchased, and thus were enabled to import into Europe the Indian commodities in greater abundance and at a lower rate than had ever been done before. Not satisfied with this, they formed a scheme of excluding all other nations from any share of the trade they enjoyed; and for that purpose determined to make themselves masters of such stations on the Red sea and Persian gulf as might put them in possession of the navigation of both these seas, and enable them not only to obstruct the ancient commerce between Egypt and India, but to command the mouths of the great rivers which we have formerly mentioned as the means of conveying the Indian goods through the internal parts of Asia. The conduct of these enterprises was committed to Alfonso Albuquerque, the most distinguished officer at that time in the Portuguese service. By reason of the vast number of the enemies he had to contend with, however, and the scanty supplies which could be derived from Portugal, he could not fully accomplish what was expected from him. However, he took from the petty princes who were tributaries to the kings of Persia the small island of Ormus, which commanded the mouth of the Persian gulf; and thus secured to Portugal the possession of that extensive trade with the east which the Persians had carried on for several centuries. On this barren island, almost entirely covered with salt, and so hot that the climate can scarcely be borne, destitute of a drop of fresh water, except what was brought from the continent, a city was erected by the Portuguese, which soon became one of the chief seats of opulence, splendour, and luxury, in the eastern world. In the Red sea the Arabian princes made a much more formidable resistance; and this, together with the damage his fleet sustained in that sea, the navigation of which is always difficult and dangerous, obliged Albuquerque to retire without effecting anything of importance. Thus the ancient channel of conveyance still remained open to the Egyptians; but their commerce was greatly circumscribed and obstructed by the powerful interest of the Portuguese in every port to which they had been accustomed to resort.\n\nThe Venetians now began to feel those effects of De Gama's discovery which they had dreaded from the beginning. To preserve the remains of their commerce, they applied to the sultan of the Mameluks in Egypt, who was no less alarmed than themselves at the loss of such a capital branch of his revenue as he had been accustomed to derive from the India trade. By then this fierce and barbarous prince was easily persuaded to send a furious manifesto to Pope Julius II. and Emmanuel king of Portugal. In this, after stating his exclusive right to the Indian trade, he informed them, that if the Portuguese did not relinquish that new course of navigation by which they had penetrated into the Indian ocean, and cease from encroaching on that commerce which from time immemorial had been carried on between the east of Asia and his dominions, he would put to death all the Christians in Egypt, Syria, and Palestine, and demolish the holy sepulchre itself. To this threat, which some centuries before would have alarmed all Christendom, no regard was paid; so that the Venetians, as their last resource, were obliged to have recourse to a different expedient. This was to excite the sultan to fit out a fleet in the Red sea to attack the Portuguese, and drive them from all their settlements in the east; nay, in order to assist him in the enterprise, he was allowed to cut down their forests in Dalmatia, to supply the deficiency of Egypt in timber for ship-building. The timber was conveyed from Dalmatia to Alexandria; and from thence, partly by water and partly by land, to Suez; where twelve men of war were built, on board which a body of Mameluks were ordered to serve under the command of an experienced officer. Thus the Portuguese were affrighted by a new enemy, far more formidable than any they had yet encountered; yet such was the valour and conduct of the admiral, that after several severe engagements, the fleet of the infidels was entirely ruined, and the Portuguese became absolute masters of the Indian ocean.\n\nThis disaster was followed in no long time by the total overthrow of the dominion of the Mameluks in Egypt by Selim the Turkish sultan; who thus also became master of Syria and Palestine. As his interest was now the same with that of the Venetians, a league was quickly formed betwixt them for the ruin of the power of the Portuguese in India. With this view Selim confirmed to the Venetians the extensive commercial privileges they enjoyed under the government of the Mameluks; publishing at the same time an edict, by which he permitted the free entry of all the productions of the east imported directly from Alexandria into any part of his dominions, but imposed heavy taxes upon such as were imported from Lisbon. All this, however, was insufficient to counteract the great advantages which the Portuguese had obtained by the new passage to India, and the settlements they had established in that country; at the same time that the power of the Venetians being entirely broken by the league of Cambrai, they were no longer able to contribute any assistance. They were therefore reduced to the necessity of making an offer to the king of Portugal to purchase all the spices imported into Lisbon, over and above what might be requisite for the consumption of his own subjects. This offer being rejected, the Portuguese for some time remained uncontrollable masters of the Indian trade, and all Europe was supplied by them, excepting some very inconsiderable quantity which was imported by the Venetians through the usual channels.\n\nThe Portuguese continued to enjoy this valuable branch of commerce undisturbed almost for a whole Portuguese century; to which, however, they are indebted more for its political situation of the different European nations than to their own prowess. After the accession of Charles V. to the throne of Spain, that kingdom was again either so much engaged in a multiplicity of operations, owing to the ambition of that monarch and his son Philip II., or so intent on prosecuting the discoveries and conquests in the new world, that no effort was made to interfere with the East Indian trade of the Portuguese, even though an opportunity offered by the discovery of a second passage by sea to the East Indies through the straits of Magellan. By the acquisition of the crown of Portugal in 1580, Spain, instead of becoming the rival, became the protector and guardian of the Portuguese trade. The resources of France all\nthis time were so much exhausted by a continuance of long and defolating wars, that it could bestow neither much attention on objects at such a distance, nor engage in any expensive scheme. England was defoliated by the ruinous wars between the houses of York and Lancaster, and afterwards its enterprising spirit was restrained by the cautious and covetous Henry VII. His son Henry VIII., in the former part of his reign, by engaging in the continental quarrels of the European princes, and in the latter part by his quarrel with the pope and contests about religion, left no time for commercial schemes. It was not therefore till the reign of Queen Elizabeth that any attention was paid to the affairs of the east by that kingdom. The first who shook the power of the Portuguese in India were the Dutch; and in this they were gladly seconded by the natives, whom the Portuguese had most grievously oppressed. The English soon followed their example; and in a few years the Portuguese were expelled from their most valuable settlements, while the most lucrative branches of their trade have continued ever since in the hands of those two nations.\n\nIt is not to be supposed that the other European nations would sit still and quietly see these two engross the whole of this lucrative commerce without attempting to put in for a share. East India companies were therefore set up in different countries; but it was only between France and Britain that the great rivalry commenced; nor did this fully display itself till after the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle. Both nations had by this time made themselves masters of considerable settlements in India. The principal of those belonging to Britain were, 1. Surat, situated on the western side of the peninsula within the Ganges, between the 21st and 22nd degrees of N. Lat. This peninsula comprehended the kingdoms of Malabar, Decan, Golconda, and Bijapur, with the principalities of Gingi, Tanjore, and Madura; the western coast being distinguished by the name of Malabar, and the eastern by that of Coromandel. 2. Bombay, a small island in the kingdom of Decan, about 45 leagues to the south of Surat. 3. Dabul, about 40 leagues farther to the south, in the province of Canan. 4. Carwar, in N. Lat. 15\u00b0, where there was a small fort and factory. 5. Tillicherry, to which place the English trade was removed from Calicut, a large town 15 leagues to the southward. 6. Anjengo, between eight and nine degrees of latitude, the most southerly settlement on the western coast of the peninsula. 7. On the Coromandel coast they possessed Fort St David's, formerly called Tegapatam, situated in the kingdom of Gingi, in 11\u00b0 40' N. Lat. 8. Madras, the principal settlement on this coast, between 13\u00b0 and 14\u00b0 N. Lat. not far from the diamond mines of Golconda. 9. Vizigapatam, farther to the north. 10. Balasore, in latitude 22\u00b0, a factory of small consequence. 11. Calcutta, the capital of all the British settlements in the East Indies. These were the principal places belonging to Britain which we shall have occasion to mention in the account of the contests which now took place; those of the French were chiefly Pondicherry and Chandernagore.\n\nThe war is said to have been first occasioned by the intrigues of the French commandant M. Duplex; who immediately after the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, began to sow dissension among the nabobs, who had by this time usurped the sovereignty of the country. Nizam Almuck, viceroy of Decan, and nabob of Arcot, had, as officer for the Mogul, nominated Anaverdy Khan to be governor of the Carnatic, in the year 1745. On the death of Nizam, his second son Nazir-zing was appointed to succeed him in his viceroyalty, and his nomination was confirmed by the Mogul. He was opposed by his cousin Muzapher-zing, who applied to Duplex for alliance. By him he was supplied with a body of Europeans and some artillery; after which, being also joined by Chunda Saib, an active Indian prince, he took the field against Nazir-zing. The latter was supported by a body of British troops under Colonel Laurence; and the French, dreading the event of an engagement, retired in the night; so that their ally was obliged to throw himself on the clemency of Nazir-zing. His life was spared, though he himself was detained as a state prisoner; but the traitor, forgetting the kindness shown him on this occasion, entered into a conspiracy against the life of Nazir-zing, and murdered him in his camp; in which infamous transaction he was encouraged by Duplex and Chunda Saib, who had retired to Pondicherry. Immense riches were found in the tents of Nazir-zing, great part of which fell to the share of Duplex, whom Muzapher-zing now associated with himself in the government. By virtue of this association, the Frenchman assumed the state and formalities of an eastern prince; and he and his colleague Muzapher-zing appointed Chunda Saib nabob of Arcot. In 1749, Anaverdy Khan had been defeated and killed by Muzapher-zing and Chunda Saib, assisted by the French; after which his son Mohammed Ali Khan had put himself under the protection of the English at Madras, and was confirmed by Nazir-zing as his father's successor in the nabobship or government of Arcot. This government therefore was disputed between Mohammed Ali Khan, appointed by the legal viceroy Nazir-zing, and supported by the English company, and Chunda Saib nominated by the usurper Muzapher-zing, and protected by Duplex, who commanded at Pondicherry. Muzapher-zing, however, did not long enjoy his ill-got authority; for in the year 1751, the nabobs who had been the means of raising him to the power he enjoyed, thinking themselves ill rewarded for their services, fell upon him suddenly, defeated his forces, and put him to death; proclaiming Salabat-zing next day viceroy of the Deccan. On the other hand, the Mogul appointed Gauzedy Khan, the elder brother of Salabat-zing, who was confirmed by Mohammed Ali Khan in the government of Arcot; but the affairs of the Mogul were at that time in such disorder, that he could not with an army support the nomination he had made. Chunda Saib in the mean time determined to recover by force the nabobship of Arcot, from which he had been deprived by the Mogul, who had placed Anaverdy Khan in his room. With this view he had recourse to Duplex at Pondicherry, who reinforced him with 2000 Sepoys, 60 Caffres, and 400 French; upon condition that if he succeeded, he should cede to the French the town of Velur in the neighbourhood of Pondicherry, with its dependencies, consisting of 45 villages. Thus reinforced, he defeated Anaverdy Khan, who lost his life in the engagement, reassumed the government of Arcot.\ncot, and punctually performed the engagements he had come under to his French allies.\n\nAll this time Mohammed Ali Khan had been supported by the English, to whom he fled after his father's death. By them he was supplied with a reinforcement of men, money, and ammunition, under the conduct of Major Laurence, a brave and experienced officer. By means of this supply he gained some advantages over the enemy; and repairing afterwards to Fort St David's, he obtained a further reinforcement. With all this assistance, however, he accomplished nothing of any moment; and the English auxiliaries having retired, he was defeated by his enemies. Thus he was obliged to enter into a more close alliance with the English, and cede to them some commercial points which had been long in dispute; after which, Captain Cope was despatched to put Trichinopoly in a state of defence, while Captain de Gingis, a Swiss officer, marched at the head of 400 Europeans to the assistance of the nabob. On this occasion Mr Clive first appeared in a military capacity. He had been employed before as a writer, but appeared very little qualified for that or any other department in civil life. He now marched towards Arcot at the head of 210 Europeans and 500 Sepoys. In the first expedition he displayed at once the qualities of a great commander. His movements were conducted with such secrecy and dispatch, that he made himself master of the enemy's capital before they knew of his march; and gained the affections of the people by his generosity, in affording protection without ransom. In a short time, however, he found himself invested in Fort St David's by Rajah Saib, son to Chunda Saib, an Indian chief, pretender to the nobbship of Arcot, at the head of a numerous army; the operations of the siege being conducted by European engineers. Thus, in spite of his utmost efforts, two practicable breaches were made, and a general assault given; but Mr Clive having got intelligence of the intended attack, defended himself with such vigour, that the assailants were everywhere repulsed with loss, and obliged to raise the siege with the greatest precipitation. Not contented with this advantage, Mr Clive, being reinforced by a detachment from Trichinopoly, marched in quest of the enemy; and having overtaken them in the plains of Arani, attacked and entirely defeated them on the 3rd of December 1751.\n\nThis victory was followed by the surrender of the forts of Timery, Conjaveram, and Arani; after which Mr Clive returned in triumph to Fort St David's. In the beginning of the year 1752 he marched towards Madras, where he was reinforced by a small body of troops from Bengal. Though the whole did not exceed 300 Europeans, with as many natives as were sufficient to give the appearance of an army, he boldly proceeded to a place called Kopperipauk, about 15 miles from Arcot, where the enemy lay to the number of 1500 Sepoys, 1700 horses, with 150 Europeans, and eight pieces of cannon. Victory was long doubtful, until Mr Clive having sent round a detachment to fall upon the rear of the enemy while the English attacked the entrenchments in front with their bayonets, a general confusion ensued, the enemy were routed with considerable slaughter, and only saved from total destruction by the darkness of the night. The French to a man threw down their arms, and surrendered themselves prisoners of war; all the baggage and cannon falling at the same time into the hands of the victors.\n\nOn the return of Mr Clive to Fort St David's, he was superseded in the command by Major Laurence, who was detached with 400 Europeans, a few Mahratta soldiers, and a body of Sepoys, to cut off the enemy's retreat to Pondicherry. In this enterprise he was attended with his usual good success, took several forts, vanquished the French commander M. d'Anteuil, and obliged him with all his party to surrender prisoners of war.\n\nChunda Saib, in the mean time, lay encamped with an army of 30,000 men at Syringham, an island in the Chunda neighbourhood of Trichinopoly; but Major Laurence having found means to intercept his provisions, he was obliged to fly. Being obliged to pass through the camp of the Tanjore general, he obtained a pass for the purpose; but was nevertheless detained by the nabob; who was an ally of the English, and his head was struck off, in order to prevent any disputes that might arise concerning him.\n\nAfter the flight of Chunda Saib, his army was attacked and routed by Major Laurence; and the island of Syringham surrendered, with about 1000 French soldiers under the command of Mr Law, brother to him who schemed the Mississippi company. M. Dupleix, exceedingly mortified at this bad success, proclaimed pretended Rajah Saib, son to Chunda Saib, nabob of Arcot; and afterwards produced forged commissions from the Mogul, Great Mogul, appointing him governor of all the Car-and affects natic from the river Kritnah to the sea. The better the state of carry on this deception, a messenger pretended to come from Delhi, and was received with all the pomp of an ambassador from the Great Mogul. Dupleix mounted on an elephant, and preceded by music and dancing women, after the oriental fashion, received his commission from the hands of this impostor; after which he affected the state of an eastern prince, kept his durbar or court, appeared fitting crofs-legged on a sopha, and received presents as sovereign of the country, from his own council as well as from the natives.\n\nThus the forces of the English and French East India companies were engaged in a course of hostilities at a time when no war existed between the two nations; and while they thus continued to make war upon each other, under the title of auxiliaries to the contending parties, Gauzy Khan took possession of the dignity appointed him by the Mogul; but had not been in possession of it above 14 days when he was poisoned by his own sister. His son Scab Abadin Khan was appointed to succeed him by the Mogul; but the latter being unable to give him proper assistance, Salabat zing remained without any rival, and made a present to the French commander of all the English possessions to the northward.\n\nThus concluded the campaign of 1752. Next year both parties received considerable reinforcements; the English, by the arrival of Admiral Watson with a squadron of ships of war, having on board a regiment commanded by Colonel Aldercroon; and the French by M. Gadeheu, commissary and governor-general of all their settlements, on whose arrival M. Dupleix departed.\nparted for Europe. The new governor made the most friendly proposals; and desired a cessation of arms until the disputes could be adjusted in Europe. These proposals being readily listened to on the part of the English deputies were sent to Pondicherry, and a provisional treaty and truce were concluded, on condition that neither of the two companies should for the future interfere in any of the differences that might take place in the country. The other articles related to the places or settlements that should be retained or possessed by the respective companies, until fresh orders should arrive from the courts of London and Versailles; and till then it was stipulated, that neither of the two nations should be allowed to procure any new grant or cession, or to build forts in defence of any new establishment; nor should they proceed to any cession, retrocession, or evacuation, of what they then possessed; but everything should remain on the same footing as formerly.\n\nThe treaty was published on the 11th of January 1755; at the end of which month Admiral Watson returned with his squadron from Bombay, and M. Gadeau returned to France in the beginning of February, leaving M. Leyrit his successor at Pondicherry. M. Buffy, with the Soubahdar Salabat-zing, commanded in the north; and M. de Sauffay was left to command the troops at Syringham. Matters, however, did not long continue in a state of tranquillity. Early in the year it appeared that the French were endeavouring to get possession of all the provinces of the Deccan. M. Buffy demanded the fortresses of Golconda from Salabat-zing; and M. Leyrit encouraged the phansier or governor who rented Velu to take up arms against the nabob. He even sent 300 French and as many Sepoys from Pondicherry to support this rebel, and oppose the English employed by the nabob to collect his revenues from the tributary princes. In this office they had been employed ever since the cessation of hostilities; one half of the revenue being paid to the nabob, and the other to the company, which now involved them in a kind of military expedition into the country of the Polygars, who had been previously summoned to send agents to settle accounts with the nabob. Four of them obeyed the summons; but one Lachenai refused, and it was therefore resolved to attack him. The country was very strong, being almost entirely fortified by nature or art; for it was surrounded by craggy hills detached from one another, and covered with bushes so as to be impassable for any but the natives, who had thrown up works from hill to hill. These works were indeed very rude, being formed of large stones laid upon one another without any cement, and flanked at proper distances by round earthen towers; before the wall was a deep and broad ditch, with a large hedge of bamboos in front, so thick that it could not be penetrated but by the hatchet or by the fire. This was forced, though not without some loss; after which another work of the same kind, but stronger, made its appearance; but this being likewise forced, Lachenai was obliged to submit and pay his tribute.\n\nThe English army now marched to Madura, a strong Indian town about 60 miles south of Trichinopoly. On their approach it submitted without any opposition, and the inhabitants seemed pleased with their change of government. Here a deputation was received from a neighbouring Polygar, desiring an alliance, and as a proof of his sincerity making an offer of two settlements on the sea-coast of his country opposite to the settlements of Ceylon, which would greatly facilitate their future commerce with Tinivelly. Before this time by the English they could not have reached that city but by a circuitous march of 400 or 500 miles; but from the new settlements the distance to Tinivelly was no more than 30 miles, and reinforcements or supplies of any kind might be sent them from Madras or Fort St David in four or five days. This offer being accepted, Colonel Heron, the English commander, marched to attack the governor of Madura, who had fled to a place called Colegoddy; on the approach of the English he fled from this place also, leaving the greatest part of his troops to defend the place. The road was so rugged, that the carriages of the cannon broke down; and as the troops were not furnished with scaling ladders, there seemed to be little hope of gaining the place, which was very strong. The colonel, however, determined to make an assault after the Indian manner, by burning down the gates with bundles of straw; and to encourage his men in this new method of attack, he himself carried the first torch, being followed by Mohammed Issouf, who bore the second. The place was taken, plundered, not sparing even the temples; whereupon the inhabitants with the utmost abhorrence of the victors on account of their contempt of the Indian religion.\n\nAfter this exploit the army removed to Madura; and a garrison being left in the place, they proceeded to Tinivelly, which submitted without opposition, and owned the jurisdiction of the nabob; though some of the Polygars still evaded payment, and therefore hostilities were commenced against them.\n\nThe new expedition was marked by an act of the cruellest and most disgraceful cruelty at a fort named Nellecotah, 40 miles south of Tinivelly. It was fortified by a mud wall with round towers. The assault was made with great resolution, and the troops gained possession of the parapet without being repulsed. On this the garrison called out for quarter, but it was barbarously refused; a general massacre of men, women, and children ensued, only six persons out of 400 being suffered to escape with life.\n\nIt now appeared that the revenues collected in this expedition had not been sufficient to defray the expenses of the army; and a report being spread that Salabat-zing was advancing into the Carnatic at the head of his army, along with M. Buffy the French commander, to demand the Mogul's tribute, it was thought proper to recall Colonel Heron to Trichinopoly. Before this, he had been prevailed on by the Indian chief who accompanied him, to convey to him (Mazuphe Cawn) an investiture of the countries of Madura and Tinivelly for an annual rent of 187,500l. sterling. In his way he was likewise induced by the same chief to make an attempt on a strong fort named Nelyangaville, situated about 30 miles west of Tinivelly; and belonging to a refractory Polygar. This attempt, however, proving unsuccessful for want of battering cannon, the colonel returned with Mazuphe Cawn to Trichinopoly, where he arrived on the 22d of May 1755.\nThe last expedition of this commander was against a mud fort named Volfynatam, situated near the entrance of the woods belonging to the Colleries. These people were highly incensed at the plundering of Coilgoody, and particularly at the loss of their sacred images which the rapacious conquerors had carried off. In consequence of this they had already slaughtered a party of Sepoys whom the commanding officer at Madura had sent out to collect cattle. In their march the English army had to go through the pass of Natam, one of the most dangerous in the peninsula. It begins about 20 miles north of Trinchinopoli, and continues for six miles through a wood impassable to Europeans. The road which lay through it was barely sufficient to admit a single carriage at a time, at the same time that a bank running along each side rendered it impossible to widen it. In most places the wood was quite contiguous to the road; and even where part of it had been felled, the eye could not penetrate above 20 yards.\u2014A detachment of Europeans, pioneers, and sepoys, were sent to scour the woods before the main body ventured to pass through such a dangerous defile. The former met with no opposition, nor did any enemy appear against the latter for a long time. At last the march was stopped by one of the heaviest tumbrils sticking in a flough, out of which the oxen were not able to draw it. The officers of artillery suffered the troops marching before to proceed; and the officer who commanded in the rear of the battalion, not suspecting what had happened, continued his march, while most of the Sepoys who marched behind the rear division of the artillery were likewise suffered to pass the carriage in the flough, which choked up the road, and prevented the other tumbrils from moving forward, as well as three field pieces that formed the rear division of artillery, and the whole line of baggage that followed. In this divided and defenceless state the rear division of the baggage was attacked by the Indians; and the whole would certainly have been destroyed, had it not been for the courage and activity of Capt. Smith, who here commanded 40 Caffres and 200 Sepoys, with one six-pounder. Considerable damage, however, was done, and the Indians recovered their goods; which certainly were not worth the carrying off, being only made of brass, and of a diminutive size.\u2014Colonel Heron was tried by a court-martial for misconduct in this expedition; and being found guilty, was declared incapable of serving the company any longer: soon after which he returned to Europe, and died in Holland.\n\nIn the mean time Nanderauze, an Indian prince, formed a scheme to get possession of Trinchinopoli; and in order to compass his end with greater facility, communicated his design to M. de Sauffay the commander of the French troops. But this gentleman having communicated intelligence to the English commander, the enterprise miscarried, and no difference betwixt these two rival nations as yet took place. It does not, however, appear that the English were in the least more solicitous to avoid hostilities than the French; for as soon as the company were informed of the acquisitions made by M. Bally in the Deccan, it was determined to encourage the Maharratas to attack Salabat-zing, in order to oblige him to dismiss the French auxiliaries from his service. In order to succeed in this enterprise, it was necessary to have a commander well experienced in the political systems of the country, as well as in military affairs; and for this purpose Mr Clive, now governor of Fort St David's, and invested with a lieutenant colonel's commission in the king's troops, offered his service. Three companies of the king's artillery, consisting of 100 men each, and 300 recruits, were sent from England on this expedition, who arrived at Bombay on the 27th of November; when on a sudden the presidency of Madras took it into consideration that this expedition could not be prosecuted without infringing the convention made with the French commander. \"This (says Mr Grofe) was acting with too much caution; for every thing relating to Salabat-zing and the French troops in his service seemed to have been studiously avoided. The court of directors had explained their whole plan to the presidency of Madras; but the ship which had the letters on board was unfortunately wrecked on a rock about 800 miles east of the Cape of Good Hope.\" The whole expedition was therefore laid aside, and the presidency of Madras directed all their force for the present against Tulagee Angria, who had long been a formidable enemy to the English commerce in those parts.\n\nThe dominions of this pirate consisted of several islands near Bombay, and an extent of land on the continent about 180 miles in length, and from 30 to 60 in breadth. He possessed also several forts that had been taken from the Europeans by his ancestors; the trade of piracy having, it seems, been hereditary in the family, and indeed followed by most of the inhabitants of this coast. This was the more dangerous for trading vessels, as the land breezes do not here extend more than 40 miles out at sea, so that the ships are obliged to keep within sight of land; and there was not a creek, harbour, bay, or mouth of a river, along the whole coast of his dominions, where Angria had not erected fortifications, both as stations of discovery and places of refuge to his vessels. His fleet consisted of two kinds of vessels peculiar to this country, named grabs and gallivats. The former have generally two masts, though some have three; the latter being about half the size of the former. They are built to draw little water, being very broad in proportion to their height; but narrowing from the middle to the end, where, instead of bows, they have a prow projecting like a Mediterranean galley, and covered with a strong deck level with the main deck of the vessel, from which it is separated by a bulk-head that terminates the forecastle. As this construction subjects the grab to pitch violently when sailing against a head sea, the deck of the prow is not inclosed with sides as the rest of the vessel, but remains bare, that the water which comes upon it may pass off without interruption. Two pieces of cannon are mounted on the main deck under the forecastle, carrying balls of nine or twelve pounds, which point forwards through port-holes cut in the bulk-head, and fire over the prow; those of the broad-side are from six to nine pounds. The gallivats are large row-boats built like the grab, but smaller, the largest scarce exceeding 70 tons burden. They have two masts, the mizen slightly made, and the main-mast bearing one large and triangular sail. In general they are covered with a spar deck made of split...\nIndia. split bamboos, and carry only paterroes fixed on swivels in the gunnel of the vessel; but those of a larger size have a fixed deck, on which they mount six or eight pieces of cannon from two to four pounders. They have 40 or 50 stout oars, by which they may be moved at the rate of four miles an hour.\n\nAngria had commonly a fleet of eight or ten grabs, with 40 or 50 gallivats; which shipped their cables and put out to sea as soon as any vessel had the misfortune to come within sight of the port or bay where they lay. If the wind blew with any strength, their construction enabled them to swim very swiftly: but if it was calm, the gallivats rowed, and towed the grabs. As soon as they came within gunshot of the enemy, they assembled afters, and the grabs began the attack, firing at first only at the masts, and choosing the most advantageous positions for this purpose. If the vessel happened to be dismayed, they then drew nearer, and battered her on all sides till she struck; but if the defense was obstinate, they sent a number of gallivats with 200 or 300 soldiers in each, who boarded from all quarters sword in hand.\n\nThis piratical state had for more than 50 years been formidable to all the nations in Europe; the English East India company had kept up a naval force for the protection of their trade at the rate of more than 50,000 annually, and after all found it scarcely adequate to the purpose. An unsuccessful attempt had been made in 1717, by the presidency of Bombay, against the forts Geriah and Kemnary, the principal strong holds of Angria.\u2014Another was made in 1722, under Admiral Matthews, against a fort named Coila-bley, about 15 leagues south of Bombay; but this also miscarried through the cowardice and treachery of the Portuguese, who pretended to assist the English. In 1735 Fort Geriah was unsuccessfully attacked by a Dutch armament of seven ships, two bomb-ketches, and a numerous body of land forces; while all this time the piracies of Angria went on successfully, and not only trading vessels, but even men of war belonging to different nations, were captured by him, particularly in the month of February 1754, when three Dutch ships of 50, 36, and 18 guns, were burnt or taken by the piratical fleet.\n\nThis last success encouraged Angria so much, that he began to build vessels of a large size, boasting that he should be master of the Indian seas. The Mahrattas having implored the affiance of the English against this common enemy, Commodore William James was sent from Bombay on the 22d of March 1755, with the Protector of 44, the Swallow of 16 guns, and two bomb-ketches; but with instructions not to hazard the fleet by attacking any of the pirate's forts, only to blockade the harbours, while the Mahratta army carried on their operations by land. He had scarce begun his voyage when he fell in with a considerable fleet of the pirates, which he would certainly have taken, had it not been for the timidity and dilatory behaviour of his allies, who could not by any means be induced to follow him. They had, however, invested three of the forts, but after a very strange manner; for they durst not approach nearer than two miles, and even there entrenched themselves up to the chin, to be secure against the fire of the fort, which they returned only with one four pounder. The commodore, provoked at this pusillanimous behaviour, determined, for the honour of the British arms, to exceed the orders he had got. Running within 100 yards of a fort named Severndroog, he in a few hours ruined the walls, and set it on fire; a powder magazine also blowing up, the people, to the number of about 1000, abandoning the place, and embarking on board of eight large boats, attempted to make their escape to another fort named Goa, but were all intercepted and made prisoners by the English. The whole force of the attack being then turned upon Goa, a white flag was soon hung out as a signal to surrender. The governor, however, did not think proper to wait the event of a capitulation, but without delay passed over to Severndroog, where he hoped to be able to maintain his ground notwithstanding the ruinous state of the fortifications. The fire was now renewed against this fortress; and the garrison having cut a passage through one of the gates with their axes, the garrison soon surrendered, at the same time that two other forts besieged by the Mahrattas hung out flags of truce and capitulated: and thus were four of Angria's forts, for so many years deemed impregnable, subdued in one day.\n\nThese successes were followed by the surrender of The pirate Bancoote, a strong fortified island, now called Fort Victoria, and which the English retained in possession; but the other forts were delivered up to the Mahrattas. On the arrival of Admiral Watson in the beginning of November 1755, it was determined to root out the pirate at once, by attacking Geriah the capital of his dominions; but it was so long since any Englishman had been this place, and the reports of its strength had been so much exaggerated, that it was thought proper to reconnoitre it before any attack was made. This was done by Commodore James; who having reported that the fort, though strong, was far from being inaccessible or impregnable, it was resolved to prosecute the enterprise with the utmost expedition and vigour. It was therefore attacked by such a formidable fleet, that Angria, losing courage at their approach, fled to the Mahrattas, leaving Geriah to be defended by his brother. The fort, however, was soon obliged to surrender, with no more loss on the part of the English than 19 men killed and wounded: but it was afterwards acknowledged, that this success was owing principally to the terror of the garrison, occasioned by such a violent cannonade; for their fortifications appeared to have been proof against the utmost efforts of an enemy. All the ramparts of this fort were either cut out of the solid rock, or built of stones at least ten feet long laid edgeway.\n\nIn this fortress were found 200 pieces of brass cannon, with six brass mortars, and a great quantity of ammunition and military stores, besides money and effects to the value of 125,000l. Angria's fleet was entirely destroyed, one of the ships having been set on fire by a shell from the English fleet, and the flames having spread from thence to all the rest. About 2000 people were made prisoners; among whom were the wife, children, mother, brother, and admiral of the pirate: but they were treated with the greatest clemency; and his family, at their own request, continued under the protection of the English at Geriah. All\nthe other forts belonging to Angria soon submitted; so that his power on the coast of Malabar was entirely annihilated.\n\nWhile the affairs of the English went on thus successfully, M. Buffly had been constantly employed near the person of Salabat-zing, whom he had served in much the same manner that the English had Mohammed Ali Cawm. As he made use of his influence with that prince, however, to enlarge the possessions of the French, and was continually making exorbitant demands upon him, the prime minister of Salabat-zing at length represented to him the danger and shame of allowing a small body of foreigners thus to give law to a great prince; and having formed a powerful combination against the French, at last obtained an order for their dismission. M. Buffly took his leave without any marks of disgust, having under his command about 600 Europeans, with 3000 Sepoys, and a fine train of artillery. His enemies, however, had no mind to allow him to depart in safety; and therefore sent orders to all the polygars to oppose their passage, feeding 6000 Mahattas after them to harass them on their march.\n\nNotwithstanding this opposition, M. Buffly reached Hyderabad with very little loss. Here he took possession of a garden formerly belonging to the kings of Golconda, where he resolved to keep his post until succours should arrive from Pondicherry and Masulipatam. Here Salabat-zing proposed to attack him; and the better to attain his purpose, applied to the English presidency at Madras for a body of troops to assist him in this service. Nothing could be more agreeable to those who had the power at that place than such an invitation; and a detachment of 400 Europeans and 1500 Sepoys was on the point of being ordered to the assistance of Salabat-zing, when express from Bengal informed them of the greatest danger that had ever threatened the British settlements in India.\n\nThis danger arose from the displeasure of Surajah Dowla the new nabob of Bengal. His grandfather Aliverdy Khan having died in April or May 1756, Surajah succeeded to the nabobship of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. He was congratulated on his accession by Mr Drake the English president at Calcutta, who requested his favour and protection in behalf of his countrymen. This was readily promised, even to a greater degree than what had been shown by his grandfather; but in a short time his resentment was incurred by the imprisonment, as it is said, of Omichund, an eminent Gentoo merchant, who had lived several years under the protection of the English government at Calcutta. Of this, however, Surajah Dowla did not directly complain; but founded his pretence of war upon the conduct of the English in repairing the fortifications of Calcutta; which indeed was absolutely necessary on account of the great likelihood of a war with the French. On this account, however, the nabob signified his displeasure, and threatened an attack if the works were not instantly demolished. With this requisition the president and council pretended to comply; but nevertheless went on with their works, applying first to the French and then to the Dutch for assistance; but as neither of these nations thought proper to interfere, the English were obliged to stand alone in the quarrel.\n\nSurajah Dowla took the field on the 27th of May 1756, with an army of 40,000 foot, 30,000 horse, on against and 400 elephants; and on the 24th of June detached Calcutta, 20,000 men to invest the English fort at Cossimbazar, a large town situated on an island formed by the western branch of the Ganges. The fort was regularly built, with 60 cannon, and defended by 300 men, but principally Sepoys. The nabob pretending a desire to treat, Mr Watts the chief of the factory, was persuaded to put himself in his power; which he had no sooner done, than he was made a close prisoner, along with Mr Batton a surgeon who accompanied him. The two prisoners were treated with great indignity, and threatened with death; but two of the council who had been sent for by the tyrant's command were sent back again, with orders to persuade the people of the factory to surrender it at discretion. This proposal met with great opposition in the council; but was at last complied with, though very little to the advantage of the prisoners; for they were not only deprived of every thing they possessed, but stripped almost naked, and sent to Huegley, where they were closely confined.\n\nThe nabob, encouraged by this success, marched directly to Calcutta, which he invested on the 15th. Though he now threatened to drive the English entirely out of his dominions, yet he proposed an accommodation with Mr Drake, provided he would pay him his duty upon the trade for 15 years, defray the expenses of his army, and deliver up the Indian merchants who were in the fort. This being refused, a siege commenced, and the place was taken in three days, through the treachery of the Dutch guard of prisoners who had the charge of a gate. The nabob promised strictness on the word of a folder, that no harm should be done to the English; nevertheless they were shut up in a prison for a night for want of air but 22. It was not, however, supposed that any massacre at this time was intended; and it is probable that he only gave orders to confine the prisoners closely for the night, without taking into consideration whether the place they were confined in was large or small.\n\nThe news of this disaster put an end to the expedition projected against M. Buffly; and Colonel Clive was instantly dispatched to Bengal with 400 Euro-Expeditors and 1000 Sepoys, on board of the fleet commanded by Admiral Watson. They did not arrive till the 15th of December, at a village called Fulta, situated on a branch of the Ganges, where the inhabitants of Calcutta had taken refuge after their misfortune, nabob. Their first operations were against the forts Burbudia, Tanna, Fort-William, and Calcutta now in the hands of the enemy. All these were reduced almost as soon as they could approach them. An expedition was then proposed against Huegley, a large town about 60 miles above Calcutta, and the place of rendezvous for all nations who traded to Bengal; its warehouses and shops being always filled with the richest merchandise of the country. This was likewise easily reduced; and the city was destroyed, with the granaries and storehouses of salt located on each side the river; which proved...\nproved very detrimental to the nabob, as depriving him of the means of subsistence for his army.\n\nSurajah Dowlah, enraged at this success of the English, now seemed determined to crush them at once by a general engagement. From this, however, he was intimidated by a successful attack on his camp, which soon induced him to conclude a treaty. This took place on the 9th of February 1757, on the following conditions. 1. That the privileges and immunities granted to the English by the king (Mogul) should not be disputed. 2. That all goods with English orders should pass, by land or water, free of any tax, fee, or imposition. 3. All the Company's factories which had been seized by the nabob should be restored; and the goods, money, and effects, which had been plundered, should be accounted for. 4. That the English should have permission to fortify Calcutta as they thought proper. 5. They should also have liberty to coin their own imports of bullion and gold.\n\nAs certain intelligence was now received of a war between France and England, the first object that naturally occurred, after the conclusion of this treaty, was the reduction of the French power in the east; in consequence of which it was represented to Admiral Watson, by a committee of the council of Bengal, that this was the only opportunity he perhaps might ever have of acting offensively against them. An attack would therefore immediately have been made on Chandernagore, had not a deputation arrived from that place, requesting a neutrality in this part of the world until matters should be finally decided in Europe. The negociation, however, was broken off on a suggestion that the government of Chandernagore, being subordinate to that of Pondicherry, could not render any transaction of this kind valid. It remained therefore only to obtain the consent of the nabob to make an attack upon this place: but this seemed not likely to be got; for in ten days after the conclusion of the treaty, he sent a letter to the admiral, complaining of his intention. \"It appears (says he) that you have a design to besiege the French factory near Hooghly, and to commence hostilities against that nation. This is contrary to all rule and custom, that you should bring your animosities and differences into my country; for it has never been known, since the days of Timur, that the Europeans made war upon one another in the king's dominions. If you are determined to besiege the French factories, I shall be necessitated, in honour and duty to my king, to assist them with my troops. You are certainly bound to abide by your part of the treaty strictly, and never to attempt or be the occasion of any troubles or disturbances in future within the provinces under my jurisdiction, &c.\" To this Admiral Watson replied, that \"he was ready to desist from his intended enterprize if the French would agree to a solid treaty of neutrality; or if the nabob, as joubahadar (viceroy) of Bengal, would, under his hand, guarantee this treaty, and promise to protect the English from any attempts made by the French against their settlements in his absence.\" This letter did not prove satisfactory; the nabob having been informed by the French agent, that the English designed to turn their arms against him as soon as they had made themselves masters of Chandernagore. This was firmly denied by the admiral; and a number of letters passed between him and the nabob, in one of which the latter made use of the following expressions, which were supposed to imply a tacit consent that Chandernagore should be attacked. \"My forbidding war on my borders was because the French were my tenants, and upon this affair desired my protection: on this I wrote to you to make peace, and no intention had I of favouring or afflicting them. You have understanding and generosity: if your enemy with an upright heart claims your protection, you will give him his life; but then you must be well satisfied of the innocence of his intentions; if not, then whatsoever you think right, that do.\"\n\nHaving thus, as was supposed, obtained the consent of the nabob, an attack was made on Chandernagore, which was soon reduced to the necessity of capitulation; though the French made a gallant defence, and, as Mr Ives informs us, \"stood to their guns as long as they had any to fire.\" A messenger was dispatched with the news to Surajah Dowlah three days after the place had surrendered, intimating also that the French had been pursued some way up the country. This intelligence, however, seemed to be by no means agreeable, as he could scarce be induced to return an answer. At last he pretended displeasure on account of the design of the English to infringe the treaties, and complained that they had ravaged some parts of his dominions. This was denied on the part of the admiral; who in his turn accused the nabob of breach of promise, and neglect in fulfilling his engagements. The last letter sent by Admiral Watson to the nabob, of date 19th April 1757, concludes in this manner. \"Let me again repeat to you, that I have no other views than that of peace. The gathering together of riches is what I desire; and I call on God, who sees and knows the spring of all our actions, and to whom you and I must one day answer, to witness the truth of what I now write: therefore, if you would have me believe that you wish for peace as much as I do, no longer let it be the subject of our correspondence for me to ask the fulfillment of our treaty, and you to promise and not perform it; but immediately fulfill all your engagements: thus let peace flourish and spread throughout all your country, and make your people happy in the re-establishment of their trade, which has suffered by a ruinous and destructive war.\" From this time both parties made preparations for war. The nabob returned no answer till the 13th of June, when he sent the following declaration of war. \"According to my promises, and the agreement made between us, I have duly rendered every thing to Mr Watts, except a very small remainder: Notwithstanding this, Mr Watts, and the rest of the council of the factory at Calicumbazar, under the pretence of going to take the air in their gardens, fled away in the night. This is an evident mark of deceit, and of an intention to break the treaty. I am convinced it could not have happened without your knowledge, nor without your advice. I all along expected something of this kind, and for that reason I would not recall my forces from Plassey, expecting some treachery. I praise God, that the breach of the treaty has not been on my part,\" &c.\n\nNothing less was now resolved on in the English council at Calcutta than the deposition of the nabob; on which\nwhich at this time appeared practicable, by supporting the pretensions of Meer Jaffier Ali Cawn, who had with other noblemen entered into a conspiracy against him. Meer Jaffier had married the sister of Aliverdy Cawn, the predecessor of Surajah Dowla; and was now supported in his pretensions by the general of the horse, and by Jugget Seet the nabob's banker, who was reckoned the richest merchant in all India. By these three leading men the design was communicated to Mr Watts the English resident at the nabob's court, and by him to Colonel Clive and the secret committee at Calcutta. The management of the affair being left to Mr Watts and Mr Clive, it was thought proper to communicate the secret to Omichund, through whom the necessary correspondence might be carried on with Meer Jaffier. This agent proved so avaricious, that it was resolved to serve him in his own way; and by a piece of treachery to him also, to gain their point with both parties. Two treaties were therefore written out; in one of which it was promised to comply with Omichund's demand, but in the other his name was not even mentioned; and both these treaties were signed by all the principal persons concerned, Admiral Watson alone excepted, whom no political motives could influence to sign an agreement which he did not mean to keep. These treaties, the same in every respect excepting as to Omichund's affair, were to the following purpose: 1. All the effects and factories belonging to the province of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, shall remain in possession of the English, nor should any more French ever be allowed to settle in these provinces. 2. In consideration of the losses sustained by the English company by the capture and plunder of Calcutta, he agreed to pay one crore of rupees, or 1,250,000 sterling. 3. For the effects plundered from the English at Calcutta, he engaged to pay 50 lacks of rupees, or 625,000. 4. For the effects plundered from the Gentooos, Moors, and others inhabitants of Calcutta, 20 lacks, or 250,000. 5. For the effects plundered from the American merchants, inhabitants of Calcutta, seven lacks, or 87,500. 6. The distribution of all these sums to be left to Admiral Watson, Colonel Clive, Roger Drake, William Watts, James Kilpatrick, and Richard Becher, Esquires, to be disposed of by them to whom they think proper.\n\nAll things being now in readiness, Colonel Clive began his march against Surajah Dowla on the 13th of June, the very day on which Surajah Dowla sent off his last letter for Admiral Watson. Before any act of hostility was committed, however, Colonel Clive wrote the nabob a letter, upbraiding him with his conduct, and telling him at last, that \"the rains being so near, and it requiring many days to receive an answer, he had found it necessary to wait upon him immediately.\" This was followed by the decisive action at Plafley; in which the treachery of Meer Jaffier, who commanded part of the nabob's troops, and stood neuter during the engagement, undoubtedly rendered the victory more easily acquired than it would otherwise have been. The unfortunate nabob fled to his capital with a few that continued faithful to him. He reached the city in a few hours; but not thinking himself safe there, left it the following evening, disguised like a Faquir, with only two attendants. By these he appears to have been abandoned and even robbed; for on the 3rd of July he was found wandering forlorn and almost naked on the road to Patna. Next day he was brought back to Muxadabad; and a few hours after privately beheaded by Meer Jaffier's eldest son, to whose care he had been committed. The usurper took possession of the capital in triumph; and on the 29th of June Colonel Clive went to the palace, and in presence of the rajas and grandees of the court solemnly handed him to the musnud or carpet and throne of state, where he was installed unanimously saluted fouhabdar or nabob, and received the submission of all present.\n\nWhile these transactions were going forward with Colonel the nabob, the utmost efforts were used to expel the French entirely from Bengal. By the articles of capitulation at Chandernagore, the whole of that garrison were to continue prisoners of war; but about the time of signing the treaty, Mr Law with a small body of troops made his escape out of Calcutta, and bent his march towards Patna. There he had been protected by the late nabob; and on the commencement of fresh hostilities, had collected about 200 French, the only remains of that nation in Bengal, to make an attempt to succour him. With these he was within two hours' march of Surajah Dowla's camp when the battle of Plafley was fought; on hearing the news of which he stopped; but afterwards being informed of the nabob's escape, he marched again to his assistance, and was within a few hours of joining him when he was taken. Three days after he was pursued by Major Eyre Coote at the head of 223 Europeans, three companies of Sepoys, 50 Lascars or Indian sailors, and 10 Marmitty men or pioneers to clear the roads, together with two pieces of cannon, six pounders. On this expedition the major exerted his utmost diligence to overtake his antagonist, and spent a very considerable space of time in the pursuit; for though he set out on the 6th of July, he did not return to Muxadabad till the 1st of September. Mr Law, however, had the good fortune to escape; but though the major did not succeed in what was proposed as the principal end of his expedition, he was, nevertheless, says Mr Ives, of considerable service to the company and to his country in general. He had obliged Ramnarain, the most powerful rajah in the country, to swear allegiance to Meer Jaffier; he laid open the interior state of the northern provinces; and, in conjunction with Mr Johnstone, gave the company some insight into the saltpetre butinels, from which such advantages have since been derived to the public.\n\nBefore the return of Major Coote, Admiral Pocock Death had succeeded to the command of the fleet, in consequence of the decease of Admiral Watson, who died on Watson, the 16th of August. The joy of the British was considerably damped by the loss of this gentleman, who had gained a great and deserved reputation both in the military line and every other. News were also received, that the French had been very successful on the coast of Coromandel. Salabat-zing, as has already been observed, had applied to the English for assistance against the French; but as they were prevented from performing their agreement by the disaster at Calcutta, he found himself under a necessity of accommodating the differences with his former friends, and to admit them again into his service. M. Buffy was now reinforced by the troops under Mr Law; who\nhad collected as many Europeans in his journey as made up 500 with those he had at first. With these he undertook to reduce the English factories of Ingeram, Bandermalanka, and Vizagapatnam. As none of the two former places were in any state of defence, the greatest part of the company's effects were put on shipboard on the first alarm; but as Vizagapatnam was garrisoned by 140 Europeans and 420 Sepoys, it was supposed that it would make some defense. If any was made, however, it appears to have been very trifling; and by the conquest of this the French became masters of all the coasts from Ganjam to Maifilipatnam. In the southern provinces the like bad success attended the British cause. The rebel Polygars having united their forces against Mazuphe Cawn, obtained a complete victory over him; after which the English Sepoys, being prevailed upon to quit Madura, the conqueror seized upon that city for himself.\n\nIn the beginning of 1758, the French made an attempt on Trichinopoly. The command was given to M. d'Auteuil, who invested the place with 900 men in battalions, with 4000 Sepoys, 100 hussars, and a great body of Indian horse. Trichinopoly was then in no condition to withstand such a formidable power, as most of the garrison had gone to besiege Madura under Captain Caillaud; but this commander having received intelligence of the danger, marched back with all his forces, and entered the town by a difficult road which the enemy had neglected to guard; and the French general, disconcerted by this successful manoeuvre, drew off his forces, and returned to Pondicherry.\n\nThis fortunate transaction was succeeded by the siege of Madura, in which the English were so vigorously repulsed, that Captain Caillaud was obliged to turn the siege into a blockade in order to reduce the place by famine. But before any progress could be made in this way, Mazuphe Cawn was prevailed upon to give it up for the sum of 170,000 rupees. A large garrison of Sepoys was again put into the place, and Captain Caillaud returned to Trichinopoly.\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt was now made by Colonel Ford on Nellore, a large town surrounded by a thick mud wall, with a dry ditch on all sides but one, where there is the bed of a river always dry but in the rainy season. The enterprise is said to have proved unsuccessful through the unheard-of cowardice of a body of Sepoys, who having sheltered themselves in a ditch, absolutely refused to stir a step farther, and rather chose to allow the rest of the army to march over them to the assault, than to expose themselves to danger. Several other enterprises of no great moment were undertaken; but the event was on the whole unfavourable to the English, whose force by the end of the campaign was reduced to 1718 men, while that of the French amounted to 3400 Europeans, of whom 1000 were sent to Pondicherry.\n\nBoth parties now received considerable reinforcements from Europe; Admiral Pocock being joined on the 24th of March by Commodore Stevens with a squadron of five men of war, and the French by nine men of war and two frigates, having on board General Lally with a large body of troops. The English admiral no sooner found himself in a condition to cope with the enemy than he went in quest of them; and an engagement took place, in which the French were defeated with the loss of 600 killed, and a great many wounded, while the English had only 29 killed and 89 wounded. The former returned to Pondicherry, where they landed their men, money, and troops. After the battle three of the British captains were tried for misbehaviour, and two of them dismissed from the command of their ships. As soon as his vessels were refitted, the admiral sailed again in quest of the enemy, but could not bring them to an action before the 3rd of August, when the French dictated a second time, with the loss of 251 killed, and 602 wounded.\n\nNotwithstanding this success at sea, the English were greatly deficient in land forces; the re-establishment of their affairs in Bengal having almost entirely drained the settlements on the coast of Coromandel of the troops necessary for their defense. The consequence of this was the loss of Fort St David, which General Lally retaken, destroyed the fortifications, demolished also the adjacent villages, and ravaging the country in such a manner as filled the natives with indignation, and in the end proved very prejudicial to his affairs. He proved successful, however, in the reduction of Devicotah, but was obliged to retreat with loss from before Tanjore, his army being greatly distressed for want of provisions; and money in particular being so deficient, that on the 7th of August the French seized and carried into Pondicherry a large Dutch ship from Batavia bound to Negapatnam, and took out of her about 5000l. in specie.\n\nFrom this time the affairs of the French daily declined. On their retreat from Tanjore, they abandoned the island of Seringham; however, they took Tripaf-fore, but were defeated in their designs on the important post of Chinglapet, situated about 45 miles southeast of Madras. Their next enterprises on Fort St George and Madras were equally unsuccessful. The latter was besieged from the 12th of December 1758 to the 17th of February 1759, when they were obliged to abandon it with great loss; which disaster greatly contributed to depress their spirits, and abate those sanguine hopes they had entertained of becoming masters in this part of the world.\n\nThe remainder of the year 1759 proved entirely favourable to the British arms. M. d'Ache the French admiral, who had been very roughly handled by Admiral Pocock on the 3rd of August 1758, having refitted his fleet, and being reinforced by three men of war at the islands of Mauritius and Bourbon, now ventured once more to face his antagonist, who on his part did not at all decline the combat. A third battle ensued French defeated a third time withstanding their superiority, both in number of ships and weight of metal, were obliged to retreat with considerable loss; having 1500 men killed and wounded, while those on board the English fleet did not exceed 569. By the 17th of October the English fleet was completely refitted; and Admiral Pocock having been joined by a reinforcement of four men of war, soon after returned to England.\n\nAll this time the unfortunate General Lally had been employed in unsuccessful endeavours to retrieve the affairs of his countrymen; still, however, he attempted to act on the offensive; but his fate was at last decided by...\nby laying siege to Wandewaith, which had lately been taken by Colonel Coote. The advantage in numbers was entirely in favour of the French general; the English army consisting only of 1700 Europeans, including artillery and cavalry, while the French amounted to 2200 Europeans. The auxiliaries on the English side were 3000 black troops, while those of the French amounted to 10,000 black troops and 300 Caffres; nor was the odds less in proportion in the artillery, the English bringing into the field only 14 pieces of cannon and one howitzer, while the French had 25 pieces in the field, and five on their batteries against the fort. The battle began about 11 o'clock on the 22nd of January 1763, and in three hours the whole French army gave way and fled towards their camp, but quitted it on finding themselves pursued by the English, who took all their cannon except three small pieces. They collected themselves under the walls of Chelatput, about 18 miles from the field of battle, and soon after retired to Pondicherry. Colonel Coote caused the country to be waited to the very gates of this fortress, by way of retaliation for what the French had done in the neighbourhood of Madras. He then set about the siege of Chelatput, which surrendered in one day; a considerable detachment of the enemy was intercepted by Captain Smith; the fort of Timmery was reduced by Major Monson, and the city of Arcot by Captain Wood. This last conquest enabled the English to restore the nabob to his dominions, of which he had been deprived by the French; and it greatly weakened both the French force and interest in India.\n\nM. Lally, in the mean time, had recalled his forces from Seringham, by which means he augmented his army with 500 Europeans. All these were now shut up in Pondicherry, which was become the last hope of the French in India. To complete their misfortunes, Admiral Cornwall arrived at Madras with six men of war; and as the French had now no fleet in these parts, the admiral readily engaged to cooperate with the land forces. The consequence was the reduction of Calcutta, Chellambrum, and Verdichellum, by a strong detachment under Major Monson; while Colonel Coote reduced Permooril, Alampervra, and Waldour. Thus he was at last enabled to lay siege to Pondicherry itself. Previous to this, however, it had been blockaded by sea and land, which reduced the place to great straits for want of provisions, and induced a mutinous disposition among the garrison. The batteries were not opened till the beginning of December 1763; and the place capitulated on the 15th of January 1764, by which an end was put to the power of the French in this part of the world.\n\nWhile the English were thus employed in effectually reducing the power of their rivals in every part of India, Meer Jaffer, the nabob of Bengal, who had been raised to that dignity by the ruin of Surajah Dowlah, found himself in a very disagreeable situation. The treasure of the late nabob had been valued at no less than 64 crore of rupees, about 80 millions sterling; and in expectation of such a vast sum, Meer Jaffer had no doubt thoughtlessly submitted to the enormous exactions of the English already mentioned. On his accession to the government, however, the treasure of which he became master fell so much short of expectation, that he could by no means fulfil his engagements to them and supply the expenses of government at the same time. This soon reduced him to the necessity of mortgaging his revenues to supply present demands; and by this ruinous expedient he put it out of his own power ever to extricate himself. In this dilemma his grandees became factious and discontented, his army mutinous for want of pay, and he rendered himself odious to his subjects by the exactions he was necessitated to lay upon them. The English, who for their own interest had raised him to the supreme power, no sooner found that he was incapable of answering their purpose any longer, than they began to scheme against him; and in order to have some colour of reason for pulling down the man whom they had just set up, they either invented or gave ear to the most malicious calumnies against him. The charges brought against him were shortly these: 1. That soon after his advancement he had resolved to reduce that power which raised him to the dignity. 2. That, to effect this, he affianced or banished every person of importance whom he suspected of being in the English interest. 3. That he negotiated with the Dutch to introduce an armament for the expulsion of the English. 4. That he had in different instances been guilty of the deepest deceit and treachery towards the English, his best benefactors and allies. 5. That at three different periods the English commander in chief had been basely deserted both by the nabob and his son, when he and the troops were hazarding their lives for them. 6. That he meditated a secret and separate treaty with Shah-Zadah, the Mogul's son, and had intended to betray the English to him. 7. That the whole term of his government had been one uninterrupted chain of cruelty, tyranny, and oppression. 8. That he meditated, and was near carrying into execution, an infamous secret treaty with the Mahrattas, which would have proved the total destruction of the country if it had taken place. 9. That he threw every possible obstruction in the way of the collection of the English tontas or assignments upon lands. 10. That he encouraged the obstructions given to the free currency of the English sicca; by which the company suffered heavy losses. 11. That by his cruelties he had rendered it scandalous for the English to support his government any longer; and, 12. That by his misconduct, he had brought the affairs of the company as well as his own into the utmost danger of ruin.\n\nIn what manner these charges were supported it is difficult to know, nor perhaps were the accusers very solicitous about the strength of their evidence. This seems the more probable, as the accusations of cruelty were, in some instances at least, void of foundation. On the 13th of June 1763, Mr Holwel wrote from Calcutta to Mr Warren Hastings, that by express he had received intelligence of the murder of the princesses of Aliverdy Khan and Shah Amet, in a most inhuman manner, by Meer Jaffer's orders. He was said to have sent a jemmatdar with 100 horse to Jefferaut Khan to carry this bloody scheme into execution; with separate orders to the jemmatdar to put an end to their lives. He refused acting any part in the tragedy, and left it to the other; who carried them out by night in a boat, tied weights to their legs, and threw them overboard. They struggled for some time, and held by the gunwale of the boat; but by frokes on their heads,\nand cutting off their hands, they were at last forced off and drowned. In like manner we were told that many others of Surajah Dowlas relations had perished; yet when it was thought proper to replace Meer Jaffier in 1761, all these dead persons were found alive excepting two. It must also be remembered, in behalf of the unfortunate nabob, that besides the sums exacted from him by the English at his accession, he had ceded to them a large extent of territory, and granted them so many immunities in trade, that he had in a manner deprived himself of all his resources; and it was impossible for him to defray the necessary expenses without either extorting money from his subjects, or infringing the privileges he had so inconsiderately granted.\n\nThere were two accounts of this remarkable revolution published, materially differing from one another. The first was given in a memorial drawn up at a consultation at Fort William, November 10, 1760, where were present Henry Vanfittart, Esq., president; William Ellis, B. Sumner, William McGuire, Henry Verelst, and Henry Smyth, Esqs. \"We resolved (says the governor) to give the nabob the next day (October 19, 1760) to reflect upon the letters I had delivered him, proposing some measures for regulating these abuses. I heard nothing from him all that day; but found by my intelligence that he had been in council at his old advisers, whose advice, I was sure, would be contrary to the welfare of the country and of the company. I therefore determined to act immediately on the nabob's fear. There could not be a better opportunity than the night of the 19th offered, it being the conclusion of the Gentoo feast, when all the principal people of that caste would be pretty well fatigued with their ceremonies. Accordingly I agreed with Colonel Caillaud, that he should cross the river with the detachment between three and four in the morning; and having joined Coffin Ali Khan and his people, march to the nabob's palace, and surround it just at daybreak. Being extremely delirious to prevent disturbance or bloodshed, I wrote a letter to the nabob, telling him, I had been waiting all the day in expectation that he would have settled the urgent affairs upon which I conferred with him yesterday; but his having favoured me with no answer, plainly showed that all I could represent to him for the good of his country would have no effect, as long as his evil counsellors were about his person, who would in the end deprive him of his government and ruin the company's affairs. For this reason I had sent Colonel Caillaud with forces to wait upon him, and to expel those bad counsellors, and place his affairs in a proper state, and I would shortly follow. This letter I gave to the colonel, to send to the nabob at such a time as he should think most expedient. Measures were taken at the same time for seizing his three unworthy ministers, and to place Coffin Ali Khan in the full management of all the affairs, in quality of deputy and successor to the nabob.\n\n\"The necessary preparations being made with all care and secrecy possible, the colonel embarked with the troops, joined Coffin Ali Khan without the least alarm, and marched into the court-yard of the palace just at the proper instant. The gates of the inner court being shut, the colonel formed his men without, and sent the letter to the nabob, who was at first in a great rage, and long threatened that he would make what resistance he could, and take his fate. The colonel forbore all hostilities, and several messengers talked between him and the nabob. The affair remained in this doubtful state for two hours, when the nabob, finding his periliting was to no purpose, sent a messenger to Coffin Ali Khan, informing him that he was ready to send the seals and all the ensigns of dignity, provided he would agree to take the whole charge of the government upon him, to discharge all arrears due to the troops, to pay the usual revenue to the king, to save his life and honour, and to give him an allowance sufficient for his maintenance. All these conditions being agreed to, Coffin Ali was proclaimed; and the old nabob came out to the colonel, declaring that he depended on him for his life. The troops then took possession of all the gates; and the old nabob was told, that not only his person was safe, but his government too if he pleased, of which it was never intended to deprive him. He answered, that he had now no more business in the city, where he should be in continual danger from Coffin Ali Khan; and if he was permitted to go and live at Calcutta, he should be contented. Coffin Ali Khan was now placed on the mainmast, and the people in general seemed much pleased with the revolution. The old nabob did not think himself safe even for one night in the city. Coffin Ali Khan supplied him with boats, and permitted him to take away about 60 of his family, with a reasonable quantity of jewels. He begged that he might sleep in his boat that night; which he accordingly did, and on the morning of the 22nd of October he set out for Calcutta, and arrived there on the 29th. He was met by a deputation from the council, and treated with every mark of respect due to his former dignity.\"\n\nThe second account of this affair was not published till the 11th of March 1762, and was signed Eyre Coote, P. Amyatt, John Cavac, W. Ellis, S. Batton, H. Verelst. \"In September 1760 (say they), when there was not the least appearance of a rupture or disgust between us and the nabob, but friendship and harmony subsisting, Meer Coffin Khan his son-in-law came down to Calcutta, and having stayed a short time returned to Moorshedabad. A few days after, Mr Vanfittart went up to that city on the pretence of a visit to the nabob Meer Jaffier. Colonel Caillaud, with 200 Europeans and some Sepoys, attended him; who, it was pretended, were going to join the army at Patna. When Mr Vanfittart arrived at Moradabagh, the nabob paid him two visits; at the last of which Mr Vanfittart gave him three letters, proposing the reformation of the abuses in his government, insisted on his naming some person among his relations to take charge of the ship, and particularly recommended Coffin Ali Khan, who was sent for, and the nabob desired to stay till he came: But the nabob being greatly fatigued, was suffered to depart to his palace. The night and following day passed in concerting measures with Coffin Ali how to put in execution the plan before agreed on in Calcutta, where a treaty was signed for this purpose. In consequence of these deliberations, our troops crossed the river next night, and being joined by Coffin and his party, surrounded the nabob's palace. A letter from Mr Vanfittart was sent to the nabob, demanding his compliance with what had been proposed to him. To this the nabob returned for answer, 'that he never\nnever expected such usage from the English; that while a force was at his gates, he would enter into no terms. A message was sent in, that if he did not directly comply, they should be obliged to storm the palace. Afflicted and terrified at this menace, he opened the gates, exclaiming, that 'he was betrayed; that the English were guilty of perjury and breach of faith; that he perceived their designs against his government; that he had friends enough to hazard at least one battle in his defense; but although no oaths were sacred enough to bind the English, yet as he had sworn to be their faithful friend, he would never swerve from his engagement, and rather suffer death than draw his sword against them.' So culpable was he of being sold, that he desired to know what sum of money Coffin Ali Khan was to give for the subahship, and he would give half as much more to be continued. He hoped, however, if they intended to dethrone him, that they would not leave him to the mercy of his son-in-law, from whom he feared the worst; but wished they would carry him from the city, and give him a place of safety in Calcutta. \"This last request of the nabob was confirmed in the light of a voluntary resignation. Our troops took possession of the palace; Meer Coffin was raised to the musjid; and the old nabob hurried into a boat with a few of his domestics and necessaries, and sent away to Calcutta in a manner wholly unworthy of the high rank he so lately held, as was also the scanty subsistence allowed him for his maintenance at Calcutta by his son-in-law. Thus was Jaffer Ali Khan deposed, in breach of a treaty founded on the most solemn oaths, and in violation of the national faith.\"\n\nAccording to this account, the servants of the company, who were the projectors of the revolution, made no secret that there was a present promised them of 200,000 rupees from Coffin, who was desirous of making the first act of his power the assassination of Jaffer, and was very much displeased when he found that the English intended giving him protection at Calcutta.\n\nIt could scarce be supposed that Meer Coffin, raised to the nabobship in the manner we have related, could be more faithful to the English than Meer Jaffer had been. Nothing advantageous to the interests of the company could indeed be reasonably expected from such a revolution. No successor of Meer Jaffer could be more entirely in subjection than the late nabob, from his natural imbecility, had been. This last consideration had induced many of the council at first to oppose the revolution; and indeed the only plausible pretense for it was, that the administration of Meer Jaffer was so very weak, that, unless he was aided and even controlled by some persons of ability, he himself must soon be ruined, and very probably the interests of the company along with him. Meer Coffin, however, was a man of a very different disposition from his father-in-law. As he knew that he had not been served by the English out of friendship, so he did not think of making any return of gratitude; but instead of this, considered only how he could most easily get rid of such troublesome allies. For a while, however, it was necessary for him to dissemble, and to take all the advantage he could of the power of his allies whilst it could be serviceable to him. By their alliance he cleared his dominions of invaders, and strengthened his frontier against them; he reduced, by means of the same affluence, the rajas or independent Indian chiefs who had rebelled in the time of his predecessor, obliging them to pay the usual tribute; by which means he repaired his finances, and thereby secured the discipline and fidelity of his troops. Having thus, by the affluence of the English forces, brought his government into subjection, he took the most effectual means of securing himself against their power. As the vicinity of his capital, Muzaffabad, to Calcutta, gave the English factory there an opportunity of inspecting his actions, and interrupting his designs when they thought proper, he took up his residence at Mongheer, a place 200 miles farther up the Ganges, which he fortified in the best and most expeditious manner he could. Being very sensible of the advantages of the European discipline, he resolved to form his army on a new model. For this purpose he collected all the Armenian, Persian, Tartar, and other soldiers of fortune, whose military characters he supposed might serve to raise the spirits of his Indian forces, and abate their natural timidity. He also carefully collected every wandering European who had borne arms, all the Sepoys who had been dismissed from the English service, distributing them among his troops, in order to teach them the English exercise. He changed the fashion of the Indian muskets from matchlocks to firelocks; and as their cannon were almost as deficient as their small arms, he procured a pattern of one from the English, by which he soon formed a train of artillery; and having thus done everything in his power to enable himself to withstand the English by force of arms, he resolved also to free his court from their emissaries, by imprisoning or putting to death every person of any consequence in his dominions who had shown any attachment to their interest.\n\nHis next step was to free himself from some of those restraints which his predecessor Meer Jaffer, and even he himself, had been obliged to lay upon the trade of the country, in order to gratify the avarice of his European allies. At his accession indeed he had ceded to the company a tract of land worth no less than 700,000l. annually, besides 70,000l. a-year on other accounts. All this, however, was not sufficient; the immunities granted them in trade were of still worse consequences than even those vast concessions. He knew by experience the distresses which these immunities had brought upon his predecessor, and therefore determined to put an end to them. In pursuance of this resolution, he began, in the year 1762, every duty on where to subject the English traders to the payment of certain duties throughout his dominions, and required that their disputes, if beyond the limits of their own jurisdiction, should be decided by his magistrates. This gave such an alarm at Calcutta, that, in November 1762, the governor Mr Vanittart waited on him in person at Mongheer, in order to expostulate with him upon the subject. The nabob answered his remonstrances in the following manner. \"If (said he) the servants of the English company were permitted to trade in all parts, and in all commodities, custom free, as many of them now pretend, they must of course draw all the trade into their own hands, and my customs would be of so little value, that it would be much more for my interest to lay trade entirely open, and collect no customs from any person whatever upon any\nany kind of merchandise. This would draw a number of merchants into the country, and increase my revenues by encouraging the cultivation and manufacture of a large quantity of goods for sale, at the same time that it would effectually cut off the principal subject of disputes which had disturbed the good understanding between us, an object which I have more than any other at heart.\"\n\nBy these intimations Mr Vanfittart was very much disconcerted; nor indeed was it in any person's power to devise a plausible answer. What the nabob had threatened was evidently in his power; and though he had laid the trade entirely open, no reasonable fault could have been found with him. The proceeding, however, tended evidently to destroy the private trade carried on by the gentlemen of the factory; and even to prejudice, as they said, that of the company itself. Mr Vanfittart therefore thought proper to submit to certain regulations, by which the trade of the English was put under certain restrictions.\n\nThis new agreement being instantly put in execution on the part of the nabob, excited the utmost indignation at Calcutta. On the 17th of January 1763, the council passed a resolution, disavowing the treaty made by the governor, and affirmed that he assumed a right to which he was by no means authorized; that the regulations proposed were dishonourable to them as Englishmen, and tended to the ruin of all public and private trade; and that the president's issuing out regulations independent of the council was an absolute breach of their privileges. They sent orders therefore to all the factories, that no part of the agreement between the governor and nabob should be submitted to. Application was again made to Meer Collim to persuade him to a third agreement; but before the success of this negociation could be known, hostilities commenced on the part of the English.\n\nThere was at that time in the city of Patna (situated on the Ganges, about 300 miles above Calcutta), a fortified factory belonging to the East India company, where were a few European and Indian soldiers. By this factory the city was suddenly attacked on the 25th of June 1763, and instantly taken, though it was defended by a strong garrison, and the fortifications had been newly repaired. The governor and garrison fled out into the country on the first appearance of danger; but perceiving that the victors took no care to prevent a surprize, he suddenly returned with a reinforcement from the country, retook the city, and either cut in pieces or drove into their fort all the English who were in it, after having been only four hours in possession of the place. The English, disheartened by this disaster, did not now think themselves able to defend their fort against the Indians; for which reason they left it, with a design to retreat into the territories of a neighbouring nabob; but being pursued by a superior force, they were all either killed or taken.\n\nThis piece of perfidy, for such it certainly was, the nabob repaid by another, viz. slaughtering the deputies who had been sent him by the council of Calcutta to treat about a new agreement with regard to commercial affairs. They set out from Mongheer on the 24th of June, having been unable to bring Meer Collim to any terms; and though he furnished them with the usual passports, yet, as they were passing the city of Muxadabad, they found themselves attacked by a number of troops assembled for that purpose on both sides of the river, whose fire killed several gentlemen in the boats. Mr Amyatt, the chief of the embassy, landed with a few Sepoys, whom he forbade to fire, and endeavoured to make the enemy's troops understand that he was furnished with the nabob's passports, and had no design of committing any hostilities; but the enemy's horse advancing, some of the Sepoys fired notwithstanding Mr Amyatt's orders to the contrary. On this a general confusion ensued, and Mr Amyatt, with most of the small party who attended him, were cut in pieces.\n\nThese acts of treacherous hostility were soon followed by a formal declaration of war. Meer Jaffer, notwithstanding the crimes formerly alleged against him, was proclaimed nabob of Bengal, and the army immediately took the field under the command of Major Adams. The whole force, however, at first consisted of only one regiment of the king's troops, a few companies of Sepoys, and 12 pieces of cannon. The Meer Coftim very soon came to action with the enemy; and having got the better in two skirmishes, cleared the country of them as far as Calimbuzar river, a branch of the Ganges, which lay between Calcutta and Muxadabad, or Moorshedabad, the capital of the province.\n\nThe war was now carried on with uninterrupted success on the part of the English; nor does it appear that all the pains taken by Meer Coftim to discipline his troops had made them in the least more able to cope with the Europeans. The English were suffered to pass the river without opposition; but an army of 10,000 Indians were advantageously posted between the river and the city. The English were entirely defeated. In his way he found the Indians again strongly posted with intrenchments 15 feet high, and defended by a numerous artillery. This strong post was taken by stratagem; a feint being made with a small body of troops against that part where the enemy had collected their greatest strength. Thus the attention of the enemy was drawn entirely to that place, without regarding others where no attack was apprehended. The greatest part of the English army, however, had in the night-time marched round the Indian fortification, and by daybreak made a furious assault on a place where there was only a slight guard. The Indians instantly fled; the intrenchments were abandoned; and the city, which was protected only by them, fell of course into the hands of the conquerors.\n\nThis success of the English served only to make them redouble their diligence. They now penetrated into the heart of the province, crossed the numerous branches of the Ganges, and traversed marshes and forests in quest of their enemy. Meer Coftim, on the other hand, was not wanting in his defence; but the utmost efforts he could use were totally insufficient to stop the career of an enemy so powerful and now flushed with victory.\n\nThe two armies met on the banks of a river called Nunas Nullas, on the 2d of August 1763. The Indians, who had chosen their post with great judgment, and had defeated much more the appearance of an European army than it Nunas ever was observed before, not only in their arms and...\nand accoutrements, but in their division into brigades, and even in their clothing. The battle was much more obstinate than usual, being continued for four hours; but though the Indian army consisted of no fewer than 20,000 horse, and 8000 foot, the English proved in the end victorious, and the enemy were obliged to quit the field with the loss of all their cannon.\n\nFrom this time the Indians did not attempt any regular engagement with the English. They made a stand indeed at a place called Anda Nulla, which they had fortified in such a manner that it seemed proof against any sudden attack. But here also they suffered themselves to be deceived in a manner similar to that above-mentioned, and the place was taken with great slaughter. They now abandoned a vast tract of country; and though there were several very defensible posts one behind another, so much were they disheartened by this misfortune, that they never attempted to stop the progress of the English, but laid open the whole country to the very gates of Mongheer.\n\nThe next operation was the siege of Mongheer itself; which notwithstanding all the pains Meer Coffin had been at to fortify it, held out no more than nine days after the trenches were opened; so that nothing now remained to complete the conquest of Bengal but the reduction of the city of Patna. The unfortunate Meer Coffin, in the mean time, enraged at the irrefutable progress of the English, vented his rage on the unhappy prisoners taken at Patna; all of whom, to the number of about 200, he caused to be inhumanly murdered. This villainy was perpetrated by one Somers, a German, who had originally been in the French service, but deserted from them to the English East India company, and from the company to Meer Coffin. This affront, by the Indians called Soomeroo, having invited the English gentlemen to sup with him, took the opportunity of borrowing their knives and forks, on pretence of entertaining them after the English manner. At night, when he arrived, he stood at some distance in the cook-room to give his orders; and as soon as the two first gentlemen, Mr. Ellis and Lushington, entered, the former was seized by the hair, his head pulled backward, and his throat cut by another. On this Mr. Lushington knocked down the murderer with his fist, seized his sword, wounded one and killed two before he himself was cut down. The other gentlemen being now alarmed, defended themselves, and even repulsed the Sepoys with plates and bottles. Somers then ordered them on the top of the house to fire down on the prisoners; which they obeyed with reluctance, alleging that they could not think of murdering them in that manner, but if he would give the prisoners arms, they would fight them; on which he knocked several of them down with bamboos. The consequence was, that all the gentlemen were either shot or had their throats cut. Dr. Fullarton was the only person who escaped, having received a pardon from the tyrant a few days before the massacre.\n\nThis inhumanity was far from being of any service to the cause of Meer Coffin. Major Adams marched without delay from Mongheer to Patna; and as the place was but indifferently fortified, it could make but a feeble resistance. The cannon of the English soon made a practicable breach, and in no longer time than eight days this great city was taken by storm. Thus the nabob was deprived of all his fortified places, his army reduced to a small body, and himself obliged to fly to Sujah Dowla nabob of Oude, who acted as grand vizier to the Mogul. Here he was kindly received, and an asylum promised for his person, but adherence was refused to his army, nor would this prince consent at any rate to make his country a seat of war. The English were now entire masters of Bengal; for though Meer Jaffier was proclaimed nabob, it is not to be supposed that he had now any authority farther than what they pleased to give him. Major Adams did not long survive the conquest of Patna, which was taken on the 6th of November 1763; he died in the month of March 1764.\n\nMeer Coffin being thus driven out, an agent was sent from Calcutta to Sujah Dowla, proposing an alliance with him and the Mogul, who was along with him, and offering to assist them against Meer Coffin or any other enemy who should attempt an invasion of their disputed dominions; in return for which, it was expected that they should declare themselves open enemies to Meer Coffin, and use their utmost endeavours to seize and deliver him up with all his effects. This design was communicated to Major Adams on the 8th of December 1763; but as he was next day to resign the command of the army, Major Carnac was desired to take the command upon him, and to watch the motions of Meer Coffin, as well as to guard the dominions of Meer Jaffier against any hostilities which might be attempted. It was also resolved, that in case Meer Coffin should prevail upon the Mogul and Sujah Dowla to assist him, Major Carnac was desired to advance to the banks of the river Carumna, and there oppose the entrance of any hostile army.\n\nIt soon appeared that the friendship of the English was not what Sujah Dowla desired. He considered them as rapacious usurpers, who having got a footing in the country under pretence of commerce, could be satisfied with nothing less than the entire possession of it, to the ruin of the natural inhabitants. In the beginning of February 1764, therefore, it was known that Sujah Dowla had determined to assist Meer Coffin in attempting to recover Bengal. The president and council on this wrote him, that though they heard such a report, they could not believe it, considering the former connections subsisting between him and the chiefs of the company, and were persuaded he would not act in such an unjust manner; but if it really was his intention to espouse the cause of Meer Coffin, they informed him that they were resolved to keep Bengal free from troubles, and carry the war into the dominions of Sujah Dowla himself. To this the nabob replied by enumerating the many favours conferred on the English by the Mogul. \"Notwithstanding these (says he) you have interfered in the king's country, polluted yourselves of districts belonging to the government, and turned out and established nabobs at pleasure, without the consent of the imperial court. Since you have imprisoned dependants on the court, and exposed the government of the king of kings to contempt and dishonour; since you have ruined the trade of the merchants of the country, granted protection to the king's servants, injured the revenues of the imperial court, and crushed the inhabitants by your acts of violence;\"\nsince you are continually feeding fresh people from Calcutta, and invading different parts of the royal dominions; to what can all those wrong proceedings be attributed, but to an absolute disregard to the court, and a wicked design of feigning the country to yourselves? If these disturbances have arisen from your own improper desires, desist from such behaviour in future; interfere not in the affairs of government; withdraw your people from every part, and send them to their own country; carry on the company's trade as formerly, and confine yourselves to commercial affairs,\" &c.\n\nAnother letter, much to the same purpose, was sent to Major Carnac; but the president and council of Calcutta, instead of paying any regard to the remonstrances of the nabob, determined to commence an immediate and offensive war against him.\n\nNotwithstanding this resolution, several difficulties occurred in carrying on a war at this time. The principal were the death of Major Adams, whose name had become formidable to the Indians, and the mutinous disposition of the army. The former was obviated by the appointment of Colonel Hector Munro, who, in military skill, appeared nothing inferior to his predecessor; and the mutinous disposition of the soldiery was got the better of by a most severe example of the mutineers, 24 of whom were blown away from the mouths of cannon. Hostilities were commenced on the part of Meer Collim, who cut off a small party of English troops, and sent their heads to the Mogul and Sujah Dowlia. An army of 50,000 men was collected, with a most formidable train of artillery, such as might be supposed to follow an European army of equal numbers. This prodigious armament seems to have effaced all the caution of Meer Collim; for though he had formerly experienced the bad effects of engaging the English in a pitched battle, yet he now thought proper to try his fortune a second time in the same way. The two armies met on the 22nd of October 1764, at a place called Buxard, on the river Carumnafla, about 100 miles above the city of Patna. The event was similar to that of other engagements with the English, to whom it never was possible for any advantages either in situation or number to make the Indians equal. The allied army was defeated with the loss of 6000 killed on the spot, 130 pieces of cannon, a proportionable quantity of military stores, and all their tents ready pitched; while, on the side of the conquerors, only 32 Europeans and 239 Indians were killed, and 57 Europeans and 473 Indians wounded.\n\nThe only place of strength now belonging to the allies on this side the river was a fort named Chanda Geer. The reduction of this place, however, might well have been deemed impracticable, as it stood on the top of a high hill, or rather rock, situated on the very brink of the Ganges, by which it could be constantly supplied with provisions; and as to military stores, it could not stand in need of any as long as stones could be found to pour down on the assailants. Notwithstanding all those difficulties, however, Colonel Munro caused his soldiers advance to the attack; but they were received with such volleys of stones, which the Indians threw both with hands and feet, that they were repulsed in a very short time; and though the attack was renewed the next day, it was attended with no better success; on which the English commander encamped with his army under the walls of Benares.\n\nSoon after this, Colonel Munro being recalled, the command of the army devolved on Sir Robert Fletcher, a major in the company's troops. The nabob, in the mean time, instead of attacking the English army at once, contented himself with sending out parties of light horse to skirmish with their advanced posts, while the main body lay at the distance of about 15 miles from Benares, which rendered it very dangerous for them to move from their place. On the 14th of January 1765, however, Sir Robert ventured at midnight to break up his camp under the walls of Benares, and to march off towards the enemy, leaving a party to protect that place against any attempt during his absence. In three days he came up with the main body of Indians, who retreated before him; on which Chandagreer, before which the late commander had been foiled by Sir Robert, His success would in all probability have been no better than that of his predecessor, had not the garrison mutinied for want of pay, and obliged the commander to surrender the place.\n\nThe reduction of Chanda Geer was followed by that of Eliabad, the capital of the enemy's country, a large city on the Ganges, between 60 and 70 miles above Chanda Geer, defended by thick and high walls and a strong fort; soon after which Sir Robert was superseded in the command of the army by Major Carnac. Sujah Dowlia in the mean time had been defeated with the English soon after the battle of Buxard. He did not, however, give himself up to despair, but gathered together, with great alacrity, the remains of his routed armies; and seeing that his own territories could not supply him with the requisite number of troops, he now applied to the Mahrattas for assistance. But these people, though very formidable to the other nations of Indotan, were far from being able to cope with the English. On the 20th of May 1765, General Carnac having assembled his troops, marched immediately to attack them; and having gained a complete victory at a place called Calpi, obliged them to retreat with precipitation across the Yumna into their own country.\n\nSujah Dowlia, now destitute of every resource, determined to throw himself on the clemency of the English. Previous to this, however, he allowed Meer Collim and the affianced Somers to escape; nor could any consideration ever prevail upon him to deliver them up. Three days after the battle of Calpi, the nabob surrendered himself to General Carnac, without illusing any thing in his own favour, farther than that he should await the determination of Lord Clive concerning him.\n\nIn the beginning of February this year died Meer Najem Ali Cawn, nominal nabob of Bengal. The succession was disputed betwixt his eldest surviving son Najem il Doula, a youth of about 18 years of age, and a grandchild by his eldest son Miran, at that time only seven years old. As the English were in reality absolute sovereigns of the country, it was debated in the council of Calcutta whether Meer Najem's son should be allowed to succeed, according to the custom of the country,\ncountry, or the grandfon, according to the English custom. The point being carried in favour of Najem, it was next debated on what terms he should be admitted to the succession. The late nabob, among other impositions, had obliged himself to support an army of 12,000 horse and as many foot. It was alleged on this occasion, that he had not fulfilled his engagement; that he had disbanded most of the troops; that at best they were but an useless burden, having never answered any purpose in real service, for which reason the company had been obliged to augment their military establishment: it was therefore now judged expedient that the nabob should settle a sum, upwards of 80,000l. annually, on the company, to be paid out of the treasury: that he should also discard his prime minister and great favourite Nuncomar, and receive in his place a person appointed by the council, who was to act in the double capacity of minister and governor to assist and instruct him. The council were also to have a negative upon the nomination of all the superintendents and principal officers employed in collecting or receiving of the revenues; that he should take their advice, and have their consent to such nominations whenever they thought proper to interfere in them. He was also to receive their complaints, and pay a due attention to them upon the misbehaviour of any of the officers who either were appointed already or should be in time to come.\n\nWith these extravagant requisitions the young nabob was obliged to comply, though he had discernment enough to perceive that he was now an absolute slave to the council at Calcutta. Though obliged by treaty to dismiss Nuncomar from the office of prime minister, he still continued to show him the same favour, until at last he was charged with carrying on a treasonable correspondence with Sujah Dowla, for which the nabob was enjoined to send him to Calcutta to take his trial. The unfortunate prince used every method to deliver his favourite from the impending danger, but to no purpose: he was obliged to submit to the mortification of having all his offers with regard to his release rejected, though the committee at Calcutta afterwards thought proper to let him at liberty without any trial.\n\nThese extraordinary powers, exerted in such a despotic manner by the council of Calcutta for such a length of time, could not but at last induce their superiors to circumscribe them in some degree, by appointing others who should act independently even of this council, and who might be supposed to be actuated by more upright and honourable principles than had hitherto appeared in their conduct. The great character which Lord Clive had already gained in the east, justly marked him out as a proper person for adjusting the affairs of Bengal. On the 3rd of May 1765 he arrived in the east, with full powers as commander in chief, president, and governor of Bengal. An unlimited power was also committed to a select committee, consisting of his lordship and four gentlemen, to act and determine every thing themselves, without dependence on the council. It was, however, recommended in their instructions, to consult the council in general as often as it could be done conveniently; but the sole power of determining in all cases was left with them, until the troubles of Bengal should be entirely ended. By these gentlemen a plan of reformation was instantly set about; by which, however, violent disputes were occasioned; but the committee, disregarding these impotent efforts, exerted their authority to the full extent, seldom even acquainting the council with their transactions, and never allowing them to give their opinion on any occasion.\n\nOn taking the affairs of Bengal into thorough consideration, Lord Clive found that the success of the restored British arms could be productive of nothing but wars; that to ruin Sujah Dowla was to break down the strongest barrier which the Bengal provinces could have against the incursions of the Mahattas and other barbarous people to the westward, who had long desolated the northern provinces; and the Mogul, with whom the company had concluded a treaty, was utterly unable to support himself, and would require the whole English power in the east to secure him in his dignity. His lordship therefore found it necessary to conclude a treaty with Sujah Dowla. The Mogul was satisfied by obtaining a more ample revenue than he had for some time enjoyed; by which means he might be enabled to march an army to Delhi to take possession of Lord Clive's empire. For the company his lordship obtained the office of duan or collector of revenues for the province of Bengal and its dependencies. Thus Sujah Dowla was again put in possession of his dominions, excepting a small territory which was referred to the Mogul, and estimated at 20 lacks of rupees, or 250,000l. annually. The company were to pay 26 lacks of rupees, amounting to 325,000l. sterling. They engaged also to pay to the nabob of Bengal an annual sum of 53 lacks, or 662,500l. for the expenses of government, and the support of his dignity. The remainder of the revenues of Bengal were allotted to the company, who on their part guaranteed the territories at that time in possession of Sujah Dowla and the Mogul.\n\nThus the East India company acquired the sovereignty of a territory equal in extent to the most flourishing kingdom in Europe. By all this, however, they were so far from being enriched, that the disorder of their affairs attracted the attention of government, and gave the British ministry an opportunity at last of depriving them of their territorial possessions, and subjecting the province of Bengal to the authority of the crown. See East India Company found a most formidable enemy in Hyder Ali, or Hyder Naig. This man, from the rank of a common Sepoy, had raised himself to be one of the War with most considerable princes in the empire of Indostan, Hyder Ali. Being sensible that the power of the English was an insuperable bar to his ambitious designs, he practised on the nizam of the Deccan, and partly by promises, partly by threats, engaged him to renounce his alliance with the company, and even to enter into a war against them. As he had been at great pains to introduce the European discipline among his troops, and had many renegadoes in his service, he imagined, that with the advantage of numbers he should certainly be able to cope with his antagonists in the open field. In this, however, he was deceived; for on the 26th of September 1767, his army was entirely defeated by Colonel Smith at a place called Errera near Trincomallee; after which the nizam thought it advisable to defer his new\nnew ally, and conclude another treaty with the English. From the latter, however, he did not obtain peace but at the expense of ceding to them the dominions of the Dageat Carnatic, which includes the dominions of Hyder Aly and some petty princes.\n\nHyder, thus deserted by his ally, transferred the seat of war to a mountainous country, where, during the year 1767, nothing decisive could be effected; while the Indian cavalry was sometimes enabled to cut off the supplies, and interrupt the communications of their antagonists. During these operations some ships were fitted out at Bombay, which conveyed 400 European soldiers and about 800 Sepoys to attack Mangalore, one of Hyder Aly's principal sea-ports, where all his ships lay. This enterprise proved successful, and nine ships were brought away; but too small a garrison having been left in the place, it was almost immediately after retaken, and all who were in it made prisoners by Hyder Aly.\n\nIn the meantime, an injudicious measure, adopted by the English in their method of managing the army, proved not only of the utmost detriment to their cause, but occasioned disgraces hitherto unheard of in the history of the nation, viz., the defection of officers from the service of Britain to that of a barbarous prince, and the giving up of forts in such a shameful manner as could not but suggest a suspicion that they had been betrayed.\u2014The original cause of all this mischief was the appointment of field-deputies to attend the army, and to control and superintend the conduct of the commander-in-chief; and these, in the present instance, being deeply concerned in the contracts for the army, took care to regulate its motions in such a manner as best suited their private interest or convenience. Hyder Aly did not fail to improve the errors consequent upon this kind of management to his own advantage. General Smith had penetrated far into his country, taken several of his fortresses, and was in a fair way of becoming master of his capital, when all his operations were checked at once by the field-deputies. His antagonist being thus allowed some respite, suddenly entered the Carnatic with a numerous army of horse, ravaging and destroying everything at pleasure. Thus the English were obliged to relinquish all their conquests in order to defend their own territories; while this reverse of fortune not only discouraged the allies of the English, but even produced in them an inclination to desert their cause, and go over to Hyder Aly, while those who remained faithful paid dearly for their attachment. The nabob of Arcot, the most faithful ally the English ever had, suffered extremely on this occasion. Hyder Aly had long entertained a violent enmity against this prince; most probably on account of his inviolable attachment to the English. His dominions were therefore ravaged without mercy; and thus, while Hyder gratified his personal resentment against him, he cut off from the English one of the principal resources they had for carrying on the war.\n\nOn the return of the company's forces to the defense of the Carnatic, they found themselves very little able to cope with their adversary; for, besides the continuance of the same causes which had formerly contributed to their want of success, they had been very much weakened in their expedition. Hyder Aly had also the prudence to avoid a general engagement, but frequently intercepted the convoys of the English, cut off their detached parties, and wearied them out with long and continual marches. The news of his successes against an enemy hitherto invincible by all the powers of India, so raised his reputation, that adventurers flocked to him from all parts; by which means his cavalry were soon increased to upwards of 90,000; to which, however, his infantry bore no proportion.\n\nNotwithstanding all his successes, it appears that the forces of Hyder Aly were altogether unable to cope with those of Britain, even when there was the greatest imaginable disparity of numbers. A detachment of the company's forces had made an assault upon a fort called Mulwagglee, in which they were repulsed with some loss. This, with the small number of the detachment, encouraged Hyder Aly to march at the head of a great part of his army to the protection of the fort. The commanding officer, however, Colonel Wood, did not hesitate, with only 460 Europeans and 2300 Sepoys, to attack his army, consisting of 14,000 horse, 12,000 men armed with matchlock guns, and six battalions of sepoys. The engagement lasted five hours; when at last Hyder Aly, notwithstanding his defeated by numbers, was obliged to retreat, leaving the field covered with dead bodies; the loss of the British being upwards of 300 killed and wounded. This engagement, however, was attended with no consequences affecting the war in general, which went on for some time in the same manner, and greatly to the disadvantage of the company. The divisions and discontent among the officers and council daily increased, the soldiers deserted, and every thing went to ruin. The revenues of the establishment of Madras being at last unequal to the expenses of the war, large remittances were made from Bengal to answer that purpose; and as these were made in a kind of base gold coin, the company is laid by that means alone to have lost 40,000l. in the difference of exchange only. At last Hyder Aly having given the English army the slip, suddenly appeared within a few miles of Madras; which occasioned such an alarm, that the presidency there were induced to enter into a negotiation with him. The Indian prince, on his part, was very ready to hearken to proposals of peace upon any reasonable terms. An offensive and defensive treaty was therefore concluded on the 3d of April 1769, on the simple condition that the forts and places taken on both sides should be restored, and each party fit down contented with their own expenses.\n\nBy this treaty it was particularly stipulated, that in case either party being attacked by their enemies, the English the other should give them assistance; and in this case even the number of troops to be supplied by each was specified. It soon after appeared, however, that the presidency of Madras were resolved to pay very little regard to their engagements. Hyder Aly having in a little time been involved in a war with the Mahrattas, applied for assistance, according to agreement; but was refused by the presidency, who pretended to fear a quarrel with the Mahrattas themselves. As the latter are a very powerful and warlike nation, Hyder Aly found himself overmatched, and therefore applied several times to the English for the assistance he had a right to expect; but was constantly refused on various pretexts; which convinced him at last that he could place\nno dependence on the friendship of the English, and filled him with an implacable hatred against them. As soon, therefore, as he could make up his differences with the Mahrattas, he resolved to recover his losses, and revenge himself on those faithless allies. With this view he applied himself to their rivals the French; whom no Indian nation ever found backward in supplying them with the means of defence against the English. By their means he obtained military stores in the greatest abundance, a number of experienced officers and soldiers; and the European discipline was brought to much greater perfection than even he himself had ever been able to bring it before this period. Thus, in a short time, imagining himself a match for the Mahrattas, he renewed the war; and gained such decisive advantages, as quickly obliged them to conclude an advantageous treaty with him.\n\nIt now appeared that the English, notwithstanding their pretended ill-will to quarrel with the Mahrattas, had not the least hesitation at doing so when their interest was concerned. In order to understand the subsequent transactions, however, we must observe, that the Mahrattas, like other nations of India, were originally governed by princes called rajahs, who reigned at Setterah; and though in process of time they came to be divided into a number of petty states, yet they paid a nominal respect to the ram-rajah, who had a right to alienate their chiefs, and order out their troops on any necessary occasion. By degrees this dignity of ram-rajah or fou-rajah (as he was also called), became merely titular, the administration being entirely policed by the pahluwa or chancellor. This office being usurped by one particular family, Nana-row, the reigning pahluwa, seized the ram-rajah and confined him in a fortress near Setterah. At his death he left two sons, Mada-row and Narain-row; of whom the former, as being the elder, succeeded him in the pahluwship. Jonogee Boola, or Bouncella, the immediate predecessor of Moodage Boola, rajah of Berar, was one of the pretenders to the dignity of ram-rajah, as being the nearest of kin; at the same time that Roganaut-row, called also Ragabah, uncle to Mada-row himself, pretended to the pahluwship. On this account the latter was confined by Mada-row, but who imprudently released him a little before his death, and even recommended him to the most affectionate manner the care of his brother Narain-row, who was to succeed to the pahluwship. The care he took in consequence of this recommendation was such as might easily have been imagined; the unhappy Narain-row was murdered, and Roganaut-row the allusion fled to Bombay; where, on promising a cession of territory, he was protected and encouraged in his pretensions. The Mahrattas remonstrated against this behaviour; but the English had determined at all events to profit by the civil divisions of the Indians, and therefore paid no regard to the justice or injustice of their cause. The Mahrattas therefore not only made up their differences with Hyder Aly, as has been already mentioned, but became determined enemies to the English, at the same time that a dangerous confederacy was formed among the most powerful princes of India to expel from that part of the world those intruders whose avarice could be satisfied with no concessions, and whom no treaties could bind when it served their turn to break them.\n\nThe resentment of Hyder Aly was particularly directed against the presidency of Madras for the reasons already given; he had also received fresh provocation by their causing a body of troops march through his dominions without his leave, and that to the afflatus of a prince for whom he had no great friendship; also by the capture of the French settlement of Mahic, on the coast of Malabar, which he said was within his dominions, and consequently that the French were under his protection. His troops were therefore assembled from every quarter, and the greatest preparations made for a powerful invasion. The presidency of Madras in the mean time spent their time in mutual alterations, neglecting even to secure the passes of the mountains, through which only an invasion could be made, until their active antagonist, having feigned and guarded those passes, suddenly poured out through them at the head of 100,000 men, among whom was a large body of European troops under French officers, and commanded by Colonel Lally, a man of great bravery and experience in war.\n\nThe alarm was given on the 24th of July 1780 that Hyder Aly's horde were only nine miles distant from Madras. The inhabitants instantly deserted their houses and fled into the fort; while the unfeasted barbarian burnt the villages, reduced the inferior forts, and prepared to lay siege to the capital. It being now absolutely necessary to make some resistance, measures were taken for assembling the troops; in doing which an express was sent to Colonel Baillie, at that time at Gumeroponda, about 28 miles from Madras, to proceed from thence directly to Conjeevaram with the corps under his command, where the main body was to meet him. But when the latter was under marching or unfortunate, the first regiment of cavalry positively refused to move without money; and as they persisted in their resolution, were at last made prisoners and sent to Madras. The main body, then, consisting of 1500 Europeans and 4200 Sepoys, under Sir Hector Munro, with their train of artillery, proceeded towards Conjeevaram; and such were the fatigues of their march, that 250 men belonging to the 73rd regiment were left lying on the road. On their arrival at Conjeevaram, they found the town in flames, great bodies of the enemy's cavalry advancing on both flanks, and no appearance of Colonel Baillie's detachment. The march of this body had been impeded by a small river swollen by a sudden fall of rain. On this occasion, the officer who gives the account of his disaster makes the following observation. \"In this incident we have a most remarkable proof and example of the danger of procrastination, and on what minute circumstances and sudden springs of the mind the fortune and the general issue of war may depend. Had Colonel Baillie passed over the Tripassore without halting, as some advised, and encamped on its southern instead of its northern bank, the disaster that soon followed would have been prevented, and an order of affairs wholly different from that which took place would have succeeded.\"\n\nHyder Aly having now raised the siege of Arcot, in which he had been employed, marched towards Conjeevaram; in the neighbourhood of which he encamped.\ncamped, and in the course of several days, at different times, offered battle. On the 6th of September, he detached his son Tippoo Saib with the flower of his army to cut off the detachment under Colonel Baillie, who was now at Perrambaukam, a small village distant from the main body about 15 miles, he himself remaining in the neighbourhood of Conjeveram, in order to watch the motions of Sir Hector Munro.\n\nThe detachment under Tippoo Saib consisted of 30,000 horse, 8000 foot, with 12 pieces of cannon. Notwithstanding this superiority in number, however, they were bravely repulsed by Colonel Baillie's handful of troops; and a junction was effected with a detachment under Sir Robert Fletcher, sent by Sir Hector Munro on first hearing the noise of the engagement.\n\nThis junction was effected on the 9th of September, and next morning orders were given for the whole army to march; Colonel Fletcher's detachment being dispersed in different parts of the line. From the moment they began to march, the enemy played off their rockets, which, however, did but little execution; but about ten at night several guns began to open on the rear of the English. Colonel Baillie, therefore, after some proper manoeuvres, caused his troops form a line, while the enemy cannonaded them incessantly with great execution. On this Colonel Baillie detached Captain Rumley with five companies of Sepoy grenadiers to storm their guns; which service they would have undoubtedly accomplished, had not their march been interrupted by a torrent of water which at that time happened to be unfordable. Captain Rumley therefore returned about half an hour after eleven, when the guns of the enemy were heard drawing off towards the English front, and a general alarm was perceived throughout their camp; owing, as was supposed, to their having received intelligence of the party that had been sent to storm their guns.\n\n\"From their noise, confusion, and irregular firing (says our author), one would have imagined that a detachment of our men had fallen upon them with fixed bayonets. At that critical moment, had a party of grenadiers been sent against them, they would have routed without difficulty the whole of Tippoo's army. Having about ten o'clock in the evening advanced a few hundred yards into an avenue, the detachment remained there in perfect silence till the morning.\n\n\"Colonel Fletcher being asked by some officers, why Colonel Baillie halted? modestly answered, that Colonel Baillie was an officer of established reputation, and that he no doubt had reasons for his conduct. It cannot, however, be concealed, that this halt afforded an opportunity for Tippoo Saib to draw off his cannon to a very strong post by which the English were obliged to pass; and at the same time of informing Hyder of their situation, and suggesting to him the expediency of advancing for the improvement of so favourable a conjuncture.\n\n\"On the 10th of September, at five o'clock in the morning, our little army marched off by the right in subdivisions, having their baggage on their right flank and the enemy on their left. A few minutes after six two guns opened on their rear, on which the line halted a few minutes. Large bodies of the enemy's cavalry now appeared on their right flank; and just at the moment when the pagoda of Conjeveram appeared in view, and our men had begun to indulge the hopes of a respite from toils and dangers, a rocket-boy was taken prisoner, who informed them, that Hyder's whole army was marching to the assistance of Tippoo. Four guns now opened on their left with great effect. So hot was the fire they sustained, and so heavy the loss, that Colonel Baillie ordered the whole line to quit the avenue, and present a front to the enemy; and at the same time dispatched Captain Rumley with ten companies of Sepoy grenadiers to storm the enemy's guns.\n\n\"Within a few minutes after Captain Rumley had left the line, Tippoo's guns were silenced. Rumley's little detachment immediately took possession of four of the enemy's guns, and completely routed the party attached to them. Captain Rumley, overcome with fatigue, ordered Captain Gowdie, the officer next in command, to lead on the party, and take possession of some more guns placed a few hundred yards in their front. But in a few minutes after, as they were advancing for this purpose, a sudden cry was heard among the Sepoys, of horde! horde! The camp followers, whose numbers were nearly five to one of the troops under arms, were driven on a part of our line by the numerous and surrounding forces of Hyder Ali; who being informed of the embarrassing situation of Colonel Baillie, had left his camp without striking his tents, with a view to conceal his march from the English. A great confusion among our troops was the unavoidable consequence of this sudden onset. The Europeans were suddenly left on the field of action alone; and at that critical moment a detachment from the advanced guard of Hyder's army pressed on with great celerity between our line and Captain Rumley's party. The commanding officer, therefore, apprehensive of being cut off from our little army, judged it most prudent to retreat.\n\n\"Colonel Baillie, when he was informed that an immense body of horse and infantry was marching towards him, and that this was supposed to be Hyder's main army, said, 'Very well, we shall be prepared to receive them.' Hyder's whole forces now appeared incalculably in view; and this barbarian chief, who, as was observed of the Roman general by Pyrrhus, had nothing barbarous in his discipline, after dividing his guns agreeably to a preconcerted plan, opened from 60 to 70 pieces of cannon, with an innumerable quantity of rockets.\n\n\"Hyder's numerous cavalry, supported by his regular infantry and European troops, driven on by threats, encouraged by promises, and led on by his most distinguished officers, bore on our little army in different quarters without making the least impression. Our men, both Europeans and Sepoys, repeatedly presented and recovered their fire-arms as if they had been manoeuvring on a parade. The enemy were repulsed in every attack; numbers of their best cavalry were killed, and many more were wounded; even the English infantry were forced to give way; and Hyder himself would have ordered a retreat, had it not been for the advice of General Lally, who informed him that it was now too late, as General Munro was most probably...\nbably advancing on their rear from Conjeevaram; for which reason nothing remained but to break the detachment by their artillery and cavalry.\n\n\"Tippoo Saib had by this time collected his party together, and renewed the cannonade; and at the same time that the English were under the necessity of sustaining an attack both from the father and son, two of their tumbrils were blown up by Hyder's guns, and a large opening made in both lines. They had now no other ammunition than grape; their guns discontinued firing; and in this dreadful situation, under a terrible fire not only of guns but rockets, losing great numbers of officers and men, they remained from half past seven till nine o'clock.\n\n\"On this Hyder Aly, perceiving that the guns were quite silenced, came with his whole army round their right flank. The cavalry charged them in distinct columns, and in the intervals between these the infantry poured in volleys of musquetry with dreadful effect. Mhiar Saib, with the Mogul and Sanoor cavalry, made the first impression. These were followed by the elephants and the Myforean cavalry, which completed the overthrow of the detachment, Colonel Baillie, though grievously wounded, rallied the Europeans, and once more formed them into a square; and with this handful of men he gained an eminence, where, without ammunition, and most of the people wounded, he resisted and repulsed 13 separate attacks; but fresh bodies or cavalry continually pouring in, they were broken without giving way. Many of our men, desperately wounded, raising themselves from the ground received the enemy on their bayonets.\n\n\"Captain Lucas's battalion of Sepoys, at the time when our men moved up to a rising ground, was stationed to the right of the European grenadiers; but that corps, seeing the Europeans in motion, and mistaking perhaps this evolution for a retreat, broke in the utmost confusion. The Europeans, bravely sustaining their reputation for intrepid valour, remained in this extremity of distress steady and undaunted, though surrounded by the French troops, and by Hyder's cavalry to the number of 40,000. They even expressed a desire, though their number did not exceed 400, of being led on to the attack. A party of Tipperaries, who lay at the distance of about 30 yards in our front, kept up an incessant fire of small arms with great effect. Many attempts were made by the enemy's cavalry to break this small body of men; but by the steady conduct of both our officers and men they were repulsed.\n\n\"Colonel Baillie, finding that there was now no prospect of being relieved by General Munro, held up a flag of truce to one of the chiefs of Hyder's army. But this was treated with contempt, and the sirdar endeavoured at the same time to cut off the colonel. The reason the enemy assigned for this was, that the Sepoys had fired after the signal was hoisted.\n\n\"A few minutes after this, our men received orders to throw down their arms, with intimation that quarter would be given. This order was scarcely complied with, but when, with the enemy rushed in upon them in the most savage and brutal manner, sparing neither age nor infancy nor any condition of life; and, but for the humane interposition of the French commanders Lally and Pimorran, who implored and inflicted with the conqueror to show mercy, the gallant remains of our little army must have fallen a sacrifice to that savage thirst of blood with which the tyrant disgraced his victory.\" (A)\n\nIn this unfortunate action near 700 Europeans were killed.\n\n---\n\n(A) In a narrative of the sufferings of the English who survived this fatal day, said to be published by an officer in Colonel Baillie's detachment, we find it related, that \"Hyder Aly, seated in a chair in his tent, enjoyed the sight of the heads of the slain, as well as of his prisoners. Colonel Baillie, who was himself very much wounded, was brought to his camp on a cannon, and with several other gentlemen in the same situation laid at the tyrant's feet on the ground and in the open air. In this situation they saw many of the heads of their countrymen presented to the conqueror, some of them even by English officers, who were forced to perform that horrid task; in a little time, however, Hyder ordered no more heads to be brought to him while the English gentlemen were present. A tent was fitted up for Colonel Baillie and his officers, but without straw or anything else to lie upon, though many of them were dangerously wounded; and as the tent could only contain 10 persons, the rest were obliged to lie in the open air. When the prisoners were removed from place to place, they were wantonly insulted, and even beaten by those who had the charge of them. If the latter halted to refresh themselves under a tree, they would be at the trouble of carrying their prisoners to the side next to the sun, lest they should enjoy the benefit of the shade. Sometimes they were tormented with thirst, at others the people allowed them to drink water out of the palms of their hands, it being reckoned a profanation to allow an European to drink out of a vessel belonging to an Indian,\" &c.\n\nIn this narrative are likewise mentioned some examples of a recovery from wounds, which, if we can depend on their authenticity, must undoubtedly show a restorative power in the human body altogether unknown in this climate.\n\n\" Lieutenant Thomas Bowler received a musket ball in his leg, and after that eight desperate wounds with a scymitar. He lay for seven hours on the spot, deprived of all sensation; but, towards evening, awakened from his trance, stripped of all his clothes, except a pair of under drawers and part of his shirt, with an intense thirst, calling out, and imploring a little water from the enemy. Some were moved with compassion, while others answered his intreates only with insults and threats of immediate death. Some water, however, was brought from a pool in the field of battle, about 50 or 60 yards from the place where he lay. It was deeply tinged with blood; nevertheless, Mr Bowler being furnished with one of Hyder's soldiers with an earthen chatty, or pot containing about a pint, and directed to the place, crawled thither as well as he could. Though struck with horror at the sight of the dead and wounded with which it was filled, he quenched his thirst with the liquid; and having\nkilled on the spot; the loss on Hyder Aly's part was so great that he indifferently concealed it, being enraged that the conquest of such an inconsiderable body should cost him so many of his bravest troops. He seemed ever after to consider the English with an extreme degree of terror; insomuch that, notwithstanding his pretended exultation on account of the present victory, he no sooner heard a report of Sir Hector Munro's march to attack him, that he left his camp in the utmost confusion, abandoning great part of his tents and baggage, as well as the vast numbers that had been wounded in the late action.\n\nOn the news of Colonel Baillie's disaster, the supreme council of Bengal requested Sir Eyre Coote to take upon him the management of the war; for the carrying on of which a large supply of men and money was instantly decreed. This was readily undertaken by the illustrious officer just mentioned, notwithstanding his very precarious state of health at that time; and from the moment he took upon him the management of affairs, the fortune of the war was changed.\n\nThe spirit of diffusion, which for a long time had infected the presidency of Madras, was indeed the true cause of all the misfortunes that had happened. This was found by Sir Eyre Coote to be even greater than he had heard by report: the respect and confidence of the natives was wholly lost; the complaints of the officers and soldiers were loud and acrimonious; an inactivity prevailed in all the councils and operations, while the enemy carried every thing before them. Sir Hector Munro had been greatly harassed on his march to Madras, whither he had retreated after Colonel Baillie's disaster; the forces of Hyder Aly had invested all the places in that neighbourhood in such a manner as in a great measure to cut off all supplies; and Arcot, the capital city of the most faithful ally the British ever had, was taken by storm, together with an adjoining fort, by which means an immense quantity of ammunition and military stores fell into the hands of the enemy.\n\nNo sooner had Sir Eyre Coote taken upon him the command of the British forces, than his antagonist thought proper to change his plan of operations entirely. He now detached large parties of his numerous forces to lay siege to the principal fortresses belonging to the company; while, with the bravest and best disciplined part, he kept the field against the British commander in person. On the very first appearance of the British army, however, his resolution failed, and he abandoned the siege of every place he had invested, retiring to a considerable distance on the other side of the river Palar, without even disputing the passage of it, as it was expected he would have done.\n\nA respite being thus obtained from the incursions of Pondicherry, this formidable enemy, the next operation was to secure Pondicherry, whose inhabitants had revolted. They were, however, easily disarmed, their magazines reduced, and all the boats in their possession destroyed; in consequence of which precaution, a French squadron that soon after appeared off Pondicherry was obliged to depart without being furnished with any necessaries. But in the mean time Hyder Aly having drawn large reinforcements from all parts of his dominions, resolved to try his fortune in a pitched battle. His army amounted to 200,000 men, 40,000 of whom were cavalry, and 15,000 well disciplined Sepoys. Still, however, he durst not openly attack the British army in the field, but took a strong post from whence he might harass them on their march. Sir Eyre Coote, however, was not on his part backward to make the attack; and on the other hand Hyder Aly prepared to engage him with all possible advantage. The battle was fought on the 11th of July 1781; and notwithstanding the vast superiority of Hyder Aly's army, he was routed with great slaughter. The Indians, however, made a much more obstinate resistance than usual; and the engagement lasted from nine in the morning till four in the afternoon, and the deficiency of the English in cavalry prevented them from pursuing the advantage they had gained.\n\nNotwithstanding the loss of this battle, Hyder Aly was soon encouraged to venture another. This was fought on the 27th of August the same year, on the very spot where Colonel Baillie had been defeated. It was more obstinately contested than even the former, being continued with great fury from eight in the morning to near dark. A number of brave officers and soldiers fell on the part of the British, owing chiefly to the terrible fire of the enemy's artillery and the advantageous position of their troops. At last, however, the Indian army was totally defeated, and driven from every post it had occupied; though from the obstinate resistance made at this time, Hyder began to entertain hopes that his forces might, by a succession of such battles, be at last enabled to cope with the English. He therefore ventured a third battle in some weeks after, but was now defeated with greater loss.\n\nhaving filled his chatty, endeavoured to proceed towards Conjeveram. He had not, however, moved from his place above 300 or 400 yards, when, being quite overcome, he was obliged to lie all night in the open air, during which time there fell two heavy showers of rain. Next morning he proceeded to Conjeveram; but after walking about a mile, was met by some of the enemy's horsemen, by whom he was brought back prisoner, and obliged to walk without any assistance. When delivered up to the enemy's Sepoys, he was so stiff with his wounds, that he could not stoop or even bend his body in the smallest degree.\n\n\"The quarter-master sergeant of artillery received so deep a cut across the back part of his neck, that he was obliged to support his head with his hands in order to keep it from falling to a side all the journey. The least shake or unevenness of the ground made him cry out with pain. He once and again ceased from all attempts to proceed; but being encouraged and conjured by his companions to renew his efforts, he did so, reached the camp, and at last, as well as Mr Bowler, recovered.\"\u2014It is also remarkable, that, according to our author, out of 32 wounded persons only six died; though one would be apt to think that the excessively severe usage they met with would have killed every one.\nIndia. los than before. Undiscouraged by this bad success, however, he laid siege to Vellore; and expecting that the relief of it would be attempted, seized a strong pass through which he knew the British army must direct their march. The British commander accordingly advanced, and found the enemy in possession of some very strong grounds on both sides of a marsh through which he was obliged to pass. Here he was attacked on all sides, but principally on the rear, the enemy directing their force principally against the baggage and convoy of provisions designed for the garrison. Their utmost efforts, however, were unavailing, and Sir Eyre Coote forced his way to Vellore in spite of all opposition. Hyder Ali did not fail to wait his return through the same pass; and having exerted his utmost skill in posting his troops, attacked him with the utmost vigour: but though the English were assaulted in front and in both flanks at once, and a heavy cannonade kept up during the whole time of the engagement, the Indians were at last defeated with great slaughter.\n\nBy these successes the presidency of Madras were now allowed so much repose, that an enterprise was planned against the Dutch settlement of Negapatam, situated to the south of Madras, and in the neighbourhood of Tanjore. A very inconsiderable force, however, could yet be spared for this purpose, as Hyder Ali, though so often defeated, was still extremely formidable. Sir Hector Munro had the management of the expedition: and so furious was the attack of the British sailors, that the troops left to guard the avenues to the place were defeated at the very first onset. A regular siege ensued; which, however, was of very short duration, a breach being soon made and the garrison surrendering prisoners of war.\n\nThe loss of Negapatam was quickly followed by that of Trincomalee in Ceylon. Admiral Hughes, who had conveyed Sir Hector Munro with the land forces to that place, and assisted him with his sailors, immediately after its surrender set sail for Trincomalee, where he arrived about the middle of January 1782. The fort of that name was quickly reduced; but the main strength of the settlement consisted of a fort named Offenburgh, the principal place on the island, and by the capture of which the whole settlement would be reduced. This fort stands on a hill which commands the harbour, but is itself overlooked by another hill at the distance of no more than 200 yards. Though the gaining of this post was undoubtedly to be attended with the loss of the fort, it does not appear that the governor even attempted to defend it. A British detachment of sailors and marines therefore took possession of it, when the admiral sent a summons of surrender, representing the uselessness of making any farther defence after the loss of such a post; and being extremely desirous of avoiding an effusion of blood, repeated his arguments at several different times. The governor, however, proving obstinate, the place was taken by storm, with the loss of about 60 on the part of the British, and very little on that of the Dutch, the victors giving quarter the moment it was asked. Four hundred Europeans were taken prisoners; a large quantity of ammunition and military stores, with a numerous artillery, were found in the place; and two Indians richly laden, with a number of small trading vessels, were taken in the harbour.\n\nA more formidable enemy, however, now made his appearance on the coast of Coromandel. This was Suffrein the French admiral; who setting out from India with his native country with 11 ships of the line and several powerful frigates, had fallen in with the Hannibal of 50 guns, and taken her when separated from her consorts. This ship, along with three others, a 74, a 64, and a 50, had been sent out to the assistance of Sir Edward; and the three last had the good fortune to join him before the arrival of M. de Suffrein. The latter, supposing that he had not yet received this reinforcement, bore down upon the English squadron at Madras, to which place they had sailed immediately after the capture of Trincomalee. Perceiving his mistake, however, he instantly bore away. The English admiral pursued, took five vessels, five of them English prizes, and the sixth a valuable transport laden with gunpowder and other military stores, besides having on board a number of land-officers and about 300 regular troops. This brought on an engagement, in which M. Suffrein, perceiving the rear division of the British fleet unable to keep up with the rest, directed his force principally against it. The ships of Admiral Hughes Engage-\n\nhimself and Commodore King sustained the most violent bent efforts of the French, having mostly two, and at times three, vessels to contend with. Thus the commodore's ship was reduced almost to a wreck; but Hughes, about six in the evening, the wind becoming more favourable to the English, the squadron of the enemy were obliged to draw off. The loss of men on the part of the British amounted to little more than 130 killed and wounded, but that of the French exceeded 250.\n\nAfter the battle Sir Edward returned to Madras; but meeting with no intelligence of Suffrein at that place, he made the best of his way for Trincomalee, being apprehensive of an attack upon that place, or of the intercepting of a convoy of stores and reinforcements at that time expected from England. Suffrein had indeed got intelligence of this convoy, and was at that time on his way to intercept it. This brought the hostile fleets again in sight of each other; and as the British admiral had been reinforced by two ships of the line, he was now better able to encounter his adversary. A desperate battle ensued, which continued till towards night, when the ships on both sides were too much shattered, that neither could renew the engagement next day.\n\nThough these engagements produced nothing decisive, they were nevertheless of the utmost prejudice to the affairs of Hyder Ali, who was thus prevented from receiving the succours he had been promised from France; and he was still farther mortified by the defeat of his forces before Tellicherry, which place he had blockaded since the commencement of hostilities. Ali's forces here, however, was in some measure compensated by Braithwaite's entire defeat of a detachment of about 2000 English infantry and 300 cavalry under Colonel Braithwaite, a brave and experienced officer. This detachment, Tipoo Saib.\nment, consisting of chosen troops from Sir Eyre Coote's army, lay encamped on the banks of the Coleroon, which forms the northern boundary of Tanjore. Tipu Saib having procured exact intelligence of the situation of this party, formed a design of attacking it while no danger was suspected on account of the distance of Hyder Aly's army. He set out on his design with an army of 15,000 horse and 5000 foot, accompanied by a body of French regulars; and having crossed the Coleroon, suddenly surrounded the British forces on all sides. The colonel, perceiving his danger, formed his men into a square, distributing the artillery to the several fronts, and keeping his cavalry in the centre. In this situation he resisted for three days the utmost efforts of his numerous enemies, always compelling them to retreat with great loss. At last General Lally, rightly conjecturing that the strength of the English must be exhausted and their numbers thinned by such desperate service, proposed that the French infantry, which was fresh and entire, should attack one of the fronts of the square, while the forces of Tipu should do the same with the other three. This last attack proved successful; the British forces were broken with great slaughter, which however was softened by the humanity of the French commander; who even obtained from Tipu Saib the care of the prisoners, and treated them with tenderness and humanity they certainly would not otherwise have experienced. A number of British officers, however, perished in the engagement, and only one remained unwounded.\n\nIn the meantime, the succours from France, so long expected by Hyder, made their appearance. As soon as a junction was formed, they proceeded, under the command of M. Duchemin, to invest Cuddalore; which not being in any situation to stand a siege, was surrendered on capitulation. In like manner some other places of smaller consequence were reduced, until at last being joined by Hyder's numerous forces, they determined to lay siege to Vandervath, a place of great importance, and the loss of which would have been extremely detrimental to the English. This quickly brought Sir Eyre Coote with his army to its relief; but Hyder Aly, notwithstanding his being reinforced by the French, durst not yet venture a battle in the open field. On this the British commander proceeded to attack Arnee, the principal depository of Hyder's warlike stores and necessaries. Thus the latter was obliged to quit his advantageous ground; but he did so with such celerity and speed, that he came upon the British army unawares while preparing for its last march to Arnee, now only five miles distant. Perceiving that the march of the British troops was through low grounds, encompassed on most parts with high hills, he planted his cannon upon the latter; from which he kept a continual and heavy fire on the troops below, while his numerous cavalry attacked them on every side. Notwithstanding all disadvantages, the British commander at last closed in with the enemy; and after an obstinate dispute completely routed them. Neither this, however, nor any other engagement with Hyder Aly, ever proved decisive; for as the want of cavalry prevented the British general from pursuing his advantage, so that his antagonist was too numerous, that by it he always covered his retreats in such an effectual manner as to lose but few men, and in a short time to be in a condition to act again on the offensive. This was remarkably the case at present; for notwithstanding this defeat, which happened on the 2d of June 1782, he cut off an advanced body of the British army five days after; and harassed the whole in such a manner, that Sir Eyre Coote, notwithstanding his success, was obliged to move nearer Madras; soon after which, he was obliged, on account of his bad state of health, to relinquish the command of the army to General Stuart.\n\nHyder Aly now perceiving that he was likely to be attended with no success by land, began to rely his hopes on the success of the French by sea. He therefore earnestly requested M. Suffren, who possessed at that time a decisive superiority in the number of ships, to lose no time in attacking the British squadron before it could be joined by a reinforcement which was then on its way, and was reported to be very formidable. As the French commander was by no means deficient in courage, a third engagement took place on the 5th of July 1783. At this time the British had the advantage of the wind, the battle was much of the more close, and the victory more plainly on their side, French. It is said indeed, that had not the wind fortunately shifted in such a manner as to enable the French to disengage their ships, a total and ruinous defeat would have ensued. After the engagement, the French admiral proceeded to Cuddalore, having received intelligence that a large body of French troops in transports had arrived off the island of Ceylon, in company with three ships of the line. As this seemed to afford hopes of retaliation, he used such diligence in refitting his ships, that the fleet was able to put to sea in the beginning of August. His intention was to make an attempt on Trincomalee; and so well were his designs conducted, that Sir Edward received no intelligence of the danger, till a British frigate chancing a French one, which took shelter with the squadron at Trincomalee, discovered it by this accident, and hastened back with the news to Madras. It was now, however, too late; the place was not in a condition to resist a siege; and the French batteries having silenced those of the fort in two days, a capitulation took place on the last day of August.\n\nSir Edward Hughes having been detained by contrary winds, did not arrive at Trincomalee before the 2d of September, when he had the mortification to see the forts in the hands of the French, and that Suffren was in the harbour with 15 sail of the line while he had only 12. He did not hesitate at venturing a fourth engagement with this inferiority, nor did M. Suffren decline the combat. The event of the battle was between the French and no other than shattering the fleets and killing and wounding a number of men on both sides. In this, however, as well as in the other engagements, the superiority of the English was very manifest; and in entering the harbour of Trincomalee the French lost a 74 gun ship.\n\nThe loss of Trincomalee was severely felt by the English; for while the French lay safely in the harbour refitting their squadron, the English were obliged for that purpose to fall to Madras. Here the fleet was threatened by one of the most dreadful tempests ever known on that coast. Trading vessels to the number of...\nof near 100 were wrecked, as well as those for Madras laden with rice, of which there was an extreme scarcity at that place. Thus the scarcity was augmented to a famine, which carried off vast numbers of the inhabitants before supplies could arrive from Bengal. The continuance of the bad weather obliged Sir Edward with his whole squadron to fail to Bombay; and there he did not arrive till towards the end of the year, when his squadron was so much shattered, that, in order to repair it with proper expedition, he was obliged to distribute it between the dock-yards of Bombay and the Portuguese settlement at Goa.\n\nIn the mean time Sir Richard Bickerton arrived at Bombay from England with five men of war, having on board 5000 troops, after a very favourable passage; having neither seen nor heard of the bad weather which had desolated the coasts of India. It was likewise the intention of France to signalize the campaign of this year by an immense force both by sea and land in India. Exclusive of the forces already on the coast of Coromandel, they were to be joined by 5000 more, all regulars, from their islands on the African coast. Suffren was to be reinforced by several ships of the line, when it was hoped that a decided superiority at sea would be obtained over the English; while their superior numbers and artillery on shore would render them invincible by any force that could be brought against them. To oppose these designs, it was deemed necessary by the presidency of Bombay to make a powerful diversion on the coast of Malabar. Here was situated the kingdom of Mylore, the sovereignty of which had been usurped by Hyder Aly under the title of Dayro, as that of the Mahrattas was by a person styled Pajibar. This kingdom is nearly in the same parallel with Arcot. To the northward is the kingdom of Canara, which is said to have been the favourite possession of Hyder Aly; the name of its capital is Bidnore, which also gives name to an extensive territory, and was by Hyder changed to that of Hydermangur. The expedition had been set on foot as early as the end of the year 1781; a strong body of forces under the command of Colonel Humberstone had taken the two cities of Calicut and Pannyan, besides others of lesser note, and penetrated into the inland country, which is there difficult and dangerous. Having here made himself master of a place called Mongarry Cotta, of which the situation commanded the entrance into the inner parts of the country, he proceeded to attack Palatacherry, a considerable town at some miles distance; but being suddenly environed with a numerous and hostile army, instead of making himself master of the place, it was not without the utmost difficulty that he made his escape after losing all his provisions and baggage. A great army, consisting of 20,000 foot and 10,000 horse, under Tippoo Saib, advanced against him with such celerity, that the colonel had only time to retreat to Pannyan, where he was superseded in the command by Colonel Macleod; and soon after the place was invested by the forces of the enemy, among whom was General Lally with a considerable body of French. Two British frigates, however, having come to the assistance of the place, rendered all the attempts of the enemy to reduce it abortive. At last Tippoo Saib, impatient of delay, made a vigorous effort against the British lines; but though both the Indian and French commanders behaved with great bravery, the attack not only proved unsuccessful, but they were repulsed with such loss as determined Tippoo to abandon the siege of the place, and retire beyond the river of Pannyan.\n\nAs soon as the presidency of Bombay were acquainted with the success of Colonel Humberstone, General Matthews was dispatched to his assistance with a powerful reinforcement. This expedition, which began the news campaign of 1783 in the kingdom of Canara, has been related with circumstances to disgraceful, and to exceedingly contrary to the behaviour for which the British troops are remarkable, that we are totally at a loss to account for them. On the one hand, it seems surprising how the national character could be forfeited by a particular body, and not by any other part of the army; and on the other, it seems equally surprising why such calumnies (if we suppose them to be so) should have arisen against this particular body and no other part of the army. Such accounts of it, however, were published as raised the indignation of the military charged gentlemen, who thought proper to publish a vindication of themselves. In the Annual Registers, from this expedition hence, next to the gazettes and newspapers, the generality receive what they look upon to be authentic intelligence, the character of this army is treated with the highest asperity. \"In the story of the conquest and recovery of Canara (says the New Annual Register), the Spaniards may be said to be brought a second time upon the scene, but not to sit down in fulness and infold prosperity after all their crimes. The Spaniards of Britain were overtaken in the midst of their career; and he who is more of a man than an Englishman, will rejoice in the irregular and unmeasured, but at the same time the just and merited vengeance that was inflicted upon them by the prince whose dominions they were ravaging!\" In support of this dreadful exclamation the following account is given of the expedition. It began with the putting in execution a design formed by General Matthews of carrying the war into the heart of Hyder Aly's dominions. For this purpose the English invested the city of Onore, situated about 300 miles to the south of Bombay, and one of the principal places in the country of Canara. \"It was taken by assault (says Dr. Andrews) with great slaughter, and plundered with circumstances of avarice and rapine that disgraced the victors; among whom, at the same time, great differences arose concerning the division of the spoil.\" \"No quarter (says the Annual Register) was given by the victorious English; every man they met was put to the sword. Upon this occasion we beg leave to transcribe three lines from the private letter of one of the officers concerned in the expedition. 'The carnage (says he) was great: we trampled thick on the bodies that were thrown in the way. It was rather than owing to humanity; but such are only secondary considerations, and to a soldier, whose bosom glows with heroic glory, they are thought only accidents of course; his zeal makes him aspire after farther victory.' This part of the peninsula had hitherto been untouched by the barbarous and unpitiful hands of Europeans, and of consequence was full of riches and splendour. In the fortresses of Onore were found sums of money to an unknown amount, besides jewels and diamonds.\nA considerable part of this appears to have been secured as private plunder by General Matthews. The complaints of the military were loud; they thought, and naturally, that the acquisition of riches was the fair and reasonable consequence of the perpetration of bloodshed. But their commander turned a deaf ear to their representations; and hastened, by adding new laurels to his fame, to hide the flatterer that might otherwise rest upon him.\n\nFrom Onore the army proceeded to the nearest fortresses on the sea coast, More and Cundapour. Here they were joined by a reinforcement from Bombay under the command of Colonels Macleod and Humberstone, with positive orders to proceed for Bidnure or Hydemanur the capital of Canara. On this General Matthews marched for the mountains called the Ghauts, where there is a pass three miles in length, though only eight feet wide, and which was then strongly fortified and defended by a vast number of the natives. \"The English (say our authors), however, had already obtained a considerable reputation by their executions; and the use of the bayonet, the most fatal instrument of war, and which was employed by them on all occasions, created such an extreme terror in the enemy, as to enable them to surmount this otherwise impregnable defile.\"\n\nThe gaining of this pass laid open the way to Bidnure the capital, to which a summons was now sent. An answer was returned, that the place was ready to submit, provided the inhabitants were not molested, and the governor was permitted to secure his property. The wealth of this city was undoubtedly great, but the estimates of its amount are very different. By the accounts of Bombay it was stated only at 175,000l., while the officers concerned in the expedition say that it was not less than 1,200,000l. or even 1,920,000l.; and even this was only public property; that seized upon by the soldiers, and which belonged to private persons, was undoubtedly very considerable also.\n\nThis treasure was at first thrown by the general to his officers, and declared to belong to the army; but he afterwards told them that it was all the property of the Mohammedan governor, and had been secured to him by the terms of the surrender. It was therefore sent to Cundapour under the convoy of Lieutenant Matthews, brother to the general, to be thence transmitted to Bombay; but whether any part of it ever reached that settlement or not was never known. The discontent of the army were now carried to the utmost height; and the contest became so furious, that Colonels Macleod, Humberstone, and Shaw, quitted the service altogether, and returned to Bombay. The officers charged their general with the most infatuated and shameful aversion; while he, in return, accused his whole army of doing everything disrespectful and injurious to him; of paying no regard to order and discipline, and of becoming loose and unfeeling as the most licentious freebooters.\n\nFrom Bidnure detachments were sent to reduce several fortresses, the principal of which was Anantpore or Anantpore. Here orders were issued for a storm and no quarter. Every man in the place was put to death, except one horseman who made his escape after being wounded in three places. \"The women, unwilling to be separated from their relations, or exposed to the brutal licentiousness of the soldiery, threw themselves in multitudes into the moats with which the fort was surrounded. Four hundred beautiful women, pierced with the bayonet, and expiring in one another's arms, were in this situation treated by the British with every kind of outrage.\"\n\nThis exploit was succeeded by the reduction of Carwa and Mangalore, which completed the reduction of Canara, when General Matthews put his army in cantonments for the rainy season.\n\nThis rapid success was owing to the death of Hyder Ali, which happened in the end of the year 1782. His son Tippoo Saib, however, having taken possession of the government, and settled his affairs as well as time would allow, instantly resumed his military operations. On the 7th of April 1783 he made his appearance before Bidnure, so that General Matthews had scarce time to collect a force of 2000 men, and to write to Bombay for a reinforcement. But, however necessary the latter might have been in his circumstances, the presidency were so much prejudiced against him by the unfavourable reports of his officers, that they suspended him from his commission, appointing Colonel Macleod to succeed to the command of the army.\n\nTippoo Saib now advanced with a vast army, supposed not to be fewer than 150,000 men, covering the hills on each side of the metropolis as far as the eye could reach. The army of General Matthews, altogether unable to cope with such a force, was quickly driven from the town, and forced to take refuge in the citadel. Tippoo having cut off their retreat by gaining possession of the Ghauts, laid close siege to the fortresses; which in less than a fortnight was obliged to capitulate. The terms proposed were, that all public property should remain in the fort; that the English should engage not to act against Tippoo for a stipulated time; that they should march out with the honours of war; that they should pile their arms, and have full liberty to proceed unmolested with their private property to the sea-coast, from thence to embark for Bombay; and in this capitulation the garrisons of Anantpore and other inland fortresses were also included.\n\nAll these terms were broken by Tippoo, who said that they had forfeited their title to liberty by a breach of the articles of capitulation, in embezzling and feigning the public money, which was all, in good faith, to be delivered up. That this was really the case seems to be universally acknowledged. In the Annual Register we are told, that \"to prevent too much money being found in the possession of one man, the general ordered his officers to draw on the paymaster-general for whatever sums they wanted. When the fort was surrendered to the sultan, there was not a single rupee found in it.\" By this circumstance the fate of the garrison was decided. General Matthews was sent for next morning to a conference. He was not, however, admitted to his presence, but immediately thrown into chains. Most of the other principal officers were, on various pretences, separated from the army. The general and his companions were conducted to Seriugapatam the capital of Mylor; and after having experienced a variety of sufferings, were at last put to death by poison. In this manner the general and 20 officers perished.\nperished. The poison administered was the milk of the cocoa-tree, which is said to be very deadly.\n\nThe above account was repeatedly complained of as partial, and at last openly contradicted in a pamphlet entitled \"A Vindication of the Conduct of the English Forces\" employed in that expedition, and published by order of the East India Company. In this pamphlet the circumstance most found fault with was that regarding the women at Anantpore, which was positively contradicted. On this account, therefore, the publishers of the above-mentioned work retract that part of their narrative, as being founded in misrepresentation. Notwithstanding this vindication, however, they still draw the following conclusions. \"It is already sufficiently evident, how little has been effected by this vindication of the Bombay officers. The great outlines of the expedition remain unaltered. It is still true that a remarkable degree of severity was employed in the field; that, in the capture of the fortresses of Canara, the principle of a storm and no quarter was very frequently applied; and that the acquisition of money was too much the governing object in every stage of the undertaking. The vindication of the officers has therefore done them little service; and it happens here, as it generally does in the case of an imperfect reply, that the majority of the facts are rather strengthened and demonstrated by the attempt to refute them. With respect to the conclusion of the story, the treachery of Hyderanagar, and the charge brought against them by Tippoo, that they had broken the terms of the capitulation, and that when the fort was surrendered not a rupee was to be found in it; these circumstances are pallied over by the officers in the profoundest silence. It was this that roused the sultan to vengeance; and it is to this that he appeals for his justification in disregarding a capitulation which had been first dissolved by the vanquished English.\"\n\nThe vindication above alluded to was signed by one major and 52 subaltern officers. It seems not, however, to have given entire satisfaction to the military gentlemen themselves, as other vindications have appeared, said to be written by officers; but these being anonymous, can be supposed to add very little weight to that already mentioned, where such a respectable body have signed their names. We shall therefore drop a subject so disagreeable, and the investigation of which at the same time is entirely foreign to the plan of this work.\n\nIt now remains to give some account of the war with the Mahrattas, begun, as was formerly hinted, on account of the protection afforded to the afflatus Rogahaut-row. This man had formerly obliged the Mogul the Mahrat to take shelter in the English factory at Bengal; but being unable to keep up his credit among his countrymen, was expelled as already related. On his arrival at Bombay, an alliance was formed between him and the English government; by which the latter engaged to replace him in the Mahratta regency in consideration of some valuable cessions of territory. The supreme council of Bengal, however, disowned this treaty, and concluded one with the Mahrattas in the month of March 1776; by which it was agreed that they should provide for Ragobah's subsistence according to his rank, on condition of his residing in their country.\n\nThis being not at all agreeable to Ragobah, he fled once more to Bombay, where a new confederacy was entered into for his restoration. The council of Bengal approved of this on account of the approaching rupture with France; and in consequence of this, a detachment was, in February 1778, ordered to march across the continent of India. By some mismanagement in this expedition, the whole army was obliged to capitulate with the Mahratta general on the 9th of January 1779. One of the terms of the capitulation was, that a body of troops which were advancing on the other side should be obliged to return to Bengal. But General Goddard, the commander of these forces, denying the right of the council of Bengal to remand him, proceeded on his march, and arrived on the 18th of February. Here he received orders to conclude a new treaty, if it could be obtained on easier terms than that of the capitulation, by which it had been engaged to cede all our acquisitions in the country of the Mahrattas.\n\nSuch extreme disregard to any stipulations that could be made, undoubtedly provoked the Mahrattas, and induced them to join in the confederacy with Hyder Aly already mentioned. The war, however, was successfully begun by General Goddard in January 1780. In three months he reduced the whole province of Guzerat. Madajee Scindia the Mahratta general advanced to oppose him; but as he did not choose to venture a battle, the English general stormed his camp, and totally routed him. Other exploits were performed in the course of this campaign; during which the governor-general (Mr Haltings) seeing no hopes of an accommodation, entered into a treaty with the rajah of Gohud, and with his consent Major Popham reduced a fortress in his dominions named Quallah, garrisoned by the Mahrattas, and hitherto reckoned impregnable.\n\nThese successes were followed by the dreadful incursions of Hyder Aly already related, which put a stop to the conquests of General Goddard; all the forces he could spare being required to assist the army under Sir Eyre Coote. The last exploit of General Goddard was the reduction of the island of Salsette, and of a strong fortress named Baffin in its neighbourhood. The army of Scindia, consisting of 30,000 men, was also defeated this year by Colonel Carnac; and the Mahrattas, threatened by their losses, consented to a separate peace with the English, leaving Hyder Aly to manage the war as he thought proper.\n\nIn the mean time, however, the expenses incurred by these wars were so high, that Mr Haltings, who was obliged to furnish them some how or other, was reduced to the greatest difficulties. For this purpose not only all the treasure of Bengal was exhausted, but it was found necessary to draw extraordinary contributions from the British allies, which was productive of many disagreeable circumstances. One of the most remarkable was the revolt of Benares. The rajah of this country had formerly put himself under the protection of the English, who on their part agreed to secure his dominions to him on condition of his paying an annual subsidy to the nabob of Oude. In 1770 the rajah died, and was succeeded by his son Chait Singh, who held the sovereignty at the time we speak of. On the death of the nabob in 1775, a new treaty was made with his successor.\nsuccessor, by which the sovereignty of Benares was transferred to the East India Company, an acquisition equivalent to \u00a340,000 per annum; at the same time that the subsidy paid by Sujah Dowlah, and which, by Lord Clive, had been fixed at \u00a336,000, and afterwards raised to \u00a352,000, was now augmented to \u00a312,000 per annum.\n\nOn receiving intelligence in July 1778, that war had actually commenced between France and England, Chit Sing was required to pay \u00a350,000 as his share of the public burdens. Such a demand was paid with extreme reluctance on the part of a prince who already contributed \u00a340,000, and probably thought that an abundant equivalent for the protection enjoyed. The same requisition, however, was made the two succeeding years, but with a promise that the demand should cease when peace was restored. Instead of any present alleviation, however, a body of troops was also quartered upon him, and he was likewise obliged to pay for their maintenance, lest he should not voluntarily pay the additional \u00a350,000. In November 1780, in addition to all these demands, he was also required to send into the field such a body of horse as he could spare; but this requisition, owing to some misunderstanding, was never complied with.\n\nIn July 1781 Mr Hastings having, it is said, received some intelligence that the oppressed rajah meditated rebellion, set out on a visit to the nabob of Oude, and in his way proposed to clear up the misunderstanding with him. The method by which he intended to clear up this misunderstanding was to lay a fine upon the poor prince of \u00a340,000 or \u00a350,000; and as a reason for doing so, it was alleged that the late rajah had left a million sterling in his treasury; a sum which was continually increasing. Chit Sing advanced to the borders of his territories to meet the governor-general, behaved with all imaginable submission; and having got private intelligence of what was meditated against him, offered to pay down \u00a320,000. This was refused; and the governor-general having reached the capital, forbade the rajah his presence, and by a letter acquainted him with his causes of complaint. Chit Sing sent a very submissive answer; but as he endeavoured to exculpate himself, Mr Hastings was so far from being satisfied, that he put the prince under an arrest.\n\nSuch an unheard-of proceeding excited the utmost surprize and resentment in subjects accustomed to regard their sovereign with a degree of reverence little short of adoration. On the very day of the arrest they assembled tumultuously, cut in pieces the guard which had been set on the palace, and carried off their prince in triumph. It does not appear, however, that this was any other than a transitory tumult; for though they could easily have cut off the governor-general, they made no attempt against him. Chit Sing protested his innocence, and made the most unlimited offers of submission, but all in vain. His government was declared vacant, and the zemindary bestowed on the next heir; the annual subsidy to the government of Bengal was augmented from \u00a340,000 to \u00a350,000 annually. The miserable rajah was forced to fly his country; and his mother, though promised leave to retire upon conditions, was attacked in her retreat and plundered by the soldiery. After all his endeavours to procure money, however, Mr Hastings found this adventure turn out much less profitable than he had expected; for the treasury of the fugitive prince was seized and retained by the soldiery.\n\nAs to the nabob of Oude, a new treaty was concluded with him; the design of which was evidently to cede the nabob of some of the burdens to which he was at that time of Oude subjected. Part of the British troops were therefore withdrawn from his dominions. As Fizulla Khan, the most prosperous of his dependents, had been called upon to furnish a body of 5000 horse to join the nabob's army, and had not complied with the requisition, the guarantee of his treaty with the nabob, formerly executed, was withdrawn; but it being afterwards discovered that his territory was not equivalent to the claims of the governor, the treaty was renewed on payment of a slight fine. As the widow of Sujah Dowlah was suspected of favouring the late rajah Chit Sing, the reigning prince was allowed to reclaim the treasures of his father in her possession, on condition of paying her a certain stipulated allowance annually. The treasures were seized as payment of the debts of the prince to the company.\n\nHostilities continued in India between the French and English till the year 1783 was far advanced, and long after tranquillity had been restored to other parts of the world. In the beginning of the season for action the governor and council of Bengal determined to send an ample supply to the presidency of Madras, that they might be enabled to put an end to the war, which Tipoo seemed willing to prosecute with even more vigour than his father had done. For this purpose Sir Eyre Coote, who, for his health, had gone to Bengal by sea, fell once more for Madras, being intrusted with a large sum of money for the necessary expenses of the war. In his passage he was chased for forty-eight hours by two French men of war. The solicitude and fatigue he underwent during this time, being almost constantly upon deck, occasioned a relapse, so that he died in two days after his arrival at Madras. His death was greatly lamented, as the greatest expectations had been formed of a happy conclusion being put to the war by his extraordinary military talents, for which he had already acquired so great a reputation in India.\n\nThe invasion of Tipoo's dominions having called him off from the Carnatic, General Stuart took the opportunity of attacking him in another quarter. Colonel Fullarton was despatched with a large body of troops to invade the province of Coimbatore. This he executed with great success; overrunning the country, taking several fortresses, and making a very alarming diversion on this side of Tipoo's dominions. General Stuart, however, having still greater designs in view, was obliged to recall this gentleman in the midst of his successes. The siege of the strong fortress of Cuddalore was the operation which now engaged his attention. It was now become the principal place of arms belonging to the French; was strongly fortified, and garrisoned by a numerous body of the best troops in France, as well as a considerable number of Tipoo's choicest forces. The siege therefore proved so difficult, that though the English displayed the utmost valour and military skill, they were not able to reduce the place until hostilities were interrupted by the news of a general pacification having taken place in Europe.\nthis siege a remarkable circumstance took place, viz. that of a corps of Sepoy grenadiers encountering and overcoming the French troops opposed to them with fixed bayonets. For this remarkable instance of valour, they not only received the highest applause at the time, but provision was made for themselves and families by the prejudices to which they belonged.\n\nAfter the reduction of Hyderabadd, and the destruction of the army under General Matthews, the English possessed only three places of consequence in the kingdom of Canara. These were Mangalore, Onore, and Carwa. The siege of all these places was undertaken at once. Mangalore, the principal port in the country, was defended by a very numerous garrison under Major Campbell. Tippoo sat down before it on the 19th of May; and the attack and defence were both conducted with the greatest spirit and activity. Notwithstanding the utmost efforts of the besiegers, however, and that the garrison were reduced to the last extremity for want of provisions, they held out in spite of every difficulty, until the general pacification being concluded, the place was afterwards delivered up. In other parts nothing more happened than an indecisive engagement between M. Suffren and Admiral Hughes; so that the British empire in Bengal was for that time fully established, and continued un molested by foreign enemies, till the ambition of Tippoo Saib again prompted him to invade the territories of the nabob, an ally of Britain. This again brought on a war with that restless, but able prince; in this war the British were joined by the Mahrattas, and the conduct of it was entrusted to Lord Cornwallis.\n\nAmong the various usurpers who suddenly rose to the rank of sovereign princes on the fall of the Mogul empire, Hyder Aly was the most successful. A master in dissimulation and treachery, he laboured, while in a humble station, to acquire the confidence of his superiors, that he might the more completely betray them. These qualities, so necessary to a successful usurper, were in time accompanied with considerable military skill, and great talents for government. Hence the power which he at first so treacherously obtained, was soon augmented by fresh acquisitions; and the territories which he conquered were governed with a systematic arrangement and rigorous justice, which speedily augmented their population, and increased his own resources.\n\nHis son, Tippoo Sultan, though far inferior to his father in the art of government, in moderation, and in the general steadiness of his character, was, however, distinguished in India as an excellent officer and intrepid warrior; qualities which effectually secured him the confidence of his troops. The operation of the system established by his father, and the warlike complexion of his own character, continued to support the general prosperity of his dominions, which were enlarged on all sides by conquests from his neighbours, and were strengthened by a great number of the most impregnable fortresses in the peninsula.\n\nHence the power of the Mysoorean kings, which in its rise had been often contested, and sometimes defeated by the Mahrattas, at last acquired a decided ascendancy in the south of India. The discipline and fidelity of their troops, till their late aggressions on the British, had constantly been increasing in reputation; and fully evinced the excellent regulations which had been established for the army. The government of both princes was strict; that of the last, violent and arbitrary. It was still, however, the despotism of an able and warlike sovereign, who may rigorously check, but does not destroy those subjects which must form the means of his future aggrandisement.\n\nFrom these causes the extensive territory of the Mysores and its dependencies had not, in the course of many years, suffered materially, either from insurrection or external invasion\u2014a felicity but rarely experienced in any quarter of India. When they were invaded by the British and their allies, under the conduct of Lord Cornwallis, the whole country was found in a high state of cultivation, and filled with inhabitants. The regular army consisted of 70,000 men; and the troops employed in the garrisons, in the police, and in the collection of revenue, amounted, by the most authentic accounts, to twice that number. This vast establishment was to completely furnished with artillery in the numerous forts, and in the field, that upwards of 400 cannon were found in the outskirts of the capital alone. The most frequent bar to the efficiency of native armies, is the want of regular pay: an obstacle the provident sultan had removed, by gradually amassing vast treasures, which he secured in the forts, or in the capital; and by improving his revenue, which amounted annually to upwards of three millions sterling.\n\nThe power and resources of the Mysoorean dominions, thus formidable in themselves, cannot be fairly estimated, unless we take into account their advantageous position and the character of the sovereign. Lying in the heart of the Deccan, and strengthened by innumerable forts, they command the adjoining frontiers of all their neighbours; while the restless and enterprising spirit of the prince has long obliged all around him to keep in a state of constant military preparation, to them nearly as expensive as that of actual war. Few years were sufficient to elapse, in which their territories were not either menaced or actually invaded. The open and defenceless frontier of the Carnatic was frequently the object of these incursions; and the territory of our ally, the nabob of Arcot, had often suffered devastations that are still remembered with horror. The British, who were bound by treaty to be the protectors of this prince, had their own territories plundered extensively; and, on one occasion, had been forced to submit to an ignominious peace, which was dictated to them at the gates of Madras.\n\nThe French officers in India, many of whom had influence of long been entertained in the service of Tippoo, had the French communicated to his policy that marked hostility against the British nation, by which it was to peculiarly differ. A splendid embassy, which had been dispatched to France, returned previous to 1789, before the breaking out of the late war; which must be regarded as the commencement of a regular system of hostility for the entire overthrow of the British power in the east.\n\nAlthough the events of the French revolution operated to divert their attention from prosecuting the objects of this new alliance, the power of Tippoo had become so formidable to the British government, that the revenues of Madras and Bombay were inadequate to support the forces necessary for their defence. Large supplies\nsupplies both of troops and of money were required from Europe; and experience had fully proved, that unless the power of the kings of Mylore was reduced, the British possessions in the east could not be retained without incurring an annual loss to the state.\n\nHappily the power, talents, and ambition of the present sultan were fully known to the whole of India. His views of universal conquest had alarmed all the native powers of the peninsula; and both the Nizam and the Mahrattas were roused to combine for their own defence. Tippoo was the first Mohammedan prince, since the establishment of the Mogul empire, who openly disclaimed the authority of the king of Delhi, or Great Mogul. He was the first also to impress coin with his own titles; a mark of disrespect which none of the native governments had ever shewn. The great zeal which he adopted soon after his father's death, and which he affixed to all his public deeds, declared him to be \"the messenger of the true faith,\" and announced his ambition to appear as a prophet as well as conqueror. In the spirit of eastern vanity, he not only declared himself the greatest king on earth, but announced himself to be the restorer of the Mohammedan faith; and to avail himself of the enthusiasm of his sect, he invites all true Mussulmans to join his standard, and not only to drive the European infidels out of India, but to establish the empire of Mohammed over the world.\n\nAn ambition so openly avowed, and to an extent so inordinate, created immediate alarm among the native powers of India. It rendered an union peculiarly necessary between the Nizam and the Mahrattas; states who differed in religion, in government, and in every point of interest, except that fear, which combined them against this powerful adversary, who was ever ready to attack them, and who, in fact, already commanded their southern frontier.\n\nThe policy of the British, who had earlier foreseen the danger, led them to adopt a still more vigorous preparation than the native powers. Four additional regiments had been raised in Europe, and sent to India under General Abercromby and Colonel Muirgrave; and as early as 1788, there were in that country thirteen European battalions, consisting of 8000 men, besides the troops in the company's establishment. Earl Cornwallis, and several of the first officers in the British service, were appointed to command them, under a new system, by which the powers of the governor-general and commander in chief were united in the same person. Thus the counteraction of different authorities was avoided, and every advantage secured which might give efficiency to the operations of warfare.\n\nHappily for the execution of those views of defence, the climate of the Mylore, like all the central parts of the peninsula of India, is temperate and healthy, in a degree superior to that of any other region of the globe lying within the tropics. The monsoons which deluge the coasts of Malabar and Coromandel, have their force broken as they approach the high mountains of the interior, where they fall out in showers, which, though heavy, are not commonly of long continuance. The verdure of the country is thus preserved; and the temperature of the climate is moderated throughout almost the whole year. The British army was therefore able to remain constantly in the field, during the whole war; and although they did not enter into cantonments, or leave their tents, yet the health of the troops did not materially suffer.\n\nThe military operations against Tippoo may therefore be divided into campaigns, not so much from the change of season, as from the success or failure of the British against Tippoo. Several plans of attack that were carried on against that prince. The first campaign commenced in the month of June 1790, and was directed to the southern part of the peninsula, with a view to relieve the rajah of Travancore, whose country had already been attacked by the sultan. During it, the main army was commanded by General Meadows; and before the end of the year, it effected the reduction of his rich provinces below the mountains; while the Bombay troops, under General Abercromby, conquered the valuable districts below the Ghauts on the west and north, as far as the river Balipatnam.\n\nThe second campaign was carried on by Earl Cornwallis in the heart of Tippoo's dominions. Though unsuccessful in effecting its ultimate object, it was distinguished by the capture of the important fortresses of Bangalore in the interior of the country; an event which fixed the seat of war in the enemy's territory, and was decisive of its final success. A successful battle was also fought in the vicinity of Seringapatam; and a demonstration made against that capital, which, from the advanced season and the swelling of the Cavery, proved abortive.\n\nThe last failure, which must in part be ascribed to the delay of the Mahratta armies, and the want of provisions, was speedily followed by the arrival of these allies, and by preparations for a fresh campaign. As these new efforts completely humbled the sultan, and produced a successful termination of hostilities, it is necessary to detail them more particularly.\n\nThe season of the year, which, after the battle in 1791, prevented an immediate attack of Seringapatam, was also unfavourable to the numerous draught cattle belonging to the army. They were infected with an epidemic disorder, which was aggravated by famine, and killed them in vast numbers; while the remainder, from disease and hunger, became unfit for service. Meanwhile the scarcity of grain, of arrack, and every article of subsistence, daily increased; this scarcity became at last so urgent, that the camp followers, which in India are four times as numerous as the fighting men, were reduced to the necessity of devouring the putrid flesh of the dead bullocks; and to add to all these calamities, the smallpox unfortunately raged in the camp.\n\nSimilar distresses were suffered by the Bombay army, who, with infinite labour, had dragged their artillery for 50 miles through the most steep and difficult passes, in order to co-operate with Lord Cornwallis. Unable to form a junction, from the swelling of the Cavery and the badness of the roads, they were compelled to retrace their steps over those vast woody mountains, which form the immense and impregnable barrier between the kingdom of Mylore and the Malabar coast. In this perilous retreat, the battering train of both armies was unavoidably lost, being too unwieldy to be moved by the small portion of draught cattle which now survived; upwards of 40,000 had already perished since the commencement of the campaign. Disappointed\nDisappointed of the relief and assistance which the junction of the Bombay troops might have afforded, the position of the main army became a scene of the greatest distress. The tents and clothing of the troops, as well as their provisions, were nearly worn out. Great part of the horses of the cavalry were so far reduced by want and fatigue, that they were unable to carry their riders. The ground at Caniambaddy, where it had encamped for a few days to favour the junction, or to protect the retreat, of General Abercromby, was covered to an extent of several miles, with the carcases of the cattle and horses; and the last sight of the gun carriages, carts, and stores of the battering train, left in flames, was the melancholy spectacle which the troops beheld, as they pattered along, on quitting this deadly camp.\n\nFortunately for them in this dreadful situation, they were met, before they had finished the first day's march, by the allied force of the Mahrattas, under Purieram Bow and Hurry Punt. Every despatch sent to these chiefs had been intercepted by the vigilance of the enemy. They were astonished when they learned the disasters which had been occasioned by their delay; their arrival, which convinced their sincerity in the cause, produced general satisfaction in the British camp, and a conviction, that the ruin of the sultan, though delayed, must now become certain and inevitable. Tipoo himself, on seeing his enemies firm and active in their union, was not insensible to the dangers that awaited him. Before the allied armies left the vicinity of his capital to forward their preparations for a new campaign, he made overtures to Lord Cornwallis for the conclusion of a peace; but that nobleman would listen to no terms of accommodation in which his allies were not included, and which were not preceded by the release of all the prisoners that had been detained during the present and former wars.\n\nThe arrival of the Mahratta troops, amounting to 32,000 cavalry, however fortunate it might be deemed at the critical moment in which it happened, brought little additional effective strength to the allied army. Their battalions were unwieldy, irregular, and ill-disciplined; their force had declined as much as Tipoo's had advanced in improvement; and they were at present far inferior to those troops who, under Madha Row, had defeated Hyder Aly in 1772. Their chiefs were, however, overjoyed that they had effected a junction nearly on the spot where that signal victory had been obtained. They were pleased at having met the British army without having occasion to try their strength singly with Tipoo, of whose discipline and abilities in the field they entertained a deep apprehension.\n\nTo avoid confusion and interference, they were encamped at a distance from the British troops. Their ground, from the number of followers, and their families, had the appearance of a large town, or of a whole nation emigrating from its territory. The tents of the chiefs are placed around their general's, without any regularity or order. They are of all dimensions, and of every variety of colour, resembling hovels rather than canvas. The streets, winding and crooking in every direction, present the appearance of a great fair; in which smiths, jewellers, merchants, and mechanics, are displaying their wares, and as busily employed in their trades, as if they lived in their own capital, and enjoyed a profound peace.\n\nThe state of their artillery, upon which modern warfare so much depends, will at once demonstrate the imperfection of the military system among the Mahratta peasantry. In the construction of their gun carriages, they India make little use of iron, but for their strength they trust to the bulk and solidity of the timber: Hence they are General unwieldy from their weight, and clumsy beyond all belief; the wheels, in particular, are heavy and low, being formed of large solid pieces of wood united together. The guns themselves are ponderous in the extreme, and of the most irregular dimensions; each is painted in a fantastic manner, and bears the name of some one of their gods. Not a few are dragged after the army long after they have ceased to be serviceable, from the great dilapidation they are held in, on account of past achievements which they are supposed to have performed for the state. Some of these useless impediments of a march are dragged along at the immense expense of 100, and sometimes 150 draught cattle yoked in pairs. The most insurmountable obstacle to the efficiency of the Mahratta artillery, was the scarcity of ammunition with which they were provided at this period; subsequent improvements have enlarged this supply, and rendered them far more formidable to their enemies.\n\nThe infantry of this nation holds a rank, if possible, still more contemptible than their artillery. Its officers are half-caste Portuguese or French; and the privates consist of outcasts of every description, who are uniform in nothing but in the wretched condition of their muskets, ammunition, and accoutrements. The Mahrattas themselves hold them in contempt, ride through them on the march, without ceremony, or even the appearance of respect. If there happen to be a few Europeans among the officers and men, which in these times was but seldom the case, they execute the service, and till they find an opportunity of escape continue to deplore their fate.\n\nThe cavalry is the favourite portion of a Mahratta army; and it is to his horses, and the bazars, that the attention of every chief is almost solely directed. On marching days, the baggage and infantry move off at daybreak, while the chiefs and their principal followers remain upon the ground smoking their hookahs till they have advanced some miles; they then follow, each pursuing his own route, attended by his principal people; while the inferior ranks disperse over the country to plunder and forage in every direction.\n\nThe troops of the Nizam at this period joined Lord Cornwallis and the Mahrattas; their state of equipment and discipline was almost in every respect as bad as that of the Mahrattas. Their forces, when united, amounted to about 80,000 men; and if to these be added four times the number of camp followers, baniaries, and the carriage department, the number of strangers to be subsisted in the Mysore alone, cannot be much less than half a million. That no distrust, jealousy, or counteraction, should have disturbed the combined operations of such an immense multitude, must be ascribed to the unexampled moderation and vigilance conduct of the commander in chief. Such a vast army had never taken the field in India in the British cause;\ncaus\u00e9; yet no murmurs, or even the slightest appearance of distrust, were ever manifested by the allies towards the British commander. They submitted with implicit confidence not only to his arrangements in carrying on the war; but, which was little to be expected among allies so much alive to their particular interests, they acquiesced in his distribution of the conquered territories with a deference which evinced the most perfect confidence in his liberality and justice.\n\nThe steady cooperation, however, of any native power with the British army in the field, is a circumstance hardly to be looked for, and must therefore prove a resource on which no commander would choose to rely. His patience will often be severely tried by their irregularities and delays; and in the most critical emergencies his views may be frustrated by their want of punctuality, or by a total failure in their engagements. Even in the article of provisions, the presence of the native armies, bating the temporary relief at their first junction, proved a much greater annoyance than a benefit; for it increased the number of mouths to be supplied, in a country defoliated by its friends as well as by the hostile armies.\n\nWith these coadjutors, Lord Cornwallis set out in the month of June, towards Bangalore. He determined on a new and circuitous route, northward by Naggemgumulam, that he might accomplish some of the important objects necessary to enable the confederates to commence another campaign. He had to enable the Mahrattas to withdraw the pows, which they had left on their march, when they advanced from Poonah towards Serigapatnam. He had to confine the sultan to as small a portion of his territory as practicable, and thus to oblige him to consume the provisions which he had laid up for the defence of his capital; and, lastly, he had to gain time for collecting and bringing forward the vast stores of camp equipage, provisions, and supplies, which he had ordered for the succeeding campaign.\n\nIn order to facilitate the communication between the Mysore and the Carnatic, from which the supplies were chiefly to be drawn; the various hill forts, which command the different passes, were to be reduced. Many of these fortresses, from their situation upon high and precipitous rocks, are of such strength that they have always been deemed impregnable by the native armies of India. In ancient times they formed the inaccessible retreats of the rajahs who still retained their independence; and it was not till the vigorous administration of Tippoo and his father, that they were brought into subjection and garrisoned by the Mysoorean troops.\n\nAmong these forts, Savendroog, Chittledroog, and Kifnaghury, are the most remarkable in point of natural strength. The first of these consists of a vast mountainous rock, which rises above half a mile in perpendicular height above its own base, which covers a space of eight or ten miles in circumference. This rock is surrounded by walls on every side, and defended by crosiers wherever it was deemed accessible. Towards the upper part, the immense pile is almost precipitous, and has the farther advantage of being divided on the top into two hills, which have each their defences, and are capable of being maintained independent of the garrison in the lower works.\n\nTo the siege of this tremendous fortress, Lieutenant-colonel Stewart commanding the right wing of the main army was appointed. The attempt commenced on the 10th of December, when this officer pitched his camp within three miles of the north side of the rock. The formidable appearance of the place itself, had with Savendroog drawn the attention of the troops from a circumstance which proved on trial the chief obstacle to the execution of their arduous attempt. It consisted in the formation of a gun road from the camp to the foot of the mountain. This was found a work of incredible labour, since it led through a long tract of rocky hills, thickly planted with bamboos; and after every effort, the battering guns were still to be dragged over rocks of considerable height, and at an ascent almost perpendicular.\n\nThis celebrated rock, so difficult of approach, and of such immense strength, is no less famed for a noxious atmosphere, occasioned by the hills and immense tracts of wood by which it is surrounded; the appellation of Savendroog, or Rock of death, is said to have been given it, from the noxious and fatal nature of its climate. Tippoo Sultan, sensible of all its advantages, congratulated his army on the infatuation of the British which had at last led them to an enterprise which would speedily operate their disgrace, and terminate in their ruin. One half of the Europeans, he assured, would be destroyed by disease, and the other half he was confident would be killed in the assault. The garrison which Tippoo had selected for the station of Savendroog were of the same sentiments with their master: regarding the attempt to reduce it as madness, they fortunately trusted more to its strength, than to their own exertions for its defence; and hence, little or no opposition was made to the erection of our batteries, farther than the ill-directed fire of their artillery produced.\n\nIn three days, during which it was found necessary to advance the batteries nearer to the wall, a practicable breach was effected, and a lodgment made for the troops within twenty yards of the breach. The storming party, which consisted chiefly of Europeans, was led by Lieutenant-colonel Niblet, and was divided into four different parties of attack, in order to secure both hills into which the mountain was divided, and to distract the attention of the enemy. Each party succeeded in gaining its object; for a large body of the enemy who were seen in the morning coming down for the defence of the breach, on observing the Europeans advancing to the storm, was seized with a panic, and fled. The eastern hill immediately above the breach, was carried by Captain Gage, without meeting, or even overtaking, the enemy; the main body of which endeavoured to gain the western hill, and, had they effected their object, the siege must have recommenced. Happily, however, the pathway leading from the breach to this hill is so steep and narrow that the fugitives impeded each other, and the assailants pressed them so hard, that they entered the different batteries along with the enemy. In these numbers were killed, among whom was the second killadar; and the citadel on the summit of the hill was at last gained, where the first killadar was made prisoner. So close and critical was the pursuit...\non this fortunate occasion, that a sergeant of the 71st regiment, when at some distance, shot the man who was in the act of shutting the first gate; and upon this occurrence, almost accidental, the fate of the citadel hinged. It was instantly taken, without the loss of a single man; although an hundred of the enemy had been killed during the advance, and many had perished by falling from the precipices in endeavouring to escape. Only one private soldier was wounded in this remarkable assault of the impregnable fortress of Saverdroog: it formed a display of successful prowess, fortunate almost beyond example; and it exhibited before the enemy, in open day, an instance of intrepidity, of high value to the reputation of the army and the interests of the India government.\n\nThe beneficial consequences of this important capture, were sensibly felt at the different forts, almost impregnable, by which this part of the country is so remarkably strengthened. Colonel Stewart's detachment, which had been so much distinguished by this achievement, marched in two days against Outredroog, another fortress strengthened by five different walls, and so steep as to prove tenable by a handful of men against the largest army. After the refusal of a summons to surrender, the lower fort was escaladed with such rapidity, that the killadar requested a parley. While this was in agitation, an appearance of treachery was discovered in the upper fort, where the garrison were seen moving and pointing their guns against the assailants. Fired at this sight, Lieutenant M'Innes led on the storming party with impetuosity; some of the gates were instantly broken, others were escaladed, till five or six different walls on the face of the steep rock were passed, when the troops gained the summit, and put the garrison to the sword. So panic-struck were the enemy, when they saw a single European above the walls, that they could make no resistance. The killadar was made prisoner, a number of the garrison was killed, and not a few, terrified at the approach of Europeans with their bayonets, are said to have precipitated themselves from the rocks.\n\nThe assault of these fortresses, which had hitherto been deemed impregnable, made so serious an impression on the enemy, that in none of the hill forts, however inaccessible, did they afterwards make an attempt to resist the British troops. Hence, the strong mountainous country between Bangalore and Seringapatam, which, studded with forts, had so much checked all communication, now afforded security to the convoys. These now reached the army without opposition; and the supplies of warlike stores of every description were as completely re-established as they had been at the beginning of the last campaign.\n\nTo prevent any future scarcity of the great article of grain, the commander-in-chief encouraged the native brigadiers, a class of men whose employment is purchasing grain where it is cheap, and selling it to the army. By constantly affording regular payment and a good price to these native merchants, they supplied the camp to an extent far exceeding what could ever be furnished by the most extensive carriage establishment. The grain-dealers had at this time passes for no less than 50,000 bullocks, whose rice was instantly paid for, as soon as it reached the camp, and orders given for purchasing more from whatever quarter it could be procured. This brought forth the resources of the enemies country as well as our own; for several of Tippoo's brigadiers, tempted by the certainty of payment and a high price, sold their rice in the British camp.\n\nSupplies being thus provided to an extent far exceeding every former example, the allied armies, and another the different detachments, were ordered to assemble for another campaign. The Bombay troops, destined again to act from the same quarter as last season, marched from Cananore, and arrived at the foot of the Poodicherry Ghaut in the month of December. Several weeks of hard labour were necessary to drag the artillery through woods extending near 60 miles, and over mountains of immense height. These mountains, which on the west command a view of the Malabar coast, and on the east of the country of the Myfore, form an elevated ridge towering into the clouds, on which the rivers are seen taking their rise, and flowing in different directions, till they reach the eastern and western shores of the peninsula. The friendly territory of the Coorga rajah surrounds the interior of this formidable pass, where a small opposition might bid defiance to a whole army. This circumstance enabled the Bombay troops, consisting of 8,400 men, with all their baggage and artillery, and a supply of rice for 40 days, to penetrate with safety into the Myfore frontier, which they reached on the 22nd of January 1792. To facilitate the return of our army, batteries were constructed, and the defence of this pass committed to Lieutenant-colonel Pech\u00e9 with 300 men, a precaution which had not the sultan overlooked, he would have suffered no invasion on this quarter of his dominions.\n\nThe Mahratta forces, which had separated from the main army at Bangalore, had spent the season of the monsoon in a train of exploits which seemed to imply more than their usual share of activity. With the affluence of the Bombay detachment of three native battalions, they took the important post of Simoga, after defeating Reza Saib and near 10,000 of the sultan's cavalry. This brilliant success encouraged Purferran Bow to engage in an enterprise against Bednore, which had nearly frustrated the whole plan of the campaign, by protracting his junction with General Abercromby beyond the stipulated time. From this attempt, however, he was diverted by the arrival of Cummerud Deen Khan, one of Tippoo's best generals, who had been dispatched against him. This chieftain retook the fort of Simoga; but being too weak to encounter the Bow in the field, the Mahrattas effected their junction with the Bombay army, though somewhat later than the appointed season. The main army under Lord Cornwallis, which had been so actively employed during the rains in subduing the hill forts, and in collecting the necessary stores and reinforcements, was ordered ultimately to assemble at Outredroog, one of the strongest of Tippoo's forts, which was situated within 50 miles of his capital. This place, being equally spacious and strong, was fitted up as a general hospital, and formed into a magazine for the grain and public stores that were not immediately needed for the army. The battering train under Colonel Duff, and the last convoys under Colonel Floyd, having safely joined, the main army was at last fully prepared to resume its enterprises against...\nagainst the sultan, who, in imitation of his father, when formerly attacked in 1767, had encamped with the whole of his force in a strong position under the walls of his capital.\n\nOne junction more was still expected; that of the Nizam or Soubah from Gurrumcondah, the lower fort of which he had captured. This prince having left a strong force to garrison the place, marched again to meet Lord Cornwallis, who was detained in expectation of this event for several days beyond the time he had appointed for leaving Outredroog. On the 25th of January, the young prince at last arrived with his army; his youth and inexperience were put under the guidance of a minister 60 years of age, a man of great talents and established reputation. The confederacy, which thus united the chief powers in the peninsula for the overthrow of a formidable and ambitious enemy, was attended also by an ambassador, who arrived at this time, from Madajee Boonila the rajah of Berar. The Pehwa and the Nizam were themselves in the field on their respective frontiers, and all India looked with anxious expectation to the event of this important campaign.\n\nOn the 1st of February the allied armies marched from Hocleadroog, the last hill fort of which they had taken possession, lying at the distance of only 40 miles from Seringapatam. Tippoo's cavalry, which had been sent out to harass them on the march, made little impression, and were therefore chiefly occupied in burning the intermediate villages, and in laying waste the country. The last march of the 5th of February, stretched across a range of barren hills lying six miles north-east of Seringapatam. From these heights, a view of the whole city was presented to the army, and the encampment of the sultan under its walls. Every circumstance was eagerly viewed by our troops; and, from the sultan's position, it was evident he meant to defend the place in person, and to make it the grand concluding scene of the war.\n\nThe camp of the allies was pitched on the north side of the island. The British formed the front line, and extended its whole length on both sides of the Lockany, a small river which at this place flows into the Cavery. The reserve was placed a mile in the rear, to afford space for the baggage and stores; and the Nizam and Mahrattas were stationed still farther in the rear, to prevent interference with the British camp.\n\nOpposite to Seringapatam, on both sides of the river, a large space is inclosed by a bound hedge which marks the limits of the capital, and affords a refuge to the peasants during the incursions of cavalry. Tippoo's front line, or fortified camp, lay immediately behind this hedge, where it was defended by heavy cannon in the redoubts, and by a large field train advantageously placed. In this line there were 100 pieces of artillery, and in the fort and island which formed his second line there were above thrice that number. The redoubts on his left were entrusted to two of his best officers, and a corps of Europeans commanded by Monsieur Vigie; Sheik Anfar, a general of established reputation, was stationed on the right, and the Carighaut hill; while Tippoo himself commanded the centre, having his tent pitched in the sultan's redoubt. The fort and island, where there was the greatest number of guns, were entrusted to Syed Saib and other commanders. The whole army of the sultan, thus stationed, consisted of about 50,000 men.\n\nEver since the junction of the allied armies, Tippoo finding he could not keep the field, employed his chief attention, and the labours of his main army, in fortifying this camp, and in strengthening his defences in the fort and island. The country had already been laid waste in the former campaign; and the sultan seemed to rest his hopes, that the strength of his works and the valour of his army would protract the siege, till the want of supplies, or the approach of the monsoon, would again force his enemies to abandon their enterprise, as they had been compelled to do on former occasions.\n\nImpressed with these ideas, Tippoo made no attempt to interrupt our reconnoitring parties, who had been busily employed on the first day after their arrival in examining his camp. The distance of our position, and the absence of the armies under General Abercromby and Purseram Bow, increased his security; for he did not imagine that Lord Cornwallis would venture to attack him without their affluence; far less could he believe that a fortified camp, defended by the guns of his capital and a powerful army, would be attempted by infantry alone, without guns, and in the uncertainty of night.\n\nThe promptitude and spirit of Lord Cornwallis had suggested far different ideas, and a plan of attack which was bold beyond even the expectations of his own army. On the evening of the fifth of February, just after the troops had left the parade, orders were issued for an attack at 7 o'clock on the enemy's camp and lines in three divisions. The British camp was left to be defended by the artillery and cavalry; while the assailants who were instantly furnished with guides and scaling ladders, marched in perfect confidence that muskets alone would prove the fittest instruments for opening their way into the enemy's camp.\n\nNo part in the execution of this bold enterprise was assigned to the troops of the allies; nor was the intended assault even communicated to them, till after the columns had marched. It was perhaps good policy to conceal from them a measure so repugnant to all their maxims of war, and in which they could not possibly take part. This opinion seems justified by the surprize and consternation which they displayed, on learning that Lord Cornwallis, like a common soldier, was personally to lead the attack on the enemy's fortified camp. They not only deemed his success impossible, but they dreaded that the ruin of the allied armies would be involved in the attempt.\n\nThe three columns into which the assailants had been divided, marched with equal intrepidity to execute the different objects that had been allotted them; many obstacles intervened; various conflicts ensued in different quarters of the enemy's camp; each party was uncertain of the fate of the rest, and each individual of his associates. The return of day at last removed their fears and uncertainty, by disclosing the complete success which had crowned their exertions throughout the whole line of attack.\n\nThe right column commanded by General Meadows had met with more impediments than the rest; it attacked and carried the end gal, a redoubt on the enemies\nmies left, which was defended by eight guns, and a numerous garrison, nearly 500 of which fell in this attack. Considerable loss was also sustained by the British in this redoubt. After its capture, the column was again formed in its original order, and marched with a view to support the centre under Lord Cornwallis; but mistaking the proper track, and making too wide a circuit, it reached the Carighaut hill on the enemy's right, which had already been carried by Col. Maxwell.\n\nThe centre column about 11 o'clock forced through the bound hedges, amidst a heavy fire from the sultan's redoubt and Tippoo's lines. These, however, were also forced. The troops were now enabled to cross the river, and penetrate into the island. So closely did they press upon the fugitives, that they would have entered the citadel along with them, but for the precaution of raising the drawbridge, which they had drawn up at the moment of entering the place. So precipitately had Tippoo been forced to abandon his tent in the sultan's redoubt, that his silver sticks, pikes, and mathematical instruments, were found scattered in the place. The fort being inaccessible from the removal of the bridge, the advanced party forced into the town or pettah, which had been almost abandoned for the defence of the batteries. Here they found 27 half-starved Europeans, loaded with irons, and confined in a dungeon. Some of these unhappy men, who were now relieved, had been cruelly given up to Tippoo by Admiral Suffren; others were deserters, whom Tippoo, however, had treated with equal severity.\n\nThe left division of the attack, which was commanded by Lieut. Col. Maxwell, was destined to take possession of the Carighaut hill, and from thence to descend and penetrate into the island on the right flank of the enemy. These objects were effected with rapidity, and but little loss, except in crossing the Cavery, which was deep and rapid, and at the same time strongly defended by the enemy's batteries. In crossing the stream, which at this place was neck deep, the ammunition was unavoidably damaged; but the troops pressed forward with the bayonet, and at last joined the other divisions who were now assembled at the pettah.\n\nThe enemy having lost all their positions on the north side of the river, where the siege was to commence, and almost the whole of the island, every material object of the assault was secured. On the side of the British, the loss, though considerable, was small in proportion to the importance of the victory, and the disasters of the enemy; of whom, it afterwards appeared, that no less than 20,000 had either deserted, or been slain in the various conflicts during this night of enterprise, danger, and death.\n\nOn the 7th, the enemy, as if ashamed of the rapidity with which their different posts had been abandoned, made several attempts to recover them. Their efforts were directed chiefly to the sultan's redoubt, commanded by Major Sibbald. Explored to the guns of the fort, and the batteries on the island, the major's little party defended the place for the whole day; and having successfully repulsed the different assaults of the enemy, they at last, weary of the attempt, desisted from the enterprise. The endeavour which the sultan's troops made to regain the pettah, met with a similar check; and the night of the 7th would have afforded some repose to the army, had not the rumour of an intended attack by Tippoo during the night, kept them on the alert. That such an attack had been meditated, there was full evidence; but both the chiefs and the soldiery were so much dispirited by the fatal train of events that had so rapidly taken place during the last twenty-four hours, that they could not be induced to second the zeal of their sovereign. During the various conflicts of the 6th and 7th, the fatigues and dangers of the British army were severe; and its loss in killed, wounded, and missing, was far from being inconsiderable (539 men). The extent and importance of the acquisitions gained by this brilliant contest seemed, however, to compensate every sacrifice that had been made. It now occupied the lines and posts from which the enemy had been driven; and the works which had been so completely fortified for the defence of the capital, now became lines of circumvallation for its attack. The troops on the one side were broken and dispirited; on the other they were in perfect order, and animated with their recent success. The Europeans in the service of Tip- poo, after the disastrous events of the last two days, now despairing of his fortunes, deserted to our army; and many of them enlisted with the Mahrattas; others retired to the French settlements. After their departure, the sultan's army never encamped in order, or assumed a formidable appearance.\n\nThe British army, now in possession of the island and the town of Serinapatanam, was immediately employed in making the necessary preparations for the siege of the fortres or citadel. This enchanting island being plentifully watered by the Cavery, and a vast number of intersecting canals, maintains a perpetual verdure; on the east, it is decorated by the buildings of the fort, which occupies a mile square; on the west, by the Laul Baug, containing the mausoleum of Hyder Ali, adorned by tall cypresses, shaded walks, and a variety of trees, whose foliage and perennial verdure announce an everlasting spring. The mosques and religious buildings were converted into hospitals for the wounded and sick; and the trees, now for the first time felled by the axe, furnished materials for fascines and gabions for the approaching siege.\n\nThe proud mind of the sultan could not remain tranquil, on seeing his beautiful gardens and all his improvements threatened with destruction, by an enemy who was also preparing to deprive him of his citadel and all that remained of his power. His indignation was expressed by a continual discharge of cannon from the fort, directed against the island, the redoubts, and every party of ours that seemed within his reach. Some of his shot ranged as far as the camp, aimed apparently at headquarters; but the distance of the several posts was too great; and his ineffectual cannonade served rather to proclaim the wrath of the sovereign, than materially to annoy his enemies.\n\nTired by these repeated efforts, which he saw were vain, and worn out by the ebullitions of his own anger, Tippoo at last began to meditate seriously on the necessity of a peace, the only means by which he could extricate himself from his perilous state. In order to smooth the way for his overtures, he previously liberated two British officers, who had been detained contrary to capitulation in Coimbatore; these officers, till now the victims of his cruelty, he loaded with presents, and made\nthem the bearers of a letter to Lord Cornwallis suing for peace. Another expedient, more daring, but far less honourable, was nearly at this time practised to attain his deliverance. A small party of horsemen were despatched to the British camp in the night, for the purpose of assassinating the commander in chief; as straggling parties of the Nizam's horse were near, the troopers, mistaken for friends, had little difficulty in entering the camp; and, but for an accident, might have effected their purpose. Detected, however, by their inquiries for his lordship's tent, they were fired at by a party of recruits; and such was the speed with which they made off, that they suffered little damage in this disgraceful enterprise, which is so often referred to by the princes of India. This was the second attempt against the commander's life during the present war: that both were unsuccessful, must be ascribed to that intoxication in which the natives are plunged, before they can be induced to venture upon such hazardous deeds.\n\nThough Tippoo had recourse to these vile projects, which he knew were countenanced by the practice of his country, he did not trust to them solely for his defence. The Bombay army which was at this time approaching, he combated and harassed by every effort of honourable war: its junction, however, with the main army was effected on the 16th; and on the second night after this event, the trenches were opened, and a parallel formed within 800 yards of the north face of the fort. General Abercromby, stationed on the south quarter with a strong detachment, was ordered to cannonade it from the heights. This attack being directed against the weakest part of the fort, occasioned the greatest alarm. Tippoo himself, therefore, at the head of his troops, marched to dislodge the general: being supported by the guns of the fort, he maintained the action for the whole day; but towards evening, he was forced to retreat.\n\nThis desperate effort was the last that Tippoo made for his defence. His affairs hastened to a crisis; cabals were formed by the chiefs, and his troops deserted in multitudes during the night. Plenipotentiaries from the allies, since that, had been treating with his vassals; his haughty spirit, hitherto untractable, was now forced to yield to their demands. He saw his capital blockaded on every side by a powerful army, plentifully supplied with provisions, which must infallibly reduce his troops by famine, should they even prove successful in repelling its assaults; even his last hopes of relief from the monsoon, and the swelling of the river, were thus finally cut off.\n\nOn the 23rd of February, therefore, the preliminaries of peace were signed by Tippoo, amidst the conflicting emotions of pride, resentment, and fear; and orders were issued to the troops on both sides to cease from farther hostilities; a stipulation, of which the dread of an immediate assault alone enforced the observance.\n\nBy the terms of this treaty, Tippoo was compelled to pay, as an indemnification for the expenses of the war, three crore and 30 lacks of rupees at two instalments, the first to be advanced immediately, and the second at the end of four months. Other articles of this instrument provided farther, that the whole prisoners taken from the allied powers from the time of Hyder Ali, should be unconditionally restored; that no less than one-half of his territories should be ceded to the allies; and that two of Tippoo Sultan's three eldest sons should be given as hostages, for the due performance of the treaty.\n\nThe candid and upright conduct of Lord Cornwallis had gained the full confidence of all the allies. So complete was the ascendancy he possessed over their councils, that they submitted without a murmur to all the arrangements which he proposed; a circumstance (considering the deep interests which were at stake) that must be regarded as not the least extraordinary in this campaign.\n\nThe terms of this agreement, which resembled a capitulation more than a treaty, were hard, and Tippoo with great difficulty was prevailed on to subscribe to them. Another struggle, perhaps still greater, yet remained for his family. This arose from the distress in his faraglio, on parting with his children. The sultan was entreated to request another day for making preparations for their departure; and Lord Cornwallis, though he had already dispensed with their accompanying the treaty, as first agreed, had the humanity to grant this request.\n\nAbout noon day on the 26th the princes mounted their elephants richly caparisoned, and attended with a splendid retinue left the fort, the walls and ramparts of which were crowded with multitudes of spectators. Amidst the vast multitudes whom curiosity or affection had drawn out to witness this scene, Tippoo himself was beheld standing above a high gateway, through which, as they passed, the princes were saluted by the guns of the fort; a compliment which they again received as they approached the British camp. They were seated in silver howdahs, attended by their father's minister, and a numerous retinue. The procession which they thus formed, was equally grand and interesting. It was led by several camel harcarras and standard-bearers, carrying green flags suspended from rockets, followed by one hundred pikemen with spears inlaid with silver. Their guard of two hundred Sepoys, and a party of horse, brought up the rear (c).\n\nIn this order the princes proceeded till they approached the tent of Lord Cornwallis, who had ordered a battalion of Sepoys for their reception; where the commander in chief embraced them with a cordiality and tenderness that resembled parental affection. The manners, dress, and appearance of the young princes themselves, formed an interesting spectacle to their European hosts. Bred up from their infancy with infinite care, and instructed to imitate in their manners the reserve and politeness of more advanced age, all present were astonished to observe the correctness and propriety of their conduct. Abdul Kallik, the eldest, was of a dark complexion, even among the natives of India; but his countenance was marked by thoughtfulness and intelligence,\n\n(c) For the substance of this account we are indebted to an eye witness, Major-general Dirom; who has favoured the public with an excellent narrative of this campaign.\nThe young Mooza ud Deen, was remarkably fair; a regular set of features, with an open appearance, rendered him the general favourite, and more admired than his brother. Clothed in red turbans and long white muslin gowns, everywhere sparkling with emeralds, rubies, and pearls, their external decorations displayed a brilliancy far surpassing every European idea of dress, and seemed to realize those laboured descriptions of splendor, which are in the western world only seen in the pages of romance. Thus attired, the young princes, immediately after their reception, were seated on each side of Lord Cornwallis, when Gulam Aly, the head vakeel of Tippoo, thus addressed the British general: \"These children were this morning the sons of the sultan my master: Their situation is now changed: They must look up to your lordship as their father.\"\n\nThe conduct of the commander in chief had perhaps suggested this address: he had in fact received the boys, as if they had been his own sons; and he again anxiously assured the vakeels, and the young princes themselves, that every possible attention would be shown them, and the greatest care taken of their persons.\n\nThe scene became more interesting; the faces of the children brightened up; and not only their attendants, but all the spectators, were delighted to observe, that any fears they might have harboured were removed, and that they would soon be reconciled to their change of situation. With regard to the youngest, this desirable object was likely to be first attained. He was the favourite son, and was said to be the sultan's destined heir: his mother, a beautiful and delicate woman, had lost her brother in a late action; and she herself had died of fright a few days before the attack of the lines. These circumstances, together with his own captivating appearance, drew to the youngest boy the greatest share of attention, and rendered his situation doubly interesting.\n\nAfter being regaled, in the eastern manner, with otter of roses and betel nut; the princes were presented each with a gold watch from Lord Cornwallis, a gift from which they seemed to receive great delight. On this occasion the ministers of the Nizam and the Mahrattas attended with their suites; and when the ceremony of their reception was ended, the princes were led back to the tents furnished by the sultan, which were of a green colour, an emblem of majesty which Tippoo always had carried with him into the field.\n\nThe detaining of Tippoo's sons as hostages, may be deemed a rigorous condition imposed on that prince; the event, however, soon proved, that without this precaution, he never could have been induced, unless by a renewal of hostilities, to fulfil the terms of the treaty. The value of the money to be received, as well as the rents of the different districts to be ceded, were keenly disputed. When the territory of the Coorga rajah, in particular, was required, the demand seemed unexpected both by the sultan and his ministers, and was at first received with astonishment and disdain. This rajah was considered as a chief cause of the war, and Tippoo, therefore, wished to crush him. Lord Cornwallis seemed equally resolute in his defence; for he again manned the works, and threatened to recommence the attack. Happily, his stock of provisions was ample; and although upwards of 400,000 strangers and half a million of cattle were daily to be fed, the supply was sufficient for the whole; while one million sterling of the fine imposed on Tippoo, had already been paid. The firm determination of the commander in chief, aided by these circumstances, which were not unknown to the sultan, damped his resolution. His resentment cooled, and he finally implemented the terms agreed upon, copies of which were delivered to the confederated powers.\n\nThe war against Tippoo, which was now happily terminated, placed the dominions of the India Company and of their allies in a state of safety and tranquillity which they had never enjoyed since the aggrandisement of his ambitious family. In the former campaigns against the Myfores, the civil and military powers were placed in separate hands; measures were planned without either energy or uniformity of system; and their execution being entrusted to other hands, seldom displayed the promptitude or vigour necessary to their success. They had often ended in the accumulation of debt, without adequate advantage; sometimes they produced the devastation of the company's possessions; and hitherto they had uniformly increased the power and pretensions of the formidable adversary whom they were meant to subdue.\n\nThis war just concluded, was followed by effects suited to the energy and perseverance with which it had been conducted. The one half of his dominions was at once wrested from the hands of the common enemy; and while his power was thus diminished, an additional strength and security was conferred on his neighbours, by that impregnable barrier which was added to their territories. In the three different campaigns the sultan's loss had been great; in the last, it seemed almost irredeemable, not less than 67 forts were taken, 800 cannon fell into the hands of the allies; and the killed, wounded, and missing of Tippoo's troops amounted to 49,000 men. At the conclusion of the treaty very few places of strength were left in his possession; his treasury was drained, and the strength and spirit of his army completely broken. To the moderation of the British commander alone it was owing that he still remained a sovereign; for he was at last completely in the power of the victors. This moderation, but little merited by a cruel and vindictive enemy, he easily forgot when his power was afterwards revived, and he permitted his French counsellors to persuade him that he was again able to contend against the British government.\n\nIn the meantime, however, the India Company's advantages territories feebly felt the advantages of the treaty of this truce at Serinapatan. The presidency of Madras, which was most exposed to inroads from the Myfores, has by that event secured a chain of forts along its frontiers, which has ever since effectually freed it from the evils of invasion. The Carnatic, recovered from its former calamities, must improve its revenue, while it is defended at a less expense. The Malabar coast and presidency of Bombay has experienced, ever since the victory at Serinapatan, a state of still greater security than the Carnatic. It contains a country the most varied, and perhaps the most fertile in India, which under a regular government may be improved to an extent at present.\npresent almost inconceivable. Hitherto, from being a scene of constant war and bloodshed, it has not been suffered to develop its resources.\n\nWhile the relative situation of the British and the Sultan were thus improved by the pacification, the interests of our allies were perhaps still more essentially benefited. The Mahrattas have gained an addition of strength as well as territory, by enlarging their frontier from Daulatpur to the Tumuldra; and the Nizam has gained a similar advantage, being strengthened on the one side by the same river, and on the other by the Sanar and Gungecotta. Both powers are by their position placed nearer the aid of the British, to whom they must in future look up for their defence against all their enemies, as well as the aggressions of the Myorean armies. During the seven years tranquillity that succeeded this memorable campaign, the armies of both these powers, having no external enemy to call forth their exertions, gradually relaxed in discipline, and assumed a still more tumultuary and unmilitary appearance.\n\nOn the other hand, the troops of Tipu, from his unconquerable hostility to the British power, and from the secret intrigues of the French, were kept in a state of constant preparation, by which their discipline was improved. The influence of time, and the resources of a vigorous government, gradually repaired the vast losses which had been sustained during the three last campaigns. The power of the Myorean court had indeed been much impaired, but it had lost none of that antipathy and hatred against the neighbouring states by which it had always been distinguished.\n\nOf all the confederated powers engaged in this war, the British derived, perhaps, the smallest share of the direct and immediate advantages which resulted from it. The prize-money shared by the army, although increased by the renunciation of the shares of Earl Cornwallis and General Meadows, was not great; and the territories that were ceded to the India Company being disunited and at a distance, seem to have been demanded rather with a view to weaken the common enemy than to add to their resources. Prior to the year 1799, the period of the final conquest of Seringapatam and the Myore, more than two-thirds of the ancient territory of the Mogul empire still remained in the hands of populous and independent states, professing either the Hindoo or Mohammedan faith. Among the latter, the Nizam and the king of Myore still held the chief rank, while five powerful Mahratta chiefs, the adherents of Brahminism, occupied the first station in the former class.\n\nSome of these princes, during the former wars in Hindostan, had individually arranged themselves on the side of the monarchy of France, against that of Britain. These rival and leading powers in Europe, had for near a century occupied a similar position in the east, which decided in some measure the fate of Asia. The republican councils, however, by which the French government had been lately subverted, embraced a much wider range in their foreign policy.\n\nThey attempted to form at once all these different princes collectively into a combination, which they hoped might become the instrument of their own ambition. Hence proceeded their warm professions of philanthropy to the natives, and their new-born zeal for improving their condition, and for rescuing them from the rapacity and tyranny of the British. The same unperishable thirst after external conquest and universal dominion which inflamed that nation to attempt those momentous changes, which were lately beheld in Europe, began to display their violence in the east, and to characterize the whole of the French policy in Asia. Confidential agents had already been dispatched over the territories of these princes; officers from France had been secretly sent out and appointed to their armies. For several years these agents had been sedulously employed not only in disciplining their troops, but in promoting among the native princes a combination for the purpose of subverting the British government, and for annihilating throughout the peninsula every power that might be deemed hostile to their own.\n\nThese schemes of ambition, wild and romantic as they may seem, have been executed with complete success over almost one half of Europe; and it must be confessed, that the power of the mighty confederacy which was projected in the east, was more than sufficient to subjugate the whole of India, had it been possible to effect the steady co-operation of its members in any common system of policy. A closer view of it will evince its power and efficiency for the execution of the most extensive plans even of French ambition.\n\nThe Mahratta empire, by being properly consolidated, must of itself command an immense force. Stretching throughout the whole length of the peninsula, from the bay of Bengal to the banks of the Indus, its population has been estimated at no less than forty millions of souls; while its known revenue has been found to amount to seventeen millions sterling. These resources, however ample, it must be noticed, are far more efficient in India than in Europe; they have there been found by actual experiment, adequate to the establishment and constant maintenance of an army of upwards of 300,000 men. Nor has the progress of the French emigr\u00e9es in communicating European tactics to this immense force, been at all inadequate to the vast schemes of their policy, or to the magnitude of their undertaking; many battalions in the service of the Peshwa and of Holkar, but more especially in the establishment of Scindiah, have been found in a state of discipline that might have been deemed creditable in most European armies. Among the troops of this latter prince, the brigade of General Perron has long been distinguished by a system of tactics hardly inferior to that of the British Seapoys; it consists of about 40,000 men, who are regularly regimented and brigaded, and as completely clothed and accoutred as the British troops. The pay of this force is regularly fixed, a rare occurrence in India; and while in the field, its operations are sustained by a well appointed artillery, consisting of upwards of 40 pieces of ordnance.\n\nTo the charge of this favourite portion of his army Scindiah has for some time past committed the capital of the empire, and the custody of the venerable but unfortunate Shah Alam; a monarch who, it is said, has reached the uncommon period of 90 years; and who, it would appear, is more waited and broken down by an unexampled load of calamity, than by either the weight or feebleness of his singular age. The forcible restraints to which this unhappy prince has for many years\nyears been subjected, easily enabled the French party among Scindiah's troops to wrest from him the sanction of the imperial name, and the semblance at least of legitimate authority; a matter of some moment, as it served to screen the progress of usurpation. It was accordingly in the vicinity of the capital, and almost in the presence of the deposed emperor, that the projects of French ambition seemed to tend to maturity with the most steady and rapid course. Considerable advances had already been made towards the formal cession of the important provinces of Agra and Delhi to the French government, and towards their final union with that distant kingdom.\n\nFortunately for the independence of the neighbouring states, and the safety of the British empire, that nobleman who at this critical period had been appointed to the government of India possessed a complete knowledge of the character and views of the French nation. Soon after the arrival of the marquis of Wellesley in the east, his innate penetration, and unrestrained industry in acquiring the knowledge of Indian politics, enabled him to discover the whole range and extent of those plans of hostility which the French had meditated in Asia. He was fully apprised of the dangerous situation of the British empire in that quarter of the globe; and with equal promptitude and energy he employed the whole resources of its power in order to avert or repel the danger.\n\nIt was, however, at Hyderabad in the Deccan that the impatience and activity of French intrigue first compelled him to meet actual hostility in the field: an insurrection of the French officers there had wrested from the Nizam the whole authority over his army, and in fact, had already converted that faithful and peaceable ally of the British into an open enemy. By a sudden and unexpected movement of a small part of our army, that had been prepared for this purpose, these officers were all suddenly apprehended, and the allegiance of the Nizam, and the subordination of his army, were almost instantaneously restored. This first act of the marquis Wellesley, though scarcely heard of in Europe, certainly augured favourably of his government; for it not only paved the way to his subsequent success against the Mysore, but from its promptitude and decision it deserved to be ranked among the most meritorious measures of his whole administration.\n\nThe vengeance of the king of Mysore, for his former losses and defeats, had not suffered him to enjoy a moment of tranquillity after the late pacification (1). He had in fact been raising up a Mohammedan confederacy, which was to consist of the grand seignior, the Persian chiefs, the nabob of Oude, and the Nizam; and was intended for a purpose, no less splendid in the eyes of the faithful, than the extirpation, not only of the British, but of all the enemies of Islamism throughout Hindoostan. The army of this prince was fully prepared to take the field, but the fortunate event that has just been related, had deprived him of the cooperation of the Nizam, his nearest, and therefore his most efficient ally.\n\nThe native princes of India are in general far more prompt in imbibing resentment, and in learning maxims of hostility against their neighbours, than cautious or prudent in their application. Their French instructors were also, at this period, so much intoxicated with the new form which their own government in Europe had assumed, that they had instituted a society, in the capital of Mysore, for the romantic purpose of spreading the doctrine of liberty and equality among the depots and slaves of Asia. The sovereign of Mysore himself was easily persuaded to become an honorary member of this institution, where he appeared among its associates under the name of Citizen Tipoo, an appellation perhaps the most awkward and incongruous that had ever been assumed by an eastern depot. The wild and frantic orisons that were daily poured forth in this club, in favour of an imaginary liberty, were constantly accompanied with sentiments of detestation, and vows of eternal hostility, against the British government; its forces were therefore instantly prepared and marched into the field to meet an aggression, which there had been so little care taken to conceal. Past experience had taught the British officers to avoid the pursuit of a native army in its rapid and disconcertive evolutions in the field; the British, therefore, marched directly towards the capital of the enemy, which fell, but not till two decided victories had been obtained without its walls, and also an obstinate defence had been made in the interior of the city. In this last conflict (2), which was maintained by both the abjects and the natives with equal valour and obstinacy, much blood was spilt, and the lives of many brave men were lost, among the rest that of Tipoo Sultan, whose body was found, after long search, among heaps of the slain, where he had fallen nobly defending the last bulwark of his kingdom, and where, however unfortunate he may be deemed in other respects, he at last met with a fate not unworthy of his bravery.\n\nBy the pacification at Hyderabad, the fall of Serinapatan, and the death of Tipoo Sultan, the Mohammedan branch of the grand confederacy, which the French had raised against the British power in India, was completely broken and finally destroyed. For although the few remaining adherents of the deceased monarch made some desperate efforts for the restoration of his family, these were rendered abortive by the activity and vigilance of those British officers who had been left in charge of the conquered country (3). The campaign against the Mysore was, therefore, completed by a signal act of justice, as creditable to the government of India, as the late brilliant successes had been honourable to the British arms. The greater part of the vanquished territory was restored to the rajah of Mysore, and his ancient family again mounted that throne,\n\n---\n\n(1) Effectuated by Marquis Cornwallis.\n(2) This memorable attack was led by General Baird, who had been for three years confined in a dungeon by the tyrant.\n(3) Particularly by Sir Arthur Wellesley, who signalized himself by the defeat of Doondea Waugh, the most steady adherent of Tipoo.\nfrom which they had been driven by the treachery and usurpation of Tippoo and his father; nor did the vengeance of the Brittili, though hurled with such destructive rapidity against the most formidable and inveterate of all their enemies, prevent them from affording sympathy and relief to the surviving family of the Myforesan kings; ample endowments were set apart for their support, which they still continue to enjoy, with perhaps equal comfort, and certainly with greater security, than in the most prosperous days of the fortunes of their house.\n\nThis train of important and successful events took place during the short space of only a few months after the arrival of the marquis de Wellesly, and they certainly entitled his administration to rank with the most active and brilliant that had ever been displayed by any governor of India; according, however, to his views of the state of that country, he must have regarded his labours as scarcely half finished. He saw the immense power of the Mahratta empire still remaining not only unbroken, but daily increasing, and consolidating under the active and unceasing operation of French influence. A French state, as already noticed, of large extent and formidable power, had been framed by the successive labours of Generals de Boyne and Perron, around the capital of India. This nascent power the all-devouring ambition of the new emperor had already grasped as a rich prize, and its destruction became therefore absolutely necessary to the safety of our empire in India, since, amidst all the multiplied aggressions of his neighbours, the usurper had uniformly distinguished the British nation as the marked, though perhaps not the ultimate object of his hostility.\n\nThe reduction of a hostile power so immediately in the vicinity of our possessions, might certainly have justified a war; but as no actual aggression had yet been committed in that quarter, it was on the other side of the peninsula that the marquis of Wellesly was again first called upon for the active support of the interests of his government: the danger became at once pressing and immediate by the usurpation of the whole Mahratta power by a single chief; and the cause of the fugitive was identified with our own.\n\nThe politics of India were never so refined, or considerate, as to admit of a balancing system, by which the overgrown power of any individual state might be prevented from endangering the independence of the rest. Hardly any circumstance of common danger has ever been deemed sufficiently urgent, to unite the native princes in the defence of the country even against foreign invasion. During the contest between the British and the king of Myfores, the Mahrattas observed a suspicious neutrality: they gazed on the combatants with an indifference that bordered on fatuity; and which strongly foreboded the dissolution of their state. After the fall of that kingdom, their empire actually fell into a state of anarchy that demanded the most prompt measures of precaution for the safety of the British territories, and those of its allies, which lay around its frontiers. The constitution of their empire, originally ill constructed and undefined, had lately been radically changed. The ancient rajas of Satarah, who had originally laid the foundation of its power, and extended its influence over the peninsula with such unexampled rapidity, had gradually sunk from the rank of sovereigns to imbecility, and, owing to the personal ambition of their servants, fell into a station, if not of absolute privacy, at least of complete insignificance.\n\nTheir ministers, already become hereditary in their offices, and too powerful for control, had sufficient influence to remove the seat of government from Satarah, and to constitute the town of Poonah the capital of the empire. There, removed from the eyes of the princes, they no longer deemed it necessary further allegiance, than the semblance of delegated power; they accordingly retained the appellation of Pethwa, but compelled the subordinate members of the confederacy to acknowledge them as the legitimate organ of the whole executive power of the state, whether civil or military. It is, however, scarcely possible, accurately to define either the rights or the power attached to the Pethwa, after his being acknowledged representative of the supreme head of the empire. The extent of his prerogatives seems to have varied at different times, according to the personal talents and ambition of each incumbent in the exercise of this recent power.\n\nBajee Rao, the present Pethwa, from that imbecility and indolence which in Asia is so often attached to high station, had devolved upon inferior agents almost the whole of the active duties of his office. His power had frequently been disputed or controlled; he had at different times nearly become a prey to the ambition of the subordinate chiefs; and, at the period now under review, though defended by Scindiah, he had been completely defeated by Holkar's troops, and obliged to flee for security beyond the limits of his own dominions.\n\nThe danger to the British possessions, and those of their allies, became pressing and immediate, from this usurpation of almost the whole Mahratta power by the hands of a single chieftain; and the cause of the Pethwa thus became identified with that of our India government.\n\nA treaty of defensive alliance between the India Company and the Pethwa, was therefore drawn up at the earnest solicitation of that prince, and was finally ratified at Baillein, where he had fled from the aggressions of Holkar for protection. By this instrument, it was stipulated, that he should be restored to his dominions, and to the exercise of his legitimate authority, on condition of his maintaining, for the defence of his territories, and at his own expense, a brigade of British troops; which it was at first agreed should consist of 6000, but afterwards the number was increased to 10,000 men.\n\nThe terms of this convention were no sooner arranged, than the British army, under Sir Arthur Wellesly, marched towards Poonah with that promptitude and decision which have always distinguished the services of this valuable officer. The rapidity of his movements, and his unexpected advance, saved the capital from destruction; for the troops of Holkar, who had continued to pillage the city, since it fell into their possession, had at last resolved to finish the catastrophe, by setting it on fire. Alarmed, however, by the sudden approach of the British army, they fled from the place with the utmost precipitation, and soon after abandoned the territory of Poonah. Room was thus made for the peaceable\nable restoration of the depoed sovereign; and the Peshwa, when he afterwards arrived, was received by his subjects, not merely with submission and quietness, but with every mark of the sincerest joy and satisfaction. During his absence the inhabitants had been subjected to the severest forms of military execution; and forced to submit to the various exactions of a chief the most needy, desperate, and rapacious, of all the leaders of the predatory bands of his countrymen. When, therefore, they again beheld their lawful sovereign, they greeted his return by salutes from all the forts in his kingdom, and testified their joy by illuminations on the tops and acclivities of the hills throughout the whole vicinity of Poonah.\n\nThus far the measures of the governor of India wore an aspect of conciliation and vigour, which augured well in favour of their ultimate success. The justice of his interference at this time, to check the overgrown power of an aspiring adversary, and to succour the distresses of a fallen prince, will hardly be questioned by such as are versant in the politics of India: Nor will it be denied, since all the Mahratta princes exercised the right of making treaties themselves, that the same privilege belonged to the head of the empire.\n\nAccording to these views, the defensive treaty of Bassein was not only avowed by the parties, but freely communicated to the rest of the chiefs, who explicitly declared, that it contained no stipulations injurious either to the principles of their constitution, or to the just rights of any member of the Mahratta confederacy.\n\nOn the other hand, its advantages were sufficiently obvious. It had the immediate effect of restoring a deposed prince to his throne, and to the exercise of his acknowledged rights, as well as of checking a dangerous usurpation. It detached from the influence of French councils a very important branch of the Mahratta confederacy, and therefore coincided with the general tendency and spirit of the British policy in the east.\n\nBut the power of the Peshwa, and the predominant rights which, by the constitution of the empire, were attached to his office, had, as was already noticed, become a grand object of ambition among the more considerable chiefs. Scindiah had for many years laboured to gain an ascendancy at the court of Poonah, and on some occasions actually possessed a powerful influence on its councils. Ragoojee Boonsa had, from family connection, some grounds for the advancement of his own claims to this office; while Holkar had lately, by the fortune of war, had the whole authority placed within his grasp, and in the name of Amrut Rao, brother to the Peshwa, had actually begun to exercise its different prerogatives.\n\nThe final deprivation of these chiefs, of so fair an object of ambition as the general control of the whole Mahratta empire, seemed to reproach their indolence and want of ambition; and the nearer they considered its attainment, the stronger the jealousy and disappointment which its loss occasioned. The deep resentment thus excited among these chiefs, though unacknowledged by themselves, was the true cause of that open hostility which they were now about to commence against the British power. Thus impelled by the strong emotions of disappointed ambition, Scindiah and the rajah of Nagpore entered into a close engagement to frustrate the arrangements lately stipulated by the treaty of Bassein. In order to execute this purpose, each chief set on foot a large army, which was marched from different quarters to a point of union, bordering on the territories of the Nizam, an ally of the India company.\n\nThis menacing position they maintained for a considerable time, in order to complete their own preparations, and the more effectually to urge Holkar to join their confederacy; nor could they be persuaded to abandon it by the strongest remonstrances of our government against military preparations so unnecessary for their own defence, and in a situation so incompatible with the peace and safety of the British allies. However unwilling the marquis of Wellesley might be to hazard the tranquillity and safety of the British empire in the east by entering into a contest with these powerful chiefs, whose dominions actually stretched over more than one-half of the peninsula of India, he had however no alternative left him. The full and positive information which he had from various sources obtained, of the nature and extent of the hostilities that had for some time past been meditated, was now confirmed by the menaces of the enemy, and the actual preparations that he had made to carry them into execution. He foresaw the dangerous crisis which was now to near at hand; and the hollow profession of friendships which were constantly sent in reply to his remonstrances, did not for a moment prevent him from bringing forward the whole resources of his government to defeat their enterprises.\n\nA combination of the Mahratta empire, so extensive, armies so vast and powerful as that now formed by the confederates, had never hitherto been brought into action against the British power; and it must be acknowledged also, that a system of defence, equally prompt, vigorous, and comprehensive, was never planned by any former governor of British India. Five different armies, each of considerable force, were speedily prepared, brought into the field, and ready to invade the vast territory of the enemy, nearly at the same period of time. The value of the previous arrangements that had been formed with the Nizam and the Peshwa, particularly the subsidiary treaties, was now distinctly felt. By them the British army was enabled to proceed through the friendly territories of allied chiefs, to the very boundary of the Mahratta dominions, where it was joined by a large subsidiary force both from Hyderabad and Poonah, which materially promoted the success of the campaign. The marquis thus was enabled to attack the extensive dominions of the enemy, from almost every available point, by an effort almost simultaneous.\n\nOn the fourth they were invaded by a powerful division of the Madras army under Sir Arthur Wellesley; in Guzerat, on the west, by Colonel Murray, and a strong detachment of the Bombay troops; a similar effort was also made by General Lake on the northern extremity of Scindiah's dominions, where the main strength of his army was stationed in conjunction with the celebrated brigade of General Perron. On the east, in Bundelcund, the same system of attack was pursued, where the adherents of the confederacy Ali Mohammed and Himmat Bahadur were overpowered and dispersed. During the execution of all these operations, the provinces of Balafore and Cuttack were wrested from the rajah of Nagpore, by the immediate direction and under the auspices of the governor-general.\nTheir immediate consequences were the defeat of the combined armies of the confederate chiefs; and, from the loss of their artillery, an irreparable blow to their strength and resources throughout the whole of India. Their prosperity results were, no doubt, aided and accelerated by the auspicious progress of the army at all the different points from which it invaded the Mahratta empire. Soon after these successes, the French officers attached to Scindiah's army, after having quarrelled with the native soldiers and with each other, abandoned the service of that chief; after the example of Perron their principal partizan, they submitted to the protection of the British commander, who suffered them to retire with whatever property they had acquired, and had been able to bring away.\n\nThus the grand fabric of French power which that nation had been anxiously raising up, with the assumed sanction of the imperial authority, and the more efficient support of the Mahratta power, was at last broken down, and completely destroyed throughout the whole of India. The conquest of Balafores and Cuttack by Colonel Harcourt seemed well calculated to prevent its future renovation; for it connected the two presidencies of Bengal and Madras, and united the British territories along the whole extent of the Coromandel coast, where they now present an unbroken and hostile frontier against every incursion from the shore, and form a barrier against the introduction of French supplies, and officers to discipline the armies of every inimical power.\n\nThe strong detachment of the Bombay army under Colonel Murray, though engaged in enterprises apparently less splendid, were equally serviceable in promoting the important results of the campaign. This officer not only defended the coast and British territory in that quarter, and those of our ally the Guicar rajah; but he also reduced the fortresses of Broach, Povanghur, and other posts of importance. Thus, in every quarter of this extended warfare, was the British cause triumphant;\u2014on the shores of Guzerat and Balafores, on the mountains of the Deccan, and in the plains of Delhi, her banners were supported with equal energy and spirit; and victory everywhere continued steadily to follow them.\n\nIn the space of a few months, a rapid succession of events had taken place, of sufficient importance to change completely the relative condition of the British empire, and the different powers of India. Its power was enlarged; and its ascendancy among the neighbouring states was without control. Seven hundred pieces of cannon had been taken from the enemy; their armies routed and dispersed. Eight fortresses had been reduced, either by siege or by escalade. The mighty strength of the French and Mahratta confederacy had been suddenly crushed throughout a territory extending over 1000 miles square. What seemed, however, of no less importance, in these warlike times, and in the critical situation of the British empire, then attacked and threatened with invasion, by its most powerful and inveterate enemy in Europe; her military reputation was heightened; the laurels she had lately gathered in Syria and Egypt were refreshed; and she enjoyed a satisfactory proof, that amidst increasing luxury and imminent danger, no portion of the enterprise and valour of her armies had been lost. Nor is it to be forgotten...\ngotten that all her late victories in the east, had been obtained over troops, not in the ordinary circumstances of Indian armies. They had been disciplined by European officers, and led with intrepidity and skill. The proficiency they had made in European tactics was so great, that during the action at Affye, the Mahrattas made no less than five different changes of position, and sustained on the same day an equal number of assaults, before they yielded the contest. It was by the point of the bayonet alone, that they were at last compelled to relinquish their guns; 100 of which were taken on the field of battle, by an army scarcely amounting to a tenth-part of the number of that which they had, with such singular bravery, driven from the field.\n\nThe Mahratta confederacy being finally subdued, a peace was concluded between the India Company, Dowlut Rao Scindia, and the Berar rajah, in January 1804. The short period of tranquillity that succeeded this event, was speedily interrupted by Holkar, another powerful chief, whose expulsion of the Peshwa had originally occasioned the war. This prince, though he kept aloof from the confederacy of his countrymen, with an indifference which seemed to argue at once a deficiency of patriotism and a want of sound policy, was, nevertheless, found to maintain the contest for his independence with far greater skill and bravery than any prince whom the British arms had opposed in India.\n\nThe power and resources of Holkar had gradually been increased, like that of the other chiefs, by the introduction of European officers into his army, and by an improved system of discipline which was thus established. Thus formidable itself, his power was rendered almost unavailable, from the nature of his country, which is uncommonly mountainous, and, during the rains, impassable from jungles and morasses. His skill in maintaining the predatory warfare, so congenial to a Mahratta army, was far superior to that of the other chiefs; whose experience had so fully taught him the danger of risking any regular engagement with European troops. Thus, although his territories were invaded on all sides by detachments of the company's forces, he constantly eluded their attacks; and by the singular rapidity of his movements, he was enabled suddenly to assemble almost his whole force, and overpower whatever detachments he might find at a distance from support. In this situation, the troops under Colonel Monson were surprised. This officer had marched against his capital Indore, in concert with Colonel Murray, who had reached the place from Bombay, and captured it without much opposition. His less fortunate coadjutor, however, after being betrayed by his guides, and deserted by a part of his troops, was attacked by a superior force, under Holkar himself, before which he was forced to retreat towards Agra, through a country impassable from the rains, and destitute of provisions. After several disastrous conflicts, during a retreat of seven weeks, which degenerated into a flight, the greater part of his guns, and the whole of the baggage and military stores, were lost. A few only of the troops reached Agra at midnight, in a state of extreme distress; the greater part had been overtaken in their flight, and were either massacred, or cruelly mutilated, by their ferocious pursuers.\n\nColonel Willot of the Bengal artillery was almost equally unsuccessful in an attack which he had planned against a strong post in the interior; he failed in the attempt; and soon after died of the wounds he had received. It was in Bundelcund, and the country of the Rohillas, that Holkar received the most considerable checks, which produced a reverse of fortune. From both those territories he was completely driven by Lieutenant-colonel Fawcett and General Smith.\n\nParties of his cavalry had been repeatedly defeated by Lord Lake; but the rapidity of their movements as often saved them from destruction; and it was not till the decisive battle of Deeg, on the 13th of November, that the main strength of this enterprising chief was completely broken. At this place, his army, trusting to the great strength of its position, behind succussive ranges of batteries, was induced to hazard a general action. From these different batteries, which extended to the depth of two miles, they were successively driven by the gallant General Frazer, who had the credit of forcing a post which had been deemed impregnable; and which at this period was defended by 24 battalions of infantry, and 150 pieces of cannon.\n\nIn this brilliant achievement the general was wounded in the leg, and soon after was obliged to be carried off the field. The completion of the victory thus fell to Colonel Monson, who now saw complete vengeance inflicted for his past disasters, and for the unexampled cruelty of his enemy; 2000 of whom were killed, either in the battle or during the retreat. An immense number was wounded, and among those many considerable chiefs; while 87 pieces of cannon fell into his hands, which partly consisted of the same guns which he had himself lost during his disastrous retreat to Agra.\n\nHad Holkar confined merely to his effective force in the field, his cause might have now been regarded as desperate. His boldness, however, and his unexampled success, had gained him the support of several of the native princes. Among these he had seduced the rajah of Bhurtpore, an ally of the British, and the chief of the celebrated cast of the Jats, the most warlike tribe in upper India. General Lake was therefore obliged to concentrate his army, and to employ it in the reduction of Bhurtpore, a fortress which experience has proved to have been the strongest and most impregnable in the whole peninsula. While thus employed, the dispersed troops of Holkar had time to rendezvous in distant quarters; and were successful in cutting off his supplies of provisions, and in plundering the surrounding districts, by that predatory mode of warfare, for which the Mahrattas have always been celebrated.\n\nThe reduction of Bhurtpore, thus defended by the indefatigable efforts of Holkar, by its intrepid garrison, and its own natural strength, proved the most arduous enterprise which the British troops had ever undertaken in Asia. The success of the besieged in repelling four different assaults, animated them with fresh courage, and intrepidity. The rajah and his whole tribe were united by the ties of blood, as well as of civil authority. They had claim to a high caste among the natives, which they knew must be forfeited forever by unconditional submission: Unfortunately these were the only terms which General Lake, in the peremptory instructions which were given for its reduction, was permitted to accept. The rajah, therefore, having collected in\nthe fort, his women, his children, and his treasures, resolved to bury them all with himself under its ruins, rather than submit to terms which were deemed as disgraceful to his religion and his rank, as they were mortifying to his feelings as a soldier.\n\nCompelled by the orders of his superior, and undaunted by all the past disasters which the troops had already suffered, General Lake resolved to hazard another attempt. In the account given of it in his dispatch to the governor-general, dated 22nd February, he observes, that \"it appeared our failure on the 20th was to be accounted for, in a great measure, by the occurrence of unexpected accidents and delays, as part of the corps who formed the forlorn party had surmounted the principal difficulty, and had nearly gained the summit of the battalion; where, I was informed, a few hours more battering would make the ascent perfectly easy, I determined to make another attempt yesterday.\"\n\n\"The party for this service consisted of the whole European force, and the two battalions of the native infantry of the Bengal army; and the greater part of his majesty's 55th and 86th regiments, the grenadier battalion, and the flank companies of the 1st battalion 3rd regiment, from the Bombay division. The whole moved on to the attack about three o'clock in the afternoon, under the command of the honourable Brigadier Monson. The troops, most confident of success, commenced the attack, and persevered in it for a considerable time, with the most determined bravery; but their utmost exertions were not sufficient to enable them to gain the top of the breach. The battalion, which was the point of attack, was extremely steep; the resistance opposed to them was vigorous, and as our men could only mount by small parties at a time, the advantages were very great on the side of the enemy. Discharges of grape, logs of wood, and pots filled with combustible materials, immediately knocked down those who were ascending; and the whole party, after having engaged in an obstinate contest for two hours, and suffering very severe loss, was obliged to relinquish the attempt, and to retire to our trenches.\" The loss of the British army in this last assault, and that of the 20th, amounted to 300 killed, and 1,664 wounded; its whole loss during the different attacks, amounted to upwards of 3,000 of the bravest of our troops; while the unconditional surrender of the place, though the ultimate object of all these perilous attempts, was never attained.\n\nThe Rajah, however, again proposed the terms he had formerly offered; and contended to pay three lacks of rupees to the army, and the expenses of the war. Hostages were given for the regular discharge of these sums, at different instalments. Thus the last prince in India who resisted the British arms, was found to have made the most glorious defence of his independence, and to have secured for himself the most honourable terms. Holkar himself, after having been often beaten, was at last defeated by almost the whole of his troops, and was obliged to escape with a retinue so scanty, as was hardly sufficient for the protection of his person. In this manner, an arduous campaign of 11 months was completed, after occasioning a greater loss of blood and treasure than had, perhaps, ever been incurred by the subjugation of any single chief. Nor did this daring and magnificent prince deign to tender submission, or to sue for peace, till the marquis of Wellesley had returned to Europe; till he had beheld the downfall of all the leading men of his nation; and till, like another Gallicus, he had secured to himself the honour of being the last prince who had dared to uphold the standard of independence in his native country.\n\nThus ended the contest between the British government and the Mahratta states\u2014a combination of military chiefs who had suddenly emerged from obscurity, and rose to the highest rank among the native powers. Their growing influence had invariably been hostile both to the Mohammedan and British power. Their vicinity was the fertile source of intrigue, stratagem, and war: By their downfall, the India Company has obtained a full ascendancy over the peninsula; time and future experience will show whether this new authority shall better promote the peace and prosperity of that populous country.\n\n**INDIA COMPANY.** See COMPANY.\n\n**INDIA RUBBER.** See CAOUTCHOUC.\n\n**INDIAN,** in a general sense, denotes anything belonging to the Indies, East or West.\n\n**INDIAN BERRY.** See MENISPERMUM.\n\n**INDIAN BREAD.** See JATROPHA.","sp":199,"ep":258},{"h":"INDIAN CORN","t":"or Maize.** See ZEA.\n\n**INDIAN CREEPS.** See TROPHELUM.\n\n**INDIAN FIG.** See CACTUS.\n\n**INDIAN POGO-TREE.** See FICUS.\n\n**INDIAN INK.** See ISK.\n\n**INDIAN REED.** See CANNA, BOTANY INDEX.\n\n**INDICATION,** in Physic, whatever serves to direct the physician how to act.\n\n**INDICATIVE,** in Grammar, the first mood or manner of conjugating a verb, by which we simply affirm, deny, or ask something: as, *amant,* \"they love;\" *non amant,* \"they do not love;\" *amant ne?* \"do they love?\" See GRAMMAR.\n\n**INDICTION,** in Chronology, a cycle of 15 years. See CYCLE.\n\n**INDICTMENT,** in Law, one of the modes of prosecuting an offender. See PROSECUTION.\n\nIn English law, it is a written accusation of one or more persons of a crime or misdemeanor, preferred to, and presented upon oath by, a grand jury. To this end, the sheriff of every county is bound to return to Blackfriars, every session of the peace, and every commission of oyer and terminer, and of general gaol-delivery, twenty-four good and lawful men of the county, some out of every hundred, to inquire, present, do, and execute all those things, which on the part of our lord the king shall then and there be commanded them. They ought to be freeholders; but to what amount is uncertain: which seems to be *ad usum omnium,* and as proper to be supplied by the legislature as the qualifications of the petit jury; which were formerly equally vague and uncertain, but are now settled by several acts of parliament. However, they are usually gentlemen of the best figure in the county. As many as appear upon this panel, are sworn upon the grand jury, to the amount of twelve at the least, and not more than twenty-three; that twelve may be a majority. Which number, as well as the constitution itself, we find exactly described so early as the laws of King Ethelred: *Exeunt seniores duodecim thani, et praefectus cum eis, ut juret.*\nIndictment jurent super sanctuarium quod eis in manus datur, quod nonint ullam innocentum acculae, nec aliquem noxium celere. In the time of King Richard I. (according to Hoveden), the process of electing the grand jury, ordained by that prince, was as follows: Four knights were to be taken from the county at large, who chose two more out of every hundred; which two associated to themselves ten other principal freemen, and those twelve were to answer concerning all particulars relating to their own district. This number was probably found too large and inconvenient; but the traces of this institution still remain, in that some of the jury must be summoned out of every hundred. This grand jury are previously instructed in the articles of their inquiry, by a charge from the judge who presides upon the bench. They then withdraw to sit and receive indictments, which are preferred to them in the name of the king, but at the suit of any private prosecutor; and they are only to hear evidence on behalf of the prosecution: for the finding of an indictment is only in the nature of an inquiry or accusation, which is afterwards to be tried and determined; and the grand jury are only to inquire upon their oaths, whether there be sufficient cause to call upon the party to answer it. A grand jury, however, ought to be thoroughly persuaded of the truth of an indictment, so far as their evidence goes; and not to rest satisfied merely with remote probabilities: a doctrine that might be applied to very oppressive purposes.\n\nThe grand jury are sworn to inquire only for the body of the county, pro corpore comitatus; and therefore they cannot regularly inquire of a fact done out of that county for which they are sworn, unless particularly enabled by act of parliament. And to so high a nicety was this matter anciently carried, that where a man was wounded in one county, and died in another, the offender was at common law indictable in neither, because no complete act of felony was done in any one of them: but by statute 2d and 3d Edw. VI. c. 24, he is now indictable in the county where the party died. And, by statute 2 Geo. II. c. 21, if the stroke or poisoning be in England, and the death upon the sea or out of England, or vice versa, the offenders, and their accessories, may be indicted in the county where either the death, poisoning, or stroke, shall happen. And so in some other cases; as particularly, where treason is committed out of the realm, it may be inquired of in any county within the realm, as the king shall direct, in pursuance of statutes 26 Hen. VIII. c. 13, 33.; Hen. VIII. c. 23, 35.; Hen. VIII. c. 2, 5, 6.; Edw. VI. c. 11. And counterfeiters, washers, or minishers, of the current coin, together with all manner of felons and their accessories, may, by statute 26 Hen. VIII. c. 6. (confirmed and explained by 34 and 35 Hen. VIII. c. 26, \u00a7 75, 76.) be indicted and tried for those offenses, if committed in any part of Wales, before the justices of gaol-delivery and of the peace, in the next adjoining county of England, where the king's writ runneth: that is, at present in the county of Hereford or Salop; and not, as it should seem, in the county of Chester or Monmouth: the one being a county palatine where the king's writ did not run; and the other a part of Wales, in 26 Hen. VIII. Murders also, whether committed in England or in foreign parts, may, by virtue of the statute 33 Hen. VIII. c. 23, be inquired of and tried by the king's special commission in any shire or place in the kingdom. By statute 10 and 11 W. III. c. 25, all robberies, and other capital crimes, committed in Newfoundland, may be inquired of and tried in any county in England. Offences against the black act, 9 Geo. I. c. 22, may be inquired of and tried in any county of England, at the option of the prosecutor. So felonies, in deftroying turnpikes, or works upon navigable rivers, erected by authority of parliament, may, by statutes 8 Geo. II. c. 20, and 13 Geo. III. c. 84, be inquired of and tried in any adjacent county. By statute 26 Geo. II. c. 19, plundering or stealing from any vessel in distress or wrecked, or breaking any ship contrary to 12 Ann. statute 2, c. 18, may be prosecuted either in the county where the fact is committed, or in any county next adjoining; and if committed in Wales, then in the next adjoining English county: by which is understood to be meant, such English county as, by the statute 26 Hen. VIII. above mentioned, had before a concurrent jurisdiction of felonies committed in Wales. Felonies committed out of the realm, in burning or deftroying the king's ships, magazines, or stores, may, by statute 12 Geo. III. c. 24, be inquired of and tried in any county of England, or in the place where the offence is committed. By statute 13 Geo. III. c. 63, misdemeanors committed in India may be tried upon information or indictment in the court of king's-bench in England; and a mode is marked out for examining witnesses by commission, and transmitting their depositions to the court. But, in general, all offences must be inquired into, as well as tried, in the county where the fact is committed. Yet if larceny be committed in one county, and the goods carried into another, the offender may be indicted in either; for the offence is complete in both. Or he may be indicted in England for larceny in Scotland, and carrying the goods with him into England, or vice versa; or for receiving in one part of the united kingdom goods that have been stolen in another. But for robbery, burglary, and the like, he can only be indicted where the fact was actually committed: for though the carrying away and keeping of the goods is a continuation of the original taking, and is therefore larceny in the second county, yet it is not a robbery or burglary in that jurisdiction. And if a person be indicted in one county for larceny of goods originally taken in another, and be thereof convicted, or stands mute, he shall not be admitted to his clergy; provided the original taking be attended with such circumstances as would have ousted him of his clergy by virtue of any statute made previous to the year 1661.\n\nWhen the grand jury have heard the evidence, if they think it a groundless accusation, they used formerly to endorse on the back of the bill, Ignoramus; or, We know nothing of it: intimating, that though the facts might possibly be true, that truth did not appear to them. But now they assert in English more absolutely, Not a true bill; or (which is the better way) Not found; and then the party is discharged without farther answer. But a fresh bill may afterwards be preferred to a subsequent grand jury. If they are satisfied of the truth of the accusation, they then endorse upon it, \"A true bill;\" anciently, Billa vera. The indictment is then said to be found, and the party stands indicted. But to find a bill, there must at least twelve...\nIndictment: Twelve of the jury agree; so tender is the law of England of the lives of the subjects, that no man can be convicted at the suit of the king of any capital offence, unless by the unanimous voice of twenty-four of his equals and neighbours; that is, by twelve at least of the grand jury, in the first place, assenting to the accusation; and afterwards by the whole petit jury of twelve more, finding him guilty upon his trial. But if twelve of the grand jury assent, it is a good indictment, though some of the rest disagree. And the indictment, when so found, is publicly delivered into court.\n\nIndictments must have a precise and sufficient certainty. By statute i Hen. V. c. 5, all indictments must set forth the Christian name, surname, and addition of the estate and degree, mystery, town, or place, and the county of the offender; and all this to identify his person. The time and place are also to be ascertained, by naming the day and township in which the fact was committed: though a mistake in these points is in general not held to be material, provided the time be laid previous to the finding of the indictment, and the place to be within the jurisdiction of the court; unless where the place is laid, not merely as a venue, but as part of the description of the fact. But sometimes the time may be very material, where there is any limitation in point of time assigned for the prosecution of offenders; as by the statute 7 Will. III. c. 3, which enacts, that no prosecution shall be had for any of the treasons or misprisions therein mentioned (except an affadavement deigned or attempted on the person of the king), unless the bill of indictment be found within three years after the offence committed: and, in case of murder, the time of the death must be laid within a year and a day after the mortal stroke was given. The offence itself must also be set forth with clearness and certainty; and in some crimes particular words of art must be used, which are appropriated by the law to express the precise idea which it entertains of the offence, that no other words, however synonymous they may seem, are capable of doing it. Thus, in treason, the facts must be laid to be done \"treasonably, and against his allegiance;\" anciently, \"proditione et contra ligavitice fuc debitum;\" else the indictment is void. In indictments for murder, it is necessary to say that the party indicted \"murdered,\" not \"killed\" or \"flew;\" the other; which, till the late statute, was expressed in Latin by the word mur-davit. In all indictments for felonies, the adverb \"feloniously,\" \"felonice,\" must be used; and for burglaries also, \"burglariter,\" or, in English, \"burglariously;\" and all these to ascertain the intent. In rapes, the word rapuit, or \"ravished,\" is necessary, and must not be expressed by any periphrasis, in order to render the crime certain. So in larcenies also, the words \"felonice cepit et aportavit,\" \"feloniously took or carried away,\" are necessary to every indictment; for these only can express the very offence. Also, in indictments for murder, the length and depth of the wound should in general be expressed, in order that it may appear to the court to have been of a mortal nature: but if it goes through the body, then its dimensions are immaterial, for that is apparently sufficient to have been the cause of the death. Also, where a limb, or the like, is absolutely cut off, there such description is needed.\n\nLastly, in indictments, the value of the thing which is the subject or instrument of the offence must sometimes be expressed. In indictments for larcenies this is necessary, that it may appear whether it be grand or petit larceny; and whether entitled or not to the benefit of clergy. In homicides of all sorts it is necessary; as the weapon with which it is committed is forfeited to the king as a deadman.

Others say, it was given to such gods as were originally of the country, or rather such as were the gods of the country that bore this name; and others again hold it was ascribed to such gods as were patrons and protectors of particular cities.

See the next article.","sp":260,"ep":260},{"h":"INDIGOFERA","t":"the INDIGO PLANT, a genus of plants belonging to the diadelphus class; and in the natural method ranking under the 32d order, Papilionace\u00e6. See Botany Index.\nThis plant requires a smooth rich soil, well tilled, and not too dry. The seed of it, which, as to figure and colour, resembles gunpowder, is sown in little furrows that are about the breadth of the hoe, two or three inches deep, at a foot's distance from each other, and in as straight a line as possible. Continual attention is required to pluck up the weeds, which would soon choke the plant. Though it may be sown in all seasons, the spring is commonly preferred. Moisture causes this plant to shoot above the surface in three or four days. It is ripe at the end of two months. When it begins to flower, it is cut with pruning-knives; and cut again at the end of every six weeks, if the weather is a little rainy. It lasts about two years, after which term it degenerates; it is then plucked up, and planted afresh. As this plant soon exhausts the soil, because it does not absorb a sufficient quantity of air and dew to moisten the earth, it is of advantage to the planter to have a vast space which may remain covered with trees, till it becomes necessary to fell them in order to make room for the indigo.\n\nIndigo is distinguished into two kinds, the true and the bastard. Though the first is sold at a higher price on account of its superiority, it is usually advantageous to cultivate the other, because it is heavier. The first will grow in many different soils; the second succeeds best in those which are most exposed to the rain. Both are liable to great accidents. Sometimes the plant becomes dry, and is destroyed by an insect frequently found on it; at other times, the leaves, which are the valuable part of the plant, are devoured in the space of 24 hours by caterpillars. This last misfortune, which is but too common, has given occasion to the saying, \"that the planters of indigo go to bed rich, and rise in the morning totally ruined.\"\n\nThis production ought to be gathered in with great precaution, for fear of making the farina that lies on the leaves, and is very valuable, fall off by shaking it. When gathered, it is thrown into the sleeping-vat, which is a large tub filled with water. Here it undergoes a fermentation, which in 24 hours at furthest is completed. A cock is then turned, to let the water run into the second tub, called the mortar or pounding tub. The sleeping-vat is then cleaned out, that fresh plants may be thrown in; and thus the work is continued without interruption.\n\nThe water which has run into the pounding-tub is found impregnated with a very subtile earth, which alone constitutes the dregs or blue-substance that is the object of this process, and which must be separated from the useless salt of the plant, because this makes the dregs swim on the surface. To effect this, the water is forcibly agitated with wooden buckets, that are full of holes and fixed to a long handle. This part of the process requires the greatest precautions. If the agitation be discontinued too soon, the part that is used in dyeing, not being sufficiently separated from the salt, would be lost. If, on the other hand, the dye were to be agitated too long after the complete separation, the parts would be brought together again, and form a new combination; and the salt reacting on the dregs would excite a second fermentation, that would alter the dye, spoil its colour, and make what is called burnt indigo. These accidents are prevented by close attention to the least alteration that the dye undergoes, and by the precaution which the workmen take to draw out a little of it from time to time in a clean vessel. When they perceive that the coloured particles collect by separating from the rest of the liquor, they leave off shaking the buckets, in order to allow time to the blue dregs to precipitate to the bottom of the tub, where they are left to settle till the water is quite clear.\u2014Holes made in the tub, at different heights, are then opened one after another, and this useless water is let out.\n\nThe blue dregs remaining at the bottom having acquired the consistence of a thick muddy liquid, cocks are then opened, which draw it off into the settler. After it is still more cleared of much superfluous water in this third and last tub, it is drained into sacks; from whence, when water no longer filters through the cloth, this matter, now become of a thicker consistence, is put into chests, where it entirely loses its moisture. At the end of three months the indigo is fit for sale.\n\nIt is used, in walking, to give a bluish colour to linen; painters also employ it in their water-colours; and dyers cannot make fine blue without indigo. The ancients procured it from the East Indies; in modern times, it has been transplanted into America. The cultivation of it, successively attempted at different places, appears to be fixed at Carolina, St Domingo, and Mexico. That which is known under the name of Guatemala indigo, from whence it comes, is the most perfect of all.\n\nThere are two kinds of indigo prepared in the East Indies, particularly on the coast of Coromandel, at Pondicherry, &c. Of these the worst kind is used for giving the body of colour to the dyed substance, the other being employed only to give it a glost afterwards. The finest is prepared on the coast of Agra, Mahilpatnam, and Ayano, but especially in the island of Java; but this last, being extremely dear, is very little used by the dyers. The best ought to float on the surface of water; its colour ought to be a very dark blue inclining to violet, bright and sparkling, especially when broken. It may be tried by dissolving a little in a glass of water: if pure, it will mix equably with the liquor; but if otherwise, will separate and fall to the bottom. Another method of trying the goodness of this substance is by fire; for the pure indigo will be entirely consumed, while the extraneous particles will remain. The pounded indigo is much more subject to adulteration than such as is sold in cakes or tablets; as the ashes or dirt with which it is mixed are very apt to separate from the pure colouring substance when standing in a liquid state, as it must always do before the moisture is evaporated: whence, on breaking a bit of indigo so adulterated, the extraneous matter will be perceived in strata of a different colour.","sp":260,"ep":265},{"h":"INDIVIDUAL","t":"a particular being of any species, or that which cannot be divided into two or more beings equal or alike.\n\nThe usual division in logic is made into genera, or into genuses; those genera into species; and those species into individuals.","sp":265,"ep":265},{"h":"INDIVISIBLE","t":"among metaphysicians.\u2014A thing is said to be absolutely indivisible that is a simple being, and consists of no parts into which it may be divided.

See the article Parson.\n\nInduction is performed by a mandate from the bishop to the archdeacon, who usually issues out a precept to other clergymen to perform it for him. It is done by giving the clerk corporal possession of the church, as by holding the ring of the door, tolling a bell, or the like; and is a form required by law, with intent to give all the parishioners due notice and sufficient certainty of their new minister, to whom their tythes are to be paid. This therefore is the investiture of the temporal part of the benefice, as institution is of the spiritual. And when a clerk is thus presented, instituted, and inducted into a rectory, he is then, and not before, in full and complete possession; and is called in law persona imperfonata, or parson imparfonnee.","sp":266,"ep":266},{"h":"INDULGENCES","t":"in the Romish church, are a remission of the punishment due to sins, granted by the church, and supposed to save the sinner from purgatory.\n\nAccording to the doctrine of the Romish church, all the good works of the saints over and above those which were necessary towards their own justification, are deposited, together with the infinite merits of Jesus Christ, in one inexhaustible treasury. The keys of this were committed to St Peter, and to his successors the popes, who may open it at pleasure, and by transferring a portion of this superabundant merit to any particular person, for a sum of money, may convey to him either the pardon of his own sins, or a release for any one in whom he is interested, from the pains of purgatory. Such indulgences were first invented in the 11th century, by Urban II., as a recompense for those who went in person upon the glorious enterprise of conquering the Holy Land. They were afterwards granted to those who hired a soldier for that purpose; and in process of time were bestowed on such as gave money for accomplishing any pious work enjoined by the pope.\n\nThe power of granting indulgences has been great. Indulgently abused in the church of Rome. Pope Leo X., in order to carry on the magnificent structure of St Peter's at Rome, published indulgences, and a plenary remission, to all such as should contribute money towards it. Finding the project take, he granted to Albert elector of Mentz, and archbishop of Magdeburg, the benefit of the indulgences of Saxony and the neighbouring parts, and farmed out those of other countries to the highest bidders; who, to make the best of their bargain, procured the ablest preachers to cry up the value of the ware. The form of these indulgences was as follows: \"May our Lord Jesus Christ have mercy upon thee, and absolve thee by the merit of his most holy passion. And I, by his authority, that of his blest apostles Peter and Paul, and of the most holy Pope, granted and committed to me in these parts, do absolve thee, first from all ecclesiastical censures, in whatever manner they have been incurred; then from all thy sins, transgressions, and excesses, how enormous soever they may be, even from such as are referred for the cognizance of the holy see, and as far as the keys of the holy church extend: 'I remit to you all punishment which you deserve in purgatory on their account; and I restore you to the holy sacraments of the church, to the unity of the faithful, and to that innocence and purity which you professed at baptism; so that when you die, the gates of punishment shall be shut, and the gates of paradise of delight shall be opened: and if you shall not die at present, this grace shall remain in full force when you are at the point of death.' In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\"\n\nThe terms in which the retailers of indulgences described their benefits and the necessity of purchasing them, are so extravagant, that they appear almost incredible. If any man (said they) purchases letters of indulgence, his soul may rest secure with respect to its salvation. The souls confined in purgatory, for whose redemption indulgences are purchased, as soon as the money tinkles in the chest, instantly escape from that place of torment, and ascend into heaven. That the efficacy of indulgences was so great, that the most heinous sins, even if one should violate (which was impossible) the mother of God, would be remitted and expiated by them; and the person be freed both from punishment and guilt. That this was the unspeakable gift of God, in order to reconcile men to himself. That the cross erected by the preachers of indulgences was equally efficacious with the cross of Christ itself. \"Lo! the heavens are open; if you enter not now, when will you enter? For twelve pence you may redeem the soul of your father out of purgatory; and are you so ungrateful, that you will not refuse your parent from torment? If you had but one coat, you ought to strip yourself instantly, and sell it, in order to purchase such benefits,\" &c.\n\nIt was this great abuse of indulgences that contributed not a little to the first reformation of religion in Germany, where Martin Luther began first to declaim against the preachers of indulgences, and afterwards against indulgences themselves: but since that time the popes have been more sparing in the exercise of this power; however, they still carry on a great trade.\nIndult trade with them to the Indies, where they are purchased at two rials a-piece, and sometimes more.\n\nThe pope likewise grants indulgences to persons at the point of death; that is, he grants them, by a brief, power to choose what confessor they please, who is authorized thereby to absolve them from all their sins in general.","sp":266,"ep":267},{"h":"INDULT","t":"in the church of Rome, the power of presenting to benefices granted to certain persons by the pope.

In 1648 Pope Alexander VIII. and in 1668 Clement IX. granted the king an indult for the bishoprics of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, which had been yielded to him by the treaty of Munster; and in 1668 the same Pope Clement IX. granted him an indult for the benefices in the counties of Rouillon, Artois, and the Netherlands. The cardinals likewise have an indult granted them by agreement between Pope Paul IV. and the sacred college in 1555, which is always confirmed by the popes at the time of their election.

Hoffman says, that the human species are infants until they begin to talk, and children to the age of puberty.\u2014Anatomy discovers to us, that during infancy there is much imperfection in the human frame; e.g., its parts are disproportioned, and its organs incapable of those functions which in future life they are designed to perform. The head is larger in proportion to the bulk of the body than that of an adult. The liver and pancreas are much larger in proportion than in advanced life; their secretions are more in quantity also. The bile is very-inert; the heart is stronger and larger than in future life; the quantity of blood sent through the heart of an infant, in a given time, is also more in proportion than in adults. Though these circumstances have their important usefulness, yet the imperfection attending them subjects this age to many injuries and dangers from which a more perfect state is exempted.\nInfants have a larger proportion of brain than adults, hence are most subject to nervous disorders; and hence the diagnostics of diseases are in many respects obscure or uncertain, as particularly those taken from the pulse, which, from the irritability of the tender bodies of infants, is suddenly affected by a variety of accidents too numerous, and seemingly too trivial, to gain our attention. However, no very great embarrassment arises to the practitioner from hence: for the disorders in this state are generally acute, less complicated than those in adults, and are more easily discovered than is generally apprehended.","sp":267,"ep":268},{"h":"INFANT","t":"denotes a young child. See INFANCY.\n\nInfants, among the Jews, Greeks, and Romans, were swaddled as soon as they were born, in a manner similar to that practised by the moderns. The Jews circumcised and named their infant children on the 8th day from the birth. Upon the birth of a son, the Grecians crowned their doors with olive\u2014of a daughter, with wool. The infant was washed in warm water, and anointed with oil\u2014by the Spartans with wine; it was then dressed, and laid in a basket, or on a shield if the father was a warrior, particularly amongst the Spartans. At five days old they ran with it round the fire, and the mother's relations sent presents. The Greeks named their children on the tenth day, the Romans on the ninth: The naming was attended with sacrifices and other demonstrations of joy. The maternal office of suckling their own children was never declined, when circumstances would permit. How much different is this from the unnatural delicacy observed by modern mothers, a delicacy which to the child is cruelty! The 40th day was a day of solemnity for the mother. The names of children were registered both by the Greeks and Romans. See REGISTER.\n\nFor an account of the custom of exposing infants, see EXPOSING.\n\nInfants were kept from crying in the streets by means of a sponge soaked in honey. Nurses had also their bugbears and terrible names to frighten the children into peace.\u2014The figure with which they were principally intimidated was Megarctus, a sort of raw-headed and bloody bones.\n\nInfant, in Law, is a person under 21 years of age; whose capacities, incapacities, and privileges, are various.\n\n1. In criminal matters. The law of England does in some cases privilege an infant under the age of 21, as to common misdemeanors; so as to escape fine, imprisonment, and the like: and particularly in the cases of omission, as not repairing a bridge, or a highway, and other similar offenses; for, not having the command of his fortune till the age of 21, he wants the capacity to do those things which the law requires. But where there is any notorious breach of the peace, a riot, battery, or the like, (which infants when full-grown are at least as liable as others to commit;) for those, an infant above the age of 14 is equally liable to suffer as a person of the full age of 21.\n\nWith regard to capital crimes, the law is still more minute and circumspect; distinguishing with greater nicety the several degrees of age and discretion. By the ancient Saxon law, the age of twelve years was established for the age of possible discretion, when first the understanding might open; and from thence till the offender was 14, it was etas pubertatis proxima, in which he might, or might not, be guilty of a crime, according to his natural capacity or incapacity. This was the dubious stage of discretion; but, under twelve, it was held, that he could not be guilty in will, neither after fourteen could be supposed innocent, of any capital crime which he in fact committed. But by the law, as it now stands, and has stood at least ever since the time of Edward III., the capacity of doing ill, or contracting guilt, is not so much measured by years and days, as by the strength of the delinquent's understanding and judgment. For one lad of 11 years old may have as much cunning as another of 14; and in these cases our maxim is, that malitia supplet etatem. Under seven years of age, indeed, an infant cannot be guilty of felony; for then a felonious discretion is almost an impossibility in nature: but at eight years old, he may be guilty of felony. Also, under 14, though an infant shall be prima facie adjudged to be doli incapax, yet if it appear to the court and jury that he was doli capax, and could discern between good and evil, he may be convicted and suffer death. Thus a girl of 13 has been burnt for killing her mistress: and one boy of ten, and another of nine years old, who had killed their companions, have been sentenced to death, and he of ten years actually hanged; because it appeared upon their trials, that the one hid himself, and the other hid the body he had killed; which hiding manifested a consciousness of guilt, and a discretion to discern between good and evil. And there was an instance in the last century, where a boy of eight years old was tried at Abington for firing two barns; and, it appearing that he had malice, revenge, and cunning, he was found guilty, condemned, and hanged accordingly. Thus also, in very modern times, a boy of ten years old was convicted on his own confession of murdering his bedfellow; there appearing in his whole behaviour plain tokens of a mischievous disposition; and, as the sparing this boy merely on account of his tender years might be of dangerous consequence to the public, by propagating a notion that children might commit such atrocious crimes with impunity, it was unanimously agreed by all the judges, that he was a proper subject of capital punishment. But, in all such cases, the evidence of that malice, which is to supply age, ought to be strong and clear beyond all doubt and contradiction.\n\n2. In civil matters. The ages of male and female are different for different purposes. A male at 12 years old may take the oath of allegiance; at 14 is at the years of discretion, and therefore may consent or disagree to marriage, may choose his guardian, and, if his discretion be actually proved, may make his testament of his personal estate; at 17 may be an executor; and at 21 is at his own disposal, and may alienate his land, goods, and chattels. A female also at seven years of age may be betrothed or given in marriage; at nine is entitled to dower; at 12 is at years of maturity, and therefore may consent or disagree to marriage, and, if proved to have sufficient discretion, may bequeath her personal estate; at 14 is at years of legal discretion, and may choose a guardian; at 17 may be executrix; and at 21 may\nmay dispose of herself and her lands. So that full age in male or female is 21 years, which age is completed on the day preceding the anniversary of a person's birth; who till that time is an infant, and so styled in law. Among the ancient Greeks and Romans, women were never of age, but subject to perpetual guardianship, unless when married, nisi convenientem in manum viri; and when that perpetual tutelage wore away in process of time, we find that, in females as well as males, full age was not till 25 years. Thus by the constitution of different kingdoms, this period, which is merely arbitrary, and juris positivi, is fixed at different times. Scotland agrees with England in this point; (both probably copying from the old Saxon constitutions on the continent, which extended the age of minority ad annum vigesimum primum, et eo ulgue juvenes sub tutelam reponunt;) but in Naples persons are of full age at 18; in France, with regard to marriage, not till 30; and in Holland at 25.\n\nThe very disabilities of infants are privileges; in order to secure them from hurting themselves by their own improvident acts. An infant cannot be sued but under the protection, and joining the name, of his guardian; for he is to defend him against all attacks as well by law as otherwise; but he may sue either by his guardian, or prochein amy, his next friend who is not his guardian. This prochein amy may be any person who will undertake the infant's cause; and it frequently happens, that an infant, by his prochein amy, institutes a suit in equity against a fraudulent guardian.\n\nWith regard to estates and civil property, an infant hath many privileges. In general, an infant shall lose nothing by nonclaim, or neglect of demanding his right; nor shall any other laches or negligence be imposed on an infant, except in some very particular cases.\n\nIt is generally true, that an infant can neither alien his lands, nor do any legal act, nor make a deed, nor indeed any manner of contract, that will bind him. But still to all these rules there are some exceptions: part of which were just now mentioned in reckoning up the different capacities which they assume at different ages: and there are others, a few of which it may not be improper to recite, as a general specimen of the whole. And, first, it is true, that infants cannot alien their estates; but infant trustees, or mortgagees, are enabled to convey, under the direction of the court of chancery or exchequer, or other courts of equity, the estates they hold in trust or mortgage, to such person as the court shall appoint. Also it is generally true, that an infant can do no legal act: yet an infant, who has an advowson, may present to the benefice when it becomes void. For the law in this case dispenses with one rule, in order to maintain others of far greater consequence: it permits an infant to present a clerk (who, if unfit, may be rejected by the bishop), rather than either suffer the church to be unfurnished till he come of age, or permit the infant to be debarred of his right by lapse to the bishop. An infant may also purchase lands, but his purchase is incomplete; for, when he comes to age, he may either agree or disagree to it, as he thinks prudent or proper, without alleging any reason; and so may his heirs after him, if he dies without having completed his agreement. It is, farther, generally true, that an infant, under 21, can make no deed but what is afterwards voidable: yet in some cases he may bind himself apprentice by deed indented or indentures, for seven years; and he may by deed or will appoint a guardian to his children, if he has any.\n\nLastly, it is generally true, that an infant can make no other contract that will bind him: yet he may bind himself to pay for his necessary meat, drink, apparel, physic, and such other necessaries; and likewise for his good teaching and instruction, whereby he may profit himself afterwards.","sp":268,"ep":269},{"h":"INFANTE","t":"and INFANTA, all the sons and daughters of the kings of Spain and Portugal, except the eldest: the princes being called infantes, and the princesses infantas.","sp":269,"ep":269},{"h":"INFANTRY","t":"in military affairs, the whole body of foot-soldiers, whether independent companies or regiments.\u2014The word takes its origin from one of the infantas of Spain, who, finding that the army commanded by the king her father had been defeated by the Moors, assembled a body of foot-soldiers, and with them engaged and totally routed the enemy. In memory of this event, and to distinguish the foot-soldiers, who were not before held in much consideration, they received the name of infantry.\n\nHeavy-armed Infantry, among the ancients, were such as wore a complete suit of armour, and engaged with broad shields and long spears. They were the flower and strength of the Grecian armies, and had the highest rank of military honour.\n\nLight-armed Infantry, among the ancients, were designed for skirmishes, and for fighting at a distance. Their weapons were arrows, darts, or flings.\n\nLight Infantry, among the moderns, have only been in use since the year 1646. They have no camp equipage to carry, and their arms and accoutrements are much lighter than those of the infantry. Light infantry are the eyes of a general, and the givers of sleep and safety to an army. Wherever there is found light cavalry, there should be light infantry. They should be accustomed to the pace of four miles an hour, as their usual marching pace, and to be able to march at five miles an hour upon all particular occasions. Most of the powers on the continent have light infantry.

It appears by some passages in Martial, that a less decent use was made of infibulation among the luxurious Romans: for some ladies of distinction, it seems, took this method of confining their paramours to their own embraces. Juvenal also hints at some such practice. Celsus, a chaste author, says infibulation was sometimes practised for the sake of health, and that nothing destroys it more than the filly practice this operation seems intended to prevent. This practice is not perhaps likely to be revived; if, however, any one who has suffered in his constitution by prepotent venery, should be able to get children, and should be inclined to prevent the same misfortune in them by infibulation, the method of doing it is thus: The skin which is above the glans is to be extended, and marked on both sides with ink, where it is perforated, and then suffered to retract itself. If the marks recur upon the glans, too much of the skin has been taken up, and we must make the marks farther; if the glans remain free from them, they show the proper place for affixing a fibula; then pass a needle and thread through the skin where the marks are, and tie the threads together; taking care to move it every day, until the parts about the perforations are cicatrified: this being effected, take out the thread, and put in the fibula; which the lighter it is the better.\n\nAuthors have not determined what the fibula of the ancient surgeons was, though no doubt it was for different purposes.

That which shocks the feelings of those with whom we converse, cannot fail of attracting notice; and as the vain are usually confident, they utter their doubts with an air so oracular and decisive, as induces the simple to think them profoundly wise. Audacity, with little ingenuity, will attract the eyes of spectators, and this will sufficiently answer the purpose of many among the professed unbelievers. One might be diverted, if one were not hurt, at seeing a circle of silly admirers, gaping and fixing their eyes on some half-learned and impudent prater, who throws out oblique insinuations against the Bible, the clergy, or the sacrament. These are fertile topics of wit and ingenuity; but it might mortify the vanity of some very vain writers and talkers, if they were to recollect, what is undoubtedly true, that it is a species of wit and ingenuity which not only the vilest, but the most stupid and illiterate of mankind, have frequently displayed in all its possible perfection.\n\nThere is indeed no doubt, but that vanity is one of the principal causes of infidelity. It must be the sole cause of communicating it to others, by writing or conversation. For let us suppose the case of a very humane, judicious, and learned man, entertaining doubts of the truth of Christianity: if he cannot clear his doubts by examination, he will yet recollect that doubts are no certainties; and, before he endeavours to propagate his scepticism, he will ask himself these questions: \"Am I quite convinced that what I doubt of cannot possibly be true? If I am convinced of it, am I sure that the publication of my opinions will not do more harm than good? Is not the disturbing of any long-established civil constitution attended with confusion, rebellion, bloodshed, and ruin? And are not the majority of men more strongly attached to the religion than the government of their forefathers? Will it serve my country to introduce discontent of any species? May not those innovations in religion, which discontent may introduce, lead to all the evils which are caused by frenzy and fanaticism? Granting that I were able to make a party formidable enough to crush opposition and to exterminate Christianity, still am I certain that I act, in this instance, like a good member of society? For is not this system, whether well or ill founded, friendly to society? I must confess it; its greatest enemies have acknowledged it. What motive then can induce me to divulge my doubts of its authenticity? Not the good of mankind; for it is already allowed by unbelievers, that the good of mankind is interested in the belief of its divine original. Is it for my\nmy own good, and with a view to be convinced? I will not deceive myself; my motive, I suspect, is of another kind; for do I read those books which have been already written to satisfy similar doubts? Nothing but the vanity of appearing to be wiser than my credulous neighbours can induce me to interrupt the happiness of their belief. But vanity of this sort, which tends to disturb society, to injure the national morals, and to rob many thousand individuals of a copious source of sweet and solid comfort, must be pronounced extreme wickedness, even according to the obvious dictates of natural religion. I shall act the part of a good citizen and a good man, by conforming to a system whose beneficial influence I feel and confess, and by endeavouring to acquire a belief in that which has for so many centuries been established, and which promises to soothe me in distress with the sweetest consolations, and to brighten the dismal hour of death, by the hope of a more glorious and happy state of existence. At all events, I shall have the satisfaction of having commanded myself so far, as not to have run the hazard of endangering the welfare of my fellow-creatures, either here or hereafter, by indulging a degree of vanity, which, in a creature so weak and so short-lived as myself, is a folly very inconsistent with the superior wisdom which I seem to arrogate.\n\n\"I will venture to repeat (continues our author), that all writers against Christianity, however they may affect even the extremes of benevolence, honour, philosophy, and enlargement of mind, are actuated by vanity and wickedness of heart. Their motives are as mean, selfish, narrow, and in every respect unjustifiable, as the tendency of their writings is mischievous. Their malice is often impotent, through the foolish sophistry of their arguments; but, if ever it be successful, it is highly injurious: and indeed, considering their motives and the probable consequences of their endeavours, the infidel writer is a greater enemy to society, and consequently guiltier, according to all the principles of social union, than the thief or the traitor. Persecution would, however, only promote his cause, and his proper punishment is contempt.\n\n\"It is certainly no derogation from the character of a man of sense, to conform, even while he is so unfortunate as to doubt their truth, to the opinions of his country. His conformity will probably lead him to a train of actions and of thought, which, in due time, will induce him to believe. But, if that should not happen, yet he will act, as very wise and very great men have acted, in paying a respectful deference to the avowed conviction of others. The most intelligent and powerful men of ancient Rome, not only appeared to believe a very absurd and hurtful system, but afflicted in all its ceremonies as priests. Even Socrates, who evidently entertained some notions adequate to the dignity of the one great and supreme Being, yet thought it was a duty which he owed to his country, so far to conform to the wretched establishment, as to order in his dying words a sacrifice to \u00c6sculapius. This external conformity to the national religion ought not to be confounded with hypocrisy. If indeed it is carried to extremes, or zealously affected, it certainly is very blamable and contemptible deceit; but while it keeps within the bounds of reason and moderation, it ought to be called a decent deference to the opinions of the majority, arising from humility, and from a desire to maintain the tranquillity of the state, and to continue an innocent and useful system, which has and will always greatly contribute to lessen the quantity and degree both of moral and of natural evil.\n\n\"The easiest, after all, or at least the most effectual method of appearing in any character, is really to be what we wish to appear. But belief, you will say, is not in our power, and how can we believe what appears to us incredible? Certainly you cannot while it appears incredible. But let me ask you, whether you have taken any pains to believe, or have at once and at a glance persuaded yourself, that the Christian religion is totally false? It is probable that a great number of sceptical writers never gave themselves the trouble to read those Scriptures which they warmly oppose. They hear objections, they read objections, and they find, that from men of reputed wit and ingenuity the objections often originate. They also wish to be reputed men of wit and ingenuity, and therefore eagerly adopt the language and sentiments of the order. Perhaps the vanity and pride of this class of men will render all attempts to convince them abortive; but to modest doubters, and to those whose good sense and good dispositions lead them to wish to adopt the religion of their country, it may not be useless to suggest advice, with a view to facilitate their conviction.\n\n\"The chief thing required is to free themselves from the pride of human reason. Humility (and surely our blindness and imperfections are sufficient to render us humble, if we would be reasonable), humility will open our hearts, and belief will find admission. Sincere endeavours, seconded by prayers, will never fail to help our unbelief. But, alas! a fine, gay, spirited, liberal, and enlarged modern philosopher, would be ashamed to be found on his knees, or with a Testament in his possession. There is scarcely any vicious act, or any vicious book, which would put him so much to blush.\n\n\"A modest well-meaning man might, however, one should think, direct himself of those prejudices which prevent the possibility of belief, by the following folio:\n\n\"I find myself placed in a world abounding with evil and misery. Under the immediate pressure of it, I feel my heart inclining, like the needle to the north, by its natural tendency, to the Deity for support. Man, of all animals, is the only one who has the sense of religion. Feeling this distinctive propensity of my nature, I look around to discover to what object, and in what manner, that part of my fellow creatures, who live in the same society with myself, pay their adoration. I find a system of religion already established, and which has been established in the most enlightened countries of the earth near 2000 years. I resolve to examine it. It claims that respect from its antiquity and universality. Many difficulties appear on the first inspection. My reason is often startled, and my belief wavering. But I will not yet give up a point of so serious importance, without further and closer attention to it. I reflect, that 2000 years is a vast space in the age of the world. How many myriads of men like myself have lived and died in the faith during that time! And were all of them fools or hypocrites?\"\ncrites? It could not have been. Can the understanding of a poor individual, just come into the world, and hardly knowing where he is, comprehend on intuition an object of such magnitude, and make the mighty discovery which has elapsed millions of the wisest and most learned of mortals? Or, supposing that they all perceived the deception, am I then at last the only honest man who will confess it? I am ashamed to avow such an idea to myself. But yet, if I reject what they received, surely I avow it in the more expressive language of my conduct. Pride, I fear, is the foundation of my skepticism; and humility must form the basis of my belief. I will check my own presumption, and reject the cavils of vain and foolish philosophy. Shall a poor weak creature, who cometh up like a flower, and is cut down, who fleeth as a shadow, and never continueth in one stay, presume to pronounce decisively in that little period, in which he has scarcely time to look about him before he dies, against a system which has strong internal and external evidence of divine original, which is most useful and comfortable, and which has been admitted among a great portion of mankind during almost 20 centuries? No, it is the first wisdom to be humble. Humility will be followed by grace, and grace by faith, and faith by salvation. It plainly appears, that I can lose nothing by belief, but some of those excessive and irregular enjoyments, which would destroy my health and life; but I may possibly gain a glory and a happiness which shall continue to all eternity.\"","sp":270,"ep":272},{"h":"INFINITE","t":"that which has neither beginning nor end: in which sense God alone is infinite.\n\nINFINITE is also used to signify that which has had a beginning, but will have no end, as angels and human souls.

The very idea of magnitudes infinitely great, or such as exceed any assignable quantities, does include a negation of limits; yet if we nearly examine this notion, we shall find that such magnitudes are not equal among themselves, but that there are really, besides infinite length and infinite area, three several sorts of infinite solidity, all of which are quantitates sui generis, and that those of each species are in given proportions.\n\nInfinite length, or a line infinitely long, is to be considered either as beginning at a point, and so infinitely extended one way, or else both ways from the same point; in which case the one, which is a beginning infinity, is the one half of the whole, which is the sum of the beginning and ceasing infinity; or, as may be said, of infinity \u00e0 parte ante and \u00e0 parte post, which is analogous to eternity in time and duration, in which there is always as much to follow as is past, from any point or moment of time; nor doth the addition or subduction of finite length, or space of time, alter the case either in infinity or eternity, since both the one or the other cannot be any part of the whole.","sp":272,"ep":272},{"h":"INFINITESIMALS","t":"among mathematicians, are defined to be infinitely small quantities.\n\nIn the method of infinitesimals, the element, by which any quantity increases or decreases, is supposed to be infinitely small; and is generally expressed by two or more terms, some of which are infinitely less than the intuitive self; which being neglected as of no importance, the remaining terms form what is called the difference of the proposed quantity. The terms that are neglected in this manner, as infinitely less than the other terms of the element, are the very same which arise in consequence of the acceleration or retardation of the generating motion, during the infinitely small time in which the element is generated: so that the remaining terms express the elements that would have been produced in that time, if the generating motion had continued uniform: therefore those differences are accurately in the same ratio to each other as the generating motions or fluxions. And hence, though in this method infinitesimal parts of the elements are neglected, the conclusions are accurately true without even an infinitely small error, and agree precisely with those that are deduced by the method by fluxions.

See PROSECUTION.\n\nInformations are of two sorts; first, those which are partly at the suit of the king, and partly at that of a subject; and secondly, such as are only in the name of the king. The former are usually brought upon penal statutes, which inflict a penalty upon conviction of the offender, one part to the use of the king, and another to the use of the informer. By the statute 31 Eliz. c. 5, no prosecution upon any penal statute, the guilt and benefit whereof are limited in part to the king and in part to the prosecutor, can be brought by any common informer after one year is expired since the commission of the offence; nor on behalf of the crown, after the lapse of two years longer; nor, where the forfeiture is originally given only to the king, can such prosecution be had after the expiration of two years from the commission of the offence.\n\nThe informations that are exhibited in the name of the king alone, are also of two kinds: first, those which are truly and properly his own suits, and filed ex officio by his own immediate officer, the attorney-general; secondly, those in which, though the king is the nominal prosecutor, yet it is at the relation of some private person or common informer; and they are filed by the king's coroner and attorney in the court of king's bench, usually called the master of the crown-office, who is for this purpose the standing officer of the public. The objects of the king's own prosecutions, filed ex officio by his own attorney-general, are properly such enormous misdemeanors, as peculiarly tend to disturb or endanger his government, or to molest or affront him in the regular discharge of his royal functions. For offences so high and dangerous, in the punishing or preventing of which a moment's delay would be fatal, the law has given to the crown the power of an immediate prosecution, without waiting for any previous application to any other tribunal: which power, thus necessary, not only to the ease and safety, but even to the very existence, of the executive magistrate, was originally referred in the great plan of the English constitution, wherein provision is wisely made for the due preservation of all its parts. The objects of the other species of informations, filed by the master of the crown-office upon the complaint or relation of a private subject, are any gross and notorious misdemeanors, riots, batteries, libels, and other immoralities of an atrocious kind, not peculiarly tending to disturb the government (for those are left to the care of the attorney-general), but which, on account of their magnitude or pernicious example, deserve the most public animadversion. And when an information is filed, either thus, or by the attorney-general ex officio, it must be tried by a petit jury of the county where the offence arises: after which, if the defendant be found guilty, he must refer to the court for his punishment. See a history and vindication of this mode of prosecution in the work cited on the margin, vol. iv. p. 309-312.\n\nINFORMER (informator) in Law, a person that informs against, or prosecutes in any of the king's courts, those that offend against any law or penal statute. See INFORMATION.\n\nInformers were very common both in Greece and Rome. Every corner of the streets was peopled with swarms of turbulent rascals, who made it their constant business to pick up stories and catch at every occasion to accuse persons of credit and reputation: these by the Greeks were called \u03a3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2; for a more particular account of whom, see the article SYCOHANT.\n\nAmongst the Romans, informers were of two sorts, mandatores and delatores. These played into each other's hands; the former marking down such persons as they pretended to have found guilty of any misdemeanor, and the other prosecuting them. What tended to increase the number of these petition fellows was, that the informers were entitled to a fourth part of the effects of the person convicted. Wicked princes rewarded and countenanced this mischievous tribe; but Titus set on foot a most diligent search after them, and punished such as he found with death or banishment.

See GRATITUDE.\n\nIngratitude is a crime so shameful, that there never was a man found who would own himself guilty of it, and, though too frequently practised, it is so abhorred by the general voice, that to an ungrateful person is imputed the guilt or the capability of all other crimes.\n\nThe ungrateful are neither fit to serve their Maker, their country, nor their friends.\n\nIngratitude perverts all the measures of religion and society, by making it dangerous to be charitable and good natured. (See GRATITUDE.) However, it is better to expose ourselves to ingratitude than to be wanting in charity and benevolence.\n\nGreat minds, like Heav'n, are pleas'd with doing good; Though the ungrateful subjects of their favours Are barren in return.\n\n1. In a little work entitled Friendly Cautions to Officers, the following atrocious instance of ingratitude is related. An opulent city in the west of England, little used to have troops with them, had a regiment sent to be quartered there: the principal inhabitants and wealthiest merchants, glad to show their hospitality and attachment to their sovereign, took the first opportunity to get acquainted with the officers, inviting them to their houses, and showing them every civility in their power. This was truly a desirable situation. A merchant, extremely easy in his circumstances, took so prodigious a liking to one officer in particular, that he gave him an apartment in his own house, and made him in a manner absolute master of it, the officer's friends being always welcome to his table. The merchant was a widower, and had only two favourite daughters; the officer in so comfortable a station cast his wanton eyes upon them; and too fatally succeeding, ruined them both. Dreadful return to the merchant's misplaced friendship! The consequence of this ungenuous action was, that all officers ever after were thumped as a public nuisance, as a pest to society: nor have the inhabitants perhaps yet conquered their aversion to a red-coat.\n\n2. We read in Rapin's History, that during Monmouth's rebellion, in the reign of James II., a certain person knowing the humane disposition of one Mrs Gaunt, whose life was one continued exercise of benevolence, fled to her house, where he was concealed and maintained for some time. Hearing, however, of the proclamation, which promised an indemnity and reward to those who discovered such as had harboured the rebel, he betrayed his benefactress; and such was the spirit of justice and equity which prevailed among the ministers, that he was pardoned and recompensed for his treachery, while she was burnt alive for her charity!\n\n3. The following instance is also to be found in the same history.\u2014Humphry Bannister and his father were both servants to and raised by the duke of Buckingham; who being driven to abscond, by an unfortunate accident befalling the army he had raised against the usurper Richard III., he without footman or page retired to Bannister's house near Salisbury, as to a place where he had all the reason in the world to expect security. Bannister, however, upon the king's proclamation promising 1000l. reward to him that should apprehend the duke, betrayed his master to John Merton high sheriff of Shropshire, who sent him under a strong guard to Salisbury, where the king then was, and there in the market-place the duke was beheaded. But Divine vengeance pursued the traitor Bannister; for demanding the 1000l. that was the price of his master's blood, King Richard refused to pay it him, saying, \"He that would be false to so good a master, ought not to be encouraged.\" He was afterwards hanged for manslaughter, his eldest son run mad and died in a hog-stye, his second became deformed and lame, and his third son was drowned in a small puddle of water. His eldest daughter was got with child by one of his carters, and his second was seized with a leprosy whereof he died.\u2014Hist. of Eng. 8vo. vol. i. p. 304.\n\nThe following barbarous instances are from ancient History.\n\n4. When Xerxes king of Persia was at Celene, a city of Phrygia, Pythius, a Lydian, who had his residence in that city, and next to Xerxes was the most opulent prince of those times, entertained him and his whole army with an incredible magnificence, and made him an offer of all his wealth towards defraying the expenses of his expedition. Xerxes, surprized and charmed at so generous an offer, had the curiosity to inquire to what a sum his riches amounted. Pythius made answer, that having the design of offering them to his service, he had taken an exact account of them, and that the silver he had by him amounted to 2500 talents (about 255,000l. sterling), and the gold to 4,000,000 of daries (about 1,700,000l. sterling), wanting 7000. All this money he offered him, telling him, that his revenue was sufficient for the support of this household. Xerxes made him very hearty acknowledgments, and entered into a particular friendship with him, but declined accepting his present. The same prince who had made such obliging offers to Xerxes, having desired a favour of him some time after, that out of his five sons who served in his army, he would be pleased to leave him the eldest, in order to be a comfort to him in his old age: the king was so enraged at the proposal, though so reasonable in itself, that he caused the eldest son to be killed before the eyes of his father, giving the latter to understand...\nthat it was a favour he spared him and the rest of his children. Yet this is the same Xerxes who is so much admired for his humane reflection at the head of his numerous army, \"That of so many thousand men, in 100 years time there would not be one remaining; on which account he could not forbear weeping at the uncertainty and instability of human things.\" He might have found another subject of reflection, which would have more justly merited his tears and affliction, had he turned his thoughts upon himself, and considered the reproaches he deserved for being the instrument of halting the fatal term to millions of people, whom his cruel ambition was going to sacrifice in an unjust and unnecessary war.\n\n5. Basilus Macedo the emperor, exercising himself in hunting, a sport he took great delight in, a great stag running furiously against him, fastened one of the branches of his horns in the emperor's girdle, and pulling him from his horse, dragged him a good distance, to the imminent danger of his life; which a gentleman of his retinue perceiving, drew his sword and cut the emperor's girdle asunder, which disengaged him from the beast, with little or no hurt to his person. But observe what reward he had for his pains: \"He was sentenced to lose his head for putting his sword so near the body of the emperor;\" and suffered death accordingly.","sp":274,"ep":275},{"h":"INGRESS","t":"in Astronomy, signifies the sun's entering the first cuspule of one of the four cardinal signs, especially Aries.","sp":275,"ep":275},{"h":"INGRIA","t":"a province of the Russian empire, lying on the gulf of Finland, being about 130 miles in length, and 50 in breadth.

He received the first part of his education at Westminster; and when he visited his father, who belonged to the court of Edward the Confessor, he was so fortunate as to engage the attention of Queen Editha. That amiable and learned princess took a pleasure in examining our young scholar on his progress in grammar, and in disputing with him in logic; nor did she ever dismiss him without some present as a mark of her approbation. From Westminster he went to Oxford, where he applied to the study of rhetoric, and of the Aristotelian philosophy, in which he made greater proficiency than many of his contemporaries. When he was about 21 years of age, he was introduced to William duke of Normandy (who visited the court of England, A.D. 1051, and made himself Ingulphus, so agreeable to that prince, that he appointed him his secretary, and carried him with him into his own dominions. In a little time he became the prime favourite of his prince, and the dispenser of all preferments, humbling some, and exalting others, at his pleasure; in which difficult station, he confessed, he did not behave with a proper degree of modesty and prudence. This excited the envy and hatred of many of the courtiers; to avoid the effects of which, he obtained leave from the duke to go in pilgrimage to the Holy Land. With a company of 30 horsemen, he joined Sigfrid duke of Mentz, who, with many German nobles, bishops, clergy, and others, was preparing for a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. When they were all united, they formed a company of no fewer than 7000 pilgrims. In their way they spent some time at Constantinople, performing their devotions in the several churches. In their passage through Lycia, they were attacked by a tribe of Arabs, who killed and wounded many of them, and plundered them of a prodigious mass of money. Those who escaped from this disaster, at length reached Jerusalem, visited all the holy places, and bedewed the ruins of many churches with their tears, giving money for their reparation. They intended to have bathed in Jordan; but being prevented by the roving Arabs, they embarked on board a Genoese fleet at Joppa, and landed at Brundusium, from whence they travelled through Apulia to Rome. Having gone through a long course of devotions in this city, at the several places distinguished for sanctity, they separated, and every one made the best of his way into his own country. When Ingulph and his company reached Normandy, they were reduced to 20 half-starved wretches, without money, clothes, or horses: A faithful picture of the disastrous journey's end to the Holy Land, so common in those times. Ingulph was now so much disgusted with the world, that he resolved to forsake it, and became a monk in the abbey of Fontenelle in Normandy; in which, after some years, he was advanced to the office of prior. When his old master was preparing for his expedition into England, A.D. 1066, he was sent by his abbot, with 100 marks in money, and 12 young men, nobly mounted and completely armed, as a present from their abbey. Ingulph having found a favourable opportunity, presented his men and money to his prince, who received him very graciously; some part of the former affection for him reviving in his bosom. In consequence of this he raised him to the government of the rich abbey of Croyland in Lincolnshire, A.D. 1076, in which he spent the last 34 years of his life, governing that society with great prudence, and protecting their possessions from the rapacity of the neighbouring barons by the favour of his royal master. The lovers of English history and antiquities are much indebted to this learned abbot, for his excellent history of the abbey of Croyland, from its foundation, A.D. 664, to A.D. 1091, into which he hath introduced much of the general history of the kingdom, with a variety of curious anecdotes that are nowhere else to be found.

The best account of the method of injecting the sanguiferous vessels of animals, is that by the late Dr Monro, published in the Medical Essays, vol. i. p. 79.\n\n\"The instrument with which the liquor is commonly thrown into the vessels is a tight easy going syringe of brass, to which several short pipes are fitted, and can be fixed by screws, the other extremities of these pipes being of different diameters without any screw, that they may slide into other pipes, which are so exactly adapted to them at one end, that when they are pressed a little together, nothing can pass between them: and because their cohesion is not so great as to resist the injection pushing force of the injection, which would drive off this second pipe, and spoil the whole operation; therefore the extremity of this second sort of pipes, which receives the first kind, is formed on the outside into a square, bounded behind and before by a rising circle, which hinders the key that closely grasps the square part from sliding backwards or forwards; or a bar of brass must stand out from each side of it to be held with the fingers. The other extremity of each of these second sort of pipes is of different diameter; and near it a circular notch, capable of allowing a thread to be sunk into it, is formed; by this, the thread tying the vessel at which the injection is to be made, will not be allowed to slide off.\n\nBesides this form described, common to all this second sort of pipes, we ought to have some of the larger ones, with an additional mechanism, for particular purposes; as, for instance, when the larger vessels are injected, the pipe fastened into the vessel ought either to have a valve or a stop-cock, that may be turned at pleasure, to hinder any thing to get out from the vessel by the pipe; otherwise, as the injection, in such a case, takes time to congealate, the people employed in making the injection must either continue all that while in the same posture; or, if the syringe is too soon taken off, the injected liquor runs out and the larger vessels are emptied. When the syringe is not large enough to hold at once all the liquor necessary to fill the vessels, there is a necessity of filling it again. If, in order to do this, the syringe was to be taken off from the pipe fixed in the vessel, some of the injection would be lost, and what was exposed to the air would cool and harden; therefore some of the pipes ought to have a reflected curve tube coming out of their side, with a valve to dispose, that no liquor can come from the straight pipe into the crooked one, but, on the contrary, may be allowed to pass from the crooked to the straight one: the injector then, taking care to keep the extremity of the reflected pipe immersed in the liquor to be injected, may, as soon as he has pushed out the first syringeful, fill it again by only drawing back the sucker; and, repeating this quickly, will be able to throw several syringefuls into the vessels.\n\nAll these different sorts of pipes are commonly made of brass.\n\nThe liquors thrown into the vessels, with a design to fill the small capillary tubes, are either such as will incorporate with water, or such as are oily: both kinds have their advantages and inconveniences; which I shall mention in treating of each, and shall conclude with that which I have found by experience to succeed best.\n\nAll the different kinds of glue, or ichthyocolla, fish, common glue, &c., dissolved and pretty much diluted, mix easily with the animal fluids, which is of great advantage, and will pass into very small vessels of a well-chosen and prepared subject, and often answer the intention sufficiently, where the design is only to prepare some very fine membrane, on which no vessels can be expected to be seen so large as the eye can discover whether the transverse sections of the vessels would be circular, or if their sides are collapsed. But when the larger vessels are also to be prepared, there\nInjection, there is a manifest disadvantage to the usefulness and beauty of the preparation; for if nothing but the glutinous liquor is injected, one cannot keep a subject so long as the glue takes of becoming firm; and therefore, in directing the injected part, several vessels will probably be cut and emptied. To prevent this, one may indeed either soak the part well in alcohol, which coagulates the glue; but then it becomes so brittle, that the least handling makes it crack; and if the preparation is to be kept, the larger vessels appear quite shrivelled, when the watery part of the injection is evaporated: or the efflux of the injection may be prevented, by carefully tying every vessel before we are obliged to cut it; still, however, that does not hinder the vessels to contract when the glue is drying. It, to obviate these difficulties, the glutinous liquor should first be injected in such quantity as the capillary vessels will contain, and the common oily or waxy injection is pulled in afterwards to keep the larger vessels distended, the wax is very apt to harden before it has run far enough; the two sorts of liquors never mix to mix irregularly, and the whole appears interrupted and broken by their soon separating from each other; which is still more remarkable afterwards, when the watery particles are evaporated.\n\n\"Spirits of wine coloured mixes with water and oils, and so far is proper to fill the very smaller vessels with: but, on the other hand, it coagulates any of our liquor it meets, which sometimes blocks up the vessels too much, that no more injection will pass; then it scarce will suspend some of the powders that prove the most durable colours; and as it entirely evaporates, the vessels must become very small; and the small quantity of powder left, having nothing to serve for connecting its particles together, generally is seen so interrupted, that the small ramifications of vessels rather have the appearances of random scratches of a pencil, than of regular continued canals.\n\n\"Melted tallow, with a little mixture of oil of turpentine, may sometimes be made to fill very small vessels, and keeps the larger ones at a full stretch; but where any quantity of the animal liquors are still in the vessels, it is liable to stop too soon, and never can be introduced into numbers of vessels, which other liquors enter; and it is so brittle, that very little handling makes it crack, and thereby renders the preparation very ugly (a).\n\n\"The method I have always succeeded best with, in making what may be called fustile or fine injections, is, first throw in coloured oil of turpentine, in such a quantity as might fill the very small vessels; and, immediately after, to push the common coarse injection into the larger ones. The oil is fustile enough to enter rather smaller capillary tubes than any colouring can; its resinous parts, which remain after the spirituous injection is evaporated, give a sufficient adhesion to the particles of the substance with which it is coloured, to keep them from separating, and it intimately incorporates with the coarser injection; by which, if the injection is rightly managed, it is impossible or the sharpest eye to discover that two sorts have been made use of (b).\n\n\"All the liquors with which the vessels of animals are artificially filled, having very faint, and near the same colours, would not all appear in the very small vessels, because of their becoming entirely diaphanous, without a mixture of some substance to impart its colour to them; and where several sorts of even the largest vessels of any part were filled, one sort could not be distinguished from another, unless the colour of each was different; which has likewise a good effect in making preparations more beautiful. Wherefore anatomists have made use of a variety of such substances, according to their different fancies or intentions; such as gamboge, saffron, ink, burnt ivory, &c., which can be easily procured from painters. My design being only to consider those that are fit to be mixed with the injecting liquors proposed to fill capillary vessels, which is scarce ever to be done in any other, except the branches of the arteries and of some veins, I shall confine myself to the common colours employed to these last named two sorts of vessels, which colours are red, green, and sometimes blue, without mentioning the others, which require very little choice.\n\n\"Anatomists have, I imagine, proposed to imitate the natural colours of the arteries and veins in a living creature, by filling the arteries with a red substance, and the veins with a blue or green: from which, however, there are other advantages, such as the strong reflection which such bodies make of the rays of light, and the unaptitude most such bodies have to transmit these same rays, without at least a considerable reflection of the rays peculiar to themselves; or, in other words, their unfitness to become completely pellucid; without which, the very fine vessels, after being injected, would still be imperceptible. The animal or vegetable substances made use of for colouring injections, such as cochineal, lacquer, rad. anchusa, brazilwood, indigo, &c., have all one general fault of being liable to run into little knots which stop some of the vessels: their colour fades sooner when kept dry; they more easily yield their tincture when the parts are preserved in a liquor; and rats, mice, and insects, will take them for food: for which reasons, though I have frequently succeeded in injecting them, I rather prefer the mineral kind, such as minium or vermillion for red; of which this last is, in my opinion, the best, because it gives the brightest colour, and is commonly to be bought finely levigated. The green-coloured powder generally\n\n(a) Rigiterus (Introduct. in notitiam rerum natur. &c. 4to, Hogae, 1743; titul. Balzamum) gives Ruytch's method of injecting and preserving animals, which, he says, Mr Blumentroft, president of the Petersburg academy, assured him was copied from the receipt given in Ruytch's own hand-writing to the Czar. According to this receipt, melted tallow, coloured with vermillion, to which, in the summer, a little white wax was added, was Ruytch's injecting ceracia materies.\n\n(b) Mr Ranby's injecting matter, as published by Dr Hales, (H\u00e6mat. Ex. 21.) is white rosin and tallow, of each two ounces, melted and strained through linen; to which was added three ounces of vermillion, or finely ground indigo, which was first well rubbed with eight ounces of turpentine varnish.\ngenerally used is verdigris; but I rather choose that preparation of it called distilled verdigris; because its colour is brighter, and it does not so often run into small knots as the common verdigris, but dissolves in the oily liquors.\n\n\"The method of preparing the injection composed of these materials, is to take for the fine one, a pound of clear oil of turpentine, which is gradually poured on three ounces of vermillion, or distilled verdigris finely powdered, or rather well levigated by grinding on marble; stir them well with a small wooden spatula till they are exactly mixed, then strain all through a fine linen rag. The separation of the groser particles is, however, rather better made, by pouring some ounces of the oil upon the powder, and after stirring them together strongly, stop rubbing with the spatula for a second or so, and pour off into a clean vessel the oil with the vermillion or verdigris suspended in it; and continue this sort of operation till you observe no more of the powder come off; and all that remains is granulated. The coarser injection is thus prepared: Take tallow, 1 pound; wax, bleached white, 5 ounces; salad oil, 3 ounces; melt them in a skilful put over a lamp: then add Venice turpentine, 2 ounces; and as soon as this is dissolved, gradually sprinkle in of vermillion or verdigris prepared, 3 ounces; then pass all through a clean, dry, warmed linen-cloth, to separate all the groser particles; and, when you design to make it run far into the vessels, some oil of turpentine may be added immediately before it is used.\n\n\"The next thing to be considered, and indeed what chiefly contributes to the success of injections, is the choice and preparation of the subject whose vessels are to be filled.\n\n\"In choosing a fit subject, take these few general rules: 1. The younger the creature to be injected is, the injection will, exacter paribus, go farther, and vice versa. 2. The more the creature's fluids have been dissolved and exhausted in life, the success of the operation will be greater. 3. The less solid the part designed to be injected is, the more vessels will be filled. 4. The more membranous and transparent parts are, the injection flows better; whereas, in the solid very hard parts of a rigid old creature, that has died with its vessels full of thick strong blood, it is scarcely possible to inject great numbers of small vessels.\n\n\"Therefore, in preparing a subject for injecting, the principal things to be aimed at are, To dissolve the fluids, empty the vessels of them, relax the solids, and prevent the injection's coagulating too soon. To answer all these intentions, authors have proposed to inject tepid or warm water by the arteries, till it returns clear and untincted by the veins, and the vessels are thereby so emptied of blood, that all the parts appear white; after which, they push out the water by forcing in air; and lastly, by pressing with their hands, they squeeze the air also out. After this preparation,\n\none can indeed inject very subtilly; but generally there are inconveniences attend it. For in all the parts where there is a remarkable vacua cellulae, it never fails to be full of the water, which is apt to spoil any parts designed to be preserved either wet or dry; and some particles of the water seldom mix to be mixed in the larger as well as smaller vessels with the oily injection, and make it appear discontinued and broken: therefore it is much better to let this injection of water alone, if it can be possibly avoided, and rather to macerate the body or part to be injected a considerable time in water, made to warm (c) as one can hold his hand easily in it; taking care to keep it of an equal warmth all the time, by taking out some of the water as it cools, and pouring in hot water in its place; by which the vessels will be sufficiently softened and relaxed, the blood will be melted down, and the injection can be in no danger of hardening too soon; whereas, if the water is too hot, the vessels shrink, and the blood coagulates. From time to time we squeeze out the liquids as much as possible at the cut vessel by which the injection is to be thrown in (D). The time this maceration is to be continued, is always in proportion to the age of the subject, the bulk and thickness of what we design to inject, and the quantity of blood we observe in the vessels, which can only be learned by experience; at least, however, care ought to be taken, that the whole subject, or part macerated, is perfectly well warmed all through; and that we continue the pressure with our hands till no more blood can be brought away, whatever position we put the subject in.\n\nWhen the syringe, injections, and subjects, are all in readiness, one of the second sort of pipes is chosen, as near to the diameter of the vessel by which the injection is to be thrown as possible; for if the pipe is too large, it is almost needless to tell it cannot be introduced. If the pipe is much smaller than the vessel, it is scarcely possible to tie them so firmly together, but, by the wrinkling of the coats of the vessel, some small passage will be left, by which part of the injection will spring back on the injector in the time of the operation, and the nearest vessels remain afterwards undisturbed, by the loss of the quantity that oozes out. Having chosen a fit pipe, it is introduced at the cut orifice of the vessel, or at an incision made in the side of it; and then a waxed thread being brought round the vessel, as near to its coats as possible, by the help of a needle, or a flexible eyed probe, the surgeon's knot is made with the thread, and it is drawn as firmly as the thread can allow; taking care that it shall be sunk into the circular notch of the pipe all around, otherwise it will very easily slide off, and the pipe will be brought out probably in the time of the operation, which ruins it.\n\n\"If there have been large vessels cut, which communicate with the vessels you design to inject, or if there are any others proceeding from the same trunk, which\n\n(c) Ruysh orders a previous maceration for a day or two in cold water; which must have a better effect in melting the blood than warm water has.\n\n(D) When Ruysh intended to inject the whole body, he put one pipe upwards, and another downwards, in the descending aorta.\nInjection, which you do not resolve to fill, let them be all carefully now tied up, to save the injected liquor, and make the operation succeed better in the view you then have.\n\n\"When all this is done, both sorts of injections are to be warmed over a lamp, taking care to stir them constantly, lest the colouring powder fall to the bottom and burn (r). The oil of turpentine needs be made no warmer than will allow the finger to remain in it, if the subject has been previously well warmed in water; when the maceration has not been made, the oil ought to be scalding hot, that it may warm all the parts which are designed to be injected. The coarse injection ought to be brought near to a boiling. In the mean time, having wrapped several folds of linen round the parts of the syringe which the operator is to grip, and secured the linen with thread, the syringe is to be made very hot by sucking boiling water several times up (s), and the pipe within the vessel is to be warmed by applying a sponge dipped in boiling water to it (c).\n\n\"After all is ready, the syringe being cleared of the water, the injector fills it with the finer injection; and then introducing the pipe of the syringe into that in the vessel, he presses them together, and either with one hand holds this last pipe firm, with the other grips the syringe, and with his breast pushes the sucker; or, giving the pipe in the vessel to be held by an assistant, in any of the ways mentioned in the description of these sorts of pipes, he grips the syringe with one hand, and pushes the sucker with the other, and consequently throws in the injection, which ought to be done slowly, and with no great force, but proportioned to the length and bulk of the part to be injected and strength of the vessels. The quantity of this fine injection to be thrown in is much to be learned by use. The only rule I could ever fix to myself in this matter was to continue pushing till I was sensible of a stop which would require a considerable force to overcome. But this will not hold where all the branches of any vessel are not injected; as for instance, when the vessels of the thorax only are to be injected: for the aorta bears too great a proportion to the branches sent from it, and therefore less fine injection is requisite here. As soon as that stop is felt, the sucker of the syringe is to be drawn back, that the nearest large vessels may be emptied. Then the syringe is taken off, emptied of the fine injection, and filled with the coarser, which is to be pushed into the vessels quickly and forcibly, having always regard to the strength and firmness of the vessels, bulk, &c. of the part. Continue to thrust the sucker, till a full stop, or a sort of push backwards, is felt, when you must beware of thrusting any more, otherwise some of the vessels will be burst, and the whole, or a considerable share of the preparation you designed, will be spoiled by the extravasation; but rather immediately stop the pipe by the turn-cock, and take out the syringe to clean it, and allow sufficient time for the coarse injection to coagulate fully, before any part is discharged.\" Ruysh, immediately after throwing in the injection, put the body into cold water, and stirred it continually for some time, to prevent the vermilion to separate from the tallow.\"\n\nII. The injection of the lymphatic system is much more difficult than that of the sanguiferous, on account of the extreme smallness of the vessels; so that till very lately it was almost quite impracticable. Methods indeed had been attempted for this purpose; but by reason of the improper form of the instruments, and the inferior skill of anatomists in former times, we may justly look upon this as one of the most modern improvements in anatomy.\n\nThe first thing to be considered, when the lymphatics are to be injected, is a proper method of discovering them; for this is by no means an easy matter, on account of their smallness and transparency.\u2014To find out these vessels, the subject must be viewed in a proper place, where the light is neither very strong nor very weak. Mr Sheldon, who has written a treatise upon this subject, recommends a winter forenoon from ten to two; it being chiefly in the winter season that anatomical preparations are made, and because at that time of the day the light is more clear and steady. He says also, from his own experience, that the light passing through the glass of a window is better for this purpose than the open air, as the vessels are more distinctly seen. The injecting of the vessels is likewise rendered more difficult in the open air by the ease with which the humidity is evaporated from them. It will likewise be necessary to incline the part in various ways to the light, as some of the vessels are most easily discoverable in one position and some in another. The lacteal trunks under the peritoneal coats of the intestines, and the lymphatics on the external surface of the liver, &c., particularly require this method. He recommends the use of magnifying glasses. \"I am persuaded (says he), that those who attempt to find them through this medium will not acquire that visus cruditus which is obtained to a surprising degree by those who have been much experienced in injecting lymphatic vessels. A lateral light is likewise preferable to a horizontal, or even to an oblique sky-light.\n\n\"The subjects must be laid upon a table of sufficient height, which might be contrived with a ledge fixed to the table in such a manner as to be water-proof; which would be useful for preventing the quicksilver, which is almost always necessary for injecting these vessels, from being lost. The surface of the table should likewise be hollowed, so that the mercury which falls may be collected in the middle, where a hole with a stopper may be made to take out occasionally the quicksilver which collects. Such a table would also be convenient for holding water for the purpose of sleeping membranous parts which are frequently to be injected; and\n\n(r) Ruysh melts his tallow by the heat of warm water, into which he puts the vessels containing the injection.\n\n(s) He warms his syringe by laying it on hot coals.\n\n(c) He warms his pipe, by putting the body, after the pipe is fixed in the vessel, into hot water. When this is to be done, a cork ought to be put into the pipe, to prevent the water getting into the vessel that is to be injected.\nInjection, and which, from being exposed to the air, become dry; which also it is inconvenient and hazardous to move into water during the time of operation. Even a common table with a hole cut in the middle may answer the purpose: the hole may be round or square according to the fancy of the anatomist; but the table must be constructed of such materials as are not liable to warp in warm water. Should the anatomist not be provided with either of these tables, the parts must be laid in a tray or earthen dish, that the quicksilver may be saved.\n\nThe materials for injecting these vessels are only quicksilver, and the ceraceous or coarse injection of anatomists; the former being always used in injecting the lymphatics and lacteals, it being almost impossible to fill them with another fluid in the dead body. The ceraceous injection is chiefly used for the thoracic duct; and in some particular instances, where the lymphatic trunks have been found larger than the ordinary size, a coarse injection has been made use of.\n\nInjections of the lymphatics may be made even while the animal is alive, and that without any great cruelty, by feeding it with milk previous to its being strangled. Of all the barbarous methods of opening the animal while alive, the most useful seems to be that of Mr Hunter, who directs to perforate the small intestine, and throw in starch-water with solutions of mucus, or indigo and tar-water. \"In a word (says Mr Sheldon), any gelatinous fluids rendered opaque with such colours as will be absorbed, are extremely useful for experiments of this kind; for much more may be seen by examining the vessels distended with a coloured fluid from natural absorption, than by anatomical injection practised in the dead body.\" Lieberkuhn first discovered the ampullae by feeding children in whom the lacteal glands were obstructed previous to their death with milk; by which means not only the lacteal trunks became distended with chyle, but likewise the ampullae. Thus absorbing mouths of the lacteal vessels were discovered by Lieberkuhn; and in a similar manner Aeslinus discovered the lacteals themselves. Thus also Eustachius discovered the thoracic duct in a horse; and Mr Hewson traced the lacteal vessels, lymphatics, and thoracic duct, in birds, by making ligatures on the root of the meniscus, and other parts, which had been previously fed with barley. Mr Hunter likewise was enabled to observe the lacteals of a crocodile when distended with chyle.\n\nThe coarse injection for the lymphatics is made of mutton-fat and yellow resin, in the proportion of two thirds of resin to one of fat. If required of a thicker consistence, we may add a small quantity of pure wax: if of a softer quality, we may augment the quantity of fat: Orpiment or king's yellow is generally made use of; though others are equally proper, provided they be fine enough.\n\nThe instruments necessary for injecting the lymphatic vessels are the injecting tube and pipes, lancets, blow-pipes, knives, scissors, forceps, needles, and thread. The old injecting tube has been found in a manner entirely useless, the pipe being fixed in a glass tube two or three feet long; which is one of the reasons why, before the time of Hewson, so little of the lymphatic system could be injected. Tubes of such a length are entirely unmanageable by one person, and it is impossible to perform the operation properly with two. To perform it in the best manner, the instrument should be held in the hand like a pencil or pen. The instruments used by our author are tubes made either of glass or of brass; which, when filled with mercury, may be held in the hand like a pen: a glass tube, however, is preferable to the metallic one. It is somewhat in the shape of a trumpet; six inches and a half in length, an inch and a half broad where broadest, and three-eighths of an inch where narrowest. A collar of steel half an inch broad and three quarters of an inch long is cemented to this pipe, and a smaller tube of the same metal is screwed upon the end of the collar; the whole terminating in a capillary tube about an inch in length. This last is the most difficult part of the whole work to execute; it should be drilled out of a solid piece of metal, and not made of a thin bit of plate foldered, as these are apt to turn ragged in the edges, and the folder is also liable to be destroyed by the mercury. Those used by Mr Sheldon were made by drilling a small hole lengthwise through a bit of well-tempered wire. It is cleaned by means of a very small piece of steel-wire capable of passing through the bore of the tube. This ought to be annealed lest it should break; in which case the broken bit could not easily be got out. Very small tubes may be made of glass drawn out as fine as we choose; and though very apt to break, they are easily repaired. They ought to be very thin, that they may be easily melted. Sometimes it has been found convenient to fit the collar with a steel stop-cock.\n\nThe brass tube represented by our author is about nine inches and a half in length, and half an inch wide where widest. The collar is a full quarter of an inch broad, and three quarters of an inch long; a steel piece and capillary tube being screwed to it as in the other.\n\nThe lancets are to be exquisitely sharp, in order to cut into the lymphatic vessels. The latter are easily inflated by the small silver blow-pipes usually put up in the dissecting cases by the London mathematical instrument makers: dissecting knives, fine-pointed scissors, accurately made dissecting forceps, with straight or crooked needles, are likewise substituted with advantage, as not being affected by the quicksilver.\n\nWe must next consider the proper subjects for injection. Mr Sheldon recommends, that they should be as free from fat as possible: he has always found in the human subject those who died universally dropsical, or of an affections or anaemia, to be the best, for the following reasons, viz., in such there is little or no animal oil, and but a very small quantity of red blood; both of which, when they occur in great abundance, very much impede the discovery of the lymphatic vessels; but when the cellular vessels are loaded with water, the absorbents are more readily traced, and with less risk of wounding them in dissection: the preparations also, particularly the dried ones, are more lasting. This circumstance is found to be of most consequence in preparing the absorbent vessels of the trunk and extremities of the human subject. Of all the viscera in young subjects, only the liver and lungs can be injected with success; and these may be successfully injected even in the fetus. It will be most proper to begin the opera-\nInjection upon the subject immediately after death, as lymph or chyle will then be more readily found in the vessels, than when we wait a longer time. In preparing the lacteals, previously distended with milk in the living subject, it is proper to have the intestines and mesenteries plunged (with the ligature upon the root of the latter) into rectified spirit of wine. This process will coagulate the chyle; and the fluid being opaque, the vessels will be beautifully seen when we mean to prepare the parts, by preserving them in proof-spirit, as wet specimens: \"In this way (says Mr. Sheldon) I have made in the dog one of the most natural preparations that can be seen of the lacteals injected from their orifices by the natural absorption.\" We may also prepare the lacteals by the method used by Mr. Hunter, already mentioned; by which they will be very conspicuous, by the indigo absorbed from the cavity of the intestines. By tying the thoracic duct near its insertion into the angle formed between the subclavian and jugular veins on the left side, or by tying these veins on both sides, we may distend almost all the absorbents of the animal. Thus we are enabled to pursue these vessels in many parts where they have not yet been discovered, where they can scarcely be traced by injection, and even in some parts where it is utterly impossible for the injections to reach them.\n\nAnother method, sometimes successfully used by our author, was first practised by Malpighi. In this the part is to be steeped in water, and the liquid changed as long as it appears tinged with blood; suffering the parts afterwards to remain in the same water till the putrefaction begins. As soon as this begins to take place, the air which is extricated will distend the lymphatics, so that they may be easily seen, and then injected with quicksilver. It is, however, remarkable, that this method will not in general answer so well in the human species as in quadrupeds; the air having never passed by putrefaction into the human lacteals in any of the subjects which Mr. Sheldon tried, though it will take place in those of the horse or ass and many other animals: drawing of the lacteals may likewise be made in this method to very great advantage. In some parts of the human body also this method may be employed to advantage; as the liver, heart, &c. It may likewise be useful to make ligatures on the large trunks of the vessels previous to the maceration, that thus the air may be confined as soon as it is extricated from the coats by putrefaction. Our author adds, that if ligatures were made upon the wrists and legs in articulo mortis, or immediately after death, the lymph would be flopped in the vessels, the latter would become distended, and might be injected with the greatest facility by the common method after taking off the ligature. Mr. Sheldon in such a case recommends the tourniquet. \"I have reason (says he) to believe, that absorption goes on as long as muscular irritability remains; which last continues a considerable time after the general life of the animal is lost.\" On this, however, we cannot forbear to remark, that making ligatures for such purposes upon a human creature in articulo mortis, or even immediately after death, favours so much of barbarity, that we cannot think it will be often practised. In some cases, even in the dead subject, ligatures are useful; as when we are searching for the lymphatics in the fingers and toes.\n\nIn these it is useful to stroke up the parts with the injection finger, by which means the small quantity of lymph remaining in the vessels will be forced upwards, and stopped by the ligature; after which the vessels may be easily injected with quicksilver, as already mentioned.\n\nTo inject the vessels, we must open one or more of them, directing the point of the lancet almost always towards the trunk or trunks of the vessels, and taking care not to carry the incision through the opposite side. If the vessels happen to lie under the peritoneum as the lacteals, or under the pleura as the lymphatics of the lungs, we may cut into their cavity through these membranes. In injecting those of the extremities, however, and in many other parts of the body, it is absolutely necessary to distend the vessels we design to fill away from the fat and reticular substance before we attempt to open them with the lancet. The tube with the pipe affixed to it is previously to be filled with mercury; the anatomist then inflates the vessel by means of the blow-pipe, takes the tube from the afflant, and introduces the small tube into the puncture. In this operation it will be found necessary not to carry the tube farther into the vessel than is sufficient to give the mercury a free passage; for if we introduce it farther, the passage of the mercury will be impeded by the pipe being pushed against the side of the vessel. Should not the fluid be able to effect a passage, it will then be necessary to press upon the surface of it in the tube with our fingers. If it defend freely, and without any of its puffing between the side of the vessel and small pipe, we have only to fill up the tube with mercury as the latter defends; but if it gets out, we must then tie the vessel. This, however, should always be avoided if possible; because, if not very dexterously performed, the operator will be apt to separate the tube from the vessel; and on this account the puncture ought always to be very small, no larger indeed than is necessary to allow the pipe to get in with difficulty. As the injection proceeds, the pressure upon the surface of the quicksilver must be carried on higher and higher in the course of the lymphatic, till we come near the gland or glands into which the vessels terminate; otherwise we shall seldom get the cells of the glands, or the vessels emerging from the opposite side of the glands, well injected. In injecting the lymphatic vessels of the extremities, it will be useful to raise the part where the pipe is inserted higher than the other end of the limb, and to make the afflant press with his hands along the skin in the course of the vessels, which will favour the progress of the injection. When the vessels are sufficiently filled, which may be known by the swelling of them, and by the resistance the mercury meets with, the afflant passes a ligature about the vessel and ties it above the puncture before the anatomist withdraws the injection-pipe.\n\nThe method of injecting the larger trunks or thoracic duct with the coarse injection is exactly similar to that already described for the fangiferous vessels. Mr. Sheldon, however, recommends the use of some pipes of a particular construction invented by himself. The improvement consists in shaping the ends of the pipes like a pen; taking care to make the edges and point blunt, to avoid cutting the vessel when we introduce them. Thus much larger tubes than those commonly\nInjection only in use may be admitted; and there is no occasion to make any bulb or ring near the extremity of these small pipes to prevent the thread from slipping off; for this will certainly hinder us from inserting pipes of such diameter as might otherwise be done.\n\nHaving thus shown the method of injecting the lymphatics, our author next proceeds to describe the method of dissecting and preparing them either for immediate demonstration, or for preservation for any length of time. In the dissection, great care is requisite, on account of the exquisite thinness of their coats; but if this should happen by accident, it will then be necessary to introduce the pipe at the ruptured part; and having secured it above and below with ligatures, to fill it again as before directed. Our author recommends, for the purpose of dissection, such knives as are made use of by the Germans and French in tracing the nerves. They must be made thin in the blade like lancets, and not much larger. A variety of different shaped blades, some single and others double edged, will be necessary for various parts of the body; the fault of the common dissecting knife being that they are too thick in the blade, which makes them soon blunt, and occasions the trouble of perpetual grinding, which is not the case with those just recommended. A sharp-pointed forceps is necessary, in order to lay fast hold of the smallest portion of cellular substance; but they ought not to be so sharp as to endanger the puncturing of the vessels; nor should they by any means be bowed or stiff in the spring, to prevent the fingers of the operator from being wearied in the operation. They should also be made in such a manner as to hold large as well as small portions of reticular substance. For dissections of this kind, fine-pointed scissors and lancets fixed in handles are sometimes necessary; and it is frequently of use to plunge the parts into water, in order to loosen the reticular membrane connected with the outside of the coats of the vessels; by which means they may be dissected more easily, and with less danger of wounding them. The blood may be extracted by frequently changing the water. After being injected with quicksilver, the parts should not be allowed to remain long in the water, because the volatile alkali formed by putrefaction is apt to change the colour of the mercury.\n\nThe dissection being performed, the preparation is then to be preserved either in a wet or dry state, according to its nature. Preparations of the larger parts, as the trunk or extremities, should be preserved dry; and to dry them effectually, they should be exposed to a free current of air, but not to the rays of the sun; and the vessels should be displayed in their natural situation. When fully dried, they ought then to be varnished over with transparent spirit or copal varnish: which will not only preserve them from insects, but render them more beautiful, and the vessels more conspicuous. They should then be inclosed in glass cases, where they are to be placed in a horizontal position, and handled as little as possible.\n\nTo make preparations of the thoracic duct, we must in the first place fill the aorta, vena cava superior, and vena azygos or intercostalis, with coarse injection; then fill, with the same, the vessels below the right crus or little muscle of the diaphragm. The duct is sometimes prepared with quicksilver; but Mr Sheldon recommends to anatomists to make drawings of any thing new or remarkable in their preparations of the thoracic lymphatic vessels with quicksilver; as most of those specimens, particularly such as are dried, become at last totally useless by reason of the drying of the vessels and the escape or blackening of the mercury; or from the varnish growing more and more opaque with age. The quicksilver injection, however, in some cases is very useful. Thus, for instance, if we wish to demonstrate the valves in the thoracic duct, or any other large absorbent vessel, we need only inject the vessels with quicksilver, dissect and dry them, then cut them open, and let the mercury run out: after which the valves will appear by making sections in the coats of the vessels. This may be done still better by varnishing the vessels three or four times before the sections are made; because the varnish will strengthen the sides of the vessel. In wet preparations the valves in the cavities of these parts may likewise be demonstrated by opening them; or by inverting the vessels and suspending them in proof malt-spirits. Thus the valves that cover the terminations of the thoracic duct on the inside of the angle formed between the jugular and subclavian veins on the left side, and those which terminate the lymphatics on the right side of the neck, arm, and lungs, may be beautifully demonstrated. Specimens of the lacteal vessels, of the absorbents of the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, diaphragm, kidneys, &c., may be kept wet or dry, according to the particular nature of the preparation or view of the anatomist. Some preparations are the better for being dried and afterwards immersed in phials full of oil of turpentine; by which means the flesh will be rendered transparent, the vessels distinctly seen, and the vessels appear extremely beautiful. The only disadvantage of this method is, that the parts on which the vessels pass, do not at all preserve their natural bulk by reason of their shrinking up; and as the wet preparations are free from this inconvenience, Mr Sheldon does not hesitate at afflicting them a decided superiority over the dry ones.\u2014Sometimes it is necessary to fix the preparations upon stiff paper or pasteboard, on account of their weight after being injected with mercury. The paper or pasteboard on which they are fastened ought to be of various colours, according to the nature of the preparation, in order to form a proper ground for showing the lymphatic vessels. Such small preparations as are preserved in spirits, or oil of turpentine, may be kept in bottles well closed with stoppers; and the larger in common preparation glasses. Our author describes a simple method of stopping the mouths of these preparation glasses, by which means the stopper is rendered nearly as durable as the glass itself. \"In order to execute it, let the anatomist take care to have the upper surface of his bottles made plain, by desiring the workmen at the glass-house to flatten them in the making. This they will easily do in forming the round ones, but the flat bottles are attended with considerable difficulty. The right way to make them, I believe, would be to blow them in moulds of various sizes; the workman should likewise form the bottoms of the bottles perfectly flat, that they may stand upright and steady.\" Bottles of this form being provided for the larger preparations, we grind the upper surface of them on a plain plate of lead, about a quarter of an inch thick, and two feet in diameter; first with fine emery and water,\nInjection, ter, then with powdered rotten stone, or putty first wet with water and at last dry; so that the surface may be reduced to an exact horizontal plane, and of as fine a polish as plate-glass. This will soon be done, as the manoeuvre requires but little dexterity; and the anatomist should be provided with a considerable number of these glasses prepared as above directed. To the top of each bottle a piece of plate-glass, cut by a diamond, is to be adapted so as completely to cover, but not project over, the edge of the bottle. When these two smooth surfaces are put upon each other, with a drop of water between, the attraction of cohesion is so considerable, that it requires great force to separate them.\n\nMany preparations of the lymphatics, and other parts preserved in bottles, do not require any strings to suspend them; particularly when fixed on plateboard or paper; such as require suspension should be tied to strings fixed to the preparation below, and to small holes drilled in the substance of the glass at the bottom of the neck; or to small bits of glass that may be fixed on the inside of the same part. The preparation is thus suspended in limpid proof malt-spirit, the bottle being almost completely filled; the upper and polished surface of the bottle, and the plate of glass, are to be wiped clean and dry; a drop of solution of gum arabic is to be put on the polished surface of the bottle, the top strongly and steadily pressed upon it, so as to bring the two surfaces into as close contact as possible; after which the bottle is to be placed in a cool airy place to dry. A piece of wet ox-bladder, freed from fat, and soaked in water till it becomes mucilaginous, is then to be placed over the top, the air pressed out from between it and the glass; after which it must be tied with a packthread dipped in the solution of gum arabic. The bladder being cut off neatly under the last turn of the thread, is then to be dried, the string taken cautiously off, and the top and neck painted with a composition of lamp-black mixed with japanners gold size; this soon dries, and leaves a fine smooth glossy surface, from which the dirt can at any time be readily wiped off as from a mirror. By this method large bottles are as easily and effectually secured as small ones; and it is found to answer as well as the hermetical sealing of glasses, which in large vessels is altogether impracticable. If the bottoms have any inequalities which prevent them from standing steady, they may be easily made perfectly flat by grinding them with emery on the plate above-mentioned. The tops, if well gummed, will even remain perfectly fixed on the glasses without the bladder; though in the common upright ones it may be advisable to put it on as a defence. Our author informs us, that since his making this discovery, he has used glass faucets; with flat tops gummed on. In these vessels the preparations, by reason of their horizontal posture, appear to great advantage. Thus he has exhibited very early abortions in their membranes, and some other preparations that cannot be suspended or viewed conveniently in the perpendicular direction. Some very delicate preparations, particularly those intended to be viewed with the microscope, those of the ampullae lacteae of Lieberk\u00fchn, and of the valves of the absorbers, may be preserved either in spirits or dry in tubes closed in the manner just mentioned, and will appear to great advantage. Some of the dry ones may also be advantageously placed in square oblong boxes, made of pieces of plate or white glass neatly gummed together, with narrow slips of white or coloured paper, and the objects may be conveniently viewed in this manner. With respect to the stopper bottles, which are very convenient for holding small preparations, our author advises the stoppers to be perfectly well ground; that they pass rather lower down than the neck of the bottle for the convenience of drilling two holes obliquely through the inferior edge of the substance of the stopper, opposite to each other, for the convenience of fixing threads to hold the subject; for if the threads pass between the neck and stopper, a space will be left; or if the stopper be well ground, the neck of the bottle will be broken in endeavouring to press it down. On the other hand, if any space be left, the thread, by its capillary attraction, will act from capillary attraction, raise the spirits from the bottle, and cause evaporation, which will likewise take place from the chink between the stopper and neck.","sp":276,"ep":283},{"h":"INJUNCTION","t":"in Law, a writ generally grounded upon an interlocutory order or decree out of the court of chancery or exchequer, sometimes to give possession to the plaintiff, for want of the defendant's appearance; sometimes to the king's ordinary court, and sometimes to the court-chancellor, to stop proceedings in a cause, upon suggestion made, that the rigour of the law, if it take place, is against equity and conscience in that case, that the complainant is not able to make his defense in these courts, for want of witnesses, &c. or that they are erroneously, denying him some just advantage.

The properties which this liquor ought to have, are,\nTo flow freely from the pen, and sink a little into the paper, that the writing be not easily discharged.\n\n2. A very deep black colour, which should be as deep at first as at any time afterwards.\n\n3. Durability, so that the writing may not be subject to decay by age.\n\n4. Ink should be destitute of any corrosive quality, that it may not destroy the paper, or go through it in such a manner as to render the writing illegible.\n\nNo kind of ink, however, hath yet appeared which is possessed of all these qualities. The ink used by the ancients was possessed of the second, third, and fourth qualities above-mentioned, but wanted the first. Dr Lewis hath discovered its composition from some passages in ancient authors. \"Pliny and Vitruvius (says he) expressly mention the preparation of soot, or what we now call lamp-black, and the composition of writing-ink from lamp-black and gum. Dioscorides is more particular, setting down the proportions of the two ingredients, viz. three ounces of the foot to one of the gum. It seems the mixture was formed into cakes or rolls; which being dried in the sun, were occasionally tempered with water; as the cakes of Indian ink are among us for painting.\"\n\nIn Mr Delaval's Treatise on Colours, p. 37, he acquaints us, that with an infusion of galls and iron filings, he had not only made an exceedingly black and durable ink, but by its means, without the addition of any acid, dyed silk and woollen cloth of a good and lasting black. This kind of ink, however, though the colour is far superior to that of any other, has the inconvenience of being very easily discharged, either by the smallest quantity of any acid, or even by simple water; because it does not penetrate the paper in such a manner as is necessary to preserve it from the instantaneous action of the acid or of the water. During the action of the infusion of galls upon the iron in making this kind of ink, a very considerable effervescence takes place, and a quantity of air is discharged, the nature of which has not yet been examined.\n\nThe materials usually employed for the making of ink are, common green vitriol, or copperas and galls; but almost all of them are deficient in durability, which is a property of such importance, that Dr Lewis hath thought the subject of ink-making not unworthy of his attention. From experiments made by that author, he infers, that the decay of inks is chiefly owing to a deficiency of galls; that the galls are the most perishable ingredient, the quantity of these, which gives the greatest blackness at first (which is about equal parts with the vitriol), being insufficient to maintain the colour: that, for a durable ink, the quantity of galls cannot be much less than three times that of the vitriol; that it cannot be much greater without lessening the blackness of the ink: that by diminishing the quantity of water, the ink is rendered blacker and more durable; that distilled water, rain-water, and hard spring-water, have the same effects: that white wine produces a deeper black colour than water; that the colour produced by vinegar is deeper than that by wine; that proof-spirit extracts only a reddish brown tinge; that the last-mentioned tincture sinks into, and spreads upon, the paper; and hence the impropriety of adding spirit of wine to ink, as is frequently directed, to prevent moulding or freezing; that other astringents, as oak-bark, bittern, floe-bark, &c. are not so effectual as galls, nor give so good a black, the colour produced by most of these, excepting oak-bark, being greenish; that the juice of floes does not produce a black colour with martial vitriol; but that, nevertheless, the writing made with it becomes black, and is found to be more durable than common ink: that inks made with saturated solutions of iron, in nitrous, marine, or acetic acids, in tartar, or in lemon juice, were much inferior to the ink made with martial vitriol: that the colour of ink is depraved by adding quicklime, which is done with an intention of destroying any superabundant acid which may be supposed to be the cause of the loss of the colour of ink: that the best method of preventing the effects of this superabundant acid is probably by adding pieces of iron to engage it; and that this conjecture is confirmed by an instance the author had heard, of the great durability of the colour of an ink in which pieces of iron had been long immersed: and lastly, that a decoction of logwood used instead of water, sensibly improves both the beauty and deepness of the black, without disposing it to fade. The same author observes, that the addition of gum-arabic is not only useful, by keeping the colouring matter suspended in the fluid, but also by preventing the ink from spreading, by which means a greater quantity of it is collected on each stroke of the pen. Sugar, which is sometimes added to ink, is found to be much less effectual than gums, and to have the inconvenience of preventing the drying of the ink. The colour of ink is found to be greatly injured by keeping the ink in vessels made of copper or of lead, and probably of any other metal, excepting iron, which the vitriolic acid can dissolve.\n\nThe foregoing experiments point out for the best proportions of the ingredients for ink. One part of green vitriol, one part of powdered logwood, and three parts of powdered galls. The best menstruum appears to be vinegar or white wine, though for common use water is sufficient. If the ink be required to be of a full colour, a quart, or at most three pints, of liquor, may be allowed to three ounces of galls, and to one ounce of each of the other two ingredients. Half an ounce of gum may be added to each pint of the liquor. The ingredients may be all put together at once in a convenient vessel, and well shaken four or five times each day. In 10 or 12 days the ink will be fit for use, though it will improve by remaining longer on the ingredients. Or it may be made more expeditiously, by adding the gum and vitriol to a decoction of galls and logwood in the menstruum. To the ink, after it has been separated from the feculencies, some coarse powder of galls, from which the fine dust has been sifted, together with one or two pieces of iron, may be added, by which its durability will be secured.\n\nIn some attempts made by the Doctor to endow writing ink with the great durability of that of the ancients, as well as the properties which it has at present; he first thought of using animal glues, and then of oily matters. \"I mixed both lamp-black (says he) and ivory-black with solution of gum-arabic, made of such consistence as just to flow sufficiently from the pen. The liquors wrote of a fine black colour; but when...\"\nwhen dry, part of the colour could be rubbed off, especially in moist weather, and a pencil dipped in water washed it away entirely.\n\n\"I tried solutions of the animal-glues with the same effect. Ifinglals or full glue being the most difficultly dissoluble of these kinds of bodies, I made a decoction of it in water, of such strength that the liquor concreted into a jelly before it was quite cold; with this jelly, kept fluid by sufficient heat, I mixed some ivory-black: characters drawn with this mixture on paper bore rubbing much better than the others, but were discharged without much difficulty by a wet pencil.\n\n\"It was now suspected, that the colour could not be sufficiently fixed on paper without an oily cement. As oils themselves are made miscible with watery fluids by the intervention of gum, I mixed some of the softer painters varnish, aftermentioned, with about half its weight of a thick mucilage of gum-arabic, working them well together in a mortar till they united into a smooth uniform mass: this was beaten with lamp-black, and some water added by little and little, the rubbing being continued till the mixture was diluted to a due consistence for writing. It wrote freely, and of a full brownish black colour: the characters could not be discharged by rubbing, but water washed them out, though not near so readily as any of the foregoing. Instead of the painters varnish or boiled oil, I mixed raw linseed oil in the same manner with mucilage and lamp-black; and on diluting the mixture with water, obtained an ink not greatly different from the other.\n\n\"Though these oily mixtures answered better than those with simple gums or glues, it was apprehended that their being dischargeable by water would render them unfit for the purposes intended. The only way of obviating this imperfection appeared to be, by using a paper which should admit the black liquid to sink a little into its substance. Accordingly I took some of the more finking kinds of paper, and common paper made damp as for printing; and had the satisfaction to find, that neither the oily nor the simple gummy mixtures spread upon them so much as might have been expected, and that the characters were as fixed as could be desired, for they could not be washed out without rubbing off part of the substance of the paper itself.\n\n\"All these inks must be now and then stirred or shaken during the time of use, to mix up the black powder, which settles by degrees to the bottom: those with oil must be well shaken also, though not used, once a-day, or at least once in three or four days, to keep the oil united with the water and gum; for, if once the oil separates, which it is apt to do by standing at rest for some days, it can no longer be mixed with the thin fluid by any agitation. But though this imperfect union of the ingredients renders these inks less fit for general use than those commonly employed, I apprehend there are many occasions in which these kinds of inconveniences will not be thought to counterbalance the advantage of having writings which we may be assured will be as lasting as the paper they are written upon. And indeed the inconvenience may be in a great measure obviated by using cotton in the inkstand, which, imbibing the fluid, prevents the separation of the black powder diffused through it.\n\n\"All the inks, however, made on the principle we are now speaking of, can be discharged by washing, unless the paper admits them to sink into its substance. The ancients were not insensible of this imperfection; and sometimes endeavoured to obviate it, according to Pliny, by using vinegar instead of water, for tempering the mixture of lamp-black and gum. I tried vinegar, and found it to be of some advantage, not as giving any improvement to the cement, but by promoting the sinking of the matter into the paper. As this washing out of the ink may be prevented by using a kind of paper easy enough to be procured, it is scarce to be considered as an imperfection; and indeed, on other kinds of paper, it is an imperfection only so far as it may give occasion to fraud, for none of these inks are in danger of being otherwise discharged than by design. The vitriolic inks themselves, and those of printed books and copperplates, are all dischargeable; nor can it be expected of the ink-maker to render writings secure from frauds.\n\n\"But a further improvement may yet be made, namely, that of uniting the ancient and modern inks together; or using the common vitriolic ink instead of water, for tempering the ancient mixture of gum and lamp-black. By this method it should seem that the writings would have all the durability of those of former times, with all the advantage that results from the vitriolic ink fixing itself in the paper. Even where the common vitriolic mixture is depended on for the ink, it may in many cases be improved by a small addition of the ancient composition, or of the common Indian ink which answers the same purpose: when the vitriolic ink is dilute, and flows so pale from the pen, that the fine strokes, on first writing, are scarcely visible, the addition of a little Indian ink is the readiest means of giving it the due blackness. By this admixture it may be presumed also that the vitriolic ink will be made more durable, the Indian ink in some measure covering it, and defending it from the action of the air. In all cases, where Indian ink or other similar compositions are employed, cotton should be used in the inkstand, as already mentioned, to prevent the settling of the black powder.\"\n\nSince the invention of printing much less attention than formerly has been paid to the making of ink, so that now the art seems to be in a great measure lost. This will appear from a comparison of some ancient manuscripts with the writings of modern times. It being of the utmost importance, however, that public records, wills, and other valuable papers, which cannot admit of being printed, should be written with ink of a durable quality, this inattention seems to have been very culpable, and a restoration of the method of making writing ink a very valuable acquisition. \"The necessity (says Mr Attle) of paying greater attention to this matter may readily be seen, by comparing the rolls and records that have been written from the 15th century to the end of the 17th, with the writings we have remaining of various writings from the 5th to the 12th centuries. Notwithstanding the superior antiquity of the latter, they are in excellent preservation; but we frequently find the former, though of more modern date, so much defaced that they are scarcely legible.\"\n\nOur author agrees with Dr Lewis in the opinion that\nthat the ancient inks were composed of foot or ivory black instead of the galls, copperas, and gums, which form the composition of ours. Besides their black inks, however, the ancients used various other colours, as red, gold and silver, purple, &c. Green ink was frequently used in Latin manuscripts, especially in the latter ages; and it was frequently employed in signatures by the guardians of the Greek emperors till their wards were of age. Blue or yellow ink was seldom used except in manuscripts; but (says Mr Attle) \"the yellow has not been much in use, as far as we can learn, these 600 years.\" Some kinds of characters, particularly the metallic, were burnished. Wax was used by the Latins and Greeks as a varnish, but especially by the former, and particularly in the 9th century. It continued a long time in vogue.\n\nA treatise upon inks was published by Peter Canliarius professor of medicine at Venice; of which an edition was printed at London in 1660. It is divided into six parts. The first treats of inks made from pyrites, stones, and metals; the second of such as are made from metals and calces; the third from foot and vitriol; the fourth of the different kinds of inks used by the librarii or book-writers, by printers, and engravers; likewise of staining or writing upon marble, flucco, or scaliola, and of encatolic modes of writing; also of liquids for painting or colouring leather and linen or woollen cloth; restoring inks that had been decayed by time; together with many methods of effacing writing, restoring decayed paper, and different modes of secret writing. The fifth treats of writing inks made in different countries from gums, woods, the juices of plants, &c., as well as of different kinds of varnishes. The sixth treats of the different methods of extracting vitriol, and the chemical uses of it.\n\nWeckerus de Secretis, a treatise printed at Basil in 1612, contains a number of curious particulars concerning ink. He gives also receipts for making gold and silver inks, composed both with these metals and without them; directions for making inks for secret writing, and for defacing them; though in this last part there are many particulars bordering too much on the marvellous.\n\nIn the Philosophical Transactions for 1787, Dr Blagden gives some account of a method of restoring decayed inks so as to render them legible. His experiments originated from a conversation with Mr Attle already quoted, on the question whether the inks make eight or ten centuries ago, and which are found to have preserved their colour very well, were made of the same materials now employed or not? In order to decide the question, Mr Attle furnished the doctor with several manuscripts on parchment and vellum from the 9th to the 15th centuries inclusively. Some of these were still very black; others of different shades, from a deep yellowish brown to a very pale yellow, in some parts to faint that it could scarcely be seen. This was tried with simple and phlogisticated alkalies, the mineral acids, and infusion of galls. From these experiments it appeared that the ink anciently employed was of the same nature as at present: the letters turned of a reddish or yellowish brown with alkalies became pale, and were at length obliterated by the dilute mineral acids. The drop of acid liquor, which had been put upon a letter, changed to a deep blue or green on the addition of phlogisticated alkalies; with an infusion of galls, in some cases the letters acquired a deep tinge, in others a slight one. \"Hence says the doctor it is evident, that one of the ingredients was iron, which there is no reason to doubt was joined with the vitriolic acid; and the colour of the more perfect MSS. which in some was a deep black, and in others a purplish black, together with the restitution of that colour in those which had lost it by the infusion of galls, sufficiently proved that another of the ingredients was astringent matter, which from history appears to have been that of galls. No trace of a black pigment of any sort was discovered; the drop of acid, which had completely extracted a letter, appearing of an uniform pale and ferruginous colour, without an atom of black powder, or other extraneous matter floating in it.\"\n\nAs this account differs very materially from the former extracted from Mr Attle's writings, so the reason given for the continuance of the colour differs so little. This, according to Dr Blagden, \"seems to depend very much on a better preparation of the material upon which the writing was made, namely the parchment or vellum; the blackest letters being generally those which had sunk into it the deepest. Some degree of effervescence was commonly to be perceived when acids were in contact with the surface of these old vellums. I was led, however, to suspect, that the ancient inks contained rather a less proportion of iron than the more modern; for, in general, the tinge of colour produced by the phlogisticated alkali in the acid laid upon them, seemed less deep; which, however, might depend in part upon the length of time they have been kept; and perhaps more gum was used in them, or they were walked over with some kind of varnish, though not such as gave any glofs.\"\n\nAmong the specimens with which our author was favoured by Mr Attle, there was one which differed very materially from the rest. It was said to be a manuscript of the 15th century: the letters were of a full engraving hand, angular without any fine strokes, broad, and very black. None of the chemical solvents above mentioned seemed to produce any effect. Most of them seemed rather to make the letters blacker, probably by cleaning the surface; and the acids, after having been rubbed strongly upon the letters, did not strike any deeper tinge with the phlogisticated alkali. Nothing could obliterate these but what took off part of the vellum; when small rolls of a dirty matter were to be perceived. \"It is therefore unquestionable (says the doctor) that no iron was used in this ink; and, from its resistance to the chemical solvents, as well as a certain clotted appearance in the letters when examined closely, and in some places a slight degree of glofs, I have little doubt that they were formed of a footy or carbonaceous powder and oil, probably something like our present printers' ink; and am not without suspicion that they were actually printed.\"\n\nOn examining this MS. more fully, our author was convinced that it was really a part of a very ancient printed book. In considering the methods of restoring the legibility of decayed writings, our author observes, that perhaps one of the best may be to join phlogisticated alkali with the calx of iron which remains; because\ncaus\u00e8 the precipitate formed by these two substances greatly exceeds that of the iron alone. On this subject Dr Blagden disagrees with Mr Bergmann; but to bring the matter to a test, the following experiments were made.\n\n1. The phlogisticated alkali was rubbed in different quantities upon the bare writing. This, in general, produced little effect; though, in a few instances, it gave a bluish tinge to the letters, and increased their intensity; \"probably (says the doctor) where something of an acid nature had contributed to the diminution of their colour.\" 2. By adding, besides the alkali, a dilute mineral acid to the writing, our author found his expectations fully answered; the letters then changing quickly to a very deep and beautiful blue. It is but of little consequence whether the acid or phlogisticated alkali be first added; though upon farther consideration the doctor inclined to begin with the alkali. The reason is, that when the alkali is first put on, the colour seems to spread less, and thus not to hurt the legibility of the writing so much as would otherwise be done. His method is to spread the alkali thin over the writing with a feather, then to touch it as gently as possible upon or nearly over the letters with the diluted acid by means of a feather or bit of stick cut to a blunt point. The moment that the acid liquor is applied, the letters turn to a fine blue, beyond comparison stronger than the original trace of the letter; and by applying a bit of blotting-paper to soak up the superfluous liquid, we may in a great measure avoid the staining of the parchment: for it is this superfluous liquor which, absorbing part of the colouring matter from the letters, becomes a dye to whatever it touches. Care ought, however, to be taken not to allow the blotting paper to come in contact with the letters, because the colouring matter may easily be rubbed off while soft and wet. Any one of the three mineral acids will answer the purpose effectually. Dr Blagden commonly uses the marine. But whichever of the three is used, it ought to be diluted so far as not to be in danger of corroding the parchment; after which the degree of strength seems not to be a matter of great nicety.\n\nAnother method of restoring the legibility of old writings is by wetting them with an infusion of galls in white wine: but this is subject to the same inconvenience with the former, and is besides less efficacious. The doctor is of opinion that the acid of the galls by itself would be better for the purpose than the infusion of the whole substance of them; and he thinks also that a preferable kind of phlogisticated alkali might be prepared either by purifying the common kind from iron as much as possible, or by making use of the volatile alkali instead of the fixed. Mr Aftle mentions a method of restoring the legibility of decayed writings; but says that it ought not to be hazarded lest a suspicion of deceit should arise.\n\nA method has been proposed of preventing ink from decaying by washing over the paper to be written upon with the colouring matter of Prussian blue, which will not deprave it in colour, or any other respect. By writing upon it with common ink afterwards, a ground of Prussian blue is formed under every stroke; and this remains strong after the black has been decayed by the weather, or destroyed by acids. Thus the ink will bear a larger proportion of vitriol at first, and will have the advantage of looking blacker when first written.\n\nIndian Ink, a valuable black for water-colours, brought from China and other parts of the East Indies, sometimes in large rolls, but more commonly in small quadrangular cakes, and generally marked with Chinese characters. Dr Lewis, from experiments made on this substance, hath shown that it is composed of fine lamp-black and animal glue: and accordingly, for the preparation of it, he desires us to mix the lamp-black with as much melted glue as is sufficient to give it a tenacity proper for being made into cakes; and these when dry, he tells us, answered as well as those imported from the East Indies, both with regard to the colour and the freedom of working. Ivory black, and other charcoal blacks, levigated to a great degree of fineness, answered as well as the lamp-black; but in the flake in which ivory-black is commonly sold, it proved much too gritty, and separated too hastily from the water.\n\nPrinting Ink, is totally different from Indian ink, or that made use of in writing. It is an oily composition, of the consistence of an ointment: the method of preparing it was long kept a secret by those whose employment it was to make it, and who were interested in concealing it; and even yet is but imperfectly known. The properties of good printing ink are, to work clean and easily, without daubing the types, or tearing the paper; to have a fine black colour; to wash easily off the types; to dry soon; and to preserve its colour, without turning brown. This last, which is a most necessary property, is effectually obtained by setting fire to the oil with which the printing ink is made for a few moments, and then extinguishing it by covering the vessel (a). It is made to wash easily off the types, by using soap as an ingredient; and its working clean depends on its having a proper degree of strength, which is given by a certain addition of rosin. A good deal, however, depends on the proportion of the ingredients to each other; for if too much soap is added, the ink will work very foul, and daub the types to a great degree. The same thing will happen from using too much black, at the same time that both the soap and black hinder the ink from drying; while too much oil and rosin tear the paper, and hinder it from washing off.\u2014The following receipt has been found to make printing ink of a tolerable good quality. \"Take a Scots pint of linseed oil, and set it over a pretty brisk fire in an iron or copper vessel capable of holding three or four times as much. When it boils strongly, and emits a thick smoke, kindle it with a piece of paper, and immediately take the vessel off the fire. Let the oil burn for about a minute; then extinguish it by covering the vessel; after it has grown\n\n(a) This is mentioned by Dr Lewis in his Philosophical Commerce of Arts; but he seems not to have been acquainted with the method of giving it the other necessary properties.\ngrown pretty cool, add two pounds of black rosin, and one pound of hard soap cut into thin slices. If the oil is very hot when the soap is added, almost the whole mixture will run over the vessel. The mixture is then to be set again over the fire; and when the ingredients are thoroughly melted, a pound of lampblack, previously put through a lawn sieve, is to be stirred into it. The whole ought then to be ground on a marble stone, or in a levigating mill.\n\nThough the above receipt is greatly superior to any that hath been hitherto published, all of which are capitally deficient in not mentioning the necessary ingredients of rosin and soap; yet it must be acknowledged, that ink made in this manner is inferior in point of colour, and is likewise more apt to daub the types and make an indistinct impression, than such as is prepared by some of those who make the manufacture of this commodity their employment; so that either a variation in the proportion of the ingredients, a nicety in the mixture, or some additional ingredient, seems necessary to bring it to the requisite perfection.\n\n**Ink for the rolling Press**, is made of lintseed oil burnt in the same manner as that for common printing ink, and then mixed with Frankfort black, and finely ground. There are no certain proportions which can be determined in this kind of ink; every workman adding oil or black to his ink as he thinks proper, in order to make it suit his own taste.\u2014Some, however, mix a portion of common boiled oil, which has never been burnt; but this must necessarily be a bad practice, as such oil is apt to go through the paper; a fault very common in prints, especially if the paper is not very thick. No soap is added; because the ink is not cleared off from the copperplates with alkaline ley as in common printing, but with a brush dipped in oil.\n\nInk is also an appellation given to any coloured liquor used in writing. Different kinds of these inks may be prepared by the directions given under the article **Colour-Making**.\n\n**Sympathetic Ink**, a liquor with which a person may write, and yet nothing appear on the paper after it is dry, till some means are used, as holding the paper to the fire, rubbing it over with some other liquor, &c.\n\nThese kinds of ink may be divided into seven classes, with respect to the means used to make them visible; viz. 1. Such as become visible by puffing another liquor over them, or by exposing them to the vapour of that liquor. 2. Those that do not appear so long as they are kept close, but soon become visible on being exposed to the air. 3. Such as appear by freezing or setting some very fine powder of any colour over them. 4. Those which become visible by being exposed to the fire. 5. Such as become visible by heat, but disappear again by cold or the moisture of the air. 6. Those which become visible by being wetted with water. 7. Such as appear of various colours.\n\nI. The first class contains four kinds of ink, viz. solutions of lead, bismuth, gold, and green vitriol, or sulphate of iron. The first two become visible by the contact of sulphurous liquids or fumes. For the first, a solution of common sugar of lead in water answers very well. With this solution write with a clean pen, and the writing when dry will be totally invisible; but if it be wetted with a solution of bepar sulphuris, or orpiment, dissolved by means of quicklime; or exposed to the strong vapours of these solutions, the writing will appear of a brown colour, more or less deep according to the strength of the sulphurous fume. By the same means the solution of nitrate of bismuth will appear of a deep black.\n\nThe sympathetic ink prepared from gold depends on the property by which that metal precipitates from its solvent on the addition of a solution of tin. Write with a solution of gold in nitro-muriatic acid, and let the paper dry gently in the shade; nothing will appear for the first seven or eight hours. Dip a pencil in the solution of tin, and drawing it lightly over the invisible characters, they will immediately appear, of a purple colour.\n\nCharacters written with a solution of green vitriol, will likewise be invisible when the paper is dry; but if wetted with an infusion of galls, they will immediately appear as if written with common ink. If, instead of this infusion, a solution of an alkaline prussiate be used, the writing will appear of a deep blue.\n\nII. To the second class belong the solutions of all those metals which are apt to attract oxygen from the air, such as lead, bismuth, silver, &c. The sympathetic ink of gold already mentioned belongs also to this class; for if the characters written with it are long exposed to the air, they become by degrees of a deep violet colour, nearly approaching to black. In like manner, characters written with a solution of nitrate of silver are invisible when newly dried, but being exposed to the sun, appear of a gray colour like slate. To this class also belong solutions of sugar of lead, nitrates of copper and of mercury, acetate of iron, and muriate of tin. Each of these has a particular colour when exposed to the air; but they corrode the paper.\n\nIII. The third class of sympathetic inks contains such liquids as have some kind of glutinous viscoity, and at the same time are long in drying; by which means, though the eye cannot discern the characters written with them upon paper, the powders strewed upon them immediately adhere, and thus make the writing become visible. Of this kind are urine, milk, the juices of some vegetables, weak solutions of the deliquescent salts, &c.\n\nIV. This class, comprehending all those that become visible by being exposed to the fire, is very extensive, as it contains all those colourless liquids in which the matter dissolved is capable of being reduced, or of reducing the paper, into a sort of charcoal by a small heat. Sulphuric acid diluted with as much water as will prevent it from corroding the paper makes a good ink of this kind. Letters written with this fluid are invisible when dry, but instantly on being held near the fire appear as black as if written with the finest ink. Juice of lemons or onions, a solution of sal-ammoniac, green vitriol, &c. answer the same purpose.\n\nV. The fifth class comprehends only a solution of muriate of cobalt; for the properties of which, see Chemistry, No. 1668, p. 627.\n\nVI. This class comprehends such inks as become visible when characters written with them are wetted with water. They are made of all such substances as deposit a copious sediment when mixed with water, dissolving only imperfectly in that fluid. Of this kind are\nInk-stones are dried alum, sugar of lead, vitriol, &c. We have therefore only to write with a strong solution of these salts upon paper, and the characters will be invisible when dry; but when we apply water, the small portion of dried salt cannot again be dissolved in the water. Hence the insoluble part becomes visible on the paper, and shows the characters written in white, gray, brown, or any other colour which the precipitate affumes.\n\nVII. Characters may be made to appear of a fine crimson, purple, or yellow, by writing on paper with solution of muriate of tin, and then paling over it a pencil dipped in a decoction of cochineal, Brazil-wood, logwood, yellow wood, &c.\n\nInk Stones, a kind of small round stones, of a white, red, gray, yellow, or black colour, containing a quantity of native martial vitriol, whence they derive the property of making ink, and from thence their name. They are almost entirely soluble in water, and besides their other ingredients, contain also a portion of copper and zinc.","sp":283,"ep":289},{"h":"INLAND","t":"a name for any part of a country at a distance from the sea.\n\nInland Navigation.

If a person who keeps a common inn, refuses to receive a traveller into his house as a guest, or to find him victuals and lodging on his tendering a reasonable price for them, he is liable to an action of damages, and may be indicted and fined at the king's suit. The rates of all commodities sold by innkeepers, according to our ancient laws, may be inflicted; and innkeepers not selling their hay, oats, beans, &c., and all manner of victuals, at reasonable prices, without taking anything for litter, may be fined and imprisoned, &c. by 21 Jac. I. c. 21.\n\nWhere an innkeeper harbours thieves, persons of infamous character, or suffers any disorders in his house, or sets up a new inn where there is no need of one, to the hinderance of ancient and well governed inns, he is indictable and fineable; and by statute, such inn may be suppressed. Action upon the case lies against any innkeeper, if a theft be committed on his guest by a servant of the inn, or any other person not belonging to the guest; though it is otherwise where the guest is not a traveller, but one of the same town or village, for there the innkeeper is not chargeable; nor is the matter of a private tavern answerable for a robbery committed on his guest; it is said, that even though the travelling guest does not deliver his goods, &c., into the innkeeper's possession, yet if they are stolen, he is chargeable. An innkeeper is not answerable for anything out of his inn, but only for such as are within it; yet, where he of his own accord puts the guest's horse to graze, and the horse is stolen, he is answerable, he not having the guest's orders for putting such horse to graze. The innkeeper may justify the stopping of the horse, or other thing of his guest, for his reckoning, and may retain the same till it be paid. Where a person brings his horse to an inn, and leaves him in the stable, the innkeeper may detain him till such time as the owner pays for his keeping; and if the horse eats out as much as he is worth, after a reasonable appraisement made, he may sell the horse and pay himself; but when a guest brings several horses to an inn, and afterwards takes them all away except one, this horse so left may not be sold for payment of the debt for the others; for every horse is to be sold, only to make satisfaction for what is due for his own meat.\n\nInns. Our colleges of municipal or common law professors and students, are called inns: the old English word for houses of noblemen, bishops, and others of extraordinary note, being of the same signification with the French word hotels.\n\nInns of Court are so called, as some think, because the students there are to serve and attend the courts of judicature; or else, because anciently these colleges received none but the sons of noblemen, and better sort of gentlemen, who were here to be qualified to serve the king in his court; as Fortescue affirms. And, in his time, he says, there were about 2000 students in the inns of court and chancery, all of whom were filii nobilium, or gentlemen born. But this custom has gradually fallen into disuse; so that in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Sir Edward Coke does not reckon above 1000 students, and the number at present is very considerably less; for which Judge Blackstone assigns the following reasons. 1. Because the inns of chancery, being now almost totally filled by the inferior branches of the profession, are neither commodious nor proper for the resort of gentlemen of any rank or figure; so that there are very rarely any young students entered at the inns of chancery. 2. Because in the inns of court all sorts of regimen and academical superintendence, either with regard to morals or studies, are found impracticable, and therefore entirely neglected. Lastly, because persons of birth and fortune, after having finished their usual courses at the universities, have seldom leisure or resolution sufficient to enter upon a new scheme of study at a new place of instruction; wherefore few gentlemen now resort to the inns of court, but such for whom the knowledge of practice is absolutely necessary in such as are intended for the profession.\n\nOur inns of court, justly famed for the production of men of learning in the law, are governed by masters, principals, benchers, stewards, and other officers; and have public halls for exercises, readings, &c., which\nwhich the students are obliged to attend and perform for a certain number of years, before they can be admitted to plead at the bar. These societies have not, however, any judicial authority over their members; but instead of this they have certain orders among themselves, which have by consent the force of laws. For lighter offences persons are only excommunicated, or put out of commons; for greater, they lose their chambers, and are expelled the college; and when once expelled out of one society, they are never received by any of the others. The gentlemen in these societies may be divided into benchers, outer-barristers, inner-barristers, and students.\n\nThe four principal inns of court, are the Inner Temple and Middle Temple, heretofore the dwelling of the Knights Templars, purchased by some professors of the common law about 300 years ago; Lincoln's Inn and Gray's Inn, anciently belonging to the earls of Lincoln and Gray. The other inns are the two Sergeants Inns.\n\nInns of Chancery were probably so called, because anciently inhabited by such clerks as chiefly studied the forming of writs, which regularly belonged to the curitors, who are officers of chancery.\n\nThe first of these is Thavies Inn, begun in the reign of Edward III. and since purchased by the society of Lincoln's Inn. Beside this, we have New Inn, Symond's Inn, Clement's Inn, Clifford's Inn, anciently the house of the Lord Clifford; Staple Inn, belonging to the merchants of the staple; Lion's Inn, anciently a common inn with the sign of the lion; Furnival's Inn, and Bernard's Inn.\n\nThese were heretofore preparatory colleges for younger students; and many were entered here, before they were admitted into the inns of court. Now they are mostly taken up by attorneys, solicitors, &c.\n\nThey all belong to some of the inns of court, who formerly used to send yearly some of their barristers to read to them.","sp":289,"ep":290},{"h":"INNATE IDEAS","t":"those supposed to be stamped on the mind, from the first moment of its existence, and which it constantly brings into the world with it: a doctrine which Mr Locke has taken great pains to refute.\n\nINNERKEITHING.

This truth is remarkably exemplified in the practice of inoculation of the smallpox: but to the honour of the British physicians, they measured not the value of this practice by the means of its origin, but by its real importance and utility; they patronized a barbarous discovery with no less zeal and affection than if it had been their own. Indeed the whole nation might be said to have adopted the practice; for the greatest encouragement it by becoming examples, and the wisest were determined by the general event of the method.\n\nThe time and place in which the art of inoculating for the smallpox was first formed, are equally unknown. Accident probably gave rise to it. Pylarini says, that among the Turks it was not attended to except amongst the meaner sort. Dr Ruffel informs us in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. lviii. p. 142, that no mention is made of it by any of the ancient Arabian medical writers that are known in Europe; and the physicians who are natives in and about Arabia assert, that nothing is to be found regarding it in any of those of a more modern date. He farther says, that he engaged some of his learned Turkish friends to make inquiry; but they did not discover any thing on this subject of inoculation either in the writings of physicians, historians, or poets. Until the beginning of the 18th century, all the accounts we have of inoculating the smallpox are merely traditional. The silence on this subject, observed amongst writers in the countries where the practice obtained, Dr Ruffel supposes, with great probability, to be owing to the physicians there never countenancing or engaging in it. It is also remarkable, that before Pylarini's letter to the Royal Society in 1701, nor yet for several years after, this practice is not noticed by any of the most inquisitive travellers. On this Dr Ruffel very justly observes, that customs, the most common in distant countries, are often the least apt to attract the observation of travellers, who, engaged in other pursuits, must be indebted to accident for the knowledge of such things as the natives seldom talk of, upon the belief that they are known to all the world.\n\nThe first accounts we have in the learned world concerning inoculation, are from two Italian physicians, viz. Pylarini and Timoni, whose letters on the subject may be seen in the Phil. Trans. abridged, vol. v. p. 370, &c. The first is dated A.D. 1701; the next is dated A.D. 1713. Whether our inquiries are extended abroad or confined to our own country, inoculation hath been practised under one mode or other time immemorial; in Great Britain and its adjacent isles we have well authenticated accounts, extending farther backward than any from the continent. Dr Williams of Haverfordwest, who wrote upon inoculation in 1725, proves, that it had been practised in Wales, though in a form somewhat different, time out of mind. Mr Wright, a surgeon,\nInoculation in the same place, says, that buying the smallpox is both a common practice, and of long standing in that neighbourhood. He says, that in Pembrokeshire there are two large villages near the harbour of Milford, more famous for this custom than any other, viz. St Ithmael's and Marloes. The old inhabitants of these villages say, that it hath been a common practice; and that one William Allen of St Ithmael's, who in 1722 was 90 years of age, declared to some persons of good sense and integrity, that this practice was used all his time; that he well remembered his mother telling him, that it was a common practice all her time, and that she got the smallpox that way; so that at least we go back 160 years or more.\n\nIn the Highlands of Scotland and some of the adjacent isles, Dr Alexander Monro senior informs us, that the custom through ages past hath been, to put their children to bed with those who laboured under a favourable smallpox, and to tie worsted threads about their children's wrists, after having drawn them through variolous pustules.\n\nAccording to the result of Dr Ruffell's inquiries, the Arabians assert, that the inoculation of the smallpox has been the common custom of their ancestors, and that they have no doubt of its being as ancient as the disease itself. It is remarkable, that buying the smallpox is the name universally applied in all countries to the method of procuring the disease: it is true that there are other terms; but in Wales and Arabia, as well as many other countries, this is the usual appellation. From the sameness of the name, and the little diversity observable in the manner of performing the operation, it is probable that the practice of inoculation in these countries was originally derived from the same source. From its extensive spread, it is probably of great antiquity too.\n\nIn the year 1717, Lady Mary Wortley Montague, wife of the English ambassador at Constantinople, had her son inoculated there at the age of five years; he had but few pustules, and soon recovered. In April 1721, inoculation was successfully tried on seven condemned criminals in London, by permission of his majesty. In 1722, Lady Mary Wortley Montague had a daughter of five years old inoculated in this island; soon after which, the children of the royal family that had not had the smallpox were inoculated with success; then followed some of the nobility, and the practice soon prevailed. And here we date the commencement of inoculation under the direction of art.\n\nFrom the example of the royal family in England, the practice was adopted in Germany, particularly in Hanover, and its adjacent countries.\n\nAfter Mr Maitland had succeeded with those he had inoculated in and about London, he introduced the practice into Scotland in the year 1726.\n\nSweden soon followed the example of the British. Russia lately engaged one of our principal promoters and improvers of this art. And now there are not many countries that do not more or less practise it.\n\nDifferent Modes of Inoculation. The practice of inoculation having obtained in every part of the world, it may be grateful, at least to curiosity, to have a general account of the different modes that are and have been adopted in that practice.\n\nInoculation with the blood of variolous patients hath been tried without effect; the variolous matter only produces the variolous disease.\n\nThe application of the variolous matter takes place in a sensible part only; the activity of the virus is such, that the smallest atom, though imperceptible to any of our senses, conveys the disease as well as the largest quantity. Hence the most obvious method is the prick of a needle or the point of a lancet dipped in the matter of a variolous pustule.\n\nCotton or thread is used, that is previously rubbed with powdered variolous scabs; this thread is drawn with a needle through the cutis, but not left in. This is the method in some parts of the East Indies. The Indians pass the thread on the outside of the hand, between any of the fingers, or between the forefinger and thumb. The Thesalian women inoculate in the forehead and chin.\n\nSome abrade the scarf-skin, and rub in the powdered dry scabs which fall from the pustules of patients with the smallpox.\n\nMany of the Greek women make an oblique puncture with a needle, on the middle of the top of the forehead, on each cheek, the chin, each metacarpus, and each metatarsus; then drop in each a little of the pus just taken warm from a patient, and brought in a servant's bosom. Others in Greece make several little wounds with a needle in one, two, or more places, in the skin, till some drops of blood exude; then the operator pours a drop of warm pus fresh from a pustule, and mixes it with the blood as it issues out; then the wound is covered by some with a bandage, by others with half a walnut shell placed with its concave side over each orifice.\n\nThe Chinese convey a pellet of variolated cotton, with the addition of a little musk, into the nostrils of the patient; they collect dry pustules, and keep them in a porcelain bottle well corked; and when they inoculate, they mix a grain of musk with three or four grains of the dry scales, and roll them in cotton. This method may be called inodoration.\n\nAbout Bengal, in the East Indies, the person who intends to be inoculated, having found a house where there is a good fort of the smallpox, goes to the bed of the sick person, if he is old enough; or if a child, to one of his relations, and speaks to him as follows: \"I am come to buy the smallpox.\" The answer is, \"Buy if you please.\" A sum of money is accordingly given, and one, three, or four pustules, for the number must always be odd, and not exceeding five, extracted whole, and full of matter. These are immediately rubbed on the skin of the outside of the hand between the forefinger and the thumb; and this suffices to produce the disease. The same custom obtains in Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli, and other countries.\n\nVery similar to the custom among the people about Bengal, &c., is that in Arabia, where on some flethly part they make several punctures with a needle imbued in variolous matter, taken from a pustule of a favourable kind. Here they buy the smallpox too, as follows: the child to be inoculated carries a few raisins, dates, sugar-plums, or such like; and showing them to the child from whom the matter is to be taken, asks how many pocks he will give in exchange? The bargain being made, they proceed to the operation; but this buying, though still continued, is not thought necessary.\nnecessary to the success of the operation. The Arabs say that any flabby part is proper; but generally they infert the matter between the fore-finger and thumb on the outside of the hand.\n\nThe Georgians infert the matter on the fore-arm.\n\nThe Armenians introduce the matter on the two thighs. In Wales the practice may be termed infraction of the smallpox. There some of the dry pustules are procured by purchase, and are rubbed hard upon the naked arm or leg.\n\nThe practice in some places is to prick the skin between some of the fingers by means of two small needles joined to one another; and after having rubbed a little of the matter on the spot, a circle is made by means of several punctures of the bigness of a common pustule, and matter is again rubbed over it. The operation is finished by dressing the wound with lint.\u2014Another custom is to mix a little of the various matter with sugar, and give it to be drank in any agreeable liquor.\n\nIncisions have been made in the arms and legs, and thread, cotton, or lint, previously dipped in the various matter, was lodged in them. The practice of some is to bathe the feet in warm water, and then secure lint dipped in the various matter on the instep, or other part of the foot, where the skin is thin. Others apply a small blistering plaster; and when the scarf skin is elevated and flipped off, the various matter is applied to the surface of the true skin, and confined there by a little lint or platter. Scratching the skin with a pin or needle, and then rubbing the part with lint, previously dipped in various matter, is the custom in some places.\n\nIn the Highlands of Scotland they rub some part of the skin with fresh matter, or dip worsted in various matter, and tie it about the children's wrists. They observe, that if fresh matter is applied a few days successively, the infection is more certain than by one application.\n\nHaving thus given the history of inoculation for the smallpox, which not many years ago was justly regarded as one of the greatest discoveries which had been made for the benefit of mankind, and would still be regarded as such had it not given place to one still more valuable and important, the vaccine inoculation or cowpox, which now promises to banish the smallpox from the world. For an account of this, see Vaccination. It would be quite unnecessary to enter into the detail of the advantages to be derived from inoculation for the smallpox, and the methods of performing or preparing for it formerly practised. But, as a curious part of the history of this practice, we shall just barely mention some of the objections which have been urged against it.\n\nIt has been said that inoculation for the smallpox is unlawful; that it is bringing a distemper on ourselves, and thus usurping the sacred prerogative of God; that the decrees of God have fixed the commission of every disease, and our precautions cannot prevent what he hath determined; that we should not do evil that good may come; that the patient may die, and then his last moments are distressful, and the future reflections of his friends are grievous; that fear is a dangerous passion in the smallpox, but inoculation increases the causes of fear, by lessening our faith and trust in God; that inoculation does not exempt from future infection; that inordinate other diseases are communicated with the matter of the smallpox by inoculating it; that perhaps the disease may never attack in the natural way; that it requires much thought to know what we should do with regard to inoculation; that it endangers others, and that the practice of inoculation comes from the devil.\n\nINORDINATE PROPORTION.

Hence they were called inquisitors; and this gave birth to the formidable tribunal of the inquisition, which was received in all Italy and the dominions of Spain, except the kingdom of Naples and the Low Countries.\n\nThis diabolical tribunal takes cognizance of heresy, Judaism, Mahometanism, sodomy, and polygamy; and the people stand in so much fear of it, that parents deliver up their children, husbands their wives, and masters their servants, to its officers, without daring in the least to murmur. The prisoners are kept for a long time, till they themselves turn their own accusers, and declare the cause of their imprisonment; for they are neither told their crime nor confronted with witnesses. As soon as they are imprisoned, their friends go into mourning, and speak of them as dead, not daring to solicit their pardon, lest they should be brought in as accomplices. When there is no shadow of proof against the pretended criminal, he is discharged, after suffering the most cruel tortures, a tedious and dreadful imprisonment, and the loss of the greatest part of his effects. The sentence against the prisoners is pronounced publicly, and with extraordinary solemnity. In Portugal, they erect a theatre capable of holding 3000 persons; in which they place a rich altar, and raise seats on each side in the form of an amphitheatre. There the prisoners are placed; and over against them is a high chair, whither they are called, one by one, to hear their doom, from one of the inquisitors.\n\nThese unhappy people know what they are to suffer by the clothes they wear that day. Those who appear in their own clothes are discharged upon payment of a fine; those who have a santo benito, or strict yellow coat without sleeves, charged with St. Andrew's crofs, have their lives, but forfeit all their effects: those who have the resemblance of flames made of red serge, sewed upon their santo benito, without any crofs, are pardoned, but threatened to be burnt if ever they relapse: but those who, besides these flames, have on their santo benito their own picture, surrounded with figures of devils, are condemned to expire in the flames. The inquisitors, who are ecclesiastics, do not pronounce the sentence of death;\nbut form and read an act, in which they say, that\nthe criminal being convicted of such a crime, by his\nown confession, is with much reluctance delivered to the\nsecular power to be punished according to his demerits:\nand this writing they give to the seven judges who at-\ntend at the right side of the altar, who immediately\npass sentence.

The following remedies we\nfind collected in the Gentleman's Magazine for Octo-\nber 1790.\u2014Of those substances which have been gen-\nerally observed to be efficacious in driving away or in\ndestroying insects, mercury, and its various preparations,\nmay be reckoned one of the most generally useful.\nSulphur is also useful. Oils of all kinds have been of-\nten and deservedly recommended. Tobacco is not less\nremarkable for its utility. Of the application of these\nin order.\n\n1. Mercury is known to kill or drive away lice from\nthe human body; and it may probably be of equal ef-\nficacy in ridding other animals of their insects. For\ninstance, sheep having a small quantity of mercurial\nointment rubbed on their skins, on the sides, between\nthe fore-legs and the body, it may kill or drive away\nthe insect peculiar to them. Sulphur is recommended\nto be added to the mercurial ointment. Thus not only the\ninsect peculiar to them, but also the fleas, may be cured:\nSee the Transactions of the Society for the Encourage-\nment of Arts, London, vol. vii. viii. p. 90. In the\nTransactions of the same society, vol. vi. vi. p. 59. Mr.\nAlway directed that, in the winter, the walls, frames,\n&c. of his green and hot-houses should be well washed\nwith the following mixture: Take of corrosive subli-\nmate mercury four ounces, and dissolve it in two gal-\nlons of water. These houses had been greatly infested\nwith red spiders and ants. After having been washed\nwith the above mixture, neither were to be seen next\nsummer. This wash may be used on old garden-walls,\nand to the roots of fruit-trees infested with insects, if\nmade weaker. It may destroy the tender leaves of\nplants, though not the roots. This wash will effectual-\nly destroy all disagreeable insects the bugs, and all other\ninsects of a tender cuticle; and it will not in the least\nhurt the colour of bed-furniture or hangings. Care\nmust be taken, that the wash be applied into every cre-\nvice or folding of the furniture with a painter's brush.\nIt will sometimes be necessary to repeat the wash, as\nsome of the ova of bugs may remain concealed, not-\nwithstanding the utmost care.\n\nSome of the West India islands were much infested\nwith large ants, which greatly hurt the sugar-canes.\nThe remedy was, to dissolve corrosive sublimate mer-\ncury in rum, in the proportion of two drams to a pint\nof spirits. This solution was poured on dry powdered\nsugar; and when the sugar was dried, it was laid in\nthe paths of the ants. They ate it, and were destroyed.\nMight not this practice be imitated, by laying sugar thus prepared on paper or pieces of thin boards\nnear the roots of fruit-trees infested by insects, espe-\ncially when the fruit is ripening? The papers or boards\nmight be taken in during the night, or when it rained.\nThe sugar should be coloured with indigo, or other\nsubstance, thereby to mark it as a substance to be\navoided by curious idlers.\n\n2. We are informed that a person in Philadelphia em-\nployed brimstone in the following manner. Having\ncleared all round the roots of trees infested with cater-\npillars or other insects, he threw some flour of brim-\nstone round the roots, and covered it with a thin\nsprinkling of fine mould, that it might not be blown\naway by the wind, yet so that the sun might operate\nthrough, and cause the brimstone to fumigate. Thus\nhe destroyed the caterpillars. One pound he found\nsufficient for 200 trees. In that hot climate the sun\nmay\nInsects may perhaps have that effect; but it scarcely will in this. He also employed sulphur in the following manner to drive insects from tall trees. He split the end of a pole, and put in the slit some matches, let them on fire, and held them under the parts of the trees chiefly affected. A pole thus armed, he found, would answer for three or four trees. Brimstone thus mixed with damp straw, and set on fire, for instance, in hop-ground infested with the fly, might be of use to drive away the fly.\n\nThe itch is supposed to proceed from a very small insect which nettles under the skin, and proceeds no farther into the habit; and is therefore attended with no dangerous consequences. Brimstone made into an ointment with hogs-lard is a sure remedy.\n\nSheep are liable to an eruption on the skin, known by the name of the scab. The brimstone, when added to the mercurial ointment recommended for that disorder in the Transactions of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, vol. vii. p. 90, might perhaps render the application more efficacious and less dangerous.\n\n3. The natives of hot countries are taught by experience, that an unctuous covering on their bodies prevents the bites of mosquitoes and all gnats. The white inhabitants in such countries are not sufficiently careful in preventing the least stagnant water near their dwellings, in which the mosquitoes are bred; even in the waste water thrown out they are produced. Dr Franklin, by a careful attention to this circumstance, guarded his family in Philadelphia from such insects: one day seeing a number of mosquitoes in his library, he found on inquiry, that one of his servants had taken the cover off a tub placed near his window for receiving rain-water. On such an occasion the remedy is easy, viz. shutting the room up for the day, so that the mosquitoes cannot come at any water, in which time they die. Though this caution may seem trifling to us who live in a mild climate, it is far otherwise in hot countries.\n\nOil being known to be most efficacious in destroying insects, may not the use of it be extended to the destruction of worms in the bowels of horses, where they may occasion the violent pain they seem sometimes to suffer? If the horse was for some time kept fasting, and a large quantity of oil, suppose a pint, was given, if worms are the cause, the oil may in that case kill them.\n\nFlowers, leaves, and fruit, on plants, are known to be devoured by caterpillars. These are destroyed by oils, which close the lateral pores by which they breathe. For this purpose it is advised, that, on the approach of spring, a cloth dipped in train oil be laid on such parts of the tree in which there is the least appearance of them.\n\nWe are informed in the Memoirs of the Society of Agriculture at Paris, that oil of turpentine, when applied to animals which were covered with insects, destroyed the insects without hurting the animal. The author tried it on several trees, mixed with fine earth so as to incorporate them well, then adding water, still stirring them carefully till the whole was brought to some degree of fluidity. In this mixture he dipped branches of fruit-trees on which there were insects, and hereby destroyed not only the eggs but also the insects, without hurting the leaves. This composition may be got off by washing, or the first heavy shower. From these experiments the author thinks, that oil of turpentine may with equal efficacy be employed for killing various kinds of lice on domestic animals.\n\nWe are informed, in the Transactions of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, vol. v. p. 45, that Mr Winter, among other experiments on turnip-feed, steeped the seed 24 hours in a sufficient quantity of train oil. He then drained the oil from the feed, which he mixed with a quantity of fine sifted earth, and immediately sowed it in drills. When the plants began to appear on the surface, the ground was fown with foot. He found that feed steeped in lintseed oil answered equally well. The turnips the least injured by the fly were those that grew from seed steeped as above, which grew so luxuriantly as to produce rough leaves several days prior to the most flourishing of any of his other experiments, and were the better enabled to withstand the fly's attack. The leaves of these turnips were of a darker green, and appeared twice as thick in bulk and luxuriancy than the other turnips, and were a considerable deal larger. The seed was drilled an inch and a half deep, and at a foot distance in the rows. Train oil is apt to kill the leaves of plants which have been injured by insects, but lintseed oil has not that effect, though equally destructive to the insects. The train oil seems to act both as an oil, and by its disagreeable smell it prevents insects approaching it. In this respect it may be successfully used to prevent field mice or other vermin preying on acorns, chestnuts, or other seeds steeped in it before they are fown.\n\nWhen thus giving directions for preventing the fly on turnips, a late experiment should be mentioned, by the disclosing of which a person gained a considerable reward. His secret was, running a roller over the ground early in the morning, while the dew remained on the ground, on the first appearance of the fly. The dew entangled the flies so much, that they could not make their escape, and were therefore crushed to death. As the roller may leave the surface of the earth too hard, some very properly advise to fix some boughs of elder in a gate or hurdle, to be drawn over the field; and if the boughs had been before fumigated with the smoke of tobacco, or tincture of saltpeter, the success would be the surer. The most certain method of preventing the hurt done by the fly is to raise the plants in a nursery, and at a proper age to transplant them, being carried to the ground in a wheel-barrow filled with manure softened with water so as to admit the plants. This method will secure their more speedy growth. In the nursery the attack of the fly may be prevented by sprinkling foot or quicklime on the ground. The utility of transplanting turnips is evident by the practice of transplanting the turnip-rooted cabbage. They who are discouraged from this practice by the expense attending it, do not reflect that the hoeing is prevented, and the plants grow the better, being fed in fresh earth.\n\n3. Before proceeding to direct the use of the last means mentioned, viz. tobacco, for destroying insects in turnips, it may be proper to mention an experiment made by Mr Green, of her majesty's flower-garden at Kew. He contrived a pair of bellows, similar to that employed in recovering people seemingly drowned. It has\nInsects have a cavity in the nozzle, in which some tobacco is put, with a live coal over it. The bellows being then worked, the tobacco is set on fire, and the smoke is directed to any particular spot. A lady was fond of having the mokrofe in her dressing-room, but was prevented having it on account of the green insects which constantly adhere to that plant. To remedy this inconvenience, Mr Green had a box made large enough to contain a pot in which a plant of the mokrofe grew. In one end of the box was a hole, to admit the nozzle of the bellows; the bellows was worked, and the smoke was received into the box. When the tobacco was consumed, the nozzle was withdrawn, and a cork being put into the hole, the box thus remained till morning, when the insects were all laid dead on the earth. Being swept off, the plant was in a state fit for a dressing-room. Many plants thus infected with insects may be too large, or otherwise so placed as not to be put into a box. In this case it occurred to the writer of these observations, that being sprinkled with an infusion of tobacco in water might in some degree answer the same purpose. On trial he found it answered, and he thus freed other plants of their insects. He also used it on trees of easy access with advantage. Train oil is so inimical to tender plants or leaves, that it destroys them if insects have in the least hurt them; whereas the infusion, instead of killing the leaves, promoted a fresh vegetation.\n\nFruit trees often become the prey of insects. Those against a wall, or in espaliers, being easily come at, much of the mischief may be prevented by cutting off the leaves so soon as they are observed to be curled; for then fresh eggs are laid on them, probably by butterflies. If sprinkled with the infusion of tobacco, it will prevent their coming to life. After the fruit is formed, the infusion must not be used, lest the taste and smell may remain. The fellifers are then the proper remedies, which ladies may employ as amusement, and may thereby prevent fruit to their friends of their own preserving. A lye of the ash of plants sprinkled on the leaves may have a good effect, as also on other pot-herbs, which are often the prey of caterpillars. As many insects, besides those bred on the leaves or in the walls, may destroy the fruit, the sugar with the corrosive sublimate, as already described, may be laid in the way of other insects, to which it will prove a speedy death. Diligent inspection into their retreats is the most certain means of preventing the loss sustained by snails. Ants are prevented rising up the trees, by laying round the roots powdered chalk, or any other substance which by entangling their feet prevents their crawling it. Care should be taken to destroy their nests everywhere near the garden.\n\nHops are now become an article of so great consequence, that it deserves our particular attention. Early in its growth, when the vines begin to ascend the poles, a black fly preys on its leaves, frequently in such numbers as, by destroying the leaves, to interrupt the vegetation, much of the food of plants being absorbed by the leaves. The infusion of tobacco destroys them, or at least drives them away so effectually, that a plant almost totally stripped of its leaves has put out fresh leaves after the use of it. If care be not taken, they will again fall on the fresh leaves. As the flies lodge on the lower side of the leaves, they are protected from storms of rain, and therefore the infusion must be driven upwards by a forcing pump. As it is said that the expense of tobacco is too great, perhaps lime-water, or even water by itself, driven strongly against the leaves, might drive them away. The labour attending such experiments in a large plantation discourages others, without reflecting, that, if such means are used early, the flies may more easily be got rid of.\n\nFree ventilation is undoubtedly beneficial to all plants; and hence perhaps the particular advantages of drilling corn in rows a little distant. If alleys somewhat larger than common were made in the plantations of hops, there might be sufficient spaces left where the alleys cross one another to admit of setting damp straw, or other materials mixed with brimstone, foot, &c., on fire. Smoke itself is said to prevent the fly; and if it, it will still act more powerfully when mixed with such materials. It has been observed in Sweden, that the hops grow naturally among heaps of stones or fragments of rocks. They therefore advise to cover the ground round their roots with stones, which will prevent the insects laying their eggs near the roots in the ground, where they lay them to be protected during the winter. The stones will also preserve moisture at the roots during the summer. A rope cannot be drawn across a plantation of hops, as it can across a field of corn, in case of mildew. Here water to wash off the clammy juice that entices and feeds insects seems to be the only remedy. The plantation being well ventilated, may at least prevent the frequency of it. The forcing pump will most effectually wash off this exudation.\n\nCruelty to Insects. It does not appear upon what principle of reason and justice it is, that mankind have founded their right over the lives of every creature that is placed in a subordinate rank of being to themselves. Whatever claim they may have in right of food and self-defence (to which ought we to add the purposes of the naturalist, explained above?) did they extend their privilege no farther than those articles would reasonably carry them, numberless beings might enjoy their lives in peace, who are now hurried out of them by the most wanton and unnecessary cruelties. It is surely difficult to discover why it should be thought less inhuman to crush to death a harmless insect, whose single offence is that he eats that food which nature has prepared for his sustenance, than it would be were we to kill any bulky creature for the same reason. There are few tempers so hardened to the impressions of humanity, as not to shudder at the thought of the latter; and yet the former is universally practised without the least check of compassion. This seems to arise from the gross error of supposing, that every creature is really in itself contemptible, which happens to be clothed with a body infinitely disproportionate to our own, not considering that great and little are merely relative terms. But the inimitable Shakespeare would teach us, that\n\n---\n\nthe poor beetle that we tread upon,\nIn corporal suff'rance, feels a pang as great\nAs when a giant dies.\n\nAnd indeed there is every reason to believe that the sensations of many insects are as exquisite as those of creatures of far more enlarged dimensions, perhaps even more...\nmore so. The milipede, for instance, rolls itself round upon the slightest touch, and the snail draws in its horns upon the least approach of our hand. Are not these the strongest indications of their sensibility? and is it any evidence of ours, that we are not therefore induced to treat them with a more sympathizing tenderness?\n\nMontaigne remarks, that there is a certain claim of kindness and benevolence which every species of creatures has a right to from us. It is to be regretted that this general maxim is not more attended to in the affair of education, and pressed home upon tender minds in its full extent and latitude. We are far, indeed, from thinking, that the early delight which children discover in tormenting flies, &c., is a mark of any innate cruelty of temper, because this turn may be accounted for on other principles; and it is entertaining unworthy notions of the Deity, to suppose he forms mankind with a propensity to the most detestable of all dispositions: but most certainly, by being unrestrained in sports of this kind, they may acquire by habit what they never would have learned from nature, and grow up into a confirmed inattention to every kind of suffering but their own. Accordingly the supreme court of judicature at Athens thought an instance of this sort not below its cognizance, and punished a boy for putting out the eyes of a poor bird that had unhappily fallen into his hands.\n\nIt might be of service, therefore, it should seem, in order to awaken as early as possible in children an extensive sense of humanity, to give them a view of several sorts of insects as they may be magnified by the assistance of glasses, and to show them that the same evident marks of wisdom and goodness prevail in the formation of the minutest insect, as in that of the most enormous Leviathan: that they are equally furnished with whatever is necessary, not only to the preservation, but the happiness of their beings in that state of existence which Providence has assigned them; in a word, that the whole construction of their respective organs distinctly proclaims them the objects of the divine benevolence, and therefore that they justly ought to be so of ours.","sp":294,"ep":297},{"h":"INSERTION","t":"in Anatomy, the close conjunction of the vessels, tendons, fibres, and membranes of the body with some other parts.\n\n**INSINUATION** denotes a cunning and covert way of creeping into any person's favour.\n\n**INSINUATION of a Will**, among civilians, is the first production of it, or the leaving it with the register, in order to its probate.

Simon, inspiration is no more than a direction of the Holy Spirit, which never permitted the sacred writers to be mistaken.\n\nIt is a common opinion, that the inspiration of the Holy\nHoly Spirit regards only the matter, not the style or words; and this seems to fall in with M. Simon's doctrine of direction.\n\nTheological writers have enumerated several kinds of inspiration; such as an inspiration of superintendency, in which God does so influence and direct the mind of any person, as to keep him more secure from error in some various and complex discourse, than he would have been merely by the use of his natural faculties; plenary superintendent inspiration, which excludes any mixture of error at all from the performance so superintended; inspiration of elevation, where the faculties act in a regular, and, as it seems, in a common manner, yet are raised to an extraordinary degree, so that the composition shall, upon the whole, have more of the true sublime or pathetic, than natural genius could have given; and inspiration of suggestion, when the use of the faculties is superseeded, and God does, as it were, speak directly to the mind, making such discoveries to it as it could not otherwise have obtained, and dictating the very words in which such discoveries are to be communicated, if they are designed as a message to others. It is generally allowed that the New Testament was written by a superintendent inspiration; for without this the discourses and doctrines of Christ could not have been faithfully recorded by the evangelists and apostles; nor could they have assumed the authority of speaking the words of Christ, and evinced this authority by the actual exercise of miraculous powers: and besides, the sacred writings bear many obvious internal marks of their divine original, in the excellence of their doctrines, the spirituality and elevation of their design, the majesty and simplicity of their style, the agreement of their various parts, and their efficacy on mankind; to which may be added, that there has been in the Christian church, from its earliest ages, a constant tradition, that the sacred books were written by the extraordinary assistance of the Spirit, which must at least amount to superintendent inspiration. But it has been controverted whether this inspiration extended to every minute circumstance in their writings, so as to be in the most absolute sense plenary. Jerome, Grotius, Erasmus, Epiphanes, and many others, maintain that it was not; whilst others contend, that the emphatical manner in which our Lord speaks of the agency of the Spirit upon them, and in which they themselves speak of their own writings, will justify our believing that their inspiration was plenary, unless there be very convincing evidence brought on the other side to prove that it was not: and if we allow, it is said, that there were some errors in the New Testament, as it came from the hands of the apostles, there may be great danger of subverting the main purpose and design of it; since there will be endless room to debate the importance both of facts and doctrines.\n\nAmong the Heathens, the priests and priestesses were said to be divinely inspired, when they gave oracles.\u2014The poets also laid claim to it; and to this end they always invoked Apollo and the Muses at the beginning of any great work.\n\nInspiration, in Physic, is understood of that action of the breast, by which the air is admitted within the lungs; in which sense, inspiration is a branch of respiration, and stands opposed to Exspiration.\n\nThis admission of the air depends immediately on its spring or elasticity, at the time when the cavity of the breast is enlarged by the elevation of the thorax and abdomen, and particularly by the motion of the diaphragm downwards; so that the air does not enter the lungs, because they are dilated; but those dilate, because the air enters within them. Nor is it the dilatation of the breast which draws in the air, as is commonly thought, though this is a condition absolutely necessary to inspiration; but an actual intrusion of the air into the lungs.

It has a noble castle or palace, formerly the residence of the archdukes of the house of Austria, with a cathedral where they are buried. The houses, though built in the German taste, are rather handsome; and the streets, though narrow, are remarkably well paved. For the defence of this city the inhabitants can place but little confidence in their fortifications, which are very trifling. They seem rather to depend on the natural advantages of their country; which appear indeed to form a barrier, so perfectly inaccessible to any enemy, that even the great Gustavus Adolphus, after having overrun with his victorious arms the other parts of Germany, could never make any impression upon this.

INSTINCT, a certain power or disposition of mind, by which, independent of all instruction or experience, without deliberation, and without having any end in view, animals are unerringly directed to do spontaneously (a) whatever is necessary for the preservation of the individual or the continuation of the kind. Such in the human species is the instinct of sucking exerted immediately after birth; and such in the inferior creation is the instinct by which insects invariably deposit their eggs in situations most favourable for hatching and affording nourishment to their future progeny. These operations are necessary for the preservation of the individual and the continuation of the kind; but neither the infant nor the insect knows that they are necessary: they both act without having any end in view, and act uniformly without instruction and without experience.\n\nThe actions of the inferior animals are generally directed by instinct; those of man by reason. This at least is the case with respect to men in a state of civilization: in the savage state they are probably little less the slaves of instinct than the brutes themselves.\n\nConcerning human instincts, indeed, philosophers differ widely in opinion; some maintaining that man is endowed with a greater number of instincts than any species of brutes; whilst others deny that in human nature there is any power or propensity at all which can properly be called instinctive.\n\nThis diversity of opinion may easily be traced to its source. There are not many original thinkers in the world. The greater part even of those who are called philosophers, implicitly adopt the opinions of certain matters whose authority they deem sufficient to supply the place of argument; and having chosen their respective guides, each maintains with zeal what his master taught, or is supposed to have taught. When Locke so successfully attacked the doctrine of innate ideas and innate principles of speculative truth, he was thought by many to have overturned at the same time all innate principles whatever; to have divested the human mind of every passion, affection, and instinct; and to have left in it nothing but the powers of sensation, memory, and intellect. Such, we are persuaded, was not his intention; nor is there anything in his immortal work which, when interpreted with candour, appears to have such a tendency.\n\nIn our opinion, great part of the Essay on Human Understanding has been very generally misinterpreted. Much of its merit, however, was soon discovered; and mankind, finding philosophy disfigured by the barbarous jargon of the schools, and built upon a few self-evident principles, implicitly embraced every opinion advanced, or which they supposed to be advanced, by the illustrious author; especially if that opinion was contrary to any part of the scholastic system which had so long been employed to perplex the understanding and to veil absurdity. Hence arose many philosophers of eminence both at home and abroad; who maintained, as they imagined, upon the principles of Locke, that in the human mind there are no instincts, but that every thing which had been usually called by that name is resolvable into association and habit. This doctrine was attacked by Lord Shaftesbury, who introduced into the theory of mind, as faculties derived from nature, a sense of beauty, a sense of honour, and a sense of ridicule; and these he considered as the tests of speculative truth and moral rectitude. His lordship's principles were in part adopted by Mr Hutcheson of Glasgow, who published a system of moral philosophy, founded upon a sense or instinct, to which he gave the name of the moral sense; and the undoubted merit of his work procured him many followers.\n\nMen generally run from one extreme to another. It being now discovered, or at least supposed, that the human mind is endowed with instinctive principles of action, a sect of philosophers soon afterwards arose, who maintained with much vehemence that it is likewise endowed with instinctive principles of belief; and who built a system of metaphysics, if such it may be called, upon a number of innate, distinct, and independent senses. The rise of this sect is well known. Berkeley and Hume had adopted Locke's doctrine reflecting the origin of our ideas; and had thence deduced consequences supposed to be dangerous in themselves, but which, it was thought, could not be denied without refusing the principles from which they were inferred. The foundation of the instinctive system being thus laid, the system itself was rapidly carried to a height far beyond what seems to have been the intention of its excellent author; and reason was well nigh banished from the regions of philosophy. For such a proceeding it is not difficult to assign the cause. The instinctive scheme requires much less labour of investigation than the systems of Locke and the ancients; for upon the principles of it, when carried to its utmost extent, every phenomenon in human nature is thought to be sufficiently accounted for, by supposing it.\n\n(a) As nothing is of greater importance in the philosophy of mind than accurate definitions, it may not be improper to observe, that through the whole of this article the word spontaneous is to be taken in the sense in which it is used in the following extracts from Hales's Origin of Mankind: \"Many analogical motions in animals, though I cannot call them voluntary, yet I see them spontaneous: I have reason to conclude, that these are not simply mechanical.\" \"The sagacities and instincts of brutes, the spontaneousness of many of their motions, are not explicable, without supposing some active determinate power connected to and inherent in their spirits, of a higher extraction than the bare natural modification of matter.\" If this be attended to, our definition of instinct will be found perfectly consonant to that which has been given by the author of Ancient Metaphysic. \"Instinct (he says) is a determination given by Almighty Wisdom to the mind of the brute, to act in such or such a way, upon such or such an occasion, without intelligence; without knowledge of good or ill, and without knowing for what end or purpose he acts.\"\nIn the effect of a particular instinct implanted in the mind for that very purpose. Hence in some popular works of philosophy we have a detail of so many distinct internal senses, that it requires no small strength of memory to retain their very names: besides the moral sense, we have the sense of beauty, the sense of deformity, the sense of honour, the hoarding sense, and a thousand others which it is needless here to mention.\n\nThis new system, which converts the philosophy of mind into mere history, or rather into a collection of facts and anecdotes, though it has made a rapid progress, is not yet universally received. It has been opposed by many speculative men, and by none with greater skill than Dr Priestley; who maintains, with the earliest admirers of Locke, that we have from nature no innate sense of truth, nor any instinctive principle of action; that even the action of sucking in new-born infants is to be accounted for upon principles of mechanism; and that the desire of the senses is merely association.\n\nWhilst men, eminent for candour as well as for science, have thus been disputing the limits between instinct and reason in the human mind, and endeavouring to ascertain the actions which result from each, two writers of name, treating of that subject, have lately advanced opinions, which, if admitted as just, must render the dispute henceforth ridiculous, and put an end forever to all moral inquiries. Mr Smellie, in a work which he calls The Philosophy of Natural History, affirms, that between instinctive and rational motives no distinction exists, but that the reasoning faculty itself is the necessary result of instinct; and Dr Reid, in his Essays on the Active Powers of Man, by attributing to instinct the action of breathing, seems to confound that principle with mere mechanism.\n\nThat reason, instinct, and mechanism, are all essentially different from one another, has hitherto been universally allowed; and it appears not to be a talk of much difficulty to point out in what respect each of them differs from the other two. Actions performed with a view to accomplish a certain end are called rational actions, and the end in view is the motive to their performance. Instinctive actions have a cause, viz. the internal impulse by which they are spontaneously performed; but they cannot be said to have a motive, because they are not done with any view to consequences. Actions automatic have likewise a cause; but that cause is not internal impulse, but mere mechanism, by which they are performed without any spontaneity of the agent. Thus, a man gives charity in order to relieve a person from want; he performs a grateful action as a duty incumbent on him; and he fights for his country in order to repel its enemies. Each of these actions is performed from a motive, and therefore they are all rational actions. An infant is impelled to suck the breast, but he knows not that it is necessary for his preservation; a couple of young savages go together, for the first time, without any view to offspring or any determinate idea of enjoyment. These actions have no motive, and therefore are not rational; but as they are performed by a spontaneous exertion of the agents, they are not to be attributed to mere mechanism; they are therefore instinctive actions. A man breathes without any motive, without any spontaneous exertion of his own, and that as well when he is asleep as when he is awake. The action of breathing therefore is neither rational nor instinctive, but merely automatic or mechanical. All this seems to be very plain.\n\nTo talk of the motives of actions performed by instinct, in an argument intended to prove that between reason and instinct there is no difference, is either to beg the question or to pervert language. If the author of the Philosophy of Natural History chooses to call the impulse which prompts the infant to suck by the name of motive, he only uses an English word improperly; if it be his intention to affirm that such a motive is not totally and essentially different from that which prompts a man to give charity or to fight for his country, he affirms what all mankind know to be false (B).\n\nHaving thus ascertained what we mean by instinct, we shall now proceed to inquire, Whether or not there be any instinctive principles in man? But in order to proceed upon sure grounds, it will be proper to consider, in the first place, such actions of the inferior animals as are generally allowed to be instinctive: for an attempt has lately been made to prove, that even these actions are the offspring of reason influenced by motives; and that instinct, as we have defined it, is a mere imaginary principle, which has no existence either in man or brute.\n\n(B) The author of Ancient Metaphysics, whose learned work contains more good sense on this subject than any other book which we have seen, thus distinguishes between reason and instinct: \"With respect to the mere animal, it is evident, that he pursues nothing but what is conducive either to the preservation of the animal life or to the continuation of the kind. On the other hand, the object which the intellectual mind pursues, is the fair and the handsome; and its happiness consists in the contemplation of these. And though it pursue also what is useful and profitable for the being and well-being of the animal life, yet it is for the sake, not of the animal life itself, but of the \u03c4\u03bf \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03c2 or beautiful; which therefore is the ultimate object of its pursuit in all things.\n\n\"Another material difference in practice betwixt the animal and intellectual mind is, that every action of intellect proceeds from an opinion formed concerning what is good or ill, beautiful or the contrary, in the action. When we do so, we are said to act from will, which is always determined by some opinion formed of the kind I have mentioned: whereas, when we act from mere appetite or inclination, without deliberation or opinion formed, we act as the brute does always; for he has no will, but is prompted to action by natural impulse, or \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, as the Greeks call it.\n\n\"A third very material difference is, that intellect, in all its operations, proposes ends, and devises means to accomplish these ends; whereas the instinct of the brute proceeds without consideration either of ends or means.\"\nIt has been said that caterpillars, when shaken off a tree in every direction, instantly turn round towards the trunk and climb up, though they had never formerly been on the surface of the ground. This is a striking instance of instinct. On the tree, and not upon the ground, the caterpillar finds its food. If therefore it did not turn and climb up the trunk it would inevitably perish; but surely the caterpillar knows not that such an exertion is necessary to its preservation; and therefore it acts not from motives, but from blind impulse. The bee and the beaver are endowed with an instinct which has the appearance of foresight. They build magazines, and fill them with provisions; but the foresight is not theirs. Neither bees nor beavers know anything of futurity. The solitary wasp digs holes in the sand, in each of which she deposits an egg. Though she certainly knows not that an animal is to proceed from that egg, and fill its cells, if possible, that this animal must be nourished with other animals, she collects a few small green worms, which she rolls up in a circular form, and fixes in the hole in such a manner that they cannot move. When the wasp-worm is hatched, it is simply stored with the food which nature has destined for its support. The green worms are devoured in succession; and the number deposited is exactly proportioned to the time necessary for the growth and transformation of the wasp-worm into a fly; when it issues from the hole, and is capable of procuring its own nourishment. This instinct of the parent-wasp is the more remarkable, that she feeds not upon flesh herself. Birds of the same species, unless when restrained by peculiar circumstances, uniformly build their nests of the same materials, and in the same form and situation, though they inhabit very different climates; and the form and situation are always exactly suited to their nature, and calculated to afford them shelter and protection. When danger, or any other circumstance peculiar to certain countries, renders a deviation from the common form or situation of nests necessary, that deviation is made in an equal degree, and in the very same manner, by all the birds of one species; and it is never found to extend beyond the limits of the country where alone it can serve any good purpose. When removed by necessity from their eggs, birds return to them with haste and anxiety, and shift them so as to heat them equally; and it is worthy of observation, that their haste to return is always in proportion to the cold of the climate. But do birds reason, and all of the same species reason, equally well, upon the nature and extent of danger, and upon the means by which it can best be avoided? Have birds any notion of equality, or do they know that heat is necessary for incubation? No: in all these operations men recognize the intentions of nature; but they are hid from the animals themselves, and therefore cannot operate upon them as motives.\n\nOf the instinct of animals we shall give one instance more in the elegant and perspicuous language of Dr. Reid. \"Every manufacturing art among men (says that able writer) was invented by some man, improved by others, and brought to perfection by time and experience. Men learn to work in it by long practice, which produces a habit. The arts of men vary in every age and in every nation, and are found only in those men who have been taught them. The manufactures of animals differ from those of men in many striking particulars. No animal of the species can claim the invention; no animal ever introduced any new improvement, or any variation from the former practice; every one of the species has equal skill from the beginning, without teaching, without experience, and without habit; every one has its art by a kind of inspiration. I do not mean that it is inspired with the principles or rules of the art, but with the ability of working in it to perfection, without any knowledge of its principles, rules, or end. The work of every animal is indeed like the works of nature, perfect in its kind, and can bear the most critical examination of the mechanic or the mathematician; of which a honeycomb is a striking instance.\n\n\"Bees, it is well known, construct their combs with remarkable cells on both sides, fit both for holding their storeable in honey and for rearing their young. There are in them only three possible figures of the cells, which can make them all equal and similar, without any useless surfaces. These are the equilateral triangle, the square, and the regular hexagon. Of the three, the hexagon is the most proper, both for convenience and strength. Bees, as if they knew this, make their cells regular hexagons. As the combs have cells on both sides, the cells may either be exactly opposite, having partition against partition, or the bottoms of a cell may rest upon the partitions between the cells on the other side, which will serve as a buttress to strengthen it. The last way is the best for strength; accordingly the bottom of each cell rests against the point where three partitions meet on the other side, which gives it all the strength possible. The bottom of a cell may either be one plane, perpendicular to the side partitions; or it may be composed of several planes, meeting in a solid angle in the middle point. It is only in one of these two ways that all the cells can be similar without losing room. And, for the same intention, the planes, of which the bottom is composed, if there be more than one, must be three in number, and neither more nor fewer. It has been demonstrated, that by making the bottoms of the cells to consist of three planes meeting in a point, there is a saving of material and labour no way inconsiderable. The bees, as if acquainted with these principles of solid geometry, follow them most accurately; the bottom of each cell being composed of three planes, which make obtuse angles with the side partitions and with one another, and meet in a point in the middle of the bottom; the three angles of this bottom being supported by three partitions on the other side of the comb, and the point of it by the common intersection of these three partitions. One instance more of the mathematical skill displayed in the structure of a honeycomb deserves to be mentioned. It is a curious mathematical problem, at what precise angle the three planes which compose the bottom of a cell ought to meet, in order to make the greatest possible saving of material and labour. This is one of those problems belonging to the higher parts of mathematics, which are called problems of maxima and minima. The celebrated Mr. Laurin resolved it by a fluxionary calculation, which is to be found in the Transactions of the Royal Society of London, and determined precisely the angle required. Upon the most exact mensuration which the subject could admit, he\nhe afterwards found, that it is the very angle in which the three planes in the bottom of the cell of a honeycomb do actually meet.\n\n\"Shall we ask here, Who taught the bees the properties of solids, and to resolve problems of maxima and minima? If a honeycomb were a work of human art, every man of common sense would conclude, without hesitation, that he who invented the construction must have understood the principles on which it was constructed. We need not say that bees know none of these things. They work most geometrically without any knowledge of geometry; somewhat like a child, who by turning the handle of an organ makes good music without any knowledge of music. The art is not in the child, but in him who made the organ. In like manner, when a bee makes its combs so geometrically, the geometry is not in the bee, but in that great Geometrician who made the bee, and made all things in number, weight, and measure.\"\n\nWe have given a full detail of the structure of a honeycomb, because it is an effect of instinct which cannot be confounded with the operations of reason. The author of *The Natural History of Animals*, justly offended with that theory which treats of instinctive motives, which represents the human mind as a bundle of instincts, and of which the object seems to be to degrade mankind to the level of brutes, has very laudably exerted his endeavours to detect its weaknesses, and to expose it to contempt. But in avoiding one extreme, he seems to have run into the other; and whilst he maintains the rights of his own species, he almost raises the brutes to the rank of men. \"It is better (he says) to share our rights with others than to be entirely deprived of them.\" This is certainly true; and no good man will hesitate to prefer his theory to that of his antagonist; but we see no necessity for adopting either; the phenomena may be accounted for without degrading reason to the level of instinct, or elevating instinct to the dignity of reason.\n\nWe shall readily allow to Locke (c), that some of the inferior animals seem to have perceptions of particular truths, and within very narrow limits the faculty of reason; but we see no ground to suppose that their souls; but natural operations are performed with a view to convey their consequences; and therefore cannot persuade ourselves, from their conduct, that these operations are the result of a train of reasoning in the mind of the animal.\n\nHe acknowledges indeed, that their reasoning and thinking powers are remarkably deficient when compared with those of men; that they cannot take so full\n\n(c) \"For if they have any ideas at all, and are not mere machines, as some would have them, we cannot deny them to have some reason. It seems as evident to me, that some of them do, in certain instances, reason, as that they have senses; but it is only in particular ideas, just as they received them from the senses. They are the best of them tied up within those narrow bounds, and have not, as I think, the faculty to enlarge them by any kind of abstraction.\" *Essay on Human Understanding*, Book ii, chap. xi.\n\nThis is in part a just observation, and serves to account for many phenomena which later writers have derived from instinct. The author of *The Philosophy of Natural History* had \"a cat that frequented a closet, the door of which was fastened by a common iron latch. A window was situated near the door. When the door was shut, the cat gave herself no uneasiness. As soon as she tired of her confinement, she mounted on the sole of the window, and with her paw dexterously lifted the latch and came out.\" This practice, which we are told continued for years, must have been the consequence of what Locke calls reasoning in particular ideas. It could not be the effect of instinct; for instinct is adapted only to a state of nature, in which cats have neither latches to lift nor doors to open; and as it is not said that the animal attempted to lift the latches of other doors, we are not authorized to infer that this particular action was the consequence of reasoning in ideas enlarged by abstraction: the cat had repeatedly seen one door opened by an exertion which she was capable of imitating. Yet that animals have no power of enlarging their ideas, is a position, of the truth of which, though it is advanced by Locke, we are by no means confident. It is well known that crows feed upon several kinds of shell-fish when within their reach; and that they contrive to break the shell by raising the fish to a great height, and letting it drop upon a stone or a rock. This may perhaps be considered as pure instinct directing the animal to the proper means of acquiring its food. But what is to be thought of the following fact, which was communicated to us by a gentleman whose veracity is unquestioned, and who, being totally unacquainted with the theories of philosophers, has of course no favourite hypothesis to support? In the spring of the year 1791, a pair of crows made their nest in a tree, of which there are several planted round his garden; and in his morning-walks he had often been amused by witnessing furious combats between them and a cat. One morning the battle raged more fiercely than usual, till at last the cat gave way and took shelter under a hedge, as if to wait a more favourable opportunity of retreating to the house. The crows continued for a short time to make a threatening noise; but perceiving that on the ground they could do nothing more than threaten, one of them lifted a stone from the middle of the garden and perched it on a tree planted in the hedge, where she sat watching the motions of the enemy of her young. As the cat crept along under the hedge, the crow accompanied her by flying from branch to branch and from tree to tree; and when at last she ventured to quit her hiding-place, the crow, leaving the tree, and hovering over her in the air, let the stone drop from on high on her back. That the crow on this occasion reasoned, is self-evident; and it seems to be little less evident, that the ideas employed in her reasoning were enlarged beyond those which she had received from her senses. By her senses, she may have perceived, that the shell of a fish is broken by a fall; but could her senses inform her, that a cat would be wounded or driven off the field by the fall of a stone? No: from the effect of the one fall preserved in her memory, she must have inferred the other by her power of reasoning.\na review of the past, nor look forward with so penetrating an eye to the future; that they do not accumulate observation upon observation, or add the experience of one generation to that of another; that their manners do not vary nor their customs fluctuate like ours; and that their arts always remain the same, without degeneracy and without improvement. \"The crow (he observes) always builds its nest in the same way; every hen treats her young with the same measure of affection; even the dog, the horse, and the furtiveous elephant, seem to act rather mechanically than with design. From such hasty observations as these, it has been inferred (he says), that the brutes are directed in their actions by some mysterious influence, which impels them to employ their powers unintentionally in performing actions beneficial to themselves, and suitable to their nature and circumstances.\"\n\nAnd are these observations indeed hasty? And is this inference ill founded? To us the matter appears quite otherwise. If the arts of brutes and other animals have always remained the same without degeneracy, and without improvement; and if they be at the same time the result of reasoning, they must either be so perfect that they cannot be improved, or so imperfect that they cannot degenerate. That the structure of a honeycomb is imperfect, no man has ever imagined. We have seen, that, as far as we are capable of discerning the end which it is intended to serve, it is the most perfect structure possible: and therefore, if it be the result of the reasoning of the bee, the author must retract his assertion reflecting the extent of the reasoning and thinking powers of inferior animals; and instead of saying that they are remarkably deficient when compared with those of men, affirm that they are infinitely more perfect. No human art has yet arrived at such perfection as that it might not be improved; no architect has ever built a town, or constructed a magazine, which he could mathematically demonstrate to be of the very best possible form for the end intended, and so absolutely perfect as to be incapable of improvement.\n\nBut the same author proceeds to affirm, that \"the laws of analogical reasoning do not justify the idea that the brutes act, on any occasion, absolutely without design.\" Nay, he says, it seems more probable, \"that the inferior animals, even in those instances in which we cannot distinguish the motives which actuate them, or the views with which they proceed, yet act with design, and extend their views, if not a great way, yet at least a certain length forward; than that they can be upon any occasion, such as in rearing of their young, building nests, &c., actuated merely by feeling, or overruled by some mysterious influence, under which they are nothing but insensible instruments.\" This last phrase is ambiguous. If by insensible instruments it be meant that the brutes are considered by the advocates for instinct as mere machines without the faculties of sensation and spontaneity, the author is combating a phantom of his own creation; for we believe an opinion so absurd is not now maintained by any man, (see BRUTE.) But if by insensible instruments be meant such instruments as act spontaneously without being conscious of the end to which their actions lead, he appears not only to be egregiously mistaken in his conjecture reflecting the design of brutes, but also to have advanced an hypothesis contradictory and inconsistent.\n\nIf it be true, that the inferior animals act with de Maintaining-sign, even in those instances in which we cannot distinguished, and distinguish their motives, their views may indeed exist but a little way when compared with infinity; but certainly they extend farther than ours; for there is no useless work of man constructed with such skill, but that, after it is finished, another man of equal education will be able to distinguish the general design of the artist. But if the inferior animals, on all occasions, act with design, we should be glad to know the design of the bees in forming the cells of their combs in the manner which we have so largely described. Do these little animals indeed know that a comb, consisting on both sides of hexagonal cells, with the bottom of each composed of several planes meeting in a certain solid angle, and so formed as that the bottom of a cell on the one side shall rest upon the partitions between the cells on the other side, is in all respects the most proper both for holding their stores of honey and for rearing their young? And do they likewise know, that its excellence arises from the precise figure and position of the cells, by which there is a very considerable saving of labour and materials, whilst the comb at the same time has the greatest possible strength, and the greatest possible capacity? If they know all this, and act with a view to these ends, it must indeed be confessed that bees are rational creatures, and that their thinking and reasoning powers far surpass those of men; for they have from the earliest ages made discoveries in the higher mathematics, which there is reason to believe were altogether unknown to the human race till the beginning of the present century, and which at this moment are beyond the comprehension of nine-tenths of mankind in the most enlightened nation on earth. If this be a conclusion too absurd to be admitted, there is no other alternative but either to suppose that by this artificial structure of their cells the bees have some other end in view, which we cannot distinguish; or to acknowledge that they are overruled by some mysterious influence, under which they are nothing but spontaneous agents, unconscious of the end to which their operations tend. Which of these conclusions is the most rational, we will not offer such an insult to the understanding of our readers, as to suppose the meanest of them capable of entertaining a doubt. That a honeycomb is constructed with design, we must readily admit; but the design is not in the bees, but in the Creator of the bees, who directs their operations to their own good, by what the author with great propriety terms a mysterious influence (D).\n\nBut he thinks it an unanswerable argument in supposition to it.\n\n(d) Though this way of acting is undoubtedly mysterious, \"yet it should not appear extraordinary even to a man who is not a philosopher, as we see examples of it daily in our own species: For a man under the direction of another of superior understanding, will use means to accomplish an end, without having any idea of either...\"\nport of his theory, that in the performance of those actions, in which animals are said to be guided by unerring instinct, different individuals display different modes of conduct; and in his opinion, to talk of instinctive principles which admit of improvement, and accommodate themselves to circumstances, is merely to introduce new terms into the language of philosophy; for he affirms, that no such improvement or accommodation to circumstances can ever take place without a comparison of ideas and a deduction of inferences. It is probable that the author here alludes to those animals which, in their most important operations, are known to act differently in different countries. Thus the ostrich in Senegal, where the heat is excessive, neglects her eggs during the day, but sits upon them in the night. At the Cape of Good Hope, however, where the degree of heat is less, the ostrich, like other birds, sits upon her eggs both day and night. In countries infested with monkeys, many birds, which in other climates build in bushes and clefts of trees, suspend their nests upon slender twigs, and thus elude the rapacity of their enemies.\n\nIt may be thought, that a determination of the mind of the brute to act so variously upon different occasions, can hardly be conceived without judgment or intelligence. But before our author had so confidently affirmed that such accommodation to circumstances can never take place without a comparison of ideas and a deduction of inferences, he would have done well to consider how nature acts in other organized bodies, such as the vegetable. We see that a vegetable, reared in the corner of a dark cellar, will bend itself towards the light which comes in at the window; and if it be made to grow in a flower-pot, with its head downwards, it will turn itself into the natural position of a plant. Can it be supposed, that the plant, in either case, does what it does from any judgment or opinion that it is bent, and not from a necessary determination of its nature? But, further, to take the case of bodies unorganized, how shall we account for the phenomena which chemistry exhibits to us? When one body unites with another, and then, upon a third being presented to it, quits the first, and unites itself with it, shall we suppose that this preference proceeds from any predilection or opinion that it is better to cleave to the one than to the other, from any comparison of ideas or deduction of inferences? Or shall we not rather say, that it proceeds from an original law of nature impressed upon it by that Being who mediately or immediately directs every motion of every minute atom in the universe? And if so, why may not instinct be an original determination of the mind of the animal, of which it is part of the nature or essence to accommodate itself to certain circumstances, on which depends the preservation of the individual, or the continuation of the kind? Indeed it cannot be otherwise, if we have defined instinct properly; for no man ever supposed, that when animals work instinctively, they act for no purpose. It is only affirmed that the purpose is not known to them. It is known, however, to the Author of instinct; who knows likewise that the same purpose must in different climates be promoted by different means, and who accordingly determines the operations of animals of the same species to be different under different circumstances.\n\nBut though we cannot agree with this author when he affirms that no accommodation to circumstances can ever take place without a comparison of ideas, we readily admit that no faculty which is capable of improvement by observation and experience can in propriety of speech be termed instinct. Instinct being a positive determination given to the minds of animals by the Author of nature for certain purposes, must necessarily be perfect when viewed in connection with those purposes; and therefore to talk, as Mr. Smellie does, of the improvement of instinct, is to perplex the understanding by a perversion of language. There is not, however, a doubt, but that reason may copy the works of instinct, and so far alter or improve them as to render them subservient to other purposes than those for which they were originally and instinctively performed. It was thus in all probability that man at first learned many of the most useful arts of life.\n\n\"Thy arts of building from the bee receive;\n\"Learn of the mole to plough, the worm to weave;\n\"Learn of the little nautilus to fail,\n\"Spread the thin oar, and catch the driving gale.\"\n\nBut the arts thus adopted by men are no longer the works of instinct, but the operations of reason influenced by motives. This is so obviously and undeniably true, that it has compelled the author last mentioned to confess, in that very section which treats of instincts improvable by experience, that \"what men or brutes learn by experience, though this experience be founded on instinct, cannot with propriety be called instinctive knowledge, but knowledge derived from experience and observation. Instinct (he says) should be limited to such actions as every individual of a species exerts without the aid either of experience or imitation.\" This is a very just distinction between instinct and experience; but how to reconcile it with the fundamental principle of the author's theory we know not. It would certainly be a very arduous task; but it is a task from which we are happily relieved, as his theory and ours have little resemblance.\n\nHaving thus proved, we hope to the satisfaction of our readers, that there is such a principle as instinct in the inferior animals, and that it is essentially different from human reason; let us return to our own species, and inquire whether there be any occasions upon which man acts intuitively, and what those occasions are. This is a question of some difficulty, to which a complete and satisfactory answer will perhaps never be given, and to which we have not the vanity to think that such an answer will be given by us. The principle of affection (to be explained afterwards under the article Metaphysics) operates so powerfully in man, and at so early a period of life, that in many cases it seems to be impossible to distinguish the effects of either; and indeed, in my opinion, by far the greater part of mankind are destined by God and nature to be governed in that way.\" Ancient Metaphysics, vol. iii. p. 352.\nof habit from the operations of nature. Yet there are a few cases immediately connected with the preservation of the individual and the propagation of the kind, in which by a little attention these things may be distinguished. We have already given an instance in the sucking of a child, which we believe to be an operation performed by instinct. Dr Priestley, however, thinks differently: \"The action of sucking (says he), I am confident, from my own observations, is not natural, but acquired.\" What observations they were which led him to this conclusion he has not told us, and we cannot imagine; but every observation which we ourselves have made, compels us to believe that an attempt to suck is natural to children. It has been observed by the author of the Philosophy of Natural History, that the instinct of sucking is not excited by any smell peculiar to the mother, to milk, or to any other substance; for that infants suck indiscriminately every thing brought into contact with their mouths. He therefore infers, that the desire of sucking is innate, and coeval with the appetite for air. The observation is certainly just: but a disciple of Dr Priestley's may object to the inference; for \"in sucking and swallowing our food, and in many such instances, it is exceedingly probable (says the doctor), that the actions of the muscles are originally automatic, having been placed by our Maker, that at first they are stimulated and contract mechanically whenever their action is requisite.\" This is certainly the case with respect to the motion of the muscles in the action of breathing; and if that action be of the same kind and proceed from the very same cause with the action of sucking, and if a child never show a desire to suck but when something is brought into contact with its mouth, Dr Priestley's account of this operation appears to us much more satisfactory than that of the authors who attribute it to instinct.\n\nBut the actions of breathing and sucking seem to differ essentially in several particulars. They are indeed both performed by means of air; but in the former, a child for many months exerts no spontaneous effort, whilst a spontaneous effort seems to be absolutely necessary for the performance of the latter. Of this indeed we could not be certain, were it true that infants never exhibit symptoms of a wish to suck, but when something is actually in contact with their mouths; for the mere act of sucking then might well be supposed to be automatic and the effect of irritation: But this is not the case. A healthy and vigorous infant, within ten minutes of its birth, gives the plainest and most unequivocal evidence of a desire to suck, before any thing be brought into actual contact with its mouth. It stretches out its neck, and turns its head from side to side apparently in quest of something: and that the object of its pursuit is something which it may suck, every man may satisfy himself by a very convincing experiment. When an infant is thus stretching out its neck and moving its head, if any thing be made to touch any part of its face, the little creature will instantly turn to the object, and endeavour by quick alternate motions from side to side to seize it with its mouth, in the very same manner in which it always seizes the breast of its nurse, till taught by experience to distinguish objects by the sense of sight, when these alternate motions, being no longer useful, are no longer employed. If this be not an instance of pure instinct, we know not what it is. It cannot be the result of association or mechanism; for when the stretching of the neck takes place, nothing is in contact with the child's mouth, and no association which includes the act of sucking can have been formed. Associations of ideas are the consequences of simultaneous impressions frequently repeated; but when the child first declares, as plainly as it could do were it possessed of language, its wish to suck, it has not received a single impression with which that wish can possibly be associated.\n\nWere Dr Priestley to weigh these facts, of the truth of which we are certain, we doubt not that his well-known candour would make him retract the assertion, that all the actions which Dr Reid and others refer to instinct, are either automatic or acquired. The greater part of those actions, as well as of the apparently instinctive principles of belief, we have no doubt are acquired: but we are persuaded that a child sucks its nurture as a bee builds its cell, by instinct; for upon no other hypothesis can we account for the spontaneous efforts exerted in both these operations: and we think it no disgrace to our species, that in some few cases we should act from the same principle with the inferior creation, as nothing seems more true than that,\n\n\u2014Reason raise o'er instinct as we can;\nIn this 'tis God that works, in that 'tis man.\n\nWe have said, that, in the savage state, the sexes go together for the first time by instinct, without any view to offspring, and perhaps with no determinate idea of enjoyment. This opinion, we believe, has been generally maintained; but it is controverted by Dr Hartley. \"Here (says he) we are to observe, first, that when a general pleasurable state is introduced, either by direct impressions or by associated influences, the organs of generation must sympathize with this general state, for the same reasons as the other parts do. They must therefore be affected with vibrations in their nerves, which rise above indifference, into the limits of pleasure, from youth, health, grateful aliment, the pleasures of imagination, ambition, and sympathy, or any other cause which diffuses grateful vibrations over the whole system.\u2014Secondly, as these organs are endowed with a greater degree of sensibility than the other parts, from their make, and the peculiar structure and disposition of their nerves, whatever these be, we may expect that they should be more affected by those general pleasurable states of the nervous system than the other parts.\u2014Thirdly, the dilution of the cells of the vesiculae seminales and of the sinuses of the uterus, which take place about the time of puberty, must make these organs more particularly irritable then.\" His fourth observation reflects a state widely different from that of nature, and therefore is nothing to the purpose: but his fifth is, that \"the particular shame which regards the organs of generation, may, when considered as an associated circumstance, like other pains, be so far diminished as to fall within the limits of pleasure, and add considerably to the sum total.\"\n\nTo this excellent and able writer we may allow the truth of these observations (though some of them might certainly be controverted); and yet deny his conclusion, that \"they are sufficient to account for the general...\"\ngeneral desires which are observable in young persons, and that those desires are of a factitious nature.\" For supposing every thing which he mentions to take place by mere mechanism and association; that the organs of generation are irritated, and certain cells and sinuses distended; the only inference which can be fairly drawn from such premises is, that at the age of puberty young men and women must from these causes experience certain feelings and wants which they knew not before; but purely mechanism and association cannot teach them the use of the organs of generation, or point out the only means by which their new feelings can be gratified; and therefore, as we see these means invariably pursued by all animals rational and irrational, without experience and without instruction, we must refer the mutual desire of the sexes to a higher principle than mere mechanism and association; and that principle can be nothing but instinct.\n\nBesides these, we think the action of eating may be attributed to instinct. It is certainly performed by a spontaneous exertion of the proper organs; and that exertion is first made at a time of life when we have no conception of the end which it serves to accomplish, and therefore cannot be influenced by motives. It must indeed be confessed, that the first act of chewing is performed by a child, not for the purpose of masticating food, but to quicken the operation of nature in the cutting of teeth; and perhaps it may be said, that the pleasing sensation of taste, which is then first experienced, and afterwards remembered, prompts the child to continue at intervals the exertion of chewing after all his teeth are cut; so that though the act of eating is not performed with a view to the mastication of food or the nourishment of the body, it may yet be performed, not from any instinctive impulse, but merely from an early and deep-rooted association. But in answer to this it is sufficient to ask, Who taught the infant that the act of chewing would quicken the operation of nature in the cutting of teeth? Not reason, surely, nor experience; for an infant knows nothing of teeth or the manner in which they grow; and if it be granted, that for this purpose it was originally impelled by some internal and mysterious influence to perform the act of chewing, we are not inclined to deny that the operation may be continued for other purposes by means of association.\n\nIn human works, though laboured on with pain,\nA thousand movements scarce one purpose gain;\nIn God's, one finger can its end produce,\nYet serves to second too some other use.\n\nThis is found philosophy confirmed by observation and daily experience; but though in the works of God, one principle produces many consequences, and though perhaps there is not a principle which falls under our cognizance more fruitful than that of association, yet if it be not sufficient to account for the first act of chewing, we cannot refer to it alone as to the source of that operation. Should it be said, that the gums of an infant are at the period of cutting teeth so irritable, that the moment any thing is applied to them the jaws perform a motion merely automatic, which we mistake for the spontaneous effect of instinct; still we would ask, What prompts the child to apply every thing to its mouth? Does the irritation of the gums contract the muscles of the arm? By a bigot for mechanism this might be said, were it true that the arm of an infant, like a piece of clock-work, is always so regularly moved as to bring its hand directly into contact with its gums: but this is far from being the case; an infant makes many unsuccessful efforts to reach its mouth, and does not accomplish its purpose till after repeated trials. Perhaps it may be alleged (for when men adopt a favourite hypothesis they will allege anything in its support), that infants are taught to carry things to their mouths by the pleasing sensation received from the application of their nurse's breasts, and continue the practice from habit and association. But it is certain that they do not begin this practice till teeth are forming in their gums; and then they use such things as they themselves carry to their mouths very differently from the breasts of their nurse: they constantly chew and bite their rattles, though they very seldom bite their nurses. As this practice cannot be begun from a principle of association, so it appears to us that it cannot be continued upon such a principle. Were the sensation experienced by an infant when chewing a hard substance a pleasing sensation, the remembrance of the pleasure might as a motive prompt it to repeat the operation; but it is obvious, that by pressing a gum, through which a tooth is making its way, against anything hard, the infant must experience a painful sensation; and therefore the influence which impels it to continue this operation, must be something more powerful than pleasure or pain.\n\nThese three actions, then, by which infants suck, by which they chew their food, and by which mankind be other are propagated, have undeniably their origin in instincts. There may be many other human actions which it is which derive their origin from the same source; but impossible in a state of civil society it is very difficult, if not to distinguish them from the effects of early custom or habit.\n\nSuch, however, is the present impatience of that labour without which effects cannot be traced to their causes, that every phenomenon in human nature, which to former philosophers would have occasioned difficulty, is now thought to be sufficiently accounted for by referring it to some instinct as its particular cause; and he who can provide himself with a sufficient number of these instincts, for the reality of which he offers no proof, seats himself in the philosopher's chair, and dreams that he is debating a system of science, whilst he is only retailing a collection of anecdotes. A philosopher of this school has lately carried the doctrine recently of instinctive principles so far, as to attribute the superiority of man over the other animals, chiefly to the great number of instincts with which his mind is endowed; and among these he reckons (not, we believe, as characteristic of our species in contradistinction to other animals, but as part of the instinctive bundle in the large-ness of which our superiority consists) \"the voiding of urine and excrement, sneezing, retraction of the muscles upon the application of any painful stimulus, the moving of the eyelids and other parts of the body.\" These (he says) are effects of original instincts, and essential to the existence of young animals. With this writer instinct is sometimes represented as looking into futurity, and acting upon motives which have hitherto been considered as the province of reason and the characteristic of man.\nInstinct man; here the same instinct is confounded with irritation and mechanism; and if this mode of philosophizing continue in fashion, we shall not be surprised to find men, beasts, birds, and vegetables, considered by some other writer as nothing more than different species of the same genus of beings, that are all actuated by the great and universal principle of instinct. If sneezing and the retraction of the muscles upon the application of any painful stimulus be actions of instinct, there cannot be a doubt, upon the received principles of philosophy, but that the contraction of the leaves of the sensitive plant upon the application of any stimulus proceeds likewise from instinct: nay, a piece of leather must be endowed with instinct; for it too retracts upon the application of the painful stimulus of fire. All these are evidently similar effects produced by the same or similar causes; for in the operations of sneezing and retracting the muscles upon any painful application, there is not the least spontaneous exertion on our part, no co-operation of mind more than in the contraction of the leather and the plant. With respect to the voiding of urine and excrement, it is obvious, that at first these operations are performed without any effort of spontaneity; and that a voluntary power over the muscles which are subservient to them is very gradually acquired. Urine and excrement irritate the bladder and guts, which are supplied with branches of the same nerves that supply the abdominal muscles. But it is well known that the irritation of one branch of a nerve brings on a contraction of the muscles which are supplied by the other branches. Urine and excrement therefore are evidently expelled by the mechanical contraction of the organs of excretion; and to attribute these evacuations to instinct, is equally absurd as to say, that water or any other fluid substance pent up in a vessel, and pressed equally on all sides, makes its escape by instinct through the easiest passage. It is difficult to guess what the author means by the instinctive motion of the eyelids and other parts of the body. There is a motion of the eyelids which is voluntary, and another which is involuntary. The former proceeds from some motive, to exclude too great a glare of light, or to guard the eye against a foreseen mischief, and is therefore the result of reason as distinguished from instinct: the latter is obviously the effect of association, which took place in early infancy and produced a habit. Infants for several days after birth do not wink with their eyes upon the approach of one's hand or any other substance; but after having experienced pain from too much light or any other thing which hurts the eye, and that pain having at first produced an automatic motion of the eyelids, the motion comes in time to be so closely associated with its cause, that the very appearance of the latter produces the former. In all this there is no instinct, nor anything which resembles instinct: in the one case, the motion of the eyelids is in the strictest sense voluntary and rational; and in the other, it is either automatic or the effect of habit.\n\n\"The love of light (says the same writer) is exhibited by infants at a very early period. I have remarked evident symptoms of this attachment on the third day after birth. When children are farther advanced, marks of the various passions generally appear. The passion of fear is discoverable at the age of two months. It is called forth by approaching the hand to the child's eye, and by any sudden motion or unusual noise.\" It has likewise been said, that \"an infant may be put into a fright by an angry countenance, and soothed again by smiles and blandishments;\" and \"that all these are causes of pure instinct.\" In reply to which, we scruple not to assert with Dr Priestley, that an infant (unless by an infant be meant a child who has a good deal of experience, and of course has made many observations on the connections of things) \"is absolutely incapable of terror. I am positive (says he), that no child ever showed the least symptom of fear or apprehension till he had actually received hurts and had felt pain; and that children have no fear of any particular person or thing, but in consequence of some connection between that person or thing and the pain they have felt. If any instinct of this kind were more necessary than another, it would be the dread of fire. But everybody must have observed, that infants show no sign of any such thing; for they will as readily put their finger to the flame of a candle as to any thing else, till they have been burned. But after some painful experience of this kind, their dread of fire, though undeniably the effect of association, becomes as quick and as effectual in its operations as if it were an original instinctive principle.\" We moreover do not hesitate to say, with the same great philosopher, that if it were possible always to beat and terrify a child with a placid countenance, so as never to affume that appearance but in those circumstances, and always to soothe him with what we call an angry countenance, this connection of ideas would be reversed, and we should see the child frightened with a smile and delighted with a frown. In fact, there is no more reason to believe that a child is naturally afraid of a frown, than that he is afraid of being in the dark; and of this children certainly discover no sign, till they have either found something disagreeable to them in the dark, or have been told that there is something dreadful in it.\n\nThe truth of these observations is so obvious, that we doubt not but they will carry conviction to the mind of every reader. For though it should be granted, that so early as on the third day after birth children exhibit symptoms of uneasiness upon the sudden exclusion of light, it would by no means follow that the love of light is in them instinctive. Light operates upon the eye by contact, and communicates to the infant a sensation of touch. If that sensation be pleasant, the child must necessarily feel some degree of uneasiness upon its removal, just as a full grown man must feel uneasy upon being deprived of any positive pleasure. But is sensation, or pleasure, or the removal of pleasure, pure instinct? No, surely.\n\nThus difficult is it to say in many cases what actions have their origin in instinct, and what are merely the effects of early association. But we think it may be safely affirmed, that no action, whether of man or brute, which is deliberately performed with a view to consequences, can with any propriety be said to proceed from instinct; for such actions are the effect of reason influenced by motives. Deliberation and instinct are obviously incompatible. To say with the author of the Philosophy of Natural History, \"that, when we are stimulated...\"\nInstructed by a particular instinct, instead of instantly obeying the impulse, another instinct arises in opposition, creates hesitation, and often totally extinguishes the original motion to action. It is either to affirm what is apparently not true, or it is a gross perversion of language. Motives opposed to each other may create hesitation, and a powerful motive may counterbalance a feeble instinct; but of two or more instincts operating at the same time, and opposing each other, we have no conception. Instinct, if we choose to speak a language that is intelligible, means a certain impulse under the direction of Supreme Wisdom; and it is very little probable that such wisdom should give opposite impulses at the same instant. In the natural works of animals, which are confessedly under the influence of instinct, we perceive no symptoms of deliberation; but every one, when not interrupted by external violence, proceeds without hesitation in the direct road, to an end of which the animal itself knows nothing. The same would be the case with man were he under the guidance of instinct; and it is vain to say that the instinct of fear is daily counteracted by ambition and resentment, till it be proved that fear, ambition, and resentment, are really instincts. Of this, however, the author seems to have no doubt. Indeed his work is so liberally stored with these principles, so useful to every man who wishes to acquire the name of a philosopher without the labour of investigation, that not only fear, ambition, and resentment, but even superstition, devotion, respect for eminent characters, avarice, hope, envy, benevolence, and sympathy, are all, in his opinion, instincts simple or modified. The origin of fear we have already seen when examining the instincts said to exhibit themselves in early infancy: let us try if we cannot trace some other individuals of this numerous family to the same source of early affections.\n\nThe case then seems to be as follows. We first perceive or suppose some real good, i.e., some instincts to promote our happiness, in those things which we love or desire. Hence we annex to those things the idea of pleasure; with which they come, in time, to be so closely associated in our minds, that they cannot ever after present themselves without bringing that idea along with them. This association likewise often remains even after that which first gave rise to it is quite forgotten, or perhaps does not exist. An instance or two will make this very clear. No man can be born a lover of money; for in a state of nature money exists not: no man therefore can be born with our author's instinct of avarice, directed in the manner which the most common acceptation of that word denotes. Yet how many men are there in the world, who have as strong a desire for money as if that desire were innate and instinctive; who account so much money so much happiness; and who make the mere possession of gold and silver, without any thought or design of using them, the ultimate end of all their actions? This is not because the love of money is born with them, for that is impossible; but because they first perceive a great many advantages from the possession of money, whence they conceive a pleasure in having it. Hence they desire it, endeavour to obtain it, and feel an actual pleasure in obtaining and possessing it. Then, by dropping the intermediate steps between money and happiness, they join money and happiness immediately together, and content themselves with the fantastic pleasure of having it; making that which was at first pursued only as means, be to them an ultimate end, in which consists their happiness or misery. The same might be observed concerning the thirst after knowledge, fame, ambition, and most of the various pursuits of life. These are at first entered upon with a view to some farther end, but at length become habitual exercises; with which the idea of pleasure is so closely associated, that we continue the pursuit after the reason from which it was at first begun has entirely vanished from our minds. Hence also we may account for another of our author's modified instincts, the almost diabolical feeling of envy. Mr Locke observes, that there are some men entirely unacquainted with this passion. His observation we believe to be a just one; for most men that are used to reflection, remember the time when they were first under its influence; and though they did not, it is a thing very little likely that the benevolent Author of nature should have implanted in the human mind even the seeds of an instinct, which, in the emphatic language of the Rambler, \"is mere unmixed and genuine evil.\" Envy is that pain which arises in the mind upon observing the success or prosperity of others; not however of all others indefinitely, but only of those with whom, upon some account or other, the envious person has once had a rivalry. But of such a feeling the origin is obvious; for when two or more persons are competitors for the same thing, the success of the one necessarily tends to the detriment of the other: hence the success of the one rival is in the mind of the other closely associated with pain or misery; and this association remaining after the rivalry which occasioned it has ceased, the person in whose mind envy is thus generated, always feels pain at the success of his rival even in affairs which have no relation to the original competition. Thus it is, that we are apt to envy those persons who refuse to be guided by our judgments, or persuaded by our arguments: For this is nothing else than a rivalry about the superiority of judgment; and we take a secret pride, both to let the world see, and in imagining ourselves, that in perspicuity and strength of judgment we have no superior.\n\nThough the principle of association will be more fully explained in another place, there is one observation which must not be omitted here; it is, that we do not always, nor perhaps for the most part, make these associations ourselves, but learn them from others in very early life. We annex happiness or misery to certain things or actions, because we see it done by our parents or companions; and acquire principles of action by imitating those whom we esteem, or by being told, by those in whom we have been taught to place confidence, that such conduct will promote our happiness, and that the reverse will involve us in misery. Hence the son too often inherits both the vices and the virtues of his father as well as his estate; hence national virtues and vices, dispositions and opinions; and hence too it is, that habits formed before the period of distinct remembrance are so generally mistaken for natural instincts.\n\nFrom the whole then of this investigation, we think ourselves warranted to conclude, that there is an essential difference between mechanism and instinct, and between both and reason; that mankind perform actions automatic by actions.\nThe primary schools, one of which is established in every district, where children are taught the arts of reading and writing, the elements of French grammar, of arithmetic and geometry, &c. 2.

The condition of possessing property was required by 19 Geo. II. c. 37, to prevent ships from being fraudulently destroyed when insured above their value; and to discourage a practice which had become common, of converting policies to the purpose of mere wagers. In transactions of this kind, as the insured had no property, and could claim no indemnification for partial damage; so the insurers, having lost their wager by the ship's being lost, could claim no abatement, though part was saved: accordingly, the policies contained clauses of interest or no interest, free from average, and without benefit of salvage. All such policies are declared invalid.\n\nThis restriction does not extend to privateers, nor to ships trading to the Spanish or Portuguese plantations.\n\nInsurances are commonly made as interest shall appear; and it is incumbent on the insured to prove the value of his property. The value of the goods may be proved by the invoices; and the coquet must be produced, if required, to instruct that the goods were actually shipped. It is admitted to value the ship at prime cost and charges, deducting the freights that have been drawn since purchased, if the proprietors choose to stand to that rule; but they are not restricted to it. Sometimes the value of the ship or goods is expressed in the policy; and this value must be admitted, although it be higher than the true one: but it is incumbent on the insured to prove that he had property at stake; and, if the property be trifling in comparison of the sum insured, the insurance will be set aside, as an evasion of the statute.\n\nExpected profits, and bounty on the whale fishery, if specified in the policy, may be insured.\n\nWhen the value is less than the sum insured, the owners may claim a return of premium for the excess.\n\nIf there be several policies on the same subject, of different dates, the earliest one is valid, and the others must be vacated. If they be of the same date, they must be vacated in equal proportions.\n\nWhen a policy is vacated, in whole or in part, the underwriters have a right to retain \u00bd per cent. for their trouble.\n\nIn the case of a cargo intended for A, but afterwards sent to B, both expected it, and insured, and B claimed for the value on its being lost. The underwriters answered, that it was a double insurance, and they ought only to pay their proportion. Judgment was\nInsurance was given, finding them liable for the whole, and reserving to them any demand competent against the underwriters who insured for A.\n\nFraudulently to cast away or destroy a ship insured above its value, is felony.\n\n2. If the ship does not proceed on the voyage, or if, being warranted to depart with convoy, it departs without convoy, the insurance must be vacated.\n\nIf the extent of a trading voyage be uncertain, the longest one in contemplation is described in the policy, and it is agreed that part of the premium shall be returned, if the voyage be shortened. In like manner, in time of war, when insurance is made without condition of convoy, it is agreed that part of the premium be returned in case it fail with convoy.\n\nWhen a ship is warranted to depart with convoy, it is understood from the usual place of convoy (e.g., the Downs), and it is insured till it arrive there.\n\nThe common proof of failing with convoy is the production of failing orders; but, if a ship be prevented by the weather from receiving the failing orders, other proof may be admitted.\n\nA ship was insured from the Thames to Halifax, warranted to sail from Portsmouth with convoy. The convoy had failed before the ship arrived there, and the underwriters declined to insure it, without convoy, for the rest of the voyage. They were found liable to return part of the premium, retaining only in proportion to the accustomed rate from London to Portsmouth. This decision seems to establish the following principle, that, when the voyage performed is only part of that described in the policy, and when the risk can be proportioned, the underwriters are bound to return part of the premium, though there be no agreement for that purpose.\n\nBut, if a ship, insured only against the hazards of the sea, be taken by the enemy, the insured have no right to claim a return of premium, though the capture happen soon, under pretence that little sea-hazard was incurred.\n\nIf a ship deviates from the voyage described in the policy, without necessity, it sets aside the insurance. An intention to deviate is not sufficient to set it aside; there must be an actual deviation; and, even in that case, the insurers are liable for damages sustained before deviation.\n\nIt is no deviation to go out of the way to the accustomed place of convoy, nor to the nearest place where necessary repairs may be had. Deviation, for the purpose of smuggling, if without the knowledge of the owners, does not set aside the insurance, nor when the matter is forced by the crew to return.\n\nIn insurance to the East Indies, and home, the insurers are understood to take the risk of detention in the country, and of country voyages.\n\n3. Insurance of prohibited goods, against the risk of seizure by the government, is unlawful, and invalid. The insurers, insured, brokers, and all accessories, are liable to the fine of \u00a3500.\n\n4. If the insured have any information of more than common danger, they must reveal every such circumstance to the insurers, otherwise the policy is set aside.\n\nThis rule is established for the preservation of good faith; and there are several strong decisions in support of it. If a ship be spoke to leaky at sea, or if there be a report of its being lost, these circumstances must be communicated to the insurers. Even the concealment of a false report of loss invalidates the insurance; and, if the ship be afterwards lost, though in a different manner, the insured will recover nothing. In a voyage from Carolina to London, another ship had failed ten days after that which was insured, and arrived seven days before the insurance was made; and the concealment of this circumstance, though the fact was not proved to the satisfaction of the jury, was considered as sufficient to set it aside. Also, during the continuance of the American war, a ship being insured from Portugal, by the month, without confederating on the voyage, failed for North America, and was taken by a provincial privateer. The insurers refused to pay, because the hazardous destination was concealed; and it was only upon proof of the insured being equally ignorant of it that they were found liable.\n\nBut the insured are not obliged to take notice of general perils, which the insurers are understood to have in contemplation; dangerous navigation, West Indian hurricanes, enterprises of the enemy, and the like.\n\nInsurance is not set aside by a mistake in the name of the ship or master, or the like.\n\nInsurance may be made on an uncertain ship; on any ship that the goods may be loaded on; on any ship that A shall sail in from Virginia. In this last case, the policy is not transferred to a ship which A goes on board during the voyage.\n\nSecondly, If a ship be insured at and from a port, the insurance commences immediately if the ship be there, or at its arrival there. If it be damaged when preparing for a voyage, the insurers are liable; but not if the voyage be laid aside for several years, with consent of the owners. Insurance from a port commences when the ship breaks ground; and, if it set sail, and be driven back and lost in the port, the insurers are liable.\n\nInsurance on goods generally continues till they be landed; but, if they be sold after the ship's arrival, and freight contracted to another port, the insurance is concluded. Goods sent on board another ship or lighter are not at the risk of the insurer; but goods sent ashore in the long boat are.\n\nInsurance on freight commences when the goods are put on board.\n\nGoods from the East Indies, insured to Gibraltar, and to be relifted from thence to Britain, were put on board a store-ship at Gibraltar, to wait an opportunity of relifting, and were lost: The custom of putting goods aboard a store-ship being proved, the insurers were found liable.\n\nLoss of sails ashore, when the ship is repairing, is comprehended within the insurance. What is necessarily understood, is insured, as well as what is expressed; the essential means, and intermediate steps, as well as the end. Ships performing quarantine are at the risk of the insurer.\n\nThirdly, The insurers are liable for a total loss when the subject perishes through any of the perils insured against. Barratry, though it properly signifies running away with the ship, extends to any kind of fraud in\nInsurance against detention of princes does not extend to ships that are seized for transgressing the laws of foreign countries.\n\nThe insurers are also liable for a total loss, when damage is sustained, and the remaining property abandoned or veiled in the insurers.\n\nIf a ship be stranded, or taken, and kept by the enemy, or detained by any foreign power, or seized for the service of the government, the proprietors have a right to abandon.\n\nBut, if a ship be taken by the enemy, and be retaken, or makes its escape, before action against the insurers; have the insured a right to abandon, or must they only claim for the damages sustained as an average loss? There are opposite decisions, according as the circumstances of the case were strong. When the ship was long detained, the goods perishable, the voyage entirely lost, or so disturbed, that the pursuit of it was not worth the freight, or when the damage exceeds half the value of the thing, they have been found entitled to abandon; Gos against Withers, 2 Burrow, 683.). But, if the voyage be completed with little trouble or delay, they are not entitled; (Hamilton against Mendez, 2 Burrow, 1198.).\n\nThe insured cannot claim, as for a total loss, on an offer to abandon, when the loss is, in its nature, only partial; for, if this were permitted, they might devolve the loss occasioned by bad markets on the insurers.\n\nAnd, in all cases, the insured have their option to abandon, or not. They may retain their property if they please, and claim for an average loss; and they must make their option before they claim.\n\nIf the goods be so much damaged, that their value is less than the freight, the insurers are accountable as for a total loss.\n\nThe insurers are liable for general average, when the property is charged with contribution; and for particular average, when the property is damaged, or part of it destroyed.\n\nIf the damage be sustained through the fault of the ship, the owners of the goods may have recourse, either against the master or insurers; and, if the insurers be charged, they stand in the place of the owners, and have recourse against the master.\n\nIn order to prevent the insurers from being troubled with frivolous demands for average, it is generally stipulated, that none shall be charged under 5 per cent., or some other determined rate; and corn, flax, fruit, fish, and like perishable goods, are warranted free from average, unless general, or the ship be stranded.\n\nIn order to encourage every effort to save the ship, the insurers are liable for charges laid out with that design, although the subject perish. Thus, they may be charged with more than the sum insured.\n\nIn case of goods being damaged, the proportion of the sum insured, for which the underwriters are liable, is regulated by the proportion of the prices which the sound and damaged goods fetch at the port of destination. The prime cost of the goods is not considered, nor the necessity of immediate sale, in consequence of damage. Although the damaged goods fell above prime cost, the insurers are liable.\n\nFourthly, If a ship be lost, and the crew saved, the loss is proved by the evidence of the crew.\n\nIf damage be sustained, the extent is proved by an examination of the subject damaged, at the ship's arrival; and the cause by the evidence of the crew.\n\nIf the ship be stranded, evidence must be taken at the place where stranded.\n\nDocuments of loss must be laid before the underwriters, with all convenient speed; and, if these be sufficiently clear, the loss should be immediately settled. The underwriters generally grant their notes at a month or six weeks date for their proportions.\n\nIf a ship be not heard of for a certain time, it is presumed lost; and the underwriters are liable to pay the sums insured, the property being abandoned to them in the event of the ship's return. Six months are allowed for a voyage to any part of Europe, a year to America, and two years to the East Indies.\n\nBy the ordinance of Hamburgh, if a ship be three months beyond the usual time of performing a voyage, the underwriters may be desired to pay 92 per cent. on an abandon. If they decline it, they are allowed 14 months more, and then they must pay the full value.\n\nA ship insured against the hazards of the sea, but not against the enemy, if never heard of, is presumed lost at sea.\n\nFifthly, In order that the manner of settling losses may be understood, we must explain what is meant by covering property. We mentioned already, that insurances for greater sums than the insured had really at stake, were contrary to law; but some latitude is allowed in that respect; for if the owner were to insure no more than the exact value of his property, he would lose the premium of insurance, and the abatement, if any was agreed on.\n\nFor example, if he has goods on board to the value of 100l. and insures the same at 5 per cent. to abate 2 per cent. in case of loss; then, if a total loss happen, he recovers 98l. from the insurers, of which 5l. being applied to replace the premium, the net sum saved is only 93l.; but, if the value on board be only 93l. and the sum insured 100l. he would be fully indemnified for the loss; and his property, in that case, is said to be covered.\n\nTo find how much should be insured to cover any sum, subtract the amount of the premium and abatement (if any) from 100l. As the remainder is to 100l., so is the value to the sum which covers it.\n\nIn case of a total loss, if the sum insured be not greater than that which covers the property, the insurers must pay it all. If greater, they pay what covers the property, and return the premium on the overplus.\n\nPartial losses are regulated by this principle, that whereas the owner is not fully indemnified, in case of a total loss, unless he covers his property, therefore he should only be indemnified for a partial loss in the same proportion; and, if it be not fully insured, he is considered as insurer himself, for the part not covered, and must bear a suitable proportion of the loss. Therefore the value of the property is proved, and the sum required to cover it computed. If that sum be all insured, the underwriters pay the whole damage; if only part be insured, they pay their share, which is computed by the following rule: As the sum which covers the property is to the sum insured, so is the whole damage to the\nInsurance, the part for which the insurers are liable.\u2014For example, if the value of the property be \u00a3360l., the sum insured \u00a3300l., the premium 8 per cent. and abatement 2 per cent.; then the sum which should be insured to cover the property is \u00a3400l.; and, if damage be sustained to the extent of \u00a3200l., the owners will recover \u00a3150l.\n\nIf a voyage is insured out and home, the premium outward must be considered as part of the value on the homeward property, and the sum necessary to cover it computed accordingly. For example, to insure \u00a3100l. out and home, at 5 per cent. each voyage, abatement 2 per cent., we compute thus:\n\n\\[ \\frac{93}{100} : \\frac{L.100}{L.107} : \\frac{10}{6}, \\text{to be insured outward, premium on } L.107 : \\frac{10}{6} \\text{ outwards, at 5 per cent. } L.5 : \\frac{7}{6} : \\frac{6}{3} : \\frac{100}{100} : \\frac{L.105}{L.105} : \\frac{7}{6} : \\frac{L.113}{L.113} : \\frac{6}{6}, \\text{to be insured home; the premium on which is } L.5 : \\frac{13}{6} : \\frac{6}{6}; \\text{and, if the ship be lost on the homeward voyage,} \\]\n\nFrom the sum insured home \\( L.113 \\) 6 0\nSubtract the discount, 2 per cent. 2 5 3\n\nSum for which the insurers are liable \\( L.111 \\) \u2014 9\n\nInsurance out \\( L.5 \\) 7 6\nInsurance home \\( 5 \\) 13 3\n\nCovered property \\( L.100 \\) \u2014 \u2014\n\nII. Insurance against Fire. There are several offices in Britain for this purpose, of which the Sun fire-office is the most considerable. Insurances are divided into common, hazardous, and doubly hazardous, according to the nature of the subject insured. When the sum insured is high, there is a higher premium per cent. demanded; and money, papers, jewels, pictures, and gunpowder, are not comprehended. If a subject be wrong described, in order that it may be insured at a lower premium, the policy is void. The benefit of a policy is transferred, by indorsement, to the representatives of the person in whose favour it was made; and it may be transferred to other houses when the insured changes his habitation. If insurance be made on the same subject in different offices, it must be specified, by indorsement, on the policy; and, in case of loss, the offices pay proportionally. The insurers pay all expenses in attempting to extinguish fire, or save goods, though not successful. If the value of a subject be insured in part, and damage be sustained, the insurers pay the whole, if it does not exceed the sum insured.\n\nIII. Insurance of Debts. See Bottomry.\n\nIV. In virtue of Insurance for Lives, when the person dies, a sum of money becomes payable to the person on whose behalf the policy of insurance was granted. One of the principal insurance-offices of this kind, is that of the Amicable Society for a perpetual insurance, kept in Sergeant's-inn, Fleet-street, London.\n\nThis society at Sergeant's-inn requires an annual payment of \u00a31 from every member during life, payable quarterly. The whole annual income hence arising is equally divided among the nominees, or heirs, of such members as die every year; and this renders the dividends among the nominees, in different years, more or less, according to the number of members who have happened to die in those years. But this society engages that the dividends shall not be less than \u00a3150l. to each claimant, though they may be more.\u2014None are admitted whose ages are greater than 45, or less than 12; nor is there any difference of contribution allowed on account of difference of age.\u2014This society has subsisted ever since 1706, and its credit and usefulness are well established. Its plan, however, is liable to several objections. First, it is evident, that regulating the dividends among the nominees, by the number of members who die every year, is not equitable; because it makes the benefit which a member is to receive to depend, not on the value of his contribution, but on a contingency; that is, the number of members that shall happen to die the same year with him. Secondly, its requiring the same payments from all persons under 45, is also not equitable; for the payment of a person admitted at 12 ought not to be more than half the payment of a person admitted at 45. Thirdly, its plan is so narrow, as to confine its usefulness too much. It can be of no service to any person whose age exceeds 45. It is likewise by no means properly adapted to the circumstances of persons who want to make assurances on their lives for only one year, or a short term of years. For example: the true value of the assurance of \u00a3150l. for five years, on the life of a person whose age is 39, may be found, by the first rule, to be nearly three guineas per annum, supposing interest at 3 per cent. and the probabilities of the duration of human life, as they are given in Dr Halley's Table of Observations. But such an assurance could not be made in this society without an annual payment of \u00a31. Neither is the plan of this society at all adapted to the circumstances of persons who want to make assurances on particular survivorships. For example: a person possessed of an estate or salary, which must be lost with his life, has a person dependent upon him, for whom he desires to secure a sum of money payable at his death. But he desires this only as a security against the danger of his dying first, and leaving a wife, or a parent, without support. In these circumstances he enters himself into this society; and, by an annual payment of \u00a31, entitles his nominee at his death to \u00a3150l. In a few years, perhaps, his nominee happens to die; and having then lost the advantages he had in view, he determines to forfeit his former payments, and to withdraw from the society. The right method, in this case, would have been to have taken from such a person the true value of the sum assured, \"on the supposition of non-payment, provided he should survive.\" In this way he would have chosen to contract with the society; and had he done this, he would have paid for the assurance (supposing interest at 3 per cent.) his age 30, the age of his nominee 30, and the values of lives as given by M. de Moivre) \u00a31. 8s. in annual payments, to begin immediately, and to be continued during the joint duration of his own life, and the life of his nominee.\n\nThe Equitable Society for Assurances on Lives and Survivorships, which meets at Blackfriars Bridge, is one of the most important of the kind. It was established in the year 1762, in consequence of proposals made, and lectures recommending the design, which had been read by Mr Dodson, author of the Mathematical Repository. It affords any sums or reverendary annuities, on any life or lives, for any number of years, as well as for the whole continuance of the lives;\nInsurance, in any manner that may be best adapted to the views of the persons assured. For instance, any persons who depend on incomes which must be lost when they die, or who are only tenants for life in estates, may, if they want to borrow money, be enabled to give sufficient security, by affixing such sums as they want to borrow, and affixing the policy. In the same way clergymen, and others who hold places of profit, having families whose subsistence depends on the continuance of their lives; such as enjoy annuities for the lives of others; any person entitled to an estate, legacy, &c., after another person, provided he survives; husbands may provide annuities for their wives, if they leave them widows; parents may, by affixing the lives of their children, when infants, till they attain a given age, secure for them, should they live till that age, sums necessary for apprenticeships, &c.; persons apprehensive of being left without support in old age, may here purchase annuities, if willing to wait for the commencement of the payment of these till they are 55 or 60 years of age.\n\nIn fine, there are no kinds of assurances on lives and survivorships, which this society does not make, following the rules given by the best mathematical writers on life annuities, particularly Mr Simson's. In order to gain such a profit as may render it a permanent benefit to the public, and enable it to bear the expenses of management, it takes the advantage of making its calculations at so low an interest as 3 per cent. and from tables of the probabilities and values of lives in London, where, as in all great towns, the rate of human mortality is much greater than it is in common among mankind.\n\nThis society, finding in the month of June 1777, that their affairs were in a flourishing condition, came to a resolution to reduce their annual premiums one-tenth; and they adopted new tables in the year 1782, founded on the probabilities of life at Northampton, instead of those which were framed from the London bills of mortality. It was afterwards thought proper to make an addition, for greater security, of 15 per cent. to the true value of the assurances, as calculated from the table of mortality at Northampton. To make a suitable recompense to the assured for the payments they had formerly made, which had been greater than the new rates required, an addition of 11. 10s. was made to their claims for every premium they had paid. The result of this measure was, that in 1785 the business of the society was nearly doubled, the sums assured amounting to 720,000l. In consequence of a minute investigation, the society took off the 15 per cent. charged on premiums in 1782, and added 11. per cent. more to the assured's claims, for every payment made before the 1st of January 1786. Business still increasing, they made another addition of 11. per cent. in 1791; and in the subsequent year a farther addition of 21. per cent. by which the claims of such as assured in 1770 came to be more than doubled, and those of a prior date were still higher. By such integrity and consequent increase of business, the sums assured amounted, on the 31st of December 1792, to the astonishing sum of three millions sterling; and exactly three years after, they amounted to about one million more.\n\nThe rates of assurance, as reduced to their real values in 1786, according to which all business is now transacted, are the following:\n\n| Age | One year | Seven years | Whole life |\n|-----|----------|-------------|------------|\n|     | \u00a3 s. d.  | \u00a3 s. d.      | \u00a3 s. d.    |\n| 15  | 17       | 11          | 21         |\n| 20  | 7        | 3           | 9          |\n| 25  | 10       | 7           | 12         |\n| 30  | 13       | 3           | 14         |\n| 35  | 16       | 4           | 18         |\n| 40  | 20       | 8           | 24         |\n| 45  | 26       | 8           | 30         |\n| 50  | 31       | 10          | 34         |\n| 55  | 36       | 12          | 38         |\n| 60  | 41       | 14          | 42         |\n| 65  | 46       | 16          | 46         |\n\nThe other offices in London for the assurances of lives are,\n\nThe Royal Exchange Assurance, which was empowered to assure lives by virtue of its second charter, bearing date the 29th of April 1721; the Westminster Society was established in 1792, for assuring lives and annuities; and the Pelican Life Office was instituted in 1797, which makes a new species of assurance, by way of endowment for daughters, when they have attained the age of 21 years.\n\nRe-Insurance is a second contract, made by any insurer, to transfer the risk he has engaged for to another.

It may not be amiss here to inquire upon what grounds this matter does really stand.\n\nThe enemies to interest in general make no distinction between that and usury, holding any increase of money to be indefensibly usurious. And this they ground as well on the prohibition of it by the law of Moses among the Jews, as also upon what is laid down by Aristotle, That money is naturally barren; and to make it breed money is preposterous, and a perversion of the end of its institution, which was only to serve the purposes of exchange, and not of increase. Hence the school-divines have branded the practice of taking interest, as being contrary to the divine law both natural and revealed; and the canon law has prohibited\nthe taking any the least increase for the loan of money as a mortal sin.\n\nBut, in answer to this, it may be observed, that the Mosaic precept was clearly a political, and not a moral, precept. It only prohibited the Jews from taking usury from their brethren the Jews; but in express words permitted them to take it of a stranger: which proves that the taking of moderate usury, or a reward for the use, for so the word signifies, is not malum in se, since it was allowed where any but an Israelite was concerned. And as to Aristotle's reason, deduced from the natural barrenness of money, the same may with equal force be alleged of houles, which never breed houles; and twenty other things, which nobody doubts it is lawful to make profit of, by letting them to hire. And though money was originally used only for the purposes of exchange, yet the laws of any state may be well justified in permitting it to be turned to the purposes of profit, if the convenience of society (the great end for which money was invented) shall require it. And that the allowance of moderate interest tends greatly to the benefit of the public, especially in a trading country, will appear from that generally acknowledged principle, that commerce cannot subsist without mutual and extensive credit. Unless money therefore can be borrowed, trade cannot be carried on; and if no premium were allowed for the hire of money, few persons would care to lend it; or at least the rate of borrowing at a short warning (which is the life of commerce) would be entirely at an end. Thus, in the dark ages of monkish superstition and civil tyranny, when interest was laid under a total interdict, commerce was also at its lowest ebb, and fell entirely into the hands of the Jews and Lombards: but when men's minds began to be more enlarged, when true religion and real liberty revived, commerce grew again into credit; and again introduced with itself its inseparable companion, the doctrine of loans upon interest.\n\nAnd, really, considered abstractedly from this its use, since all other conveniences of life may be either bought or hired, but money can only be hired, there seems no greater impropriety in taking a recompense or price for the hire of this, than of any other convenience. If one borrow tools to employ in a beneficial trade, it is but equitable that the lender should have a proportion of the gains. To demand an exorbitant price is equally contrary to conscience, for the loan of a horse, or the loan of a sum of money: but a reasonable equivalent for the temporary inconvenience which the owner may feel by the want of it, and for the hazard of his losing it entirely, is not more immoral in one case than it is in the other. And indeed the absolute prohibition of lending upon any, even moderate interest, introduces the very inconvenience which it seems meant to remedy. The necessity of individuals will make borrowing unavoidable. Without some profit by law, there will be but few lenders; and those principally bad men, who will break through the law, and take a profit; and then will endeavour to indemnify themselves from the danger of the penalty, by making that profit exorbitant. Thus, while all degrees of profit were discomfited, we find more complaints of usury, and more flagrant instances of oppression, than in modern times when money may be easily had at a low interest. A capital distinction must therefore be made between a moderate and exorbitant profit; to the former of which we usually give the name of interest, to the latter the truly odious appellation of usury: the former is necessary in every civil state; if it were but to exclude the latter, which ought never to be tolerated in any well regulated society.\u2014For, as the whole of this matter is well summed up by Grotius, \"if the compensation allowed by law does not exceed the proportion of the hazard run, or the want felt, by the loan, its allowance is neither repugnant to the revealed nor to the natural law: but if it exceeds those bounds, it is then oppressive usury; and though the municipal laws may give it impunity, they never can make it just.\"\n\nWe see, that the exorbitance or moderation of interest, for the money lent, depends upon two circumstances; the inconvenience of parting with it for the present, and the hazard of losing it entirely. The inconvenience to individual lenders can never be estimated by laws; the rate therefore of general interest must depend upon the usual of general inconvenience. This results entirely from the quantity of specie or current money in the kingdom: for, the more specie there is circulating in any nation, the greater superfluity there will be, beyond what is necessary to carry on the business of exchange and the common concerns of life. In every nation, or public community, there is a certain quantity of money thus necessary; which a person well skilled in political arithmetic might perhaps calculate as exactly as a private banker can the demand for running cash in his own shop: all above this necessary quantity may be spared, or lent, without much inconvenience to the respective leaders; and the greater this national superfluity is, the more numerous will be the lenders, and the lower ought the rate of the national interest to be; but where there is not enough, or barely enough, circulating cash to answer the ordinary uses of the public, interest will be proportionably high; for lenders will be but few, as few can submit to the inconvenience of lending.\n\nSo also the hazard of an entire loss has its weight in the regulation of interest: hence, the better the security, the lower will the interest be; the rate of interest being generally in a compound ratio, formed out of the inconvenience and the hazard. And as, if there were no inconvenience, there should be no interest but what is equivalent to the hazard; so, if there were no hazard, there ought to be no interest, save only what arises from the mere inconvenience of lending. Thus, if the quantity of specie in a nation be such, that the general inconvenience of lending for a year is computed to amount to three per cent, a man that has money by him will perhaps lend it upon good personal security at five per cent, allowing two for the hazard run; he will lend it upon landed security, or mortgage, at four per cent, the hazard being proportionably less; but he will lend it to the state, on the maintenance of which all his property depends, at three per cent, the hazard being none at all.\n\nBut sometimes the hazard may be greater than the rate of interest allowed by law will compensate. And this gives rise to the practice, 1. Of bottomry, or respondentia. 2. Of policies of insurance. See BOTTOMRY, and INSURANCE.\nUpon the two principles of inconvenience and hazard, compared together, different nations have at different times established different rates of interest. The Romans at one time allowed centumlinea, one per cent. monthly, or twelve per cent. per annum, to be taken for common loans; but Justinian reduced it to trientes, or one-third of the as or centumlinea, that is four per cent.; but allowed higher interest to be taken of merchants, because there the hazard was greater. So too Grotius informs us, that in Holland the rate of interest was then eight per cent. in common loans, but twelve to merchants. Our law establishes one standard for all alike, where the pledge or security itself is not put in jeopardy; left, under the general pretence of vague and indeterminate hazards, a door should be opened to fraud and usury; leaving specific hazards to be provided against by specific insurances, or by loans upon respondebuntia or bottomry. But as to the rate of legal interest, it has varied and decreased for 200 years past, according as the quantity of specie in the kingdom has increased by accretions of trade, the introduction of paper-credit, and other circumstances. The statute 37 Hen. VIII. c. 9., confirmed interest to ten per cent. and so did the statute 13 Eliz. c. 8. But as, through the encouragements given in her reign to commerce, the nation grew more wealthy; so, under her successor, the statute 21 Jac. I. c. 17., reduced it to eight per cent.; as did the statute 12 Car. II. c. 13., to six; and lastly, by the statute 12 Ann. stat. 2. c. 16., it was brought down to five per cent. yearly, which is now the extremity of legal interest that can be taken. But yet, if a contract which carries interest be made in a foreign country, our courts will direct the payment of interest according to the law of that country in which the contract was made. Thus Irish, American, Turkish, and Indian interest, have been allowed in our courts to the amount of even 12 per cent. For the moderation or exorbitance of interest depends upon local circumstances; and the refusal to enforce such contracts would put a stop to all foreign trade. And, by stat. 14 Geo. III. c. 79., all mortgages and other securities upon estates or other property in Ireland or the plantations, bearing interest not exceeding five per cent. shall be legal; though executed in the kingdom of Great Britain: unless the money lent shall be known at the time to exceed the value of the thing in pledge; in which case also, to prevent usurious contracts at home under colour of such foreign securities, the borrower shall forfeit treble the sum so borrowed.\n\nFor the method of computing interest, see Arithmetic, sect. iv. p. 645; and Algebra, sect. xx. p. 658.","sp":315,"ep":317},{"h":"INTERIM","t":"a name given to a formulary, or kind of confession of the articles of faith, obtruded upon the Protestants after Luther's death by the emperor Charles V. when he had defeated their forces; so called because it was only to take place in the interim (mean time) till a general council should have decided all points in dispute between the Protestants and Romanists.

Plato, in his Republic, does not forget, amongst other parts of justice, that which concerns the dead. Cicero establishes three kinds of justice; the first respects the gods, the second the manes or dead, and the third men. These principles seem to be drawn from nature; and they appear at least to be necessary for the support of society, since\nat all times civilized nations have taken care to bury their dead, and to pay their last respects to them. See BURIAL.\n\nWe find in history several traces of the respect which the Indians, the Egyptians, and the Syrians entertained for the dead. The Syrians embalmed their bodies with myrrh, aloes, honey, salt, wax, bitumen, and resinous gums; they dried them also with the smoke of the fir and the pine tree. The Egyptians preserved theirs with the resin of the cedar, with aromatic spices, and with salt. These people often kept such mummies, or at least their effigies, in their houses; and at grand entertainments they were introduced, that by reciting the great actions of their ancestors they might be better excited to virtue. See FUNERAL RITES.\n\nThe Greeks, at first, had probably not the same veneration for the dead as the Egyptians. Empedocles, therefore, in the eighty-fourth Olympiad, restored to life Pontia, a woman of Argirgentum, who was about to be interred. But this people, in proportion as they grew civilized, becoming more enlightened, perceived the necessity of establishing laws for the protection of the dead.\n\nAt Athens the law required that no person should be interred before the third day; and in the greater part of the cities of Greece a funeral did not take place till the fifth or seventh. When a man appeared to have breathed his last, his body was generally washed by his nearest relations, with warm water mixed with wine. They afterwards anointed it with oil; and covered it with a dress commonly made of fine linen, according to the custom of the Egyptians. This dress was white at Messina, Athens, and in the greater part of the cities of Greece, where the dead body was crowned with flowers. At Sparta it was of a purple colour, and the body was surrounded with olive leaves. The body was afterwards laid upon a couch in the entry of the house, where it remained till the time of the funeral. At the magnificent obsequies with which Alexander honoured Hephaestion, the body was not burned until the tenth day.\n\nThe Romans, in the infancy of their empire, paid as little attention to their dead as the Greeks had done. Acilius Aviola having fallen into a lethargic fit, was supposed to be dead; he was therefore carried to the funeral pile; the fire was lighted up; and though he cried out he was still alive, he perished for want of speedy assistance. The praetor Lamia met with the same fate. Tubero, who had been praetor, was saved from the funeral pile. Aesclepiades a physician, who lived in the time of Pompey the Great, about one hundred and twenty years before the Christian era, returning from his country-house, observed near the walls of Rome a grand convoy and a crowd of people, who were in mourning afflicting at a funeral, and showing every exterior sign of the deepest grief. Having asked what was the occasion of this concourse, no one made any reply. He therefore approached the pretended dead body; and imagining that he perceived signs of life in it, he ordered the bystanders to take away the flambeaux, to extinguish the fire, and to pull down the funeral pile. A kind of murmur on this arose throughout the whole company. Some said that they ought to believe the physician, while others turned both him and his profession into ridicule. The relations, however, yielded at length to the remonstrances of Aesclepiades; they consented to defer the obsequies for a little; and the consequence was, the restoration of the pretended dead person to life. It appears that these examples, and several others of the like nature, induced the Romans to delay funerals longer, and to enact laws to prevent precipitate interments.\n\nAt Rome, after allowing a sufficient time for mourning, the nearest relation generally closed the eyes of the deceased; and the body was bathed with warm water, either to render it fitter for being anointed with oil, or to reanimate the principle of life, which might remain suspended without manifesting itself. Proofs were afterwards made, to discover whether the person was really dead, which were often repeated during the time that the body remained exposed; for there were persons appointed to visit the dead, and to prove their situation. On the second day, after the body had been washed a second time, it was anointed with oil and balm. Luxury increased to such a pitch in the choice of foreign perfumes for this purpose, that under the consulship of Licinius Cratius and Julius Caesar, the senate forbade any perfumes to be used except such as were the production of Italy. On the third day the body was clothed according to its dignity and condition. The robe called the praetexta was put upon magistrates, and a purple robe upon consuls; for conquerors, who had merited triumphal honours, this robe was of gold tissue. For other Romans it was white, and black for the lower classes of the people. These dresses were often prepared at a distance, by the mothers and wives of persons still in life. On the fourth day the body was placed on a couch, and exposed in the vestibule of the house, with the visage turned towards the entrance, and the feet near the door; in this situation it remained till the end of the week. Near the couch were lighted wax-tapers, a small box in which perfumes were burnt, and a vessel full of water for purification, with which those who approached the body befriended themselves. An old man, belonging to those who furnished everything necessary for funerals, sat near the deceased, with some domestics clothed in black. On the eighth day the funeral rites were performed; but to prevent the body from corrupting before that time, salt, wax, the resinous gum of the cedar, myrrh, honey, balm, gypsum, lime, asphaltites or bitumen of Judea, and several other substances, were employed. The body was carried to the pile with the face uncovered, unless wounds or the nature of the disease had rendered it loathsome and disgusting. In such a case a mask was used, made of a kind of plaster; which has given rise to the expression of funera larvata, used in some of the ancient authors. This was the last method of concealment which Nero made use of, after having caused Germanicus to be poisoned; for the effect of the poison had become very sensible by livid spots and the blackness of the body; but a shower of rain happening to fall, it washed the plaster entirely away, and thus the horrid crime of fratricide was discovered.\n\nThe Turks have, at all times, been accustomed to wash the bodies of their dead before interment; and as their ablutions are complete, and no part of the body escapes the attention of those who assist at such melancholy ceremonies, they can easily perceive whether\nInterment one be really dead or alive, by examining, among other methods of proof, whether the sphincter ani has lost its power of contraction. If this muscle remains still contracted, they warm the body, and endeavour to recall it to life; otherwise, after having washed it with water and soap, they wipe it with linen cloths, wash it again with rose-water and aromatic substances, cover it with a rich dress, put upon its head a cap ornamented with flowers, and extend it upon a carpet placed in the vestibule or hall at the entrance of the house.\n\nIn the primitive church the dead were washed and then anointed; the body was wrapped up in linen, or clothed in a dress of more or less value according to circumstances, and it was not interred until after being exposed and kept some days in the house. The custom of clothing the dead is preserved in France only for princes and ecclesiastics.\n\nIn other countries, more or less care is taken to prevent sudden interments. At Geneva, there are people appointed to inspect all dead bodies. Their duty consists in examining whether the person be really dead, and whether one died naturally or by violence. In the north, as well as at Genoa, it is usual not to bury the dead till three days have expired. In Holland, people carry their precautions much farther, and delay the funeral's longer. And in England bodies generally remain unburied three or four days.\n\nPremature Interment. Notwithstanding the customs above recited; still, in many places, and on many occasions in all places, too much precipitation attends this last office; or if not precipitation, a neglect of due precautions in regard to the body. In general, indeed, the most improper treatment that can be imagined is adopted, and many a person made to descend into the grave before he has sighed his last breath. The histories related by Hildanus, by Camerarius, by Horilius, by Macrobius in his Somnium Scipionis, by Plato in his Republic, by Valerius Maximus, and by a great many modern authors, leave us no doubt respecting the dangers and misconduct of such precipitation. It must appear astonishing that the attention of mankind has been after all so little raised by an idea the most terrible that can be conceived on this side of eternity. If nature recoils from the idea of death, with what horror must she start at the thought of death anticipated, precipitated by inattention\u2014a return of life in darkness, dilution, and despair\u2014then death repeated under agonies unspeakable! To revive nailed up in a coffin! The brain can scarce sustain the reflection in our coolest safest moments.\n\nAccording to present usage, as soon as the semblance of death appears, the chamber of the sick is deserted by friends, relatives, and physicians; and the apparently dead, though frequently living, body, is committed to the management of an ignorant and unfeeling nurse, whose care extends no farther than laying the limbs straight, and securing her accustomed perquisites. The bed-clothes are immediately removed, and the body is exposed to the air. This, when cold, must extinguish any spark of life that may remain, and which, by a different treatment, might have been kindled into flame; or it may only continue to refresh it, and the unhappy person afterwards revive amidst the horrors of the tomb.\n\nThe difference between the end of a weak life and interment; the commencement of death, is so final, and the uncertainty of the signs of the latter is so well established both by ancient and modern authors who have turned their attention to that important object, that we can scarcely suppose undertakers capable of distinguishing an apparent from a real death. Animals which sleep during winter show no signs of life; in this case, circulation is only suspended: but were it annihilated, the vital spirit does not so easily lose its action as the other fluids of the body; and the principle of life, which long survives the appearance of death, may re-animate a body in which the action of all the organs seems to be at an end. But how difficult is it to determine whether this principle may not be revived? It has been found impossible to recall to life some animals suffocated by mephitic vapours, though they appeared less affected than others who have revived. Coldness, heaviness of the body, a leaden livid colour, with a yellowness in the visage, are all very uncertain signs: Mr Zimmerman observed them all upon the body of a criminal, who fainted through the dread of that punishment which he had merited. He was shaken, dragged about, and turned in the same manner as dead bodies are, without the least signs of respiration; and yet at the end of 24 hours he was recalled to life by means of volatile alkali.\n\nA director of the coach-office at Dijon, named Colinet, was supposed to be dead, and the news of this event was spread through the whole city. One of his friends, who was desirous of seeing him at the moment when he was about to be buried, having looked at him for a considerable time, thought he perceived some remains of sensibility in the muscles of the face. He therefore made an attempt to bring him to life by spirituous liquors, in which he succeeded; and this director enjoyed afterwards for a long time that life which he owed to his friend. This remarkable circumstance was much like those of Empedocles and Asclepiades. These instances would perhaps be more frequent, were men of skill and abilities called in cases of sudden death, in which people of ordinary knowledge are often deceived by false appearances.\n\nA man may fall into a syncope, and may remain in that condition three or even eight days. People in this situation have been known to come to life when deposited among the dead. A body belonging to the hospital at Caen appeared to have breathed its last; he was carried into the hall where the dead were exposed, and was wrapped up in a piece of canvas. Some time after, recovering from his lethargy, he recollected the place in which he had been deposited, and crawling towards the door knocked against it with his foot. This noise was luckily heard by the sentinel, who soon perceiving the motion of the canvas called for assistance. The youth was immediately conveyed to a warm bed, and soon perfectly recovered. Had his body been confined by close bandages or ligatures, he would not have been able, in all probability, to make himself be heard: his unavailing efforts would have made him again fall into a syncope, and he would have been thus buried alive.\n\nWe must not be astonished that the servants of an hospital should take a syncope for a real death, since, even the most enlightened people have fallen into errors of\nDr John Schmid relates, that a young girl, seven years of age, after being afflicted for some weeks with a violent cough, was all of a sudden freed from this troublesome malady, and appeared to be in perfect health. But some days after, while playing with her companions, this child fell down in an instant as if struck by lightning. A death-like pallor was diffused over her face and arms; she had no apparent pulse, her temples were sunk, and she showed no signs of sensation when shaken or pinched. A physician, who was called, and who believed her to be dead, in compliance with the repeated and pressing request of her parents, attempted, though without any hopes, to recall her to life; and at length, after several vain efforts, he made the soles of her feet be firmly rubbed with a brush dipped in strong pickle. At the end of three quarters of an hour she was observed to sigh; she was then made to swallow some spirituous liquor; and she was soon after restored to life, much to the joy of her disconsolate parents.\u2014A certain man having undertaken a journey, in order to see his brother, on his arrival at his house found him dead. This news affected him so much, that it brought on a most dreadful syncope, and he himself was supposed to be in the like situation. After the usual means had been employed to recall him to life, it was agreed that his body should be dissected, to discover the cause of so sudden a death; but the supposed dead person overhearing this proposal, opened his eyes, started up, and immediately betook himself to his heels.\u2014Cardinal Espanola, prime minister to Philip II., was not so fortunate; for we read in the Memoirs of Amelot de la Houllai, that he put his hand to the knife with which he was opened in order to be embalmed. In short, almost every one knows that Vesalius, the father of anatomy, having been sent for to open a woman subject to hysterics, who was supposed to be dead, he perceived, on making the first incision, by her motion and cries, that she was still alive; that this circumstance rendered him so odious, that he was obliged to fly; and that he was so much affected by it, that he died soon after.\u2014On this occasion, we cannot forbear to add an event more recent, but no less melancholy. The abbe Prevost, so well known by his writings and the singularities of his life, was seized with a fit of the apoplexy, in the forest of Chantilly, on the 23d of October 1763. His body was carried to the nearest village, and the officers of justice were proceeding to open it, when a cry which he sent forth affrightened all the assistants, and convinced the surgeon that the abbe was not dead; but it was too late to save him, as he had already received the mortal wound.\n\nEven in old age, when life seems to have been gradually drawing to a close, the appearances of death are often fallacious. A lady in Cornwall, more than 80 years of age, who had been a considerable time declining, took to her bed, and in a few days seemingly expired in the morning. As she had often desired not to be buried till she had been two days dead, her request was to have been regularly complied with by her relations. All that saw her looked upon her as dead, and the report was current through the whole place; nay, a gentleman of the town actually wrote to his friend in the island of Scilly that she was decease. But one of those who were paying the last kind office of humanity to her remains, perceived some warmth about the Interm. middle of the back; and acquainting her friends with it, they applied a mirror to her mouth; but, after repeated trials, could not observe it in the least alarmed; her under jaw was likewise fallen, as the common phrase is; and, in short, she had every appearance of a dead person. All this time she had not been stripped or dried; but the windows were opened, as is usual in the chambers of the deceased. In the evening the heat seemed to increase, and at length she was perceived to breathe.\n\nIn short, not only the ordinary signs are very uncertain, but we may say the same of the stiffness of the limbs, which may be convulsive; of the dilation of the pupil of the eye, which may proceed from the same cause; of putrefaction, which may equally attack some parts of a living body; and of several others. Haller, convinced of the uncertainty of all these signs, proposes a new one, which he considers as infallible. \"If the person (says he) be still in life, the mouth will immediately shut of itself, because the contraction of the muscles of the jaw will awaken their irritability.\" The jaw, however, may be deprived of its irritability though a man may not be dead. Life is preserved a long time in the passage of the intestines. The sign pointed out by Dr Fothergill appears to deserve more attention: \"If the air blown into the mouth (says this physician) passes freely through all the alimentary channel, it affords a strong presumption that the irritability of the internal sphincters is destroyed, and consequently that life is at an end.\" These signs, which deserve to be confirmed by new experiments, are doubtless not known to undertakers.\n\nThe difficulty of distinguishing a person apparently dead from one who is really so, has, in all countries where bodies have been interred too precipitately, rendered it necessary for the law to assist humanity. Of several regulations made on this subject, we shall quote only a few of the most recent; such as those of Arras in 1772; of Mantua in 1774; of the grand duke of Tuscany in 1775; of the fenechauffee of Sivrai, in Poitou, in 1777; and of the parliament of Metz in the same year. To give an idea of the rest, it will be sufficient to relate only that of Tuscany. By this edict, the grand duke forbids the precipitate interment of persons who die suddenly. He orders the magistrates of health to be informed, that physicians and surgeons may examine the body; that they may use every endeavour to recall it to life, if possible, or to discover the cause of its death; and that they shall make a report of their procedure to a certain tribunal. On this occasion, the magistrate of health orders the dead not to be covered until the moment they are about to be buried, except so far as decency requires; observing always that the body be not closely confined, and that nothing may compress the jugular veins and the carotid arteries. He forbids people to be interred according to the ancient method; and requires that the arms and the hands should be left extended, and that they should not be folded or placed cross-wise upon the breast. He forbids, above all, to press the jaws one against the other; or to fill the mouth and nostrils with cotton, or other stuffing. Lastly, he recommends not to cover the visage with any kind of cloth until the body is deposited in its coffin.\nWe shall conclude this article by adjoining, from Dr Hawes's Address to the Public on this subject, a few of the cases in which this fallacious appearance of death is most likely to happen, together with the respective modes of treatment which he recommends.\n\nIn apoplectic and fainting fits, and in those arising from any violent agitation of mind, and also when opium or spirituous liquors have been taken in too great a quantity, there is reason to believe that the appearance of death has been frequently mistaken for the reality. In these cases, the means recommended by the Humane Society for the Recovery of Drowned Persons should be persevered in for several hours; and bleeding, which in similar circumstances has sometimes proved pernicious, should be used with great caution. (See the article DROWNING.) In the two latter instances it will be highly expedient, with a view of counteracting the soporific effects of opium and spirits, to convey into the stomach, by a proper tube, a solution of tartar emetic, and by various other means to excite vomiting.\n\nFrom the number of children carried off by convulsions, and the certainty arising from undoubted facts, that some who have in appearance died from that cause have been recovered; there is the greatest reason for concluding, that many, in consequence of this disease, have been prematurely numbered among the dead; and that the fond parent, by neglecting the means of recalling life, has often been the guiltless executioner of her own offspring. To prevent the commission of such dreadful mistakes, no child, whose life has been apparently extinguished by convulsions, should be confined to the grave till the means of recovery above recommended in apoplexies, &c., have been tried; and, if possible, under the direction of some skilful practitioner of medicine, who may vary them as circumstances shall require.\n\nWhen fevers arise in weak habits, or when the cure of them has been principally attempted by means of depletion, the consequent debility is often very great, and the patient sometimes sinks into a state which bears so close an affinity to that of death, that there is reason to suspect it has too often deceived the bystanders, and induced them to send for the undertaker when they should have had recourse to the succours of medicine. In such cases, volatiles, eau de luce for example, should be applied to the nose, rubbed on the temples, and sprinkled often about the bed; hot flannels, moistened with a strong solution of camphorated spirit, may likewise be applied over the breast, and renewed every quarter of an hour; and as soon as the patient is able to swallow, a teaspoonful of the strongest cordial should be given every five minutes.\n\nThe same methods may also be used with propriety in the smallpox when the pustules sink, and death apparently ensues; and likewise in any other acute diseases, when the vital functions are suspended from a similar case.","sp":317,"ep":321},{"h":"INTERMITTENT","t":"or INTERMITTING, Fever; such fevers as go off and soon return again, in opposition to those which are continual.

The Romanists contend, that it belongs absolutely to the church: adding, that where the is silent, reason may be consulted; but where it speaks, reason is to be disregarded. The Protestants generally allow reason the sovereign judge, or interpreter; though some among them have a strong regard to synods, and others to the authority of the primitive fathers.

To the interrex was delegated all the regal and consular authority, and he performed all their functions. He assembled the senate, held comitia or courts, and took care that the election of magistrates was according to rules. Indeed at first it was not the custom of the interrex to hold comitia, at least we have no instance of it in the Roman history.

The distance between any given sound and another, strictly speaking, is neither measured by any common standard of extension nor duration; but either by immediate sensation, or by computing the difference between the numbers of vibrations produced by two or more sonorous bodies, in the act of sounding, during the same given time. As the vibrations are slower and fewer during the same instant, for example, the sound is proportionally lower or graver; on the contrary, as during the same period the vibrations increase in number and velocity, the sounds are proportionably higher or more acute. An interval in music, therefore, is properly the difference between the number of vibrations produced by one sonorous body of a certain magnitude and texture, and of those produced by another of a different magnitude and texture in the same time.\n\nIntervals are divided into consonant and dissonant. A consonant interval is that whose extremes, or whose highest and lowest sounds, when simultaneously heard, coalesce in the ear, and produce an agreeable sensation called by Lord Kames a tertium quid. A dissonant interval, on the contrary, is that whose extremes, simultaneously heard, far from coalescing in the ear, and producing one agreeable sensation, are each of them plainly distinguished from the other, produce a grating effect upon the senses, and repel each other with an irreconcilable hostility. In proportion as the vibrations of different sonorous bodies, or of the same sonorous body in different modes, more or less frequently coincide during the same given time, the chords are more or less consonant. When these vibrations never coincide at all in the same given time, the discord is consummate, and consequently the interval absolutely dissonant.

It may also be deduced from the word diatonic, as in that scale it is most frequently conversant; a scale which appears most convenient and most natural to the voice.

The first and principal is that of the hero of the piece; the second contains the designs of all those who oppose him. These opposite causes produce opposite effects, to wit, the efforts of the hero for the execution of his design, and the efforts of those who thwart it. As these causes and designs are the beginning of the action, so these efforts are the middle, and there form a knot or difficulty which we call the intrigue, that makes the greatest part of the poem. It lasts as long as the mind of the reader or hearer is suspended about the event of those opposite efforts: the solution or catastrophe commences when the knot begins to unravel, and the difficulties and doubts begin to clear up.\n\nThe intrigue of the Iliad is twofold. The first comprehends three days fighting in Achilles' absence, and consists on the one side in the resistance of Agamemnon and the Greeks, and on the other in the inexorable temper of Achilles. The death of Patroclus unravels this intrigue, and makes the beginning of a second. Achilles resolves to be revenged, but Hector opposes his design; and this forms the second intrigue, which is the last day's battle.\n\nIn the \u00c6neid there are also two intrigues. The first is taken up in the voyage and landing of \u00c6neas in Italy; the second is his establishment there: the opposition he met with from Juno in both these undertakings forms the intrigue.\n\nAs to the choice of the intrigue, and the manner of unravelling it, it is certain they ought both to spring naturally from the ground and subject of the poem. Bo\u00ebthius gives us three manners of forming the intrigue of a poem: the first is that already mentioned; the second is taken from the fable and design of the poet; in the third the intrigue is so laid, as that the solution follows from it of course.","sp":322,"ep":323},{"h":"INTRINSIC","t":"a term applied to the real and genuine values and properties, &c., of any thing, in opposition to their extrinsic or apparent values.","sp":323,"ep":323},{"h":"INTRODUCTION","t":"in general, signifies any thing which tends to make another in some measure known before we have leisure to examine it thoroughly; and hence it is used on a great variety of occasions.

He extended its liberties considerably, and in the time of David I. it became a royal residence. The Moubrays had large possessions here, which were forfeited in the reign of Robert II. The Franciscans had a convent in this town; and, according to Sir Robert Sibbald, the Dominicans had another. This town has a considerable trade in coal and other articles.","sp":324,"ep":324},{"h":"INVERLOCHY","t":"an ancient castle in the neighbourhood of Fort-William in Inverness-shire. It is adorned with large round towers; and, by the mode of building, seems to have been the work of the English in the time of Edward I. who laid large fines on the Scotch barons for the purpose of erecting new castles. The largest of these towers is called Cumins's. But long prior to these ruins, Inverlochy, according to Boece, had been a place of great note, a most opulent city, remarkable for the vast resort of French and Spaniards, probably on account of trade. It was also a seat of the kings of Scotland, for here Atholus in the year 790 signed (as is reported) the league offensive and defensive between himself and Charlemagne. In after-times it was utterly destroyed by the Danes, and never again restored.\n\nIn the neighbourhood of this place were fought two fierce battles, one between Donald Balloch brother to Alexander lord of the illes, who with a great power invaded Lochaber in the year 1427: he was met by the earls of Mar and Caithness; the last was slain, and their forces totally defeated. Balloch returned to the illes with vast booty. Here also the Campbells under the marquis of Argyll, were in February 1645, defeated by Montrose. Fifteen hundred fell in the action and in the pursuit, with the loss only of three to the royalists.","sp":324,"ep":324},{"h":"INVERNESS","t":"capital of a county of the same name in Scotland, is a parliament-town, finely seated on the river Nevis, over which there is a stone bridge of seven arches, in W. Long. 4\u00b0. N. Lat. 57\u00b0 36'. It is large, well built, and very populous, being the most northerly town of any note in Britain. As there are always regular troops in its neighbourhood, there is a great air of politeness, a plentiful market, and more money and business stirring than could have been expected in such a remote part of the island. The country in the neighbourhood is remarkably well cultivated; and its produce clearly shows that the soil and climate are not defective. The salmon-fishery in the Nevis is very considerable, and is let to London fishmongers. Some branches both of the woollen, linen, and hemp manufacture, are also carried on here; and, in consequence of the excellent military roads, there is a great proportion of inland trade. But besides all this, Inverness is a port with 20 creeks dependent upon it, part on the Murray frith to the east, and part on the north of the town, reaching even the fourth border of the county of Caithness. Inverness has several good schools; and an academy was erected some years ago on an extensive and liberal plan. The inhabitants speak the Erse and English language promiscuously. On an eminence near the town are the remains of a castle, where, according to some historians, the famous Macbeth murdered Duncan his royal guest.\n\nInverness-Shire,\nInverness-Shire, a county of Scotland, bounded on the north by Ross-shire; on the east by the shires of Nairne, Murray, and Aberdeen; on the south, by those of Perth and Argyle; and on the west, by the Atlantic ocean. Its extent from north to south is above 50 miles; from east to west about 80.\u2014The northern part of this county is very mountainous and barren. In the district of Glenelg are seen the ruins of several ancient circular buildings, similar to those in the Western Isles, Sutherland, and Ross-shires; concerning the uses of which antiquarians are not agreed. In their outward appearance, they are round and tapering like glass-houses. In the heart of the wall, which is perpendicular within, there are horizontal galleries going quite round and connected by stairs. These ascend toward the top, which is open. They are all built of stone, without lime or mortar of any kind. They have no opening outward, except the doors and the top; but there are several in the inside, as windows to the galleries. From Bernera barracks, in this district, proceeds the military road to Inverness.\n\nThis county is nearly divided by water, so that by means of the Caledonian canal uniting Loch Ness, Loch Oich, Loch Lochy, and Lochiel or Loch Eil, a communication will be opened between the eastern and western seas. This great undertaking is now (1807) going forward. In this tract, Fort George, Fort Augustus, and Fort William, form what is called the Chain of Forts across the island. By means of Fort George on the east, all entrance up the strait towards Inverness is prevented; Fort Augustus curbs the inhabitants midway; and Fort William is a check to any attempts in the west. Detachments are made from all these garrisons to Inverness, Bernera barracks opposite to the Isle of Skye, and Castle Duart in the Isle of Mull.\n\nThe river Ness, upon which the capital of the shire is situated, is the outlet of the great lake called Loch Ness. This beautiful lake is 22 miles in length, and for the most part one in breadth. It is screened on the north-west by the lofty mountains of Urquhart and Meall-fourvonny, and bordered with coppices of birch and oak. The adjacent hills are adorned with many extensive forests of pine; which afford shelter to the cattle, and are the retreat of flags and deer. There is much cultivation and improvements on the banks of Loch Ness; and the pasture-grounds in the neighbouring valleys are excellent.\u2014From the south, the river Fyers descends towards this lake. Over this river there is built a stupendous bridge, on two opposite rocks; the top of the arch is above 100 feet from the level of the water. A little below the bridge is the celebrated Fall of Fyers, where a great body of water darts through a narrow gap between two rocks, then falls over a vast precipice into the bottom of the chasm, where the foam rises and fills the air like a great cloud of smoke.\n\nLoch Oich is a narrow lake, stretching about four miles from east to west. It is adorned with some small wooded islands, and is surrounded with ancient trees. Near this is the family seat of Glenary, surrounded by natural woods of full grown fir, which extend nine or ten miles along the banks of the river Gary. The waters of Loch Oich flow through Loch Ness into the eastern sea.\u2014Loch Lochy transmits its waters in an opposite direction, this being the highest part of the vast flat tract that here stretches from sea to sea. This extensive lake is above ten miles in length, and from one to two in breadth. From the west, the waters of Loch Arrok descend into this lake. Out of it runs the river Lochy, which about a mile below its issue from the lake receives the Spean, a considerable river, over which there is a magnificent bridge, built by General Wade, about two miles above the place where it falls into the Lochy. These united streams traversing the plains of Lochaber, after a course of five or six miles, fall into Loch Eil.\n\nA few miles to the south-east of Loch Lochy is Glenroy or King's Vale. The north-east end of this valley opens on Loch Spey. A small river palisades along the bottom of the vale, accompanied by a modern road. On the declivity of the mountains, about a mile from the river, on either hand, are seen several parallel roads of great antiquity. On the north-west side, five of these roads run parallel and close by each other. On the opposite side are three other roads exactly similar. These roads are 30 feet broad, all perfectly horizontal, and extend eight or nine miles in length. Their delineation or use has baffled the conjectures of antiquaries.\u2014Not far from Fort Augustus soars the pointed summit of Ben Nevis, which is esteemed the highest mountain in Britain, rising more than 4300 feet above the level of the sea.\u2014In the districts of Moydart, Arisaig, Morer, and Knoydart, there are numerous bays and creeks, along the coast, many of which might be excellent fishing stations.\n\nThe southern part of this county is very mountainous, and is supposed to be the most elevated ground in Scotland. From its numerous lakes many streams descend toward both seas. In the extensive district called Badenoch lies Loch Spey, the source of the great river Spey, which proceeding eastward with an increasing stream, enters the shire of Murray at Rothesmurchus, after having expanded into a fine lake. Not far from this is seen the lofty top of Cairngorm; a mountain celebrated for its beautiful rock-crystals of various tints. These are much esteemed by lapidaries; and some of them, having the lustre of fine gems, bring a very high price. Limestone, iron-ore, and some traces of different minerals, are found in the county, but no mines have yet been worked with much success. Its rivers and lakes afford abundance of salmon and trout. The extensive plains which surround the lakes are in general fertile; and the high grounds feed many sheep and black cattle, the rearing and selling of which forms the chief trade of the inhabitants.\u2014By the present spirited exertions of the gentlemen in this populous county, the commerce and the industry of the inhabitants have of late been greatly increased; and to facilitate the communication with other parts, application has been made to parliament for leave to levy a tax on the proprietors of land for improving the roads and erecting bridges in this extensive shire. The commonalty in the high parts of the county and on the western shore speak Gaelic; but the people of fashion in Inverness and its vicinity use the English language, and pronounce it with remarkable propriety.\nThe following is a view of the population of the different parishes in the county at two different periods.*\n\n| Parish     | Population in 1755 | Population in 1790\u20141798 |\n|------------|--------------------|-------------------------|\n| Abernethy  | 1670               | 1769                    |\n| Alvie      | 1021               | 1011                    |\n| Arderfer   | 428                | 1298                    |\n| Bolekine   | 1961               | 1741                    |\n| Conveth or Kiltarlity | 1964 | 2495                    |\n| Cromdale   | 3063               | 3000                    |\n| Croy       | 1901               | 1552                    |\n| Daviot     | 2176               | 1697                    |\n| Durris     | 1520               | 1365                    |\n| Glenelg    | 1816               | 2746                    |\n| Inverness  | 9730               | 10,527                  |\n| Kilmanivaig| 2995               | 2400                    |\n| Kilmaille  | 3093               | 4031                    |\n| Kilmoreck  | 2830               | 2318                    |\n| Kingussie  | 1900               | 1083                    |\n| Kirkhill   | 1360               | 1570                    |\n| Laggan    | 1460               | 1512                    |\n| Moy        | 1693               | 1813                    |\n| Petty      | 1643               | 1518                    |\n| Urquhart   | 1943               | 2355                    |\n\nContinental part: 46,167\n\n| Islands     | Population         |\n|-------------|--------------------|\n| Bracadale   | 1907               |\n| Diurinish   | 2368               |\n| Kilmuir     | 1572               |\n| Portree     | 1385               |\n| Sleat       | 1250               |\n| Snizort     | 1627               |\n| Strath      | 943                |\n| Barry       | 1150               |\n| South Uist  | 2209               |\n| North Uist  | 1909               |\n| Harris      | 1969               |\n\nTotal islands: 18,489\n\nTotal: 65,636\n\nIncrease: 9323","sp":324,"ep":326},{"h":"INVERSE","t":"is applied to a manner of working the rule of three.

See COLUMBA.\u2014It is said to have been a\nseat of the druids before his arrival, when its name in\nIrish was Inis Drunach, or the \"Druid Island.\" The\ndruids being expelled or converted, he founded here a\ncell of canons regular, who till 716 differed from the\nchurch of Rome, in the observance of Easter and in\nthe tonsure. After his death, the island retained his\nname, and was called Icolmkill or \"Columb's cell,\" now\nIcolmkill. The Danes dislodged the monks in the\n9th century, and Cluniacs were the next order that\nsettled here.\n\nThis island, which belongs to the parish of Rothesay\nin Mull, is three miles long, and one broad: the east side\nis mostly flat; the middle rises into small hills; and\nthe west side is very rude and rocky; the whole form-\ning a singular mixture of rock and fertility.\u2014There is\nin the island only one town, or rather village, con-\nsisting of about 60 mean houses.

An oblong inclo-\nsure, bounded by a stone dyke, and called Clachan\nDruimach, in which bones have been found, is supposed\nto have been a burial-place of the Druids or rather\nthe common cemetery of the townspeople. Beyond\nthe town are the ruins of the nunnery of Austin cano-\nnesses, dedicated to St Oran, and said to be founded\nby Columba: the church was 58 feet by 20, and the\neast roof is entire.

A broad paved way leads hence to\nthe cathedral; and on this way is a large handsome cros\ncalled Maclean's, the only one that remains of 360,\nwhich were demolished here at the Reformation. Rei-\nlig Oran, or the Burying-place of Oran, is the large\ninclosure where the kings of Scotland, Ireland, and\nof the isles, and their descendants, were buried in\nthree several chapels. The dean of the isles, who tra-\nvelled over them 1549, and whose account has been\ncopied by Buchanan, and published at Edinburgh\n1781, says, that in his time on one of these chapels\n(or \"tombs of slain formit like little chapels with ane\nbraid gray marble or quhin slain on the gavil of ilk\nane of the tombes,\" containing, as the chronicle says,\nthe remains of 48 Scotch monarchs, from Fergus II.\nto Macbeth; 16 of whom were pretended to be of the\nrace of Alpin) was inscribed, *Tumulus regum Scotiae.*\nThe next was inscribed, *Tumulus regum Hiberniae,* and\ncontained four Irish monarchs: and the third, inscribed\n*Tumulus regum Norvegiae,* contained eight Norwegian\nprinces, or viceroys of the Hebrides while they were\nsubject to the crown of Norway. Boetius says, that\nFergus founded this abbey for the burial-place of\nhis successors, and caused an office to be composed for\nthe funeral ceremony. All that Mr Pennant could\ndiscover here were only certain slight remains, built\nin a ridged form and arched within, but the inscrip-\ntions lost. These were called *fornaire nan righ,* or\n\"the ridge of the kings.\" Among these stones are\nto be seen only these two inscriptions in the Gaelic or\nErse language and ancient Irish characters: *Gros\nDomhail faid'ach,* i.e. \"the cros of Donald Long-\nshanks,\" and that of *Urchuine o Guin,* and another\ninscribed *Hic jacent priores de Hy, Johannes, Hug-\nniut, Patricius,* in decrevis olim baccularius, qui obit\nan. Dom. millesimo quingentesimo.* About 300 inscrip-\ntions were collected here by Mr Sacheverel in 1688\nand given to the earl of Argyle, but afterwards lost\nin the troubles of the family. The place is in a man-\nner filled with grave-stones, but so overgrown with\nweeds, that few or none are at present to be seen, far\nless any inscriptions read. Here also stands the chapel\nof St Oran, the first building begun by Columba, which\nthe evil spirits would not suffer to stand till some hu-\nman victim was buried alive; for which service Oran\noffered himself, and his red grave-stone is near the\ndoor. In this chapel are tombs of several chiefs, &c.\nA little north-west of the door is the pedestal of a\ncros: on it are certain stones that seem to have been\nthe supports of a tomb. Numbers who visit this island\nthink it incumbent on them to turn each of these\nthrice round, according to the course of the sun.\nThey are called *Glacha-braith,* for it is thought that the\nbraith, or end of the world, will not arrive till the pe-\ndaffal on which they stand is worn through. Origi-\nnally (says Mr Sacheverel) here were three noble globes\nof white marble, placed on three stone bases, and these\nwere turned round; but the synod ordered them and\n60 croses to be thrown into the sea. The present\nstones are probably substituted in place of these globes.\nThe precinct of these tombs was held sacred, and en-\njoyed the privileges of a girth or sanctuary. These\nplaces of retreat were by the ancient Scotch law, not\nto shelter indiscriminately every offender, as was the\ncase in more bigoted times in Catholic countries; for\nhere all atrocious criminals were excluded; and only\nthe unfortunate delinquent, or the penitent sinner,\nwas shielded from the instant stroke of rigorous ju-\nstice. A little to the north of this inclosure stands\nthe cathedral, built in form of a cros, 115 feet long\nby 23, the transept 70 feet: the pillars of the choir\nhave their capitals charged with scripture and other\nhistories; and near the altar are the tombs of two ab-\nbots and a knight. A fragment remains of the altar-\nstone of white marble veined with gray. This\nchurch is ascribed to Maldwin in the 7th century; but\nthe present structure is far too magnificent for that age.\nMost of the walls are built of red granite from the\nNun's island in the sound. Two parallel walls of a cov-\nered way about 12 feet high and 10 wide, reach from\nthe south-east corner to the sea. In the church-yard is\na fine cros of a single piece of red granite, 14 feet high,\n22 inches broad, and 10 inches thick. Near the south-\neast end is Mary's chapel. The monastery is behind\nthe chapel; of which only a piece of the cloisters re-\nmains, and some sacred black stones in a corner, on\nwhich contracts and alliances were made and oaths\nsworn. East of it was the abbot's gardens and of-\nfices. North of this was the palace of the bishop of\nthe isles after the separation of Man from them. This\nsee was endowed with 13 islands; several of which were\nfrequently taken away by the chieftains. The title of\nSoder, which some explained Soter, Zaling, \"the name\nof Christ, or Soder, an imaginary town,\" is really de-\nrived from the division of the diocese into the north-\nern islands or Norderseys (i.e. all to the north of Ad-\nnamurchan point), and the Southern or Sudereys;\nwhich last being the most important, the isle of Man\nretained both titles.\n\nOther ruins of monastic buildings and offices may be\ntraced, as well as some druidical sepulchral remains.\nSeveral abbeys were derived from this, which with the\nisland was governed by an abbot-prebiter, who had\nrule even over bishops. The place where Columba\nlanded is a pebbly beach, where a heap of earth re-\nprefents the form of his ship. Near it is a hill with a\ncircle of stones called *Cnoc-nar aingeal,* or \"the hill of\nangels,\" with whom the saint held conference; and on\nMichaelmas day the inhabitants coursed their horses\nround it, a remain of the custom of bringing them there\nto be blest. In former times, this island was the\nplace where the archives of Scotland and many valuable\nold manuscripts were kept. Of these most are suppo-\nsed to have been destroyed by the Reformation; but\nmany, it is said, were carried to the Scotch college at\nDouay in France, and it is hoped some of them may\nstill be recovered. In the island of Iona a schoolmaster\nis established; but there is no temple for worship, no\ninstructor in religion, excepting the schoolmaster, unless\nit is visited by the parish minister from another island.","sp":337,"ep":338},{"h":"IONIA","t":"a country of Asia Minor, bounded on the north by \u00c6olia, on the west by the \u00c6gean and Icarian seas, on the south by Caria, and on the east by Lydia and part of Caria.

Ionia was divided into 12 small states, which formed a celebrated confederacy often mentioned by the ancients. These 12 states were Priene, Miletus, Colophon, Clazomenae, Ephesus, Lebedos, Teos, Phoc\u00e6a, Erythre, Smyrna, and the capitals of Samos and Chios. The inhabitants of Ionia built a temple which they called Pan Ionium from the concourse of people that flocked there from every part of Ionia. After they had enjoyed for some time their freedom and independence, they were made tributary to the power of Lydia by Croesus. The Athenians assisted them to shake off the slavery of the Asiatic monarchs; but they soon forgot their duty and relation to their mother-country, and joined Xerxes when he invaded Greece. They were delivered from the Persian yoke by Alexander, and restored to their original independence. They were reduced by the Romans under the dictator Sylla.

The name comes from the Saxon Cygefewick, that is, a town situated upon the Gyppen, now called Orwell. It had once 21 churches, but now has only 12. It was plundered by the Danes in 991, and afterwards besieged by King Stephen. It had charters and a mint in the reign of King John, but its last charter was from Charles II. The remains of a wall and five or seven religious houses are still to be seen. Though it is not in so flourishing a state as formerly when the harbour was more commodious, yet it is still a large well built town. Besides the churches already mentioned, it has several meeting-houses, two chapels, a town-hall, council-chamber, a large market-place with a cross in the middle of it, a shire-hall for the county sessions, a library, several hospitals, a free-school, a handsome stone-bridge over the river, stately flambles in the market-place built by Cardinal Wolsey, who was a native of the town and a butcher's son, and who also began to build a college here on the ruins of a small college of black canons, which still bears his name, though it was never finished. Here are also several almshouses, three charity-schools, and a convenient key and customhouse. By virtue of Charles II.'s charter, the town is governed by two bailiffs, a recorder, 12 portmen, of whom the bailiffs are two, a town-clerk, two coroners, and 24 common-council. The bailiffs and 4 of the portmen are justices of the peace. The town enjoys a great many privileges, as palling fines and recoveries, trying criminals, and even crown and capital causes among themselves, settling the affix of bread, wine, and beer. No freeman is obliged to serve on juries out of the town, or bear any office for the king, except that of the sheriff, or to pay tolls or duties in any other part of the kingdom. They have an admiralty jurisdiction beyond Harwich on the Essex coast, and on both sides the Suffolk coast, by which they are entitled to all goods cast on shore. The bailiffs even hold an admiralty-court beyond Landguard-fort. By a trial in King Edward III.'s time, it appears that the town had a right to the custom-duties for all goods coming into Harwich-haven. They claim a right also to all waifs and strays, &c. The manufactures of the town are chiefly woollen and linen cloth. It has still a considerable foreign trade.\n\nThe tide rises pretty high, and brings great ships irrefleble, within a small distance of the town. They export a great deal of corn to London, and sometimes to Holland. Formerly, they had a great trade in shipbuilding; but that having declined, they now send great quantities of timber to the king's yard at Chatham. It has several great fairs for cattle, cheese, and butter; and is admirably situated for the trade to Greenland, because the same wind that carries them out of the river will carry them to Greenland. It is worth remarking, that it is one of the best places in England for persons in narrow circumstances, house rent being easy, provisions cheap and plentiful, the passage by land or water to London, &c., convenient, and the company of the place good.

The Irish historians pretend to very great antiquity. According to them, the island was first inhabited about 322 years after the flood. At Origin of that time Partholansus the son of Scara landed in Mun-the Irish after the 14th of May with 1000 soldiers, and some according women, from Greece. This voyage he had undertaken on account of his having killed his father and mother in his native country. The same historians inform us, that a great number of lakes broke out in Ireland during the reign of Partholansus, which had no existence when he came into the island, with many other particulars not worth mentioning; but the most surprising circumstance is, that about 300 years after the arrival of this Grecian colony, all of them perished by a plague, not a single person remaining to tell the fate of the rest; in which case, it is wonderful how the catastrophe should have been known.\n\nAfter the extinction of this first colony, Ireland remained a perfect wilderness for 30 years; when another colony arrived from the east, under the direction of one Nemedius. He set sail from the Euxine sea with 30 transports, each manned with 40 heroes; and\nIreland, at last arrived on the coasts of Ireland, after a very tedious and strange navigation. During his reign also many lakes were formed in the country, which had no existence before; the most material circumstance, however, was an unsuccessful war in which he was engaged with some African pirates, who in the end enslaved his people. The victors proved such inapplicable tyrants, that the Irish found themselves under a necessity of quitting the island altogether. They embarked on board a fleet of 1150 ships, under the command of three grandsons of Nemedius, viz., Simon Breac, To Chath, and Briatan Maoil. The first returned to Greece, the second sailed to the northern parts of Europe, and the third landed in the north of Scotland, and from him the island of Britain is said to have taken its name, and the Welsh their origin.\n\nAbout 216 years after the death of Nemedius, the descendants of Simon Breac returned from Greece into Ireland. They were conducted by five princes of great reputation, who divided the island into five kingdoms, nearly equal in size. These kingdoms were called Munster, Leinster, Connacht, Meath, and Ulster; and the subjects of these kings are called by the Irish historians Firbolgs.\n\nThe Firbolgs were in process of time expelled or totally subdued, after the loss of 100,000 men in one battle, by the Tuath de Dananns, a nation of necromancers, who came from Attica, Boeotia, and Achaia, into Denmark, from Denmark to Scotland, and from Scotland to Ireland. These necromancers were so completely skilled in their art, that they could even restore the dead to life, and bring again into the field those warriors who had been slain the day before. They had also some curiosities which possessed a wonderful virtue. These were a sword, a spear, a cauldron, and a marble chair; on which last were crowned first the kings of Ireland, and afterwards those of Scotland. But neither the powerful virtues of these Danish curiosities, nor the more powerful spells of the magic art, were able to preserve the Tuath de Dananns from being subdued by the Gadelians when they invaded Ireland.\n\nThe Gadelians were descended from one Gathelus, from whom they derived their name. He was a man of great consequence in Egypt, and intimately acquainted with Moses the Jewish legislator. His mother was Scotia, the daughter of Pharaoh, by Niul the son of a Scythian monarch contemporary with Nimrod. The Gadelians, called also Scots, from Scotia above-mentioned, conquered Ireland about 1300 B.C., under Heber and Heremon, two sons of Milesius king of Spain, from whom were descended all the kings of Ireland down to the English conquest, and who are therefore styled by the Irish historians, princes of the Milesian race.\n\nFrom this period the Irish historians trace a gradual refinement of their countrymen from a state of the grossest barbarity, until a monarch, named Ollam Fodla, established a regular form of government, erected a grand seminary of learning, and instituted the Fer, or triennial convention of provincial kings, priests, and poets, at Feamor or Tarah in Meath, for the establishment of laws and regulation of government. But whatever were the institutions of this monarch, it is acknowledged that they proved insufficient to withstand the wildness and disorder of the times. To Kinnab, one of his successors, the annalists give the honour of reviving them, besides that of regulating Ulster, his family-province, and adorning it with a stately palace at Eamannia near Armagh. His immediate successor, called Hugony, is still more celebrated for advancing the work of reformation. It seems, that from the earliest origin of the Irish nation, the island had been divided into the five provincial kingdoms above-mentioned, and four of these had been subject to the fifth, who was nominal monarch of the whole island. These four, however, proved such obstinate disturbers of the peace, that Hugony, to break their power, parcelled out the country into 25 dynasties, binding them by oath to accept no other monarch but one of his own family. This precaution proved ineffectual. Hugony himself died a violent death, and all his successors for a series of ages were assassinated, scarcely with one exception.\n\nAbout 100 B.C. the pentarchal government was restored, and is said to have been succeeded by a considerable revolution in politics. The Irish bards had for many ages dispensed the laws, and the whole nation submitted to their decisions; but as their laws were exceedingly obscure, and could be interpreted only by themselves, they took occasion from thence to oppress the people, until at last they were in danger of being totally exterminated by a general insurrection. In this emergency they fled to Convocar-Mac-Nefia, the reigning monarch, who promised them his protection in case they reformed; but at the same time, in order to quiet the just complaints of his people, he employed the most eminent among them to compile an intelligible, equitable, and distinct, body of laws, which were received with the greatest joy, and dignified with the name of celestial decrees. These decisions seem to have produced but very little reformation among the people in general. We are now presented with a new series of barbarities, murders, factions, and anarchy; and in this disordered situation of affairs it was, according to the Irish historians, that the chieftain mentioned by Tacitus addressed himself to Agricola, and encouraged him to make a descent on Ireland. This scheme happened not to suit the views of the Roman general at that time, and therefore was not adopted; and so confident are these historians of the strength of their country even in its then disturbed state, that they treat the notion of its being subdued by a Roman legion and some auxiliaries (the force proposed to Agricola) as utterly extravagant; acquainting us at the same time, that the Irish were so far from dreading a Roman invasion, that they failed to the affluence of the Piets, and having made a successful incursion into South Britain, returned home with a considerable booty.\n\nIn the same state of barbarity and confusion the kingdom of Ireland continued till the introduction of Christianity by St Patrick, about the middle of the fifth century. This missionary, according to the adversaries of the Irish antiquity, first introduced letters into Ireland, and thus laid the foundations of a future civilization. On the other hand, the advocates for that antiquity maintain, that the Irish had the knowledge of letters, and had made considerable progress in the arts, before the time of St Patrick: though they allow,\nthat he introduced the Roman character, in which his copies of the Scripture and liturgies were written. To enter into the dispute would be contrary to our plan. It is sufficient to observe, that, excepting by some of the Irish themselves, the history already given is generally reckoned entirely fabulous, and thought to have been invented after the introduction of Christianity. An origin of the Irish nation has been found out much nearer than Asia, Greece, or Egypt; namely, the island of Britain, from whence it is now thought that Ireland was first peopled. A dispute hath arisen concerning the place from whence the first emigrants from Britain set sail for Ireland. The honour of being the mother-country of the Irish hath been disputed between the North and South Britons. Mr Macpherson has argued strenuously for the former, and Mr Whitaker for the latter. For an account of their dispute, however, we must refer to the works of these gentlemen. Mr Whitaker claims the victory, and challenges himself the honour of being the first who clearly and truly demonstrated the origin of the Irish.\n\nThe name of Ireland, according to Mr Whitaker, is obviously derived from the word *Iar* or *Eir*, which in the Celtic language signifies \"west.\" This word was sometimes pronounced *Iver*, and *Hiver*; whence the names of *Iris*, *Ierna*, *Juverna*, *Iverna*, *Hibernia*, and *Ireland*; by all of which it hath at some time or other been known.\n\nAbout 350 B.C., according to the same author, the Belgae crossed the channel, invaded Britain, and seized the whole extended line of the southern coast, from Kent to Devonshire. Numbers of the former inhabitants, who had gradually retired before the enemy, were obliged at last to take shipping on the western coast of England, and pass over into the uninhabited isle of Ireland. These were afterwards joined by another body of Britons driven out by the Belgae under Divitius, about 100 B.C. For two centuries and a half afterwards, these colonies were continually reinforced with fresh swarms from Britain; as the populousness of this island, and the vicinity of that, invited them to settle in the one, or the bloody and successive wars in Britain during this period naturally induced them to relinquish the other: and the whole circuit of Ireland appears to have been completely peopled about 150 years after Christ: and as the inhabitants had all fled equally from the dominion of the Belgae, or for some other cause left their native country, they were distinguished among the Britons by one general and very apposite name, viz. that of *Scutes* or *Scots*, \"the wanderers, or refugees.\"\n\nMr Whitaker also informs us, \"that in the times of the Romans Ireland was inhabited by 18 tribes; by one upon the northern and three on the southern shore, seven upon the western, six on the eastern, and one in the centre.\n\n\"Along the eastern coast, and the Vergilian or internal ocean, were ranged the Dumnii, the Voluntii, and the Eblani, the Caucii, the Menapii, and the Coriondii. The first inhabited a part of the two counties of Antrim and Down, extending from Fair head, the most northerly extremity of the island, to Ifannum Promontorium, or the point of Ardglass haven, in the county of Down; and, having the Logia or Lagan, which falls into Carrickfergus bay, within their possessions, and Dunum or Downpatrick for their capital. The Voluntii possessed the coast from the point of that haven to the river Buvinda or Boyne, the remainder of Down, the breadth of Armagh, and all Louth; having the Vindurus or Carlingford river in their dominions, and the town of Laberus near the river Deva (Atherden in the county of Louth) for their metropolis. And the Eblani reached from the Boyne to the Lebusius, Leuvi, or Liffy; residing in East Meath, and in the large portion of Dublin county which is to the north of this river; and acknowledging Mediolanum, Eblana, or Dublin, for their principal town. The Caucii spread from the Liffy to the Letrim, the Oboca of the ancients; had the rest of Dublin county, and such parts of Wicklow as lie in the north of the latter; and owned Dunum or Rath-Downe for their chief city. The Menapii occupied the coast betwixt the Letrim and Cancarne-point, all the rest of Wicklow, and all Wexford to the point; their chief town, Menapia, being placed upon and to the east of Modona, Slanus, or Slane. And the Coriondii inhabited at the back of the Caucii and Menapii, to the west of the Slane and Liffy, and in all Kildare and all Catherlogh; being limited by the Boyne and Barrow on the west, the Eblani on the north, and the Brigantes on the south.\n\n\"Upon the southern shore and along the verge of the Cantabrian ocean, lay the Brigantes, the Vodiea, and the Ibernii. The first owned the rest of Wexford and all Waterford: extending to the Blackwater, Avonmore, or Dabrona, on the fourth-west; having the great mouth of the Barrow with their territories, and Brigantia, Waterford, or some town near it, for their chief city; and giving name of Brigas to the Suir or Swire, their liminary stream on the north, and the appellation of Bergie to their own part of the county of Wexford. The Vodiea possessed the shire of Corke from the Blackwater to the Ban, the river of Kinfaile, and the Dobonia or Dubana of the ancients; and affixed the name of Vodium Promontorium to the point of Balycotton island. And the Ibernii inhabited the remainder of Corke, and all that part of Kerry which lies to the fourth-east of Dingle found; having Rufina or Ibaune for their capital, the Promontorium Aufrinum or Milen-Head about the middle of their dominions, and the river Ibermus or Dingle found for their northern barrier; and leaving their names to the three divisions of Ibaune, Beare, and Iveragh.\n\n\"Upon the western shore of the island, and along the Great Britannic or Atlantic ocean, were the Lucanii or Lucenii, the Velaborii, and the Cangani, the Aterii, the Nagnatae, the Hardinii, and Venenicii. The Lucanii inhabited the peninsula of land that lies along the river Ibermus or Dingle found, and perhaps some adjoining parts of Kerry. The Velaborii ranged along the small remainder of the latter, and over the whole of Limerick to the Senus or Shannon; having the Durus or Calheen flowing through their dominions, and Regia, Limerick or some town near it, for their metropolis. And the latter was probably that city near Limerick, the site of which is still famous, and retains the appellation of Cathair, or the fortress; and where the remains of streets, and other marks of a town, may yet be traced. The Cangani lived in the county of Clare:\nClare: Macolicum near the Shannon, perhaps Feakle or Melic, being their principal town; a headland in the bay of Galway, near Glaniny, being denominated Benjannum Promontorium; and the adjoining isles of Arran called Infulae Cangane. The Auterii were settled in the county of Galway; winding along the deep recesses of the Sinus Auboa or bay of Galway; stretching towards the north as far as the Libinius, or the river that bounds the thire in that part; and possesting the small portion of Mayo which lies to the south of it. And these were subject to Auterium, anciently Aterith, and now Athenree; and have left their name to the division of Athenree. The Nagnatae occupied the rest of the large county of Mayo, all Sligo and all Roscommon, all Letrim as far as Logh Allin on the south-east, and all Fermanagh, to Ballyhannon and Logh Erne; being bounded by the Rhebus or river of Ballyhannon, and the lake Rhebus or Logh Erne; having a deep bay, called Magnus Sinus, that curves along Mayo, Sligo, and Letrim counties; and acknowledging Nagnat, Necmaht, or Alnecmaht, the town of the Nagnatae, for their capital. And the Hardini and Venicii were confederated together under the title of the Venician Nation, extended from Ballyhannon to the North-Cape, and possessed all Donnegalle, except the two whole divisions of Raphoe and Enis-Owen, and the eastern part of Killmacrenen. The Venicii lay along the immediate margin of the shore, giving name to the Promontorium Venicum or Cape Horn, and to the Insula Venicia or North Arran island. And their metropolis Rheba was seated upon the lake Rhebus, and in the country of the Hardini on the south-east.\n\nUpon the northern shore and along the margin of the Deucalidonian ocean, were only the Robogdii; inhabiting the rest of Donnegalle, all Derry, and all Antrim to the Fair-Head, and the Damii; and giving their own name to the former and the division of Raphoe. And they had the rivers Vidua or Shipharbour, Arigta or Logh Swilly, Darabouna or Logh Foile, and Banna, or Ban, in their territories; and acknowledged Robogdium, Robog, or Raphoe, for their chief city.\n\nThe central regions of the island, all Tyrone, the remainder of Fermanagh and Letrim, all Monaghan, and the rest of Armagh; all Cavan, all Longford, and all West-Meath; all the King's and Queen's county, all Kilkenny, and all Tipperary; were planted by the Scoti. The Shannon, Logh Allin, and Logh Erne, were their great boundaries on the west; the Barrow, Boyne, and Logh Neagh, on the east; the Swire and Blackwater on the south; and a chain of mountains on the north. And the two greatest of their towns were Rheba, a city seated, like the Rheba of the Venicians, upon the lake and river Rhebus, but on a different part of them, and somewhere in the north of Cavan; and Ibernia, a town placed a little to the east of the Shannon, and somewheres in the county of Tipperary.\"\n\nBut whether we are to receive as truth the accounts given by Mr Whitaker, those of the Irish annalists, or any other, it is certain that, till little more than a century ago, Ireland was a scene of confusion and slaughter. The Irish historians acknowledge this, as we have already seen. Very few of their monarchs escaped a violent death. The histories of their kings indeed amount to no more than this, viz. that they began to reign in such a year, reigned a certain number of years, and were slain in battle by the valiant prince who succeeded to the throne. The introduction of Christianity seems to have mended the matter very little, or rather not at all. The same wars between the chiefs continued; and the same murders and treacheries took place among the inhabitants, till they were invaded by the Danes or Normans, about the end of the eighth century. At this time, we are told, the Danes that the monarchical power was weak, by reason of the factious and assuming disposition of the inferior dynasties; but that the evils of the political constitution had considerably subsided by the respect paid to religion and learning. The first invasions of the Danes were made in small parties for the sake of plunder, and were repelled by the chieftain whose dominions were invaded. Other parties appeared in different parts of the island, and terrified the inhabitants by the havoc they committed. These were in like manner put to flight, but never failed to return in a short time; and in this manner was Ireland harassed for the space of 20 years, before the inhabitants thought of putting an end to their intestine contentions, and uniting against the common enemy. The northern pirates, either by force or treaty, gradually obtained some small settlements on the island; till at length Turgesius, or Turgesius, a warlike Norwegian, landed with a powerful armament in the year 815. He divided his fleet and army, in order to strike terror in different quarters. His followers plundered, burned, and massacred, without mercy, and persecuted the clergy in a dreadful manner on account of their religion. The Danes already settled in Ireland, flocked to the standard of Turgesius, who thus was enabled to seat himself in Armagh, from which he expelled the clergy, and seized their lands. The Irish, in the mean time, were infatuated by their private quarrels; till at last, after some ill-conducted and unsuccessful efforts, they sunk into a state of abject submission, and Turgesius was proclaimed monarch of the whole island in 845.\n\nThe new king proved such a tyrant, that he soon became intolerable. A conspiracy was formed against him; and he was seized by Melachline prince of Meath, in a time of apparent peace. An universal insurrection ensued; the Danes were massacred or dispersed; their leader condemned to death for his cruelties, and drowned in a lake. The foreigners, however, were not exterminated, but the remains of them were allowed to continue on the island as subjects or tributaries to some particular chieftains. A new colony soon arrived, but under pretence of peaceable intentions, and a design of enriching the country by commerce. The Irish, through an infatuated policy, suffered them to become masters of Dublin, Limerick, Waterford, and other maritime places, which they enlarged and fortified with such works as had till then been unknown in Ireland. The Danes did not fail to make use of every opportunity of enlarging their territories, and new wars quickly ensued. The Irish were sometimes victorious, and sometimes not; but were never able to drive out their enemies, so that they continued to be a very distinguished and powerful sept, or tribe, in Ireland. The wars with the Danes were no sooner\nIreland at an end, than the natives, as usual, turned their arms against each other. The country was harassed by the competitions of the chiefs; laws and religion lost their influence, and the most horrid licentiousness and immorality prevailed. Thus the whole island seemed ready to become a prey to the first invader, when an attempt was made upon it by Magnus king of Norway. This attempt miscarried through his own rashness; for, having landed without opposition, he advanced into the country without the least apprehension. The consequence of this was, that he was surrounded and cut to pieces with all his followers. His death, however, proved of little benefit to Ireland; the same disorders which had gradually reduced the kingdom to a state of extreme weakness, still continued to operate, and to facilitate the success of the English invasion, which happened in the reign of Henry II.\n\nThe first motives which induced this monarch to think of an expedition against Ireland are not well known. It was supposed that he had been provoked by some affront which the Irish princes had given to the French; but, whatever might be in this, it is certain that the design was conceived soon after he ascended the throne; and his flatterers soon furnished him with sufficient reasons for considering the Irish as his subjects. It was affirmed that they had originally possessed themselves of their country by permission of Gurguntius a British king; and that, as descendants of the Britons, they were the natural and rightful subjects of the English monarch. It was also suggested, that the renowned King Arthur, Egfred the Northumbrian prince, and Edgar one of the Saxon kings of England, had all led their armies into Ireland, and there made valuable acquisitions, which their successor was in honour bound to recover and maintain. All these suggestions, however, or whatever else had occurred to himself, seemed yet insufficient to Henry; and therefore he took the most effectual method to injure his reputation, namely, by an application to the pope. To him he represented, that the inhabitants of Ireland were sunk into the most wretched state of corruption, both with regard to morals and religion; that Henry, zealous for the honour and enlargement of God's kingdom, had conceived the pious design of erecting it in this unhappy country; was ready to devote himself and all his powers to this meritorious service; implored the benediction of the pontiff; and requested his permission and authority to enter Ireland to reduce the disobedient and corrupt, to eradicate all sin and wickedness, to instruct the ignorant, and spread the blest influence of the gospel in all its purity and perfection; promising at the same time to pay a yearly tribute to St Peter from the land thus to be reduced to his obedience, and to the holy see. Adrian, the reigning pope, rejoiced at this application which tended so much to the advancement of his own power. A bull was therefore immediately formed, conformable to the most sanguine wishes of Henry, which was sent to England without delay, together with a ring, the token of his investiture as rightful sovereign of Ireland. But whatever inclination the king of England or the pope might at this time (A.D. 1156) have for the subjection of Ireland, the fluctuation of the English affairs obliged him to defer it for some time.\n\nThe state of Ireland, as we have already observed, was at this time extremely favourable for an invasion. The monarch enjoyed little more than a titular dignity being harassed by a faction, and opposed by powerful rivals. A number of chieftains who assumed the title that time and rights of royalty, paid a precarious tribute to their superior, and united, if they were disposed to unite, with him, rather as his allies than his subjects. In Ulster, the family of the northern Hi-Nial, as it was called, exercised a hereditary jurisdiction over the counties now called Tyrone, Derry, and Donegal. They also claimed a right of supremacy over the lords of Fermanagh, Antrim, and Argial, which included the counties of Armagh, Monaghan, Louth, and some adjacent districts; while Dunleve, prince of Uladh (now Down), disputed the superiority of this family, and affected an independent state. In Munster reigned the descendants of Brien, a famous sovereign of former times, impatient to recover the honours of their family; but at last, being confined by powerful rivals to the territory of North Munster, they were obliged to leave the family of Mac Arthy foreseigns of Desmond, the southern division. In Connaught, the princes known by the name of O'Connor were acknowledged foreseigns of the eastern territory. Ternan O'Ruare, an active and restless military chief, had the supremacy in Breffney, containing the modern county of Leitrim, and some adjacent districts. Meath, or the southern Hi-Nial, was subject to the family of Clan-Colman, Murchard O'Malachlyn, and his successors. Leinster, divided into several principalities, was subject to Dermot, a fierce, haughty, and oppressive tyrant. His father had governed with great cruelty. Seventeen of his vassal lords had been either put to death, or had their eyes put out, by his order in one year; and Dermot seemed to inherit too great a portion of the same temper. His stature and bodily strength made him admired by the inferior orders of his subjects; and these he was careful to protect and favour. His donations and endowments of religious houses recommended him to the clergy; but his tributary chieftains felt the weight of his pride and tyranny, and to them his government was extremely odious.\n\nThe chief competitors for the rank of monarch of Ireland, in the mean time, were, the heirs of the two houses of O'Connor, and the northern Hi-Nial. Torlogh O'Connor was in possession; but he was not generally recognized, and was opposed by his rival O'Lochlan; notwithstanding which, he maintained his dignity with magnificence and vigour, till a decisive victory gained by him over O'Brien raised O'Lochlan's jealousy to such, that he obliged him in a convention of the states to allow him the sovereignty of the northern division. In consequence of this partition, it was resolved to transfer the territory of O'Ruarc to a person more inclined to the interests of the two sovereigns. An expedition was accordingly undertaken; O'Ruarc was surprised, defeated, and driven from his dominions. Dermot, who had conceived an unlawful passion for Dervorghal, the wife of O'Ruarc, took the opportunity of her husband's distresses to carry her off in triumph. O'Ruarc conceived the most implacable resentment against Dermot; and therefore applying himself to Torlogh, promised an inviolable attachment to his interest; and prevailed on him not only to reinstate him\nhim in his possessions, but to revenge the insult offered by Dermod, and to restore his wife. By means of such a powerful ally, O'Ruarc found frequent opportunities of harassing his antagonist till the death of Torlogh, which happened in 1156, upon which O'Lochlain succeeded to the sovereignty. Dermod was the first to acknowledge the authority of this new sovereign, by whose means he hoped to be able to revenge himself on O'Ruarc. He soon found, however, that he had acted too precipitately. His patron, having treacherously feigned and put out the eyes of Dan's prince of Down, the neighbouring chieftains took arms, in order to secure themselves from his barbarity. O'Lochlain was defeated and killed; upon which the monarchy devolved on Roderic the son of the late Torlogh O'Connor.\n\nThe new prince had acquired the reputation of valour, and was determined to establish this reputation by some remarkable exploit in the beginning of his reign. Having therefore engaged in his service the Oldmen, or descendants of the Danes, he marched against Dermod as the chief partisan of his fallen rival. The king of Leinster was seized with the utmost consternation; and in despair set fire to his own town of Ferns, lest the enemy should have the satisfaction of spoiling it. Roderic still advanced, attended by O'Ruarc, Dermod's implacable enemy, and soon overran the whole province. All the inferior lords at once acknowledged Roderic's authority. Dermod was deposed, as a man utterly unworthy of his station; another of his family was raised to the throne; and the unfortunate prince, finding it impossible to stay with safety in Ireland, embarked with 60 of his followers for England, and soon arrived at the port of Bristol, with a design to solicit alliance from King Henry.\n\nIn England, Dermod's character was unknown, and he was regarded as an injured prince driven from his throne by an injurious confederacy. The clergy received him as the benefactor of their order, and entertained him in the monastery of Augustines with great hospitality. Having learned that Henry was then in Aquitain, he immediately went thither, and in a very abject manner implored his assistance, promising to acknowledge him as his liege lord, and to hold his dominions, which he was thus confident of regaining, in vassalage to Henry and his heirs.\n\nThough nothing could be more flattering to the ambition of the king of England than this servile address, yet the situation of his own affairs rendered it impossible for him at that time to reap from it any of the advantages with which it flattered him. He therefore dismissed the Irish prince with large presents, and a letter of credence addressed to all his subjects: notifying his grace and protection granted to the king of Leinster; and declaring, that whosoever within his dominions should be disposed to aid the unfortunate prince in the recovery of his kingdom, might be assured of his free licence and royal favour.\n\nDermod returned to England highly pleased with the reception he had met with; but notwithstanding the king's letter, none of the English seemed to be disposed to try their fortunes in Ireland. A month elapsed without any prospect of succours, so that Dermod began to despair. At last, however, he prevailed, with great promises, Richard earl of Chepstow, or, as it was formerly called, Strigul, a nobleman of considerable influence in Wales, but of broken fortune, to assist him with a considerable force to be transported next spring into Ireland. Overjoyed at this first instance of success, he advanced into South Wales, where, by venturers the influence of the bishop of St David's, he procured to follow many other friends. Robert Fitz-Stephen, a brave land and experienced officer, covenanted with him to engage in his service with all his followers, and Maurice Fitz-Gerald his maternal brother; while Dermod, on his part, promised to cede to the two principal leaders, Fitz-Stephen and Fitz-Gerald, the entire dominion of the town of Wexford, with a large adjoining territory, as soon as by their assistance he should be reinstated in his rights.\n\nThe Irish prince having now accomplished his purpose, set sail for Ireland in the winter of 1169, and recovered a small part of his dominions even before the arrival of his new allies; but being attacked with a superior force by his old enemies Roderic and O'Ruarc, he found himself obliged to feign submission till the English allies came to his assistance. The expected succours arrived in the month of May 1170, in a creek called the Bann, near the city of Wexford. Robert Fitz-Stephen commanded 35 knights, 60 men in armour, and 300 archers. With these came Harvey of Mountmorris, nephew to Earl Richard. He had no military force along with him; but came solely with a view of discovering the nature of the country, and reporting it to his uncle. Maurice of Pendergait commanded 10 knights and 200 archers; and thus the English force, which was to contend with the whole strength of Ireland, amounted to no more than 600 men.\n\nTrifling as this assistance may seem, it nevertheless changed the face of affairs almost instantaneously. Numbers of Dermod's subjects who had abandoned him in his distress, now flocked to his standard. Wexford was immediately attacked, and surrendered in a few days; Fitz-Stephen and Fitz-Gerald were jointly invested with the lordship of this city and its domain; and Harvey of Mountmorris was declared lord of two considerable districts on the coast. After three or four weeks spent in feasting and rejoicing, a new expedition was undertaken against the prince of Offory (a district of Leinster), who had not only revolted from Dermod, but put out the eyes of one of his sons, and that with such cruelty, that the unhappy youth expired under the operation. The allied army was now increased to 3000 men, who were opposed by the prince of Offory at the head of 5000, strongly entrenched among woods and morasses. By the superior conduct of the English troops, however, the Irish were decoyed from their advantageous situation, and thus were entirely defeated. The English were for keeping the field till they had totally reduced their enemies: but Dermod, accustomed only to ravage and plunder, contented himself with destroying the country; and a sudden reverse of fortune seemed ready to take place. The prince of Offory, though defeated, still appeared in arms, and only waited for an opportunity of again opposing the enemy in the field. Maurice Pendergait also joined him with his whole troop, being provoked by Dermod, who had refused him leave to return to Wales. This defection, however, was in part supplied by the arrival\nIreland. arrival of Fitz-Gerald with 10 knights, 30 horse-\nmen, and 100 archers. Pendergast in a short time re-\npenting of his new alliance, and retired into Wales; so\nthat the prince was obliged to make his submission to\nDermot, which the latter with some reluctance ac-\ncepted.\n\nIn the mean time, Roderic, having settled all his\nother affairs, advanced against the allies with a pow-\nerful army. Dermot was thrown into despair; but en-\ncouraged by Fitz-Stephen, he encamped in a very\nstrong situation, where he was soon besieged by Roderic.\nThe latter, however, dreading the valour of the Eng-\nlish, condescended to treat first with them, and then\nwith Dermot, in order to detach them from the inte-\nrests of each other: but as this proceeded evidently\nfrom fear, his offers were rejected by both parties;\nupon which he began to prepare for battle: but at the\nvery time when the engagement should have com-\nmenced, either through the suggestions of his clergy, or\nof his own fears, Roderic entered into a new negotiation;\nwhich at last terminated in a peace. The terms were,\nthat Dermot should acknowledge the supremacy of\nRoderic, and pay him such service as the monarchs of\nIreland had usually received from inferior princes;\nand as a security for his faithful performance of this\narticle, he delivered up his favourite son as an hostage\nto Roderic: but in order to establish this accommoda-\ntion on the firmest basis, the latter obliged himself to\ngive his daughter in marriage to the young prince as\nsoon as Leinster should be reduced, and the peace of the\nisland effectually restored. By a secret article, Dermot\nengaged to dismiss the British forces immediately after\nthe settlement of his own province, and in the mean\ntime not to bring over any further reinforcements from\nEngland.\n\nThus ended the first British expedition into Ireland,\nthe consequences of which were so little dreaded at that\ntime by the natives, that their historians, though they\ndwell upon the principal wars and contests in other\nparts of the island, speak of the settlement of the\nWelshmen in Leinster with a careless indifference. But\nthough the settlement of this colony seemed very little\nalarming to the generality, it could not escape the ob-\nservation of discerning persons, that a man of Dermot\u2019s\ncharacter would not long keep his treaties; and that\non the first emergency he would have recourse to his\nformer allies, who thus would establish themselves more\nand more, till at last they would reduce the country\nentirely under their subjection. These reflections, if\nany such were then made, were in a short time verified.\nDermot was scarce settled in his own dominions, when\nhe began to aspire at the sovereignty, and form\nschemes for dethroning Roderic. He applied to Fitz-\nStephen and Fitz-Gerald; by whom he was again di-\nrected to apply to Richard earl of Chepstow, more\ncommonly known by the name of Strongbow, on ac-\ncount of his feats of archery. Richard was very much\ninclined to accept of his invitation; but thought it in-\ncumbent upon him first to obtain the consent of King\nHenry. The king, however, did not incline that his\nsubjects should make conquests for themselves in any\nother country, and therefore dismissed Richard with an\nequivocal answer; but the latter being willing to un-\nderstand his sovereign\u2019s words in the most favourable\nsense, immediately set about the necessary preparations\nfor his expedition. In May 1171, Raymond le Gros,\nRichard\u2019s domestic friend, and the near relation of\nFitz-Stephen and Fitz-Gerald, landed at a place called\nDondonalp, near Waterford, with 10 knights and 70\narchers; and along with them came Harvey of Mount-\nlith, accompanied by a small train. The English imme-\ndiately intrenched themselves, and erected a temporary\nfort for themselves; which proved a very necessary pre-\ncaution; for the natives, justly attributing this new\ndebarcation to the practices of Dermot, instantly\nformed a tumultuous army, and marched to expel the\ninvaders. The English prepared to meet them; but\nwhen they perceived the great superiority of the enemy,\nthey thought proper to retire to their fort. Here,\nhowever, they must have been totally cut off; had they\nnot luckily collected a numerous herd of cattle from\nthe neighbouring country for their subsistence. These\nthey drove with fury among the Irish, who were thus\nput into the utmost confusion. The invaders seized\nthe favourable moment; and, falling upon their dis-\nordered enemies, put them to flight, and drove great\nnumbers of them into the sea, where they perished.\nSeventy prisoners were taken, all of them principal ci-\ntizens of Waterford; who, though they offered large\nsums for their ransom, and even that the city should be\ndelivered up to the English, were all barbarously put to\ndeath. This success and cruelty so intimidated the\nIrish, that they suffered these merciless invaders to\nmaintain their station unmolested, and wait for the ar-\nrival of their associates.\n\nRichard in the mean time having assembled his va-\nllals, led them through Wales, where he was joined by\ngreat numbers of other adventurers; but, when just\non the point of embarking, was surprised by a positive\ncommand from the king, to desist from his intended\nenterprise, on pain of forfeiture of his lands and ho-\nnours. He was now, however, too much interested\nin his scheme to retract; and therefore pretended to\ndisbelieve the authenticity of the royal mandate. On\nthe eve of the feast of St Bartholomew, he landed at\nWaterford with 200 knights and 1200 infantry, all with\na choler and well appointed soldiers. They were im-\nmediately joined by Raymond and his troop; and the\nnext day it was resolved to make an attempt upon\nWaterford. The city was taken by storm, and a\ndreadful massacre ensued; to which the cruel Dermot\nhad the merit of putting an end. The marriage of\nRichard with Eva, the daughter of Dermot, was fo-\nlemnized without delay, and a scene of joy and festivi-\nty succeeded the calamities of war.\n\nA new expedition was now undertaken against\nDublin; the inhabitants of which had either manifest-\ned some recent disaffection to Dermot, or had never\nbeen thoroughly forgiven for their old defection. Ro-\nderic advanced against the allied army with a formi-\ndable body, consisting, as is said, of 30,000 men; but,\nfearing to come to a general engagement, he\ncontented himself with some slight skirmishes; after\nwhich, great part of his vassals forced him to dismiss\nthem, and Dublin was left to its fate. The inhabitants\nwere treated very severely; however, a considerable\nbody of them, with Hesulph their governor, had the\ngood fortune to gain some vessels lying in the har-\nbour, and made their escape to the northern islands.\nEarl Richard was now invested with the lordship of\nDublin;\nDublin; and appointed Milo de Cogan, a brave English knight, his governor; while he himself, in conjunction with the forces of Dermot, overran the country of Meath, committing everywhere the most horrid cruelties. Roderic, in the mean time, unable to oppose them in the field, sent deputies to Dermot, commanding him to retire, and putting him in mind that his son was in his hands, and must answer with his life for the breach of those treaties which his father made so little scruple to violate. Natural affection, however, had very little place in the breast of Dermot. He expressed the utmost indifference about his son; and, with the greatest arrogance, claimed the sovereignty of all Ireland; Roderic, provoked at this answer, cut off the young prince's head.\n\nThis piece of impotent cruelty served only to make the king odious to his own subjects, while Dermot and his English allies committed everywhere the greatest devastations, and threatened to subdue the whole island. This indeed they would probably have accomplished, had not the extraordinary success of Strongbow alarmed King Henry; who, fearing that he might render himself totally independent on the crown of Britain, issued his royal edict, strictly forbidding any English vessel from passing into Ireland with men, arms, or provisions; and commanding all his subjects at that time resident in Ireland, of whatever rank or degree, to return to their country before the ensuing feast of Easter, on pain of forfeiting their lands, and being declared traitors.\n\nOur adventurers were plunged into the greatest distress by this peremptory edict. They now found themselves cut off from all supplies in the midst of their enraged enemies, and in danger of being forsaken by those who had attached themselves to them during their success. Raymond was dispatched with a most submissive message to the offended monarch; but before he received any favourable answer, everything was thrown into confusion by the death of Becket*, so that the king had neither leisure nor inclination to attend to the affairs of Ireland. About the same time the death of Dermot their great ally seemed almost to give a finishing stroke to the English affairs. An universal defection took place among their associates; and before they had time to concert any proper measures, Hefculph, who had formerly escaped from Dublin, appeared before that city with a formidable body of troops armed after the Danish manner. A furious attack ensued; which at last ended in the defeat and captivity of Hefculph, who was immediately put to death. This danger, however, was soon followed by one still greater. Roderic had formed a powerful confederacy with many of the Irish chieftains, and the kings of the northern isles, in order to extirpate the English totally from the island. The harbour of Dublin was blocked up by a fleet of 30 ships from the northern isles; while the confederated Irish took their stations in such a manner as to surround the city, and totally cut off all supplies of provisions. In two months' time the English were reduced to great straits. On the first alarm, Richard had sent for assistance to Fitz-Stephen; who having weakened his own force, in order to serve the earl, the people of Wexford had risen and besieged Fitz-Stephen in his fort called Carrig, near that city. A messenger now arrived, informing Strongbow that his friend was in the utmost danger, and must fall into the hands of his enemies if not assisted within three days; upon which a council of war was called, in order to deliberate on the measures necessary to be pursued in this desperate emergency. It was soon resolved to enter into a treaty with Roderic upon any terms that were not totally servile or opprobrious. Laurence prelate of Dublin was appointed to carry the terms; which were, that Richard proposed to acknowledge Roderic as his sovereign, and to hold the province of Leinster as his vassal, provided he would raise the siege. Laurence soon returned with an answer, probably of his own framing; namely, that Dublin, Waterford, Wexford, and all the forts possessed by the British, should be immediately given up; and that the earl and his associates should depart with all their forces by a certain day, leaving every part of the island free from their usurpations, and absolutely renouncing all their pretended claims. On these conditions they were to be spared; but the least reluctance or delay would determine the besiegers to storm the city.\n\nThese terms, though they contained nothing insolent or unreasonable, considering the present situation of the English, were yet intolerable to our indignant adventurers. After some time spent in silence, Milo de Cogan, suddenly starting up, declared his resolution to die bravely rather than submit to the mercy of barbarians. The spirit of desperate valour was instantly caught by the whole assembly; and it was resolved to risk their whole fortune on one desperate effort, by falling out against the enemy, and to make their attack upon that quarter where Roderic himself commanded. Accordingly, having persuaded a body of the townsmen to take part in this desperate enterprise, they marched out against their enemies, who they expected nothing less than such a sudden attack. The besiegers were secure and careless, without discipline or order; in consequence of which, they were unable to sustain the furious assault of the English. A terrible slaughter ensued, and the Irish instantly fled in the greatest confusion; their monarch himself escaping only by mixing half naked with the crowd. The other chieftains who were not attacked caught the panic, and broke up their camps with precipitation; while the victors returned from the pursuit to plunder, and among other advantages, gained as much provision as was sufficient to support them for a whole year.\n\nStrongbow being thus relieved from his distresses, committed the government of Dublin to Milo de Cogan, while he proceeded immediately to Wexford, in order to relieve Fitz-Stephen; but in this he was disappointed; for that brave officer, having often repulsed his enemies, was at last treacherously deceived into submission and laid in irons. Strongbow, however, continued to advance; and was again attacked by the Irish, whom he once more defeated. On his arrival at Wexford, he found it burnt to the ground; the enemy having retired with Fitz-Stephen and the rest of the prisoners to Holy Island, a small island in the middle of the harbour, from whence they sent a deputation, threatening to put all the prisoners to death if the least attempt was made to molest them in their present situation. The earl then proceeded to Waterford, and from thence to Ferns; where he for some time exercised a regal authority, rewarding his friends and punishing his enemies.\nA more important object, however, soon engaged his attention. The king of England, having settled his affairs as well as he could, now determined to conquer Ireland for himself. A summons was instantly dispatched to Earl Richard, expressing the greatest resentment at his presumption and disobedience, and requiring his immediate presence in England. The earl found himself under the necessity of obeying; and having made the best dispositions the time would permit for the security of his Irish possessions, embarked for England, and met the king at Newnham near Gloucester. Henry at first affected great displeasure; but soon allowed himself to be pacified by a surrender of the city of Dublin, and a large territory adjacent, together with all the maritime towns and forts acquired by Strongbow: while on his part he consented that the earl should have all his other possessions granted in perpetuity, to be held of the king and his heirs. The other adventurers made their peace in a similar manner; while the Irish chieftains, instead of uniting in the defence of their country, only thought how to make the most of the approaching invasion, or at least how to avert the threatened evils from their own particular districts. They saw the power of their own sovereign on the point of total dissolution; and they saw it with indifference, if not with an envious and malignant satisfaction. Some were even ready to prevent their invader, and to submit before he appeared on the coast. The men of Wexford, who had possessed themselves of Fitz-Stephen, resolved to avert the consequences of their late perfidy and cruelty, by the forwardness of their zeal for the service of the king of England, and the readiness of their submissions. Their deputies cast themselves at Henry's feet; and, with the most passionate expressions of obedience, humbly intreated that he would accept them as his faithful vassals, ready to resign themselves, their lands, and possessions, to his absolute disposal. \"They had already (they said) endeavoured to approve their zeal by feigning Robert Fitz-Stephen, a traitor to his sovereign, who had lately entered their territory by force of arms, without any due warrant or fair pretence, had slaughtered their people, seized their lands, and attempted to establish himself independent of his liege lord.\u2014They kept him in chains, and were ready to deliver him to the disposal of his sovereign.\"\u2014The king received them with expressions of the utmost grace and favour; commended their zeal in repelling the unwarrantable attempts of Fitz-Stephen; declared that he should soon inquire into his crimes, and the wrongs they had sustained, and inflict condign punishment for every offence committed by his undutiful subjects.\u2014Thus were the Irishmen dismissed in the utmost joy and exultation; and the artifice of Henry, while it inspired these men with dispositions favourable to his interests, proved also the most effectual means of saving Fitz-Stephen from their cruelty.\n\nHenry, having completed the preparations necessary for his expedition, embarked at Milford with several of his barons, 400 knights, and about 4000 soldiers, on board a fleet of 240 sail. He landed at Waterford on the feast of St Luke in October 1172; with a professed design not to conquer, but to take possession of a kingdom already his own, as being granted him by the pope. Most of the Irish indeed seemed to be of the same opinion, and therefore submitted without the least reluctance. Strongbow set them an example, by making a formal surrender of Waterford, and doing homage to the king for the territory of Leinster. Fitz-Stephen was delivered up, with many accusations of tyranny and injustice. He was at first sent to prison; but soon purchased his liberty, by surrendering Wexford, and doing homage for the rest of his possessions to the king. The prince of Desmond was the first Irish chieftain who submitted. On the very day after the king's arrival, he attended his court, resigned his claim to the city of Cork, did him homage, and stipulated to pay a tribute for the rest of his territory. An English governor and garrison were immediately appointed to take possession of his capital; and the king displayed his power and magnificence by marching to Lismore, where he chose a situation and gave the necessary orders for building a fort. The prince of Thomond next submitted and did homage. He was followed by the princes of O'Byrne, Decies, and all the inferior chiefs of Munster.\n\nThe king, after having provided for the security of all his newly acquired territories, and put garrisons in the cities of Limerick, Cork, Waterford, and Wexford, proceeded to take possession of Dublin, which had been surrendered by Strongbow. The neighbouring lords took the opportunity of submitting as he advanced. O'Carroll of Argail, a chieftain of great consequence, repaired to his camp, and engaged to become his tributary; and even O'Rourke, whom Roderic had made lord of a considerable part of Meath, voluntarily submitted to the new sovereign.\n\nRoderic, though surprised at the defection of so many of his allies, still determined to maintain his own full holds dignity, and at least preserve his province of Connaught, seeing he could no longer call himself monarch of the whole island. With this design he entrenched himself on the banks of the Shannon; and now, when disencumbered from a crowd of faithless and discontented followers, he appears to have acted with a spirit and dignity becoming his station. Hugh de Lacy and William Fitz-Andelin were commissioned by the king to reduce him; but Roderic was too strong to be attacked with any probability of success by a detachment from the English army; and he at least affected to believe, that his situation was not yet so totally desperate as to reduce him to the necessity of resigning his dignity and authority, while his own territory remained inviolate, and the brave and powerful chiefs of Ulster still kept retired in their own districts without any thoughts of submission. Henry in the meantime attempted to attach the Irish lords to his interest by elegant and magnificent entertainments, such as to them appeared quite astonishing. Some historians pretend that he established the English laws in all those parts which had submitted to his jurisdiction; but this must appear extremely improbable, when we consider how tenacious a rude and barbarous people are of their ancient laws and customs. The Irish lords had been accustomed to do homage to a superior; and they had made no submission to Henry which they had not formerly done to Roderic, and probably thought their submission to the king of England more honourable than that to their Irish monarchs; and it cannot be supposed, that a wise and politic monarch, such as Henry\nHenry undoubtedly was, should form at once such an extravagant scheme as altering the laws of a great number of communities, none of which he had subdued by force of arms. By his transactions both with the natives and adventurers, however, Henry had attained the absolute dominion of several maritime cities and their dependencies; so that he had both a considerable number of real subjects, and a large extent of territory, in the island. To these subjects indeed Henry granted the English laws; and gave the city of Dublin by charter to the inhabitants of Bristol, to be held of him and his heirs, with the same liberties and free customs which they enjoyed at Bristol, and throughout all his land. And, by another charter, executed soon after, he confirmed to his burgesses of Dublin all manner of rights and immunities throughout his whole land of England, Normandy, Wales, and Ireland, wherever they and their effects shall be, to be fully and honourably enjoyed by them as his free and faithful subjects. And as it was not easy to induce his English subjects immediately to settle in these maritime towns, he permitted the Olmten to take possession of Waterford; and to them he granted a particular right of denization, whereby they were invested with the rights and privileges of free subjects, and for the future to be governed by the laws of his realm. For the better execution of these new laws, the king also made a division of the districts now subject to him into shires or counties; which was afterwards improved and enlarged, as the extension of the English settlements and the circumstances of the country required. Sheriffs were appointed both for the counties and cities, with itinerant judges, and other ministers of justice, and officers of state, and every appendage of English government and law. To complete the whole system, a chief governor, or representative of the king, was appointed. His business was to exercise the royal authority, or such parts of it as might be committed to him in the king's absence; and, as the present state of Ireland, and the apprehensions of war or insurrections, made it necessary to guard against sudden accidents, it was provided, That in case of the death of any chief governor, the chancellor, treasurer, chief justice, and chief baron, keeper of the rolls, and king's sergeant at law, should be empowered, with consent of the nobles of the land, to elect a successor, who was to exercise the full power and authority of this office, until the royal pleasure should be further known.\n\nBut while Henry was thus regulating the government of his new dominions, he received the unwelcome news, that two cardinals, Albert and Theodine, delegated by the pope, had arrived in Normandy the year before, to make investigation into the death of Becket; that having waited the king's arrival until their patience was exhausted, they now summoned him to appear without delay, as he would avert the dreadful sentence of excommunication, and preserve his dominions from a general interdict. Such denunciations were of too great consequence to admit of his longer stay in Ireland; he therefore ordered his forces and the officers of his household to embark without delay, referring three ships for the conveyance of himself and his immediate attendants. Having therefore but a short time to secure his Irish interests, he addressed himself to the original English adventurers, and by grants and promises laboured to detach them from Strongbow, and to bind them firmly to himself. To make amends for what he had taken from Fitz-Stephen, he granted him a considerable district in the neighbourhood of Dublin, to be held by knight's service; at the same time entrusting the maritime towns to his own immediate dependants. Waterford was committed to Humphrey de Bohun, Robert Fitz-Bernard, and Hugh de Gundville, with a train of 20 knights. In Wexford were stationed William Fitz-Andelm, Philip of Hastings, and Philip de Braos, with a like number of attendants. Hugh de Lacey had a grant of all the territory of Meath, where there was no fortified place, and where, of consequence no particular reservation was necessary, to be held of the king and his heirs, by the service of 50 knights, in as full a manner as it had been enjoyed by any of the Irish princes. He also constituted him lord governor of Dublin, with a guard of 20 knights. Robert Fitz-Stephen and Maurice Fitz-Gerald were appointed his coadjutors, with an equal train; and these, with others of the first adventurers, were thus obliged, under the pretence of an honourable employment, to reside at Dublin, subject to the immediate inspection of De Lacey, in whom Henry seems to have placed his chief confidence. Lands were assigned in the neighbourhood of each city for the maintenance of the knights and soldiers. Orders were given to build a castle in Dublin, and fortresses in other convenient places; and to John de Courcy, a baron distinguished by his enterprising genius and abilities for war, was granted the whole province of Ulster, provided he could reduce it by force of arms.\n\nHenry was no sooner gone, than his barons began to contrive how they might best strengthen their own interests, and the Irish how they might best shake off the yoke to which they had so readily submitted. De Lacey parcelled out the lands of Meath to his friends and adherents, and began to erect forts to keep the old inhabitants in awe. This gave offence to O'Ruarc, who still enjoyed the eastern part of this territory as a tributary prince. He repaired to Dublin, in order to obtain redress from Laeey for some injuries real or pretended; but, as the parties could not come to an agreement, another conference was appointed on a hill called Taragh. Both parties came with a considerable train of armed followers; and the event was a scuffle, in which O'Ruarc and several of his followers were killed, and which served to render the English not a little odious to the natives.\n\nThe spirit of disaffection had soon after an opportunity of showing itself on the rebellion of King Henry's sons, of which an account is given under the article ENGLAND, No 121, et seq. The king had been obliged to weaken his forces in Ireland, by withdrawing several of his garrisons. The soldiers who remained were also discontented with their general Hervey of Mountmorris, on account of his severity in discipline, and restraining them from plunder, to which they imagined themselves entitled on account of the deficiencies of their pay. Raymond le Gros, the second in command, was much more beloved by the soldiery; and to such a height had the jealousies between the commanders arisen, that all effectual opposition...\nposition to the Irish chieftains was prevented; and the event might have been fatal to the English interest, had not Henry found out a remedy. He summoned Earl Richard to attend him at Rouen in Normandy, and communicated his intentions of committing the affairs of Ireland to his sole direction. The earl expressed the utmost readiness to serve his master; but observed, that he had already experienced the envy and malignity of his secret enemies; that if he should appear in such a distinguished character as that of the king's deputy in Ireland, their insidious practices would be renewed, and his conduct misrepresented.\u2014He therefore requested that a colleague might be appointed in the commission; and recommended Raymond as a person of approved loyalty and abilities, as well as highly acceptable to the soldiery. The king replied, with an affected air of regard and confidence, that he had his free consent to employ Raymond in any service he should deem necessary, not as a colleague, but as an assistant; but that he relied entirely on the earl himself, and implicitly trusted every thing to his direction. To reward his services, he granted him the town of Wexford, together with a fort erected at Wicklow; and then dismissed him with the most gracious expressions of favour.\n\nThe earl landed at Dublin, where he was received with all the respect due to the royal commission. He signified the king's pleasure, that Robert Fitz-Bernard, with the garrison of Waterford, should instantly embark and repair to Normandy; that Robert Fitz-Stephen and Maurice Pendergaff should attend the service of their sovereign in England; and, agreeably to the king's instructions, took on him the custody of the cities of Dublin, Waterford, and Wexford. Hugh de Lacey and Milo de Cogan were, with the other lords, commanded to repair to England for the service of the king; by which the earl's forces were considerably weakened, and he soon found himself under the necessity of appointing Raymond to the chief command. The new general proved successful in some enterprises against the rebellious Irish; but having presumed upon his merits to demand in marriage Basilia the earl's sister, Richard refused his consent, and Raymond retired into Wales.\n\nThus the supreme command again devolved upon Hervey of Mountmorris; who, being sensible that his character had suffered much from a comparison with that of Raymond, determined to emulate his successes by some bold attempt against the rebels. A detachment of 400 of his men, however, had the misfortune to be surprised and cut off by the enemy; and this success served as a signal for a general revolt. Several of the Leinster chieftains, who had lately made their submissions, and bound themselves to the service of King Henry, now openly disclaimed all engagements. Even Donald Kavanagh, son to the late King Dermot, who had hitherto adhered to the English in their greatest difficulties, now declared against them, and claimed a right to the kingdom of Leinster; while Roderic, on his part, was active in uniting the princes of Ulster, the native lords of Meath, and other chiefs, against their common enemy. This produced the immediate recall of Raymond; and Richard no longer refused his consent to the marriage with his sister, which was solemnized immediately on Raymond's arrival. The very next morning, the bridegroom was obliged to take the field against Roderic, who had committed great devastations in Meath. By the vigorous conduct of the English commander, however, he was not only prevented from doing farther mischief, but at last convinced of the folly of resistance; and Roderic therefore determined to make a final submission. Yet, to King conscious of his dignity, he declined to submit to Henry subject; and therefore, instead of treating with Earl Richard, he sent deputies directly to the king. The deputies were, Catholicus archbishop of Tuam, the abbot of St Brandan, and Master Lawrence as he is styled, chancellor to the king of Connaught.\n\nThe terms of this submission, by which Henry became sole monarch of Ireland, were as follow: Roderic consented to do homage and pay tribute, as liege-man to the king of England; on which condition he was allowed to hold the kingdom of Connaught, as well as his other lands and sovereignties, in as ample a manner as he had enjoyed them before the arrival of Henry in Ireland. His vassals were to hold under him in peace, as long as they paid their tribute and continued faithful to the king of England; in which Roderic was to enforce their due obedience, and for this purpose to call to his affluence the English government, if necessary. The annual tribute to be paid was every tenth merchantable hide, as well from Connaught as from the rest of the island; excepting those parts under the immediate dominion of the king of England and his barons, viz. Dublin and Meath with their appurtenances, Wexford and all Leinster, and Waterford with its lands, as far as Dungarvan inclusive; in all which districts Roderic was not to interfere, nor claim any power or authority.\u2014The Irish who had fled from these districts were to return, and either pay their tribute, or perform the services required by their tenures, at the option of their immediate lords; and, if refractory, Roderic, at the requisition of their lords, was to compel them to return. He was to take hostages from his vassals, such as he and his liege-lord should think proper; and on his part to deliver either these or others to the king, according to the royal pleasure. His vassals were to furnish hawks and hounds annually to the English monarch; and were not to detain any tenant of his immediate demesnes in Ireland, contrary to his royal pleasure and command. This treaty was solemnly ratified in a grand council of prelates and temporal barons, among whom we find the archbishop of Dublin one of the subscribing witnesses. As metropolitan of Leinster, he was now become an English subject, and was probably summoned on this occasion as one obliged to attend, and who had a right to assist in the king's great council. It is also observable, that Henry now treated with Roderic not merely as a provincial prince, but as monarch of Ireland. This is evidently implied and supposed in the articles; although his monarchical powers and privileges were little more than nominal, frequently disregarded and opposed by the Irish toparchs. Even by their submissions to Henry, many of them in effect disavowed and renounced the sovereignty of Roderic; but now his supremacy seems to be indubitably acknowledged, that the present submission might appear virtually the submission of all the subordinate princes, and thus the king\nIreland. king of England be invested with the sovereignty of the whole island. The marks of sovereignty, however, were no more than homage and tribute; in every other particular the regal rights of Roderic were left inviolate. The English laws were only to be enforced in the English pale: and, even there, the Irish tenant might live in peace, as the subject of the Irish monarch; bound only to pay his quota of tribute, and not to take arms against the king of England.\n\nBut though the whole island of Ireland thus became subject to the king of England, it was far from being settled in tranquillity, or indeed from having the situation of its inhabitants mended almost in any degree. One great occasion of disturbance was, that the English laws were confined only to those parts which had been subdued by force of arms: while the chieftains that had only submitted to pay tribute, were allowed to retain the ancient Irish laws within the limits of their own jurisdictions. By these old Irish laws, many crimes accounted capital with us, such as robbery, murder, &c., might be compensated by a sum of money. Hence it happened, that very unequal punishments were inflicted for the same offence. If one Englishman killed another, he was punished with death; but if he killed an Irishman, he was punished only by a fine. If an Irishman, on the other hand, killed an Englishman, he was certainly punished with death: and as in times of violence and outrage, the crime of murder was very frequent, the circumstance just mentioned tended to produce an implacable hatred between the original inhabitants and the English. As the Irish laws were thus more favourable to the barbarity natural to the tempers of some individuals, many of the English were also tempted to lay aside the manners and customs of their countrymen altogether, and to associate themselves with the Irish, that, by becoming subject to their laws, they might thus have an opportunity of gratifying their brutal inclinations with less controul than formerly; and in process of time, these degenerate English, as they were called, proved more bitter enemies to their countrymen than even the Irish themselves.\n\nAnother cause of the distresses of Ireland was, the great power of the English barons, among whom Henry had divided the greatest part of his Irish dominions. The extent of their authority only inflamed them with a desire for more; and, instead of contributing their endeavours to increase the power of their sovereign, or to civilize the barbarous people over whom they were placed, they did every thing in their power to counteract and destroy each other. Henry himself, indeed, seems to have been infected with a very fatal jealousy in this respect; for, though the abilities and fidelity of Raymond had abundantly manifested themselves, the king never could allow himself to continue him in the government of the island: and the consequence of degrading him never failed to be a scene of uproar and confusion. To these two reasons we must likewise add another: namely, that in those parts of the kingdom where the Irish chieftains enjoyed the sovereignty, they were at full liberty to make war upon each other as formerly, without the least restraint. This likewise induced many of the English to degenerate, that they might have an opportunity of sharing the plunder got by these petty wars; so that, on the whole, the island was a perpetual scene of horror, almost unequalled in the history of any country.\n\nAfter the death of Earl Richard, Raymond was immediately elected to succeed him; but was superseded by the king, who appointed William Fitz-Andelm, a nobleman allied to Raymond, to succeed in his place. The new governor had neither inclination nor abilities to perform the task assigned to him. He was of a rapacious temper, sensual and corrupt in his manners; and therefore only studied to enrich himself. The native Irish, provoked by some depredations of the English, commenced hostilities: but Fitz-Andelm, instead of repelling these with vigour in the beginning, treated the chieftains with affected courtesy and flattery. This they had sufficient discernment to see, and to despise; while the original adventurers had the burden of the whole defence of the English pale, as the English territories were called, thrown upon them, at the same time that the bad conduct of the governor was the cause of perpetual disorders. The consequence of this was, that the lords avowed their hatred of Fitz-Andelm: the followers were mutinous, ill-appointed, and unpaid: and the Irish came in crowds to the governor with perpetual complaints against the old adventurers, which were always decided against the latter; and this decision increased their confidence, without lessening their disaffection.\n\nIn this unfavourable state of affairs, John de Courcy, a bold adventurer, who had as yet reaped none of the benefits he expected, resolved to undertake an expedition against the natives, in order to enrich himself with their spoils. The Irish at that time were giving no offence; and therefore pleaded the treaty lately concluded with King Henry: but treaties were of little avail, when put in competition with the necessities of an indigent and rapacious adventurer. The consequence was, that the flame of war was kindled through the whole island. The chieftains took advantage of the war with the English, to commence hostilities against each other. Desmond and Thomond, in the southern province, were distracted by the jealousies of contending chiefs, and the whole land was wasted by unnatural and bloody quarrels. Treachery and murder were revenged by practices of the same kind, in such a manner as to perpetuate a succession of outrages the most horrid and the most disgraceful to humanity. The northern province was a scene of like enormities; though the new English settlers, who were considered as a common enemy, ought to have united the natives among themselves. All were equally strangers to the virtues of humanity; nor was religion, in the form it then assumed, capable of restraining these violences in the least.\n\nIreland was thus in a short time reduced to such a state, that Henry perceived the necessity of recalling Fitz-Andelm, and appointing another governor. He was recalled accordingly; and Hugh de Lacy appointed to succeed him. He left his government without being regretted, and is said by the historians of those times to have done only one good action during the whole course of his administration. This action was nothing more important, than the removing of a relic, called the staff of St. Patrick, from the cathedral of Armagh to that of Dublin; probably that it might be...\nbe in greater safety, as the war raged violently in Ulster. De Lacey, however, was a man of a quite different disposition, and every way qualified for the difficult government with which he was invested; but at the same time, the king, by investing his son John with the lordship of Ireland, gave occasion to greater disturbances than even those which had already happened. The nature of this lordship hath been much disputed; but the most probable opinion is, that the king's son was now to be invested with all the rights and powers which had formerly belonged to Roderic, who was allowed the title of king of Ireland. It doth not appear, indeed, that Henry had any right to deprive Roderic of these powers, and still less had he to dispose of any of the territories of those chieftains who had agreed to become his tributaries; which nevertheless he certainly did, and which failed not to be productive of an immediate war with these chiefs.\n\nThe new governor entered on his office with all that spirit and vigour which was necessary; but being misrepresented to the king by some factious barons, he was in a short time recalled, and two others, totally unfit for the government, appointed in his room. This error was soon corrected, and Lacey was replaced in three months. The same jealousy which produced his first degradation, soon produced a second; and Philip de Braola, or Philip of Worcester as he is called, a man of a most avaricious disposition, was appointed to succeed him. This governor behaved in such a manner, that his superstitious subjects expected every moment that the vengeance of heaven would fall upon him, and deliver them from his tyranny. His power, however, was of short duration; for now Prince John prepared to exercise the authority with which his father had invested him in Ireland. He was attended by a considerable military force; his train was formed of a company of gallant Normans in the pride of youth; but luxurious, insolent, and followed by a number of Englishmen, strangers to the country they were to visit, desperate in their fortunes, accustomed to a life of profligacy, and filled with great expectations of advantage from their present service. The whole assembly embarked in a fleet of 60 ships; and arrived at Waterford after a prosperous voyage, filling the whole country with the greatest surprize and expectation.\n\nThe young prince had not yet arrived at the years of discretion; nor indeed, from his subsequent conduct, doth it appear that his disposition was such as qualified him in the least for the high dignity to which he was raised. The hardly Welshmen who first migrated into Ireland, immediately waited upon him to do him homage; but they were disagreeable to the gay courtiers, and to the prince himself, who minded nothing but his pleasures. The Irish lords were at first terrified by the magnificent representation of the force of the English army; and being reconciled to submission by the dignity of the prince's station, hastened in crowds to Waterford to do him homage. They exhibited a spectacle to the Norman courtiers, which the latter did not fail to treat with contempt and ridicule. The Irish lords, with uncoated attire, thick bushy beards, and hair standing on end, advanced with very little ceremony; and, according to their own notions of respect, offered to kiss the young prince. His attendants stepped in, and prevented this horrid violation of decency by thrusting away the Irishmen. The whole assembly burst into peals of laughter, pulled the beards, and committed several other indignities on the persons of their guests; which were immediately and fiercely resented. The chieftains left the court, boiling with indignation; and meeting others of their countrymen halting to do homage to the prince, they informed them of the reception they themselves had met with. A league was instantly formed to extirpate the English, and the revolt of the whole nation flew to arms; while John and his courtiers, instead of opposing the enemy, employed themselves in harrying and oppressing those who were under their immediate jurisdiction. The country was therefore overrun by the barbarians, agriculture entirely neglected, and a dreadful famine threatened to follow the calamities of war.\n\nThis terrible devastation had continued for eight months before the king was fully acquainted with it. He then determined to recall his son; but was at a loss whom he should name for his successor. Lacey had been murdered by an Irish peasant, and the king was at last obliged to have recourse to John de Courcy, whose boisterous valour seemed now to be absolutely necessary to prevent the English from being totally exterminated. The new governor was obliged at first to suppress the league, and began their usual hostilities against Courcy; each other, he was at last enabled to maintain the authority of the English government, and to support their acquisitions in Ireland, though not to extend them.\n\nIn this situation were the affairs of Ireland when Miserable Henry II. died, and was succeeded by his son Richard I. The new king was determined on an expedition to the holy land, which left him no leisure to attend to the affairs of Ireland. John, by virtue of the powers granted him by his father, took upon him the management of Irish affairs; and immediately degraded De Courcy from his government, appointing in his place Hugh de Lacey the younger. De Courcy, provoked at this indignity, retired into Ulster, where he was immediately engaged in a furious war with the natives, and at last almost entirely detached himself from the English government. The greatest confusion ensued: Hugh de Lacey was recalled from his government, and William Petit earl marshal of England appointed in his place. Petit's administration proved more unfortunate than that of any of his predecessors. Confederacies everywhere took place against the English; the latter were everywhere defeated, their towns taken; and their power would certainly have been annihilated, had not the Irish, as usual, turned their arms against each other.\n\nIn this desperate situation matters continued during the whole reign of King Richard, and part of the reign of John, while the difficulties of the country were increased by the dissensions and disaffection of the English lords, who aspired at independency, and made war upon each other like Irish chieftains. The prudent conduct of a governor named Melet Fitz-Henry, how better never, at last put an end to these terrible commotions; and about the year 1228, the kingdom was more quiet than it had been for a long time before. In 1210, John came over to Ireland in person with an army,\narmy, with a design, as he said, to reduce his refractory nobles to a sense of their duty. More than 25 Irish chiefs waited upon him immediately to do him homage; while three of the English barons, Hugh and Walter de Lacy and William de Braofa, fled to France. The king, at the desire of his Irish subjects, granted them, for their information, a regular code and charter of laws, to be deposited in the exchequer of Dublin, under the king's seal. For the regular and effectual execution of these laws, besides the establishment of the king's courts of judicature in Dublin, there was now made a new and more ample division of the king's lands of Ireland into counties, where sheriffs, and many other officers, were appointed. These counties were, Dublin, Meath, Kildare, Argail, now called Louth, Kilkenny, Wexford, Waterford, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary; which marks the extent of the English dominions at this time as confined to a part of Leinster and Munster, and to those parts of Meath and Argail which lie in the province of Ulster as now defined. Before his departure, the king gave liberty to John de Grey, bishop of Norwich, whom he appointed governor, to coin money of the same weight with that of England; and which, by royal proclamation, was made current in England as well as Ireland.\n\nThis ecclesiastical governor is said to have managed affairs so happily, that during the violent contests between John and his barons, Ireland enjoyed an unusual degree of tranquillity. We are not to imagine, however, that this unhappy country was at this or indeed any other period, till the end of Queen Elizabeth's reign, perfectly free from disorders, only they were confined to those districts most remote from the English government. In 1219, the commotions were renewed, through the insuperable ambition and contentions of the English barons, who despised all control, and oppressed the inhabitants in a terrible manner. The disorders in England during the reign of Henry III. encouraged them to despise the royal authority; they were ever the secret enemies, and sometimes the avowed adversaries, of each other; and in many places where they had obtained settlements, the natives were first driven into insurrections by their cruelty, and then punished with double cruelty for their resistance. The English laws, which tended to punish the authors of these outrages, were scorned by an imperious aristocratic faction, who, in the frenzy of rapine and ambition, trampled on the most salutary institutions. In 1228, a remonstrance was presented to the king against this dangerous neglect and suspension of the laws; which he answered by a mandate to the chief governor, directing that the whole body of nobility, knights, free tenants, and bailiffs of the several counties, should be convened; that the charter of English laws and customs received from King John, and to which they were bound by oath, should be read over in their presence; that they should be directed for the future strictly to observe and adhere to these; and that proclamation should be made in every county of Ireland, strictly enjoining obedience, on pain of forfeiture of lands and tenements. How little effect was produced by this order, we may learn from another, dated in 1246; where the barons are commanded, for the peace and tranquillity of the land, to permit it to be governed by the laws of England.\n\nNothing indeed can be conceived more terrible than the state of Ireland during the reign of Henry III., depravation of people of all ranks appear to have been sunk in the lowest degree of depravity. The powerful English lords not only subverted the peace and security of the people, by refusing to admit the salutary laws of their own country, but behaved with the utmost injustice and violence to the natives who did not enjoy the benefits of the English constitution. The clergy appear to have been equally abandoned with the rest: nor indeed could it be otherwise; for through the partialities of Henry himself, the neglected, the worthless, and the depraved among the English clergy, found refuge in the church of Ireland. What were the manners of these clergy, will appear from the following petition of a widow to King Edward I.\n\n\"Margaret le Blunde, of Cashel, petitions our lord the king's grace, that she may have her inheritance which she recovered at Cloonmell before the king's judges, &c., against David Macmackerway bishop of Cashel.\n\n\"Item, the said Margaret petitions redress on account that her father was killed by the said bishop.\n\n\"Item, for the imprisonment of her grandfather and mother, whom he shut up and detained in prison until they perished by famine, because they attempted to seek redress for the death of their son, father of your petitioner, who had been killed by the said bishop.\n\n\"Item, for the death of her six brothers and sisters, who were starved to death by the said bishop, because he had their inheritance in his hands at the time he killed their father.\n\n\"And it is to be noted, that the said bishop had built an abbey in the city of Cashel, on the king's lands granted for this purpose, which he hath filled with robbers, who murder the English, and depopulate the country; and that when the council of our lord the king attempts to take cognizance of the offence, he fulminates the sentence of excommunication against them.\n\n\"It is to be noted also, that the said Margaret has five times crossed the Irish sea. Wherefore, the petitions for God's sake, that the king's grace will have compassion, and that she may be admitted to take possession of her inheritance.\n\n\"It is further to be noted, that the aforesaid bishop hath been guilty of the death of many other Englishmen besides that of her father; and that the aforesaid Margaret hath many times obtained writs of our lord the king, but to no effect, by reason of the influence and bribery of the said bishop.\n\n\"She further petitions, for God's sake, that she may have costs and damages, &c.\"\n\nMatters continued in the same deplorable state during the reign of Edward I., with this additional grievance, that the kingdom was infested by invasions of the Scots. The English monarch indeed possessed all ward that prudence and valour which were necessary to have reduced the island to a state of tranquillity; but his project of conquering Scotland left him but little leisure to attend to the distracted state of Ireland. Certain it\nIreland, however, that the grievous distresses of that country gave him great uneasiness; so that he transmitted his mandate to the prelates of Ireland, requiring them to interpose their spiritual authority for composing the public disorders. About the same time, the Irish who lay contiguous to the English, and who dwelt among them, presented a petition to the king, offering to pay him 8000 marks, upon condition that they were admitted to the privileges of English subjects. To this petition he returned a favourable answer; but his good intentions were defeated by the licentious nobility, who knew that these laws would have circumcised their rapacious views, and controll'd their violence and oppression. Petitions of the same kind were several times repeated during this reign, but as often defeated; though some means were used for the peace of the kingdom, such as the frequent calling of parliaments, appointing sheriffs in some new counties, &c.\n\nThese means were not altogether without effect. They served to give some check to the disorders of the realm, though by no means to terminate or subdue them. The incursions of the natives were repressed, and the English lords began to live on better terms with each other; and, in 1311, under Edward II., the most powerful of them were reconciled by the marriage of Maurice and Thomas Fitz-John, afterwards the heads of the illustrious houses of Desmond and Kildare, to two daughters of the earl of Ulster. But just at this happy period, when the nation seemed to have some prospect of tranquillity, more dreadful calamities than any hitherto related were about to take place. The Scots had just recovered their liberty under Robert Bruce, and were now in no danger of being again enslaved by a foreign power. Edward, the king's brother, as a recompense for his services, demanded a share of the royal authority. This was refused by Robert, and Edward was for the present satisfied by being declared heir apparent to the crown. But the king, wisely considering the necessity of finding out some employment for a youth of such an aspiring and ambitious disposition, pointed out to his brother the island of Ireland, the conquest of which would be easy, on account of the distracted state in which it almost always was, and which would make him an independent sovereign. This proposal was eagerly embraced by Edward, and every thing necessary for the expedition immediately got ready. On the 25th of May 1315, he landed on the north-eastern coast of Ireland with 6000 men, to assert his claim to the sovereignty of this kingdom. The Irish lords of Ulster, who had invited and encouraged him to this enterprise, were now prepared to receive their new monarch, flocked with eagerness to his standard, and prepared to wreak their vengeance on the common enemy. Their progress was marked by desolation and carnage. The English settlers were slaughtered, or driven from their possessions, their castles levelled with the ground, and their towns set on fire. The English lords were neither prepared to resist the invasion, nor sufficiently united among themselves. The consequence was, that the enemy for some time met with no interruption. An intolerable scarcity of provisions, however, prevented Bruce from pursuing his advantages; and though his brother landed in Ireland with a powerful army, the famine prevented him from being of any essential service. The forces which he left behind him, however, proved of considerable advantage; and by means of this reinforcement, he was enabled to take the city of Carrickfergus.\n\nThe terrible devastations committed by Bruce and his associates, now induced some English lords to enter into an association to defend their possessions, and repel the invaders. For this purpose, they raised a considerable body of forces; which coming to an engagement with Fedlim prince of Connaught, one of Bruce's principal allies, entirely defeated and killed him with 8000 of his men. This defeat, however, had very little effect on the operations of Bruce himself. He ravaged the country to the walls of Dublin, traversed the district of Offaly, and penetrated into Munster, destroying every thing with fire and sword. The English continued to augment their army, till at last it amounted to 30,000 men; and then Bruce, no longer able to oppose such a force, found it necessary to retire into the province of Ulster. His retreat was effected with great difficulty; and during the time of his inactivity, the distresses of his army increased to such a degree, that they are said to have fed upon the bodies of their dead companions. At last an end was put to the sufferings and the life of this adventurer in the battle of Dundalk, in 1318, where he was defeated and killed by the English under Sir Robert Birmingham. A brave English knight, named Maupas, had rushed forward to encounter Bruce himself, and both antagonists had killed each other; the body of Maupas being found, after the battle, stretched upon that of Bruce. The king of Scotland had been advancing with powerful succours to his brother; but Edward, confident of victory, refused to wait his arrival; and Robert, on hearing of his brother's death, instantly retired.\n\nThe defeat of the Scottish invaders did not put an end to the disturbances of this unhappy country. The contentions of the English with one another, of the Irish with the English, and among themselves, still kept the island in a state of the utmost barbarity and confusion. An attempt was made indeed, in the reign of Edward II., to establish an university in Dublin; but for want of proper encouragement the institution for some time languished, and then expired amidst the confusion and anarchy of the country. The reign of Edward III. proved not much more favourable than preceding times had been. He was too much taken up with the idea of conquering France, to pay much regard to the interests of Ireland. The unhappy people, indeed, sensible of their own miseries, petitioned the king to admit all his subjects in Ireland to a participation of the English laws; but the petition being delivered as usual to the chief governor, and laid before the parliament, it was either clandestinely defeated or openly rejected. A new scene of tumult and bloodshed immediately ensued; which at last produced an order from the king, prohibiting all Irishmen, or Englishmen married and having estates in Ireland, from bearing any public office whatever.\u2014This, instead of having a tendency to promote peace, made the disorder much greater than before; and at last produced a remonstrance from the states met at Kilkenny, in which they grievously complain not only\nIreland. of the disorders of the kingdom, but also of the conduct of the king himself in the edict above-mentioned; and to this remonstrance the king thought proper to give a gracious and condescending answer, in order to procure from Ireland the succours he wanted in his expedition against France.\n\nIt is not to be supposed, that mere promises, unassisted by any vigorous exertion, could make the least alteration in the state of a kingdom involved in so much misery. The disorders, however, at last became insupportable to the inhabitants themselves; and a parliament was summoned in 1368, the result of which was the famous statute of Kilkenny. The preamble to this act recites, that the English had become more Irish in their language, names, apparel, and manner of living; had rejected the English laws, and submitted to those of the Irish, with whom they had united by marriage-alliance, to the ruin of the commonwealth.\n\n\u2014It was therefore enacted, that marriage, nurture of infants, &c., with the Irish, should be considered and punished as high treason.\u2014Again, if any man of English race shall use an Irish name, the Irish language, or the Irish apparel, or any mode or custom of the Irish, the act provides, that he shall forfeit lands and tenements, until he hath given security in the court of chancery to conform in every particular to the English manners; or if he have no lands, that he shall be imprisoned till the like security be given. The Brehon law was pronounced to be a pernicious custom and innovation lately introduced among the English subjects; and it was therefore ordained, that in all their controversies they should be governed by the common law of England; and that whoever should submit to the Irish jurisdiction should be adjudged guilty of high treason. As the English had been accustomed to make war or peace with the bordering Irish at pleasure, they were now expressly prohibited from levying war without special warrant from the state.\u2014It was also made highly penal for the English to permit their Irish neighbours to graze their lands, to present them to ecclesiastical benefices, or to receive them into monasteries or religious houses; to entertain their bards, who perverted their imaginations by romantic tales; or their news-tellers, who seduced them by false reports.\u2014It was made felony to impose or cease any forces upon the English subject against his will. And as the royal liberties and franchises were become sanctuaries for malefactors, express power was given to the king's sheriffs to enter into all franchises, and there to apprehend felons and traitors.\u2014Lastly, because the great lords, when they levied forces for the public service, acted with partiality, and laid unequal burdens upon the subjects, it was ordained that four wardens of the peace in every county should adjudge what men and armour every lord or tenant should provide.\u2014The statute was promulgated with particular solemnity; and the spiritual lords, the better to enforce obedience, denounced an excommunication on those who should presume to violate it in any instance.\n\nThis statute, it is evident, could not tend to promote the peace of the kingdom. This could only have been done by removing the animosity between the native Irish and English; but so far was the statute of Kilkenny from having any tendency of this kind, that it manifestly tended to increase the hatred between them. During the whole of this reign, therefore, the state of the Irish government continued to be greatly disordered and embroiled. The English interest gradually declined; and the connections of the king's subjects with the original inhabitants, occasioned by their vicinity and necessary intercourse, in despite of all legal injunctions, obliged the king to relax the severity of the statutes of Kilkenny, in cases where they proved impracticable, or oppressive in the execution. The perpetual hostility, however, in which the different parties lived, proved an effectual bar to the introduction of those arts which contribute to the comfort and refinement of mankind. Even foreign merchants could not venture into such a dangerous country without particular letters of protection from the throne. The perpetual succession of new adventurers from England, led by interest or necessity, served only to inflame dissension, instead of introducing any essential improvement. Lawyers sent from England were notoriously insufficient, if not corrupt; and, as such, had frequently been the objects of complaint. The clergy were a mean grovelling race, totally influenced by the crown. Even prelates were commonly made the inferior agents of government in collecting forces, and raising war against the Irish enemy; but were not to be enticed into this service, except by remittances from the exchequer. Attendance in parliament they dreaded as the greatest hardship; and either recurred to mean excuses to avert the penalty of absence, or sued to the king to be exempted by patent from contributing or attending to those laws by which they were to be governed.\n\nIn this deplorable situation the kingdom continued Power till the time of Henry VII, who laid the foundation of the future civilization of the Irish, as he also did of the English nation. This he effected by enacting some very salutary laws, and appointing faithful and active governors to see them put in execution. Of these governors Sir Edward Poyning contributed more than any other to the tranquillity of the state. During his administration was enacted the law known by the name of Poyning's Law, and which henceforth became the subject of much political debate. The purport of it was, Poyning's That no parliament should be held in that island without first giving notice to the king of England, and acquainting him with the acts to be passed in that parliament; neither should any act passed, or any parliament held, without the approbation of the king and council, be deemed valid. Thus was the power of the turbulent barons greatly broken; and the governor, not having it in his power to assemble parliaments when he pleased, became a person of much less consequence. The whole Irish legislation also became dependent on that of England, and hath ever since continued to be so.\n\nFrom this time we may date the revival of the English power in Ireland; which from the Scottish war in the time of Edward II, had gradually declined into a miserable and precarious state of weakness. The authority of the crown, which had at last been despised, insulted, and rejected, even in the English territory, was restored and confirmed, and the rebellious vigorously opposed and suppressed. The feigning of the British crown over the whole body of the Irish, which\nIreland in former reigns seemed to have been totally forgotten, was now formally claimed and affected, and some of the most ferocious chieftains by their marriage-connections became the avowed friends of the English power. An ignominious tribute, called the Black Rent, was indeed still paid to some chieftains; but their hostilities were opposed and chastised, and even in their own districts they were made to feel the superiority of English government.\n\nDuring the reign of Henry VIII., the Irish affairs were neglected; and the disorders, which had only been checked, and never thoroughly eradicated, returned as usual. They were further promoted by the innovations in religion which the king introduced, and which were exceedingly disagreeable both to English and Irish. The Reformation, however, continued to make some progress, though slowly, during the reign of Edward VI. and even in the reign of Queen Mary; for as the persecution did not reach thither, many Protestants fled to Ireland in order to avoid the queen's cruelty. The machinations of the Spaniards against Queen Elizabeth excited the Irish to fresh insurrections. The king of Spain, indeed, not only encouraged the natives in these insurrections, but actually sent over troops to assist them in driving out the English altogether. This they had well effected; but the Spaniards, upon seeing an army of Irish defeated by a handful of their enemies, were so much provoked that they surrendered all the places they had made themselves masters of, and even offered to assist the English in reducing the rebels; though it was not thought proper to accept of their assistance. The consequence of this was, that the Irish, abandoned by these allies, were unable to carry on the war; and the grand rebel O'Neal of Tirowen, or Tyrone, after much treachery, evasion, and many pretended submissions, was at last obliged to submit in good earnest. He fell upon his knees before the deputy, and petitioned for mercy with an air and aspect of distress. He subscribed his submission in the most ample manner and form. He implored the queen's gracious commiseration; and humbly sued to be restored to his dignity, and the state of a subject, which he had justly forfeited. He utterly renounced the name of O'Neal, which he had assumed on account of the great veneration in which it was held among the Irish. He abjured all foreign power, and all dependency except on the crown of England; resigned all claim to any lands except such as should be conferred upon him by letters patent; promising at the same time to assist the state in abolishing all barbarous customs and establishing law and civility among his people. The lord deputy, on the part of the queen, promised a full pardon to him and all his followers; to himself the restoration of his blood and honours, with a new patent for his lands, except some portions reserved for certain chieftains received into favour, and some for the use of English garrisons.\n\nNo insurgent now remained in this kingdom who had not obtained or sued for mercy. Many, indeed, were driven by necessity to the continent, and earned a subsistence by serving in the armies of Spain; and thus a race of Irish exiles was trained to arms, filled with a malignant resentment against the English. Thus, the honour of reducing all the enemies of the crown of England in this island, after a continued contest for 440 years, was referred to the arms of Elizabeth. The ghastliness of famine and desolation was now somewhat enlivened by the restoration of tranquillity. Indeed, from the most authentic accounts, the prices of provisions were so high, that considering the value of money at that time, it is surprising how the inhabitants could subsist. From an account of the rates of provisions taken by the mayor of Dublin in 1622, it appears, That wheat had risen from 3s. to 9s. the quarter; barley-malt from 10s. to 43s. the barrel; oat-malt from 5s. to 22s. the barrel; pease from 5s. to 40s. the peck; oats from 3s. 4d. to 20s. the barrel; beef from 26s. 8d. to 8l. the carcass; mutton from 3s. to 26s. the carcass; veal from 10s. to 20s. the carcass; a lamb from 12l. to 6s.; a pork from 8s. to 20s.\n\nUnder James I. Ireland began to assume a quite different appearance. That monarch valued himself upon promoting the arts of peace, and made it his study to civilize his barbarous Irish subjects. By repeated conspiracies and rebellions, a vast tract of land had been ceded to the crown in five northern counties, Tyrconnel, now called Donegal, Tyrone, Derry, Fermanagh, Cavan, and Armagh, amounting to about 500,000 acres; a tract of country covered with woods, where rebels and banditti found a secure refuge, and which was destined to lie waste without the timely interposition of government. James resolved to dispose of these lands in such a manner as might introduce all the happy consequences of peace and cultivation. He caused surveys to be taken of the several counties where the new settlements were to be established; described particularly the state of each; pointed out the situations proper for the erection of towns and castles; delineated the characters of the Irish chieftains, the manner in which they should be treated, the temper and circumstances of the old inhabitants, the rights of the new purchasers, and the claims of both; together with the impediments to former plantations, and the methods of removing them.\n\nAt his instance it was resolved, that the persons to whom lands were assigned should be either new undertakers from Great Britain, especially from Scotland, or servitors, as they were called; that is, men who had for some time served in Ireland, either in civil or military offices; or old Irish chieftains or captains. Among the last were included even those Irish who had engaged in the rebellion of Tyrone, and still harboured their secret discontent. To gain them, if possible, by favour and lenity, they were treated with particular indulgence. Their under-tenants and servants were allowed to be of their own religion; and, while all the other planters were obliged to take the oath of allegiance, they were tacitly excepted. The servitors were allowed to take their tenants either from Ireland or Britain, provided no Popish recusants were admitted. The British undertakers were confined to their own countrymen.\n\nIn the plantations which had been formerly attempted, the Irish and English had been mixed together, from a fond imagination that the one would have learned civility and industry from the other. But experience had now discovered, that this intercourse served only to make the Irish envy the superior comforts of their\ntheir English neighbours, and to take the advantage of a free access to their houses to steal their goods and plot against their lives. It was therefore deemed necessary to plant them in separate quarters; and in the choice of these situations, the errors of former times were carefully corrected. The original English adventurers, on their first settlement in Ireland, were captivated by the fair appearance of the plain and open districts. Here they erected their castles and habitations; and forced the old natives into the woods and mountains, their natural fortresses. There they kept themselves unknown, living by the milk of their kine, without husbandry or tillage; there they increased to incredible numbers by promiscuous generation; and there they held their assemblies, and formed their conspiracies without discovery. But now the northern Irish were placed in the most open and accessible parts of the country, where they might lie under the close inspection of their neighbours, and be gradually habituated to agriculture and the mechanic arts. To the British adventurers were assigned places of the greatest strength and command; to the servitors, stations of the greatest danger, and greatest advantage to the crown: but as this appeared a peculiar hardship, they were allowed guards and entertainment, until the country should be quietly and completely planted.\n\nThe experience of ages had shown the inconvenience of enormous grants to particular lords, attended with such privileges as obstructed the administration of civil government; and even in the late reign, favourite undertakers had been gratified with such portions of land as they were by no means able to plant. But, by the present scheme, the lands to be planted were divided in three different proportions; the greatest to consist of 2000 English acres, the least of 1000, and the middle of 1500. One half of the eleventh lands in each county was assigned to the smallest, the other moiety divided between the other proportions; and the general distributions being thus ascertained, to prevent all disputes between the undertakers, their settlements in the respective districts were to be determined by lot. Estates were assigned to all, to be held of them and their heirs. The undertakers of 2000 acres were to hold of the king in capite; those of 1500, by knights service; those of 1000, in common socage. The first were to build a castle, and inclose a strong court-yard or bawn as it was called, within four years; the second, to finish an house and bawn within two years; and the third, to inclose a bawn; for even this rude species of fortification was accounted no inconsiderable defence against an Irish enemy. The first were to plant upon their lands, within three years, 48 able men of English or Scottish birth, to be reduced to 20 families; to keep a demesne of 600 acres in their own hands; to have four free farmers on 120 acres each; six lease-holders, each on 100 acres; and on the rest, eight families of husbandmen, artificers, and cottagers. The others were under the like obligations proportionally. All were, for five years after the date of their patents, to reside upon their lands either in person, or by such agents as should be approved by the state, and to keep a sufficient quantity of arms for their defence. The British and servitors were not to alienate their lands to mere Irish, or to demise any portions of them to such persons as should refuse to take the oaths to government; they were to let them at determined rents, and for no shorter term than 21 years or three lives. The houses of their tenants were to be built after the English fashion, and united together in towns or villages. They had power to erect manors, to hold courts-baron, and to create tenures. The old natives, whose tenures were granted in fee-simple, to be held in socage, were allowed the like privileges. They were enjoined to let their lands at certain rents, and for the like terms as the other undertakers; to take no Irish exactions from their inferior tenants, and to oblige them to forfeit their old Scythian custom of wandering with their cattle from place to place for pasture, or creaghting as they called it; to dwell in towns, and conform to the English manner of tillage and husbandry. An annual rent from all the lands was reserved to the crown for every 65 English acres, six shillings and eight pence from the undertakers, ten shillings from servitors, and 13 shillings and four pence from Irish natives. But for two years they were exempt from such payments, except the natives, who were not subject to the charge of transportation. What gave particular credit to this undertaking, was the capital part which the city of London was persuaded to take in it. The corporation accepted of large grants in the county of Derry; they engaged to expend L. 20,000 on the plantation, to build the cities of Derry and Colerain, and stipulated for such privileges as might make their settlements convenient and respectable. As a competent force was necessary to protect this infant plantation, the king, to support the charge, instituted the order of baronets, an hereditary dignity, to be conferred on a number not exceeding 200; each of whom, on passing his patent, was to pay into the exchequer such a sum as would maintain 30 men in Ulster, for three years, at 8d. daily pay.\n\nBut scarcely had the lands been allotted to the different patentees, when considerable portions were reclaimed by the clergy as their rightful property. And so far had the estates of the northern bishoprics been embarrassed, both by the usurpations of the Irish lords, and the claims of patentees, that they scarcely afforded a competent, much less an honourable, provision for men of worth and learning, while the state of the parochial clergy was still more deplorable. Most of the northern churches had been either destroyed in the late wars or had fallen to ruin: the benefices were small, and either shamefully kept by the bishops in the way of commendam or sequestration; or filled with ministers as scandalous as their income. The wretched flock was totally abandoned; and for many years divine service had not been used in any parish-church of Ulster, except in cities and great towns. To remedy these abuses, and to make some proper provision for the instruction of a people immersed in lamentable ignorance, the king ordained, that all ecclesiastical lands should be restored to their respective fees and churches, and that all lands should be deemed ecclesiastical from which bishops had in former times received rents or pensions: that compositions should be made with the patentees for the site of cathedral churches, the residences of bishops and dignitaries, and other church-lands which were not intended to be conveyed to them; who were to receive equivalents if they compounded freely,\nfreely; or else to be deprived of their patents as the king was deceived in his grant, and the possessions restored to the church. To provide for the inferior clergy, the bishops were obliged to resign all their impropriations, and relinquish the tythes paid them out of parishes, to the respective incumbents; for which ample recompense was made out of the king's lands. Every proportion allotted to undertakers was made a parish, with a parochial church to each. The incumbents, besides their tythes and duties, had glebe-lands assigned to them of 60, 90, or 120 acres, according to the extent of their parishes. To provide for a succession of worthy pastors, free-schools were endowed in the principal towns, and considerable grants of lands conferred on the university of Dublin, which had been re-established by Queen Elizabeth, together with the advowson of six parochial churches, three of the largest, and three of the middle proportion in each county.\n\nSuch was the general scheme of this famous northern plantation, so honourable to the king, and of such consequence to the realm of Ireland. Its happy effects were immediately perceived, although the execution by no means corresponded with the original idea. Buildings were slowly erected; British tenants were difficult to be procured in sufficient numbers; the old natives were at hand, offered higher rents, and were received into those districts from which it was intended to exclude them. In this particular, the Londoners were accused of being notoriously delinquent. They acted entirely by agents; their agents were interested and indolent, and therefore readily countenanced this dangerous intrusion of the natives: an error of which sufficient cause was afterwards found to repent. For the present, however, a number of loyal and industrious inhabitants was poured into the northern counties, considerable improvements made by the planters, and many towns created. To encourage their industry, and advance his own project, the king was pleased to incorporate several of these towns, so that they had a right of representation in the Irish parliament.\n\nThe only disturbance that now ensued was from the Popish party, who never could bear to see the Protestant religion established in preference to their own, while they had power to resist. After numberless ineffectual machinations and complaints, their fury broke out in a terrible massacre of the new English settlers in the year 1641*. The affairs of Britain were at that time in such confusion, that the rebellion could not be quelled in less than ten years; during which time the country was reduced to a most deplorable situation. It recovered again under Cromwell, Charles II., and the short reign of James II. On the accession of William III., matters were once more thrown into confusion by an attempt made in favour of the exiled monarch, who came over thither in person, and whose bad success is related under the article BRITAIN, No. 309\u2014325. Since that time, Ireland hath recovered from the miserable situation to which it was so long reduced. As yet, however, it is far from being in such a flourishing state as either South or North Britain. One great obstacle to the improvement of the kingdom is the extreme poverty and oppression of the common people. The produce of the kingdom, either in corn or cattle, is not above two-thirds at most of what by good cultivation it might yield. The high roads throughout the southern and western parts are lined with beggars, who live in huts or cabins without chimneys, or any covering capable of defending the wretched inhabitants from the cold, wind, and rain. \"It is a scandal (says a judicious traveller, who lately visited Ireland) to the proprietors of this fertile country, that there is not the greatest plenty of good corn and hay in it; but some of the best land in the king's dominions is suffered to be torn in pieces, and cultivated in the vilest manner, by a set of abject miserable occupiers; who are absolutely no better than slaves to the despicable, lazy, and oppreive subordinated landlords.\"\n\nAnother cause consisted in the various restrictions Origin of which it had been thought proper to lay upon the Irish the Irish trade; and the constant and great preference given by discontented the most grievous discontented and distresses. On the part of England it was supposed, that as Ireland had meant for been subdued by force of arms, the inhabitants ought and again in every respect to be subject to the victorious state; and that the interest of the English ought on all occasions to be consulted, without regarding the inconveniences which might ensue to the Irish. A very different idea, however, was entertained by the Irish themselves, or at least by the patriotic party among them. They rejected all notions of dependence upon the British ministry and parliament; and though they did not scruple to acknowledge the king's right of conquest, they most positively denied that the British parliament had any authority whatever over them; and therefore looked upon the restrictions laid upon their trade as the most grievous and intolerable oppression.\n\nIn the year 1719, according to Mr Crawford, the cause of oppression and grievances of Ireland became altogether Sherlock insupportable. A cause relative to an estate, between Anne Heffer Sherlock and Maurice Anneley, was tried before the court of exchequer in Ireland. Here the latter obtained a decree in his favour; but, on an appeal, the sentence was reversed by the lords. Anneley appealed from them to the English peers; who having reversed the judgment of those of Ireland, he was put in possession of the estate in dispute. Sherlock appealed again to the Irish lords, and the matter became very serious. It was proposed to the consideration of the judges, Whether by the laws of the land an appeal lies from a decree of the court of exchequer in Ireland to the king in parliament in Britain? This question being determined in the negative, Sherlock was again put in possession of the estate. A petition was some time after presented to the house by Alexander Burrowes, sheriff of Kildare, setting forth, \"That his predecessor in office had put Sherlock in possession of the premises; that, upon his entering into office, an injunction, agreeable to the order of the English peers, issued from the exchequer, requiring him to restore Maurice Anneley to the possession of the above-mentioned lands; and that, not daring to act in contradiction to the order of the house, he was fined. In consequence of this, being afraid lest he should be taken into custody, he durst not come in to pass his accounts; and for this he was peers fined 1200l.\" His conduct was applauded by the Irish lords, who commanded the fines imposed upon him to England.\nIreland be taken off; and in a short time after drew up a memorial to be presented to his majesty. In this they set forth, that having submitted to Henry II. as their liege lord, they had from him obtained the benefit of English law, with many other privileges, particularly that of having a distinct parliament. In consequence of this concession, the English had been encouraged to come over and settle in Ireland, where they were to enjoy the same privileges as in their own country. They farther insisted, that though the imperial crown of Ireland was annexed to that of Britain, yet being a distinct dominion, and no part of the kingdom of England, none could determine with regard to its affairs, but such as were authorized by its known laws and customs, or the express consent of the king. It was an invasion of his majesty's prerogative for any court of judicature to take upon them to declare, that he could not by his authority in parliament determine all controversies between his subjects of this kingdom; or that, when they appealed to his majesty in parliament, they did not bring their cause before a competent judicature; and they represented, that the practice of appeals from the Irish parliament to the British peers was an usurped jurisdiction assumed by the latter; the bad consequences of which they pointed out very fully.\n\nThis representation being laid before his majesty in parliament, it was resolved, that the barons of exchequer in Ireland had acted with courage and fidelity, according to law, &c. and an address was presented to his majesty, praying him to confer on them some mark of his royal favour as a recompense for the injuries they had sustained from the Irish legislature. This was followed by a bill for the better securing the dependency of Ireland upon the crown of Great Britain. By this it was determined, \"That the house of lords of Ireland have not, nor of right ought to have, any jurisdiction to judge of, affirm, or reverse, any judgment, sentence, or decree, given or made in any court within the kingdom; and that all proceedings before the said house of lords, upon any such judgment or decree, are utterly null and void to all intents and purposes whatever.\" It was also determined in this bill, that \"the king's majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons of Great Britain in parliament assembled, hath, and of right ought to have, full power and authority to make laws and statutes of sufficient force and validity to bind the people of Ireland.\"\n\nThis bill was looked upon by the Irish to be equivalent to a total annihilation of their liberties; and they were still farther exasperated in the year 1724, by the patent granted to one Wood an Englishman to coin halfpence and farthings for the use of Ireland. In this affair Wood is said to have acted very dishonourably; insomuch that a threepenny piece of the halfpence he made were scarcely worth a penny. Great quantities of this base coin were sent over; and it was used not only in change, but accounts were likely to be paid in it, so that dangerous consequences seemed ready to ensue. The Irish parliament, in an address to the king, represented that they were called upon by their country to lay before his majesty the ill consequences of Wood's patent, and that it was likely to be attended with a diminution of the revenue and the ruin of trade.\n\nThe same was set forth in an application made to his majesty by the privy council. In short, the whole nation seemed to unite their efforts in order to remedy an evil of such dangerous tendency, the effects of which already began to be felt.\n\nAmong the controversial pieces which appeared on Dr Swift in this occasion, those of Dr Swift were particularly distinguished. His Drapier's letters are to this day held in grateful remembrance by his countrymen; but he was in danger of fulfilling deeply in the cause. He Wood had been at particular pains to explain an argument used by the Irish on this occasion, viz. that brass money, being illegal, could not be forced upon the nation by the king, without exceeding the limits of his prerogative. Hence the opposite party took occasion to charge the Irish with a design of calling off their dependence on Britain altogether; but Swift having examined the accusation with freedom, pointed out the encroachments made by the British parliament on the liberties of Ireland; and asserted, that any dependence on England, except that of being subjects to the same king, was contrary to the law of reason, nature, and nations, as well as to the law of the land. This publication was so disagreeable to government, that they offered a reward of \u00a3500 for the discovery of the author; but as nobody could be found who would give him up, the printer was prosecuted in his stead; however, he was unanimously acquitted by a jury of his countrymen.\n\nThe Irish continued to be jealous of their liberties, while the British ministry seemed to watch every opportunity of encroaching upon them as far as possible. Apprehensions being entertained of a design upon Ireland by the partisans of the pretender in 1715, a vote of credit to government was passed by the house of commons to a considerable amount. This laid the foundation of the national debt of that kingdom, which was quickly augmented to several hundred thousand pounds; for discharge of which a fund had been provided by administration. An attempt was made during the administration of Lord Carteret (who governed Ireland till 1730), to vest this fund in the hands of his majesty and of his heirs for ever, redeemable by parliament. This was opposed by the patriotic party, who insisted, that it was inconsistent with the public safety, and unconstitutional, to grant it longer than from secession to secession. In 1731 another attempt was made to vest the same in the crown for 21 years; but when the affair came to be debated, the strength of both parties was found to be equally balanced. Immediately before the vote, however, Colonel Tottingham having rode off on the occasion, arrived in the house, and determined the question against government.\n\nThe behaviour of Lord Chesterfield, who was made governor of Ireland in 1745, is highly extolled, on account of his moderation, and the favour he showed to the liberties of the people. As the apprehensions of government were then very considerable, on account of the rebellion which raged in Scotland, his lordship was advised to augment the military force of Ireland by 4000 men. Instead of this, however, he sent four battalions to the duke of Cumberland, and encouraged the volunteer associations which formed in different parts for the defence of their country. These battalions\nIreland, he replaced by additional companies to the regiments already on the establishment; by which means he saved a considerable expense to the nation, without augmenting the influence of the crown. The supplies asked by him were small, and raised in the most easy and agreeable manner to the people, expending the money at the same time with the utmost economy. There was even a saving, which he applied to the use of the public. It had been a custom with many of the lieutenant-governors of Ireland to bestow reversionary grants, in order to purchase the affluence of friends in support of their measures. Lord Chesterfield, however, being convinced that this practice was prejudicial to the interest of the nation, put a stop to it; but the most remarkable part of his administration was the humanity with which he treated the Roman Catholics. Before his arrival, the Romish chapels in Dublin had been shut up; their priests were commanded by proclamation to leave the kingdom; and such as disobeyed had been subjected to imprisonment and other penalties. Lord Chesterfield, however, convinced that the affection is to be engaged by gentle usage, permitted them to exercise their religion without disturbance. The accusations brought against them of forming plots against government were disregarded; and so much was his moderation and uprightness in this respect applauded by all parties, that, during the whole time of his administration, the national tranquillity was not once interrupted by the smallest internal commotion. On his leaving the island, his butt was placed at the public expense in the cattle of Dublin.\n\nLord Chesterfield having left Ireland in the spring of 1746, the island continued to be governed by lords justices until the 13th of September, when William earl of Harrington came over with the powers of lord lieutenant. A contest in the election of representatives for the city of Dublin this year called forth the abilities of Mr Charles Lucas, so much celebrated for his patriotic virtues. Having some years before been admitted a member of the common council, he resolved to exert himself in behalf of the privileges of his fellow-citizens. The powers of this city-corporation, as well as of others, had been changed by authority derived from an act in the time of Charles II.; and among other innovations, for the purpose of augmenting the influence of the crown, they deprived the commons of the power of choosing the city magistrates. This was now veiled in the board of aldermen; which being subject in the exercise of its jurisdiction to the approbation of the privy-council, was consequently dependent on government. Mr Lucas complained loudly of the injury; but as this law could not be altered, he set himself to inquire, whether encroachments, which could not be justified by law, had not been made on the rights of the citizens? Having satisfied himself, by searching diligently into ancient records, that his apprehensions were well founded, he published his discoveries, explained the nature of the evidence resulting from them, and encouraged the people to take the proper steps for obtaining redress.\n\nThe consequence of this was a contest between the commons and aldermen, which lasted two years. The former struggled in vain to recover their lost privileges; but the exertions of Lucas in every stage of the dispute had rendered him so respectable among his countrymen, that on the death of Sir James Somerville he was encouraged to declare himself a candidate for a seat in parliament. This being highly agreeable to his wishes, he was elected accordingly; and distinguished himself not only by the boldness and energy of his speeches, but more especially by a number of addresses to his countrymen. In some of these he particularly considered the several branches of the constitution, and pointed out the encroachments of the British legislature. Government, alarmed at his boldness, determined to crush him by the hand of power; for which reason the most obnoxious paragraphs were extracted from his works, and made the foundation of a charge before parliament. The commons voted him an enemy to his country; and addressed the lord-lieutenant for an order to prosecute him by the attorney-general. The universal esteem in which he was held could not screen him from ministerial vengeance: he was driven from Ireland; but having spent some years in banishment, he was once more enabled, through the exertions of his friends, to present himself as a candidate for the city of Dublin. Being again elected, he continued to distinguish himself by the same virtuous principles for which he had been from the beginning so remarkable, and died with the character which he had preserved through life, of the incorruptible Lucas.\n\nIn the year 1753, a remarkable contest took place betwixt government and the Irish parliament relative to previous consent. As the taxes for defraying state expenses are imposed by the representatives of the previous people, it thence naturally follows, that they have a consent right to superintend the expenditure of them; and by an inspection of the journals of the house of commons, it appeared, that from the year 1692, they had exercised a right of calling for and examining the public accounts. When any surplus remained in the treasury, it was also customary to dispose of it by bill for the good of the public. In the year 1749, however, a considerable sum having remained in the treasury, the disposal of this money in future became an object to ministry. In 1751, it was intimated to parliament by the lord lieutenant, the duke of Dorset, that his majesty would graciously consent and recommend it to them, that such part of the money as then remained in the treasury should be applied to the reduction of the national debt. As this implied a right inherent in his majesty to dispose of the money as he thought proper, the proposal was accounted an invasion of the privileges of the house of commons. No notice was therefore taken of the direction given by Dorset, but the bill was sent over to England as usual without any notice taken of his majesty's consent. In England, however, this very material alteration was made, and the word consent introduced into it. The commons at this time did not take any notice of such an essential alteration; but next year, on its being repeated, the bill was rejected. Government were now at the utmost pains to defend the measure they had adopted, and pamphlets were published in which it was justified on various grounds. The event at last, however, was, that his majesty by letter took the money which had been the subject of dispute out of the treasury.\n\nIn the year 1760 Ireland sustained an inconsiderable invasion by hostile invasion, the first that had been experienced in Ireland in the 1760s.\nIreland. the kingdom for 70 years. The armament consisted originally of five ships; one of 48 guns, two of 36, and two of 24; having on board 1270 land forces. They were commanded by the celebrated Thurot, whose reputation, as captain of a privateer, had advanced him to this dignity. The squadron, however, was driven by adverse winds to Gottenburgh; where having continued a few days, they fell fail for the place of their destination. On their arrival at the coast of Ireland, they were obliged to shelter themselves in Lough Foyle from a violent storm which again overtook them. The wind, however, having shifted, and continuing to blow tempestuously, they were obliged to keep out to sea. Two of the ships were thus separated from the rest by the violence of the storm, and returned to France; but the remaining three directed their course to the island of Ilay, where they anchored; and having repaired their damages, took in a supply of provisions, and thence sailed to Carrickfergus.\n\nIn the mean time, an officer belonging to the small number of troops at that time in Carrickfergus took post on a rising ground, with an advanced party, to observe the motions of the enemy. A skirmish ensued between this party and Thurot's men, until the former, having expended all their ammunition, were obliged to retire into the town. Having vainly attempted to prevent the enemy from taking possession of it, the British troops shut themselves up in the castle, where they were soon obliged to capitulate, after having killed about 100 of their enemies, with the loss of only three on their own part. The French having plundered the town, fell on the 26th of February; and three days after were all taken by Captain Elliot, Thurot himself being killed in the engagement.\n\nSoon after the accession of George III., Ireland first began to be disturbed by a banditti who styled themselves White Boys; and as these were generally of the Roman Catholic persuasion, the prejudices against that sect broke forth in the usual manner. A plot was alleged to have been formed against government; French and Spanish emigrants to have been sent over to Ireland, and actually to be employed to assist in carrying it into execution. The real cause of this commotion, however, was as follows: About the year 1739 the murrain broke out among the horned cattle in the duchy of Holstein, from whence it soon after spread through the other parts of Germany. From Germany it reached Holland, from whence it was carried over to England, where it raged with great violence for a number of years. The mitigation of the penal laws against the papists about this time encouraged the natives of the south of Ireland to turn their thoughts towards agriculture, and the poor began to enjoy the necessaries of life in a comfortable manner. A foreign demand for beef and butter, however, having become uncommonly great, by reason of the cattle ditto just mentioned, ground appropriated to grazing became more valuable than that employed in tillage. The cottars were everywhere dispossessed of their little possessions, which the landlords let to monopolizers who could afford a higher rent. Whole baronies were now laid open to pasturage, while the former inhabitants were driven desperate for want of subsistence. Numbers of them fled to the large cities, or emigrated to foreign countries, while those who remained took small spots of land, about an acre each, at an exorbitant price, where they endeavoured if possible to procure the means of protracting a miserable existence for themselves and families. For some time these poor creatures were allowed by the more humane landlords the liberty of commonage; but afterwards this was taken away, in despite of justice and a positive agreement; at the same time, the payment of tythes, and the low price of labour, not exceeding the wages in the days of Queen Elizabeth, aggravated the distresses of the unhappy sufferers beyond measure.\n\nIn such a situation, it is no wonder that illegal methods were pursued in expectation of redress. The people, covered with white shirts, assembled in parties at night, turned up the ground, destroyed bullocks, levelled the inclosures of the commons, and committed other acts of violence. These unavailing efforts were construed into a plot against the government; numbers of the rioters were apprehended in the counties of Limerick, Cork, and Tipperary, and some of them condemned and executed. In different places these unhappy wretches, instead of being looked upon as objects of compassion, were prosecuted with the utmost severity. Judge Afton, however, who was sent over to try them, executed his office with such humanity as did him the highest honour. A most extraordinary and affecting instance of this was, that on his return from Dublin, for above ten miles from Clonmell, both sides of the road were lined with men, women, and children; who, as he passed along, kneeled down and implored the blessing of heaven upon him as their guardian and protector.\n\nIn the mean time, the violences of the White Boys continued, notwithstanding that many examples were made. The idea of rebellion was still kept up; and, without the smallest foundation, gentlemen of the first rank were publicly charged with being concerned in it, inasmuch that some of them were obliged to enter bail, in order to protect themselves from injury. The Catholics of Waterford gave in a petition to Lord Hertford, the governor in 1765, in behalf of themselves and brethren, professing their loyalty and obedience to government; but no effectual step was taken either to remove or even to investigate the cause of the disturbances.\n\nAbout two years after the appearance of the White Boys, a similar commotion arose in Ulster; which, however, proceeded in part from a different cause, and was of much shorter duration. By an act of parliament, the making and repairing of highways in Ireland was formerly a grievous imposition on the lower ranks of people. An housekeeper who had no horse was obliged to work at them six days in the year; and if he had a horse, the labour of both was required for the same space of time. Besides this oppression, the poor complained that they were frequently obliged to work at roads made for the convenience of individuals, and which were of no service to the public. Nor were these the only grievances of which the insurgents at this time complained: the tythes exacted by the clergy were said to be unreasonable, and the rent of lands was more than they could bear. In 1763, therefore, being exacerbated by a road promised to be made through a part of the county of Armagh, the inhabitants most immediately affected by it rose in a body, and decla-\nred that they would make no more highways of the kind. As a mark of distillation, they wore oak branches in their hats, from which circumstance they called themselves Oak-boys. The number of their partizans soon increased, and the insurrection became general through the counties of Armagh, Tyrone, Derry, and Fermanagh. In a few weeks, however, they were dispersed by parties of the military; and the public tranquillity was restored with the loss of only two or three lives. The road act, which had been justly found fault with, was repealed next session; and it was determined, that for the future the roads should be made and repaired by a tax to be equally assessed on the lands of the rich and poor.\n\nBesides these, another set of insurgents called Steel-boys soon made their appearance, on the following account. The estate of an absentee nobleman happening to be out of lease, he proposed, instead of an additional rent, to take fines from his tenants. Many of those, who at that time possessed his lands, were unable to comply with his terms; while others who could afford to do so, insisted upon a greater rent from the immediate tenants than they were able to pay. The usual consequences of this kind of oppression instantly took place. Numbers being dispossessed and thrown destitute, were forced into acts of outrage similar to those already mentioned. One of these charged with felony was carried to Belfast, in order to be committed to the county gaol; but his associates, provoked by the outrage they had received, determined to relieve him. The design was eagerly entered into by great numbers all over the country; and several thousands, having provided themselves with offensive weapons, proceeded to Belfast in order to rescue the prisoners. To prevent this, he was removed to the barracks and put under the guard of a party of soldiers quartered there; but the Steel-boys pressed forward with a determination to accomplish their purpose by force, and some shots were actually exchanged between them and the soldiers. The consequences would undoubtedly have been fatal, had it not been for a physician of highly respectable character, who interposed at the risk of his life, and prevailed on those concerned to let the prisoner at liberty. The tumult, however, was not thus quelled. The number of insurgents daily increased, and the violences committed by them were much greater than those of the other two parties. Some were taken and tried at Carrickfergus, but none condemned. It was supposed that the fear of popular resentment had influenced the judges; for which reason an act was passed, enjoining the trial of such prisoners for the future to be held in counties different from those where the crimes were committed. This breach of a fundamental law of the constitution gave such offence, that though several of the Steel-boys were afterwards taken up and carried to the castle of Dublin, no jury would find them guilty. This obnoxious law was therefore repealed; after which some of the insurgents, being tried in their respective counties, were condemned and executed. Thus the commotions were extinguished; but as no methods were taken to remove the cause, the continued distresses of the people drove many thousands of them into America in a very few years.\n\nIn the meantime a very material alteration had taken place in the constitution of the kingdom, with regard to the duration of parliaments. At an early period these had continued only for a year; but afterwards they were prolonged until the death of a sovereign, unless he chose to dissolve it sooner by an exercise of his prerogative. Thus, from the moment of their election, the commoners of Ireland were in a manner totally independent of the people and under the influence of the crown; and government soon availed itself of this power to bribe a majority to serve its own purposes. Various methods were thought of to remedy this evil; but all proved ineffectual until the year 1768, when, during the administration of Lord Townshend, a bill was prepared and sent over to England, by which it was enacted, that the Irish parliaments thenceforth should be held every seven years.\n\nIt was returned with the addition of one year; and Parliament ever since the parliaments of this country have been of Ireland octennial. During this session an attempt was made by the British ministry to infringe the rights of the octennial house of commons in a very material point. A money bill, which had not originated in Ireland, was sent money-bill over from Britain, but was rejected in a spirited manner. Its rejection gave great offence to the lord lieutenant, who repeatedly prorogued them till the year 1771.\n\nThe affairs of Ireland began now to draw towards that crisis which effected the late remarkable revolution in favour of the liberties of the people. The passing of the octennial bill had diminished, but not taken away, the influence of the crown; and the situation of affairs between Britain and America had inclined ministry to make the most of this influence they could. In 1773 Lord Harcourt, at that time governor of Ireland, exerted himself so powerfully in favour of administration, that the voice of opposition in parliament was almost entirely silenced. The difficulties, however, under which the whole nation laboured began state of Ireland to be so severely felt, that an address on the subject was presented by the commons to his excellency. In lord lieutenant they told him, that they hoped he would lay before the king the state of Ireland, restricted in its commerce from the short-fighted policy of former times, to the great injury of the kingdom, and the advantage of the rivals, if not of the enemies, of Great Britain. These hardships, they said, were not only unpatriotic, but unjust; and they told his excellency plainly, that they expected to be restored to some, if not to all their rights, which alone could justify them to their constituents for laying upon them so many burdens during the course of this session.\n\nThis representation to the lord lieutenant produced no effect; and Ireland for some years longer continued to groan under the burden of intolerable restrictions. These had principally taken place in the reign of Charles II. At this time it was enacted, that beef or live cattle should not be exported to England; neither were the commodities of Ireland to be exported to the American colonies, nor American goods to be imported to any port in Ireland without first unloading them in some part of England or Wales. All trade with Asia was excluded by charters granted to particular companies; and restrictions were imposed upon almost every valuable article of commerce sent to the different ports of Europe. Towards the end of King\nKing William's reign an absolute prohibition was laid on the exportation of Irish wool. This restriction proved disadvantageous not only to Ireland, but to Great Britain herself. The French were now plentifully supplied by smuggling with Irish wool; and not only enabled to furnish woollen stuffs sufficient for their own consumption, but even to vie with the British in foreign markets. Other restrictions conspired to augment the national calamity, but that which was most sensibly felt took place in 1776. \"There had hitherto (says Mr Crawford) been exported annually to America large quantities of Irish linens; this very considerable source of national advantage was now shut up, under pretence of rendering it more difficult for the enemy to be supplied with the means of subsistence; but in reality, to enable a few rapacious English contractors to fulfil their engagements, an embargo, which continued, was in 1776 laid upon the exportation of provisions from Ireland, by an unconstitutional stretch of prerogative. Remittances to England, on various accounts, particularly for the payment of our forces abroad, were more than usually considerable. These immediate causes being combined with those which were invariable and permanent, produced in this country very calamitous effects. Black cattle fell very considerably in their value; notwithstanding that, customers could not be had. The price of wool was reduced in a still greater proportion. Rents everywhere fell; nor, in many places, was it possible to collect them. An universal stagnation of business ensued. Credit was very materially injured. Farmers were pressed by extreme necessity, and many of them failed. Numbers of manufacturers were reduced to extreme necessity, and would have perished, had they not been supported by public charity. Those of every rank and condition were deeply affected by the calamity of the times. Had the state of the exchequer permitted, grants might have been made to promote industry, and to alleviate the national distress; but it was exhausted to a very uncommon degree. Almost every branch of the revenue had failed. From want of money the militia law could not be carried into execution. We could not pay our forces abroad; and, to enable us to pay those at home, there was a necessity for borrowing \u00a350,000l. from England. The money which parliament was forced to raise, it was obliged to borrow at an exorbitant interest. England, in its present state, was afflicted with the wretched condition to which our affairs were reduced. Individuals there, who had estates in Ireland, were sharers of the common calamity; and the attention of individuals in the British parliament was turned to our situation, who had even no personal interest in this country.\"\n\nWhile things were in this deplorable situation, Earl Nugent, in the year 1778, undertook the cause of the Irish, by moving in parliament, that their affairs should be taken into consideration by a committee of the whole house. This motion being agreed to almost unanimously, it was followed by several others, viz. That the Irish might be permitted to export directly to the British plantations, or to the settlements on the coasts of Africa, all goods being the produce and manufacture of the kingdom, excepting only wool, or woollen manufactures, &c. That all goods, being the produce of any of the British plantations, or of the settlements on the coast of Africa, tobacco excepted, be allowed to be imported directly from Ireland to all places, Britain excepted. That cotton yarn, the manufacture of Ireland, be allowed to be imported into Great Britain. That glass manufactured in Ireland be permitted to be exported to all places, Britain excepted.\u2014With respect to the Irish sail cloth and cordage, it was moved, that they should have the same privilege as for the cotton yarn.\n\nThese motions having passed unanimously, bills for Petitions for the relief of Ireland were framed upon them accordingly. The trading and manufacturing towns of England, however, now took the alarm, and petitions against the Irish indulgence were brought forward from many different quarters, and numbers infructuous to oppose it. In consequence of this a warm contest took place on the second reading of the bills. Mr Burke supported them with all the strength of his eloquence; and as the minister seemed to favour them, they were committed; though the violent opposition to them still continued, which induced many of their friends at that time to desert their cause.\n\nThough the efforts of those who favoured the cause of Ireland thus proved unsuccessful for the present, they renewed their endeavours before the Christmas vacation. They now urged, that, independent of all claims from justice and humanity, the relief of Ireland was enforced by necessity. The trade with British America was now lost for ever; and it was indispensably requisite to unite the remaining parts of the empire in one common interest and affection. Ireland had hitherto been pallive; but there was danger that, by driving her to extremities, she would cast off the yoke altogether; or, even if this should not happen, the tyranny of Britain would be of little advantage; as, on the event of a peace, the people would desert a country in which they had experienced such oppression, and emigrate to America, where they had a greater prospect of liberty. On the other hand, they insisted, that very considerable advantages must ensue to Britain by the emancipation of Ireland; and every benefit extended to that country would be returned with accumulated interest. The difficulties were at last summed up in a motion made by Lord Newhaven, in February 1769, that liberty should be granted to the Irish to import sugars from the West Indies. This was carried; but the petitioners of Glasgow and Manchester having petitioned against it, it was again lost through the interference of the minister, who now exerted his influence against the relief he had formerly declared in favour of. Various other efforts, however, were made to effect the intended purpose; but nothing more could be obtained than a kind of compromise, by which Lord Gower pledged himself, as far as he could answer for the conduct of others, that, during the recess, some plan should be fallen upon for accommodating the affairs of Ireland to the satisfaction of all parties.\n\nIn the mean time the affairs of this country hastened to a crisis; which forced the British ministry to give that relief so long solicited, and which they often promised without any intention of performing their promises. As long as the affairs of the country were under consideration of the British parliament, the inhabitants...\nhabitants preserved some degree of patience; but, when they found themselves deserted by the minister, their discontent was inflamed beyond measure. The laws he had passed in their favour, viz. an allowance to plant tobacco, and a bill for encouraging the growth of hemp, were considered as mockery instead of relief, and it was now resolved to take such measures as should effectually convince the ministry that it was not their interest to tyrannize any longer. With this view, associations against the importation of British commodities, which had been entered into in some places before, now became universal throughout the kingdom; and such as presumed to oppose the voice of the people in this respect, had the mortification to find themselves exposed to public obloquy and contempt on that account. Thus the Irish manufacturers began to revive; and the people of Britain found themselves obliged seriously to take into consideration the relief of that country, and to look upon it as a matter very necessary to their own interest. To this also they were still more seriously disposed by the military associations, which had taken place some time before, and now assumed a most formidable appearance. These at first were formed by accidental causes. The situation of Britain, for some time, had not admitted of any effectual method being taken for the defence of Ireland. Its coasts had been insulted, and the trading ships taken by the French and American privateers; nor was it at all improbable that an invasion might soon follow.\n\n\"The minister (says Mr Crawford) told us, that the situation of Britain was such as rendered her incapable of protecting us. The weakness of government, from the following circumstance, was strikingly obvious. The mayor of Belfast having transmitted a memorial to the lord lieutenant, setting forth the unprotected state of the coast, and requesting a body of the military for its defence, received for answer, that he could not afford him any other assistance than half a troop of dismounted horse and half a company of invalids.\"\n\nIn this dilemma, a number of the inhabitants of the town associated for the purpose of self-defence; and, on the same principle, a few volunteer companies were formed in different parts of the kingdom. These chose their own officers, purchased their own uniforms and arms, and, with the assistance of persons properly qualified, assembled regularly on the parade to acquire a knowledge in the military art. Their respectable appearance, and the zeal they showed in the service of their country, soon excited curiosity and attracted respect. Their number increased every day; and people of the first consequence became ambitious of being enrolled among them. As no foreign enemy appeared, against whom they might exercise their military prowess, these patriotic bands soon began to turn their thoughts towards a deliverance from domestic oppression. No sooner was this idea made known, that it gave new vigour to the spirit of volunteering; insomuch that, by the end of 1778, the military associations were thought to amount at least to 30,000 men. But, while thus formidable from their numbers, and openly avowing their intention to demand a restitution of their rights from the British ministry, they professed the utmost loyalty and affection to the king; and with regard to sobriety and decent demeanor, they were not only unexceptionable, but exemplary. Instead of exciting disorders themselves, they restrained every kind of irregularity, and exerted themselves with unanimity and vigour for the execution of the laws.\n\nThat such a body of armed men, acting without any command or support from government, should be an object of apprehension to ministry, is not to be wondered at. In the infancy of their associations indeed they might have been suppressed; but matters had been suffered to proceed too far; and, as they flood at present, all resistance was vain. As the volunteers could not be controlled, some attempts were made to bring them under the influence of the crown; but this being found impossible, ministry thought proper to treat them supplied with an appearance of confidence; and, accordingly, with arms orders were filled for supplying them with 16,000 infantry.\n\nThe Irish parliament, thus encouraged by the spirit the militia of the nation, and piqued by the difficulties arising from the diminished value of their estates, resolved to exert themselves in a becoming manner, in order to procure relief to their country. At their meeting in October 1779, an address to his majesty was drawn up; in which it was expressly declared, that \"it was not by temporary expedients, but by a free trade alone, that Ireland was now to be saved from impending ruin.\" When this address was carried up to the lord lieutenant, the streets of Dublin were lined with volunteers, commanded by the duke of Leinster, in their arms and uniform. But, though a general expectation of relief was now diffused, an anxious fear of disappointment still continued. If the usual supply was granted for two years, there was danger of the distresses continuing for all that time; and after it was granted, the prorogation of parliament might put a stop to the expected relief altogether. The people, however, were not now to be trifled with. As the court-party showed an aversion to comply with the popular measures, a mob rose in Dublin, who, among riotous acts of violence, pulled down the house of the Dublin attorney-general, and did their utmost to compel the members to promise their countenance to the matter in hand. When the point therefore came to be debated, some espoused the popular side from principle, others from necessity; so that on the whole a majority appeared in favour of it. A short money-bill was passed and transmitted to England; where, though very mortifying to the ministry, it palled also.\n\nOn the meeting of the British parliament in December, the affairs of Ireland were first taken into consideration in the house of peers. The necessity of granting gainful relief to that kingdom was strongly set forth by the lord who introduced them. He said, the Irish, now parliament, conscious of possessing a force and consequence to which they had hitherto been strangers, had resolved to apply it to obtain the advantages of which the nation, by this spirited exertion, now showed themselves worthy. Had they for some time before been gratified in lesser matters, they would now have received with gratitude, what they would, as affairs stood at present, consider only as a matter of right. He then moved for a vote of censure on his majesty's ministers for their neglect of Ireland. This motion was rejected; but Earl Gower, who had now deferred the cause of ministry, declared, that there did not exist in his mind a single doubt that the vote of censure was not\nnot well founded. He added, in his own vindication, that early in the summer he had promised that relief should be granted to Ireland, and had done everything in his power to keep his word; but that all his efforts had proved fruitless.\n\nIn the house of commons the minister found himself so hard pressed by the arguments of the minority, and the short money-bill from Ireland, that he was obliged to declare, than in less than a week he intended to move for a committee of the whole house to take the affairs of Ireland into consideration. On the 13th of December he accordingly brought forward his propositions in favour of this kingdom. The design of these was to repeal the laws prohibiting the exportation of Irish manufactures made of wool or wool flocks; to repeal as much of the act of 19th Geo. II. as prohibited the importation of glaas into Ireland, except of British manufacture, or the exportation of glaas from Ireland; and to permit the Irish to export and import commodities to and from the West Indies and the British settlements on the coast of Africa, subject to such regulations and restrictions as should be imposed by the Irish parliament.\n\nOn these propositions his lordship made several remarks by way of explanation. One object of them, he said, was to restore to Ireland the wool export and woollen manufacture. In 1692, from jealousy or some other motive, an address had been presented by the English parliament, recommending a kind of compact between the two kingdoms; the terms of which were, that England should enjoy the woollen manufacture, and Ireland the linen, exclusively. But notwithstanding this agreement, it was certain, that England carried on the linen manufacture to as great extent as Ireland, while at the same time the former retained the monopoly of woollens. The first step taken, in consequence of this agreement, was to lay a heavy duty, equal to a prohibition, upon all wool and woollen exported; and when this act, which was but a temporary one by way of experiment, expired, the English parliament passed a similar one, and made it perpetual; by means of which and some others a total end was put to the woollen trade of Ireland.\n\nWith regard to the trade of Ireland, his lordship observed, that, upon an average of the six years from 1766 to 1772, the export to Ireland was somewhat more than two millions; and, in the succeeding five years, from 1772 to 1778, about as much more: nearly one-half being British manufacture and produce; the other half certified articles, of which this country was the medium of conveyance. The native produce on an average, was somewhat more than 900,000l. but of this only 200,000l. were woollens. The woollen manufacture of Ireland therefore would long continue in a state of infancy; and though cloths had been manufactured sufficient for home consumption, yet it could hardly be expected that Ireland would rival Great Britain at the foreign markets, when, after the expense of land-carriage, freight, insurance, and factorage, the latter was able to undersell Ireland in her own market on the very spot, even though aided by the low wages and taxes paid in the country.\n\nWith regard to the linen, his lordship observed, that however prosperous it might appear, yet still it was capable of great improvement. The idea of extending and improving the linen manufactures of Ireland originated from a pamphlet written by Sir William Temple; and this gave rise to the compact which had been referred to. But though this compact was now about to be dissolved, it was his opinion that the bounties on importing Irish linens ought not to be discontinued; because it appeared, that the British bounties had operated as a great encouragement to the Irish manufactures, at the same time that the sum appropriated to this purpose amounted to more than 13,000l.\n\nWith regard to the dissolution of the compact betwixt England and Ireland, he observed, that, as a more liberal spirit had now appeared on both sides of the water, he hoped both kingdoms would be perfectly contented. Ireland would never be able to rival England in the fine woollen fabrics; but allowing the Irish to manufacture their own wool, would put an end to the contraband trade with France; and it ought to be remembered, that whatever was an advantage to Ireland, must sooner or later be of singular advantage to Great Britain, and by the proposed regulations in their commercial connections, the two kingdoms would be put more upon an equality.\n\nWith regard to the glaas manufacture, his lordship likewise observed, that Ireland had been very injuriously treated. Before the act of 19th Geo. II. they had begun to make some progress in the lower branches of the glaas manufacture; but by that act they were not only prevented from importing any other glaas than what was of British manufacture, but also from exporting their own glaas, or putting it on a horse or carriage with a design to be exported. This act had been complained of in Ireland as a piece of great injustice, and it was the intention of his proposition to remove that grievance.\n\nWith regard to the third proposition, his lordship observed, that allowing Ireland a free trade to the colonies must be considered as a favour to that kingdom. Considering her even as an independent state, she could set up no claim to an intercourse with the British colonies. By every principle of justice, of the laws of nations, and the custom of the other European powers who had settlements and distant dependencies, the mother country had an exclusive right to trade with, and to forbid all others from having any intercourse with them. Were not this the case, what nation under the sun would spend their blood and treasure in establishing a colony, and protecting and defending it in its infant state, if other nations were afterwards to reap the advantages derived from their labour, hazard, and expense. But though Great Britain had a right to restrain Ireland from trading with her colonies, his lordship declared himself of opinion that it would be proper to allow her to participate of the trade. This would be the only prudent means of affording her relief; it would be an unequivocal proof of the candour and sincerity of Great Britain; and he had not the least doubt but it would be received as such in Ireland. Britain, however, ought not to be a sufferer by her bounty to Ireland; but this would be the case, should the colony trade be thrown open to the latter, without accompanying it with restrictions similar to those which were laid upon the British trade with them. An equal trade must include an equal share of duties and taxes;\ntaxes; and this was the only proper ground on which the benefits expected by the Irish nation could be either granted or refused.\n\nHaving made some other observations on the propriety of these measures, they were regularly formed into motions, and passed unanimously. In Ireland they were received with the utmost joy and gratitude by both houses of parliament. On the 20th of December the following resolutions were passed; viz. That the exportation of woollen and other manufactures from Ireland to all foreign places will materially tend to relieve its distresses, increase its wealth, promote its prosperity, and thereby advance the welfare of Britain, and the common strength, wealth, and commerce of the British empire: that a liberty to trade with the British colonies in America and the West Indies, and the settlements on the coast of Africa, will be productive of very great commercial benefits; will be a most affectionate mark of the regard and attention of Great Britain to the distresses of the kingdom; and will give new vigour to the zeal of his majesty\u2019s brave and loyal people of Ireland, to stand forth in support of his majesty\u2019s person and government, and the interest, the honour, and dignity of the British empire.\u201d\n\nThe same resolutions were, next day, passed in the house of peers.\n\nThe highest encomiums were now passed on Lord North. His exertions in favour of Ireland were declared to have been great and noble; he was styled \u201cthe great advocate of Ireland;\u201d and it was foretold, that he would be of glorious and immortal memory in that kingdom. But while these panegyrics were so lavishly made on the minister, the members in opposition, in the British parliament, were spoken of in very indifferent terms. It was said, that, while they thought the minister did not mean to go into the business of Ireland, they called loudly for censure against him for not doing it; but when it was found that he meant seriously to take their affairs into consideration, they had then safely seceded, and wholly forsook the interest of the kingdom. These censures were so loud, that by a member of the British house of commons wrote a letter to be communicated to his friends in Ireland, in which he represented, that however politic it might be to compliment the minister on the present occasion, it was neither very wise nor generous in the members of the Irish parliament to be so ready in bestowing invectives against their old friends in England. With regard to the minister, it was alleged, that until he was driven to it by the measures adopted in Ireland, his conduct had been extremely equivocal, dilatory, and indecisive. The minority had been justly incensed against him for having so grossly sacrificed the honour of the nation and the dignity of parliament as to refuse any substantial relief to the Irish, until their own exertions had made it appear that every thing which could be done for them by the British parliament was not a matter of choice but of necessity. The minority, it was said, had earnestly and repeatedly laboured to procure relief for the people of Ireland; and if they had now contented themselves with a silent acquiescence in the minister\u2019s propositions, it was only until they should know whether they would be satisfactory to the people of Ireland; and because what was now done, appeared to be more an act of state than of mere parliamentary deliberation and discussion.\n\nTo the propositions already mentioned, Lord North added three others. 1. For repealing the prohibition of exporting gold coin from Great Britain to Ireland, in favour of importing the prohibition to import foreign hops into Ireland, and the drawback on the exportation of foreign hops. 2. For enabling his majesty\u2019s Irish subjects to become members of the Turkey company, and to export woollens in British or Irish bottoms to the Levant. In support of this last resolution his lordship urged, that it was necessary, because the exportation of woollens having been granted to Ireland, the Irish would naturally expect a share in the Turkey trade, which, as matters stood, was not possible, it having hitherto been a received opinion, that no Irishman could be elected a member of the Turkey company. Notwithstanding all the satisfaction, however, with which the news of these bills were received in Ireland, it was not long before thoughts of a different kind began to take place. It was suggested that a free trade could be but of little use, if held by a precarious tenure. The repeal of the obnoxious laws was represented as an act of necessity, not of choice, on the part of the British parliament. When that necessity, therefore, no longer existed, the same parliament might recall the benefits it had granted, and again fetter the Irish trade by restrictions perhaps more oppressive than before. To secure the advantages they now possessed, it was necessary that the kingdom should enjoy the benefits of a free constitution. For this the people looked up to the volunteer companies; and the idea of having such a glorious object in their power, augmented the numbers of those which had also been increased from other causes. They had now received the thanks of both houses of parliament, and thus had obtained the sanction of the legislature. Thus many who had formerly scrupled to connect themselves with a lawless body, made no scruple to enter their lists. Government also engaged several of their friends in the volunteer cause. New companies were therefore raised; but whatever might be the political sentiments of the officers, the private men were universally attached to the popular cause. The national spirit was likewise kept up by several patriotic publications, particularly the letters signed Owen Roe O\u2019Neill, which in an especial manner attracted the public attention; nor was the pulpit backward in contributing its part in the same cause.\n\nTo give the greater weight to their determinations, the volunteers now began to form themselves into battalions; and in a very short time they were all united in this manner, excepting a small number of companies, which, from accidental causes, continued separate. The newspapers were filled with resolutions from the several corps, declaring Ireland to be an independent kingdom, entitled by reason, nature, and compact, to all the privileges of a free constitution; that no power independent in the world, excepting the king, with the lords and commons of Ireland, had or ought to have power to make laws for binding the Irish; and that, in support of these rights and privileges, they were determined to sacrifice their lives and property.\n\nNotwithstanding all this zeal, however, the representatives\nIreland. Sentatives of the people in Ireland seem yet to have behaved in a very supine and careless manner, and to have been entirely obedient to the dictates of government. One of the house of commons declared in the month of April 1780, that \"no power on earth, excepting the kings, lords, and commons of Ireland, had a right to make laws to bind the people.\" \"Every member in the house (says Mr Crawford), one excepted, acknowledged the truth of the proposition, either in express terms, or by not opposing it; and yet, however alluring it may appear, it was evident, that had the question been put, it would have been carried in the negative. The matter was compromised. The question was not put; and nothing relating to it was entered on the journals.\n\nThis inattention, or rather unwillingness, of the majority to serve their country, was more fully manifested in the case of a mutiny bill, which they allowed to be made perpetual in Ireland, though that in England had always been cautiously passed only from year to year. After it was passed, however, some of the zealous patriots, particularly Mr Grattan, took great pains to fet forth the bad tendency of that act. He observed, that standing armies in the time of peace were contrary to the principles of the constitution and the safety of public liberty; they had subverted the liberty of all nations excepting in those cases where their number was small, or the power of the sovereign over them limited in form, respect or other; but it was in vain to think of fetting bounds to the power of the chief magistrate, if the people chose by a statute to bind themselves to give them a perpetual and irresistible force. The mutiny bill, or martial law methodized, was directly opposite to the common law of the land. It fet aside the trial by jury and all the ordinary steps of law; establishing in their stead a summary proceeding, arbitrary crimes and punishments, a secret sentence, and sudden executions. The object of this was to bring those who were subject to it to a state of implicit subordination, and render the authority of the sovereign absolute. The people of England, therefore, from a laudable jealousy on all subjects in which their liberty was concerned, had in the matter of martial law exceeded their usual caution. In the preamble to the mutiny act, they recited part of the declaration of right, \"that standing armies and martial law in time of peace, without the consent of parliament, are illegal.\" Having then stated the purity and simplicity of their ancient constitution, and fet forth the great principle of magna charta, they admitted a partial and temporary repeal of it: they admitted an army, and a law for its regulation, but at the same time they limited the number of the former, and the duration of both; confining the existence of the troops themselves, the law that regulated them, and the power that commanded them, to one year. Thus were the standing forces of England rendered a parliamentary army, and the military rendered effectually subordinate to the civil magistrate, because dependent on parliament. Yet the people of England considered the army, even thus limited, only as a necessary evil, and would not admit even of barracks, lest the folder should be still more alienated from the state of a subject; and in this state of alienation have a post of strength, which would augment the danger arising from his situation. When the parliament of Ireland proceeded to regulate the army, therefore, they ought to have adopted the maxims of the British constitution, as well as the rules of British discipline. But they had totally departed from the maxims and example of the English, and that in the most important concern, the government of the sword. They had omitted the preamble which declared the great charter of liberty; they had left the number of forces in the breast of the king, and under these circumstances they had made the bill perpetual.\n\nIt is probable that the bulk of the Irish nation did not at first perceive the dangerous tendency of the bill in question. The representations of Mr Grattan and others, however, soon opened their eyes, and a general dissatisfaction took place. This was much increased by two unsuccessful attempts in the house of commons; one to obtain an act for modifying Poyning's law; and the other for securing the independency of the judges. An universal disgust against the spiritless conduct of parliament now took place; and the hopes of the people were once more set on the volunteers.\n\nAs it became now somewhat probable that these companies might at last be obliged to assert the rights of their countrymen by force of arms, reviews were appointed. Several of these reviews took place in the course of summer 1780. The spectators in general were struck with the novelty and grandeur of the fight; the volunteers became more than ever the objects of esteem and admiration, and their numbers increased accordingly. The reviews in 1781 exceeded those of the former year; and the dexterity of the corps who had associated more early was now observed to be greater than that of the rest. More than 5000 men were reviewed at Belfast, whose performances were fet off to peculiar advantage by the display of 13 pieces of cannon. They showed their alacrity to serve their country in the field, on a report having arisen that the kingdom was to be invaded by the combined fleets of France and Spain; and for their spirited behaviour on this occasion they received a second time the thanks of both houses of parliament.\n\nSuch prodigious military preparations could not but alarm the British ministry in the highest degree; and it was not to be doubted that the Irish volunteers would come to the same extremities the Americans had done, unless their wishes were speedily complied with. Still, however, it was imagined possible to suppress them, and it was supposed to be the duty of the lord lieutenant to do so. It was during the administration of the duke of Buckingham that the volunteers had grown into such consequence; he was therefore recalled, and the earl of Carlisle appointed in his place. Though it was impossible for the new governor to suppress the spirit of the nation, he found it no difficult matter to obtain a majority in parliament. Thus every redress was for the present effectually denied. Neither the modification of Poyning's law, nor the repeal of the obnoxious parts of the mutiny bill, could be obtained. The volunteers, exasperated at this behaviour, resolved at once to show that they were resolved to do themselves justice, and were conscious that they had power to do so. At a meeting of the officers of the southern battalion of the Armagh regiment, com-\nmanded by the earl of Charlemont, the following resolutions were entered into December 28, 1781.\n\n1. That the most vigorous and effectual methods ought to be pursued for rooting corruption out from the legislative body.\n\n2. For this purpose a meeting of delegates from all the volunteer associations was necessary; and Dungannon, as the most central town in the province of Ulster, seemed to be the most proper for holding such a meeting.\n\n3. That as many and lasting advantages might attend the holding such a meeting before the present session of parliament was much farther advanced, the 15th of February next should be appointed for it.\n\nThese resolutions proved highly offensive to the friends of government, and every method was taken to discourage it. On the appointed day, however, the representatives of 143 volunteer corps attended at Dungannon; and the results of their deliberation were as follows:\n\n1. It having been asserted, that volunteers, as such, cannot with propriety debate or publish their opinions on political subjects, or on the conduct of parliament, or public men, it was resolved unanimously, that a citizen, by learning the use of arms, does not abandon any of his civil rights.\n\n2. That a claim from any body of men, other than the king, lords, and commons of Ireland, to make laws to bind the people, is illegal, unconstitutional, and a grievance.\n\n3. Resolved, with one dissenting voice only, that the powers exercised by the privy council of both kingdoms, under colour or pretence of the law of Poyning, are unconstitutional and a grievance.\n\n4. Resolved unanimously, that the ports of this country are by right open to all foreign countries not at war with the king; and that any burden thereupon, or obstruction thereto, excepting only by the parliament of Ireland, are unconstitutional and a grievance.\n\n5. Resolved, with one dissenting voice only, that a mutiny bill, not limited in point of duration from session to session, is unconstitutional and a grievance.\n\n6. Resolved unanimously, that the independence of judges is equally essential to the impartial administration of justice in Ireland as in England, and that the refusal or delay of this right is in itself unconstitutional and a grievance.\n\n7. Resolved, with 11 dissenting voices only, that it is the decided and unalterable determination of the volunteer companies to seek a redress of these grievances; and they pledged themselves to their country, and to each other, as freeholders, fellow-citizens, and men of honour, that they would, at every ensuing election, support only those who had supported them, and would support them therein, and that they would use all constitutional means to make such pursuit of redress speedy and effectual.\n\n8. Resolved, with only one dissenting voice, that the minority in parliament, who had supported those constitutional rights, are entitled to the most grateful thanks of the volunteer companies, and that an address to the purpose be signed by the chairman, and published with the resolutions of the present meeting.\n\n9. Resolved unanimously, that four members from each county of the province of Ulster, eleven to be a quorum, be appointed a committee till the next general meeting, to act for the volunteer corps, and to call general meetings of the province as occasion requires.\n\n10. The committee being appointed, and the time of general meetings, and some other affairs of a similar nature settled, it was resolved unanimously, that the court of Portugal having unjustly refused entry to certain Irish commodities, the delegates would not consume any wine of the growth of Portugal, and that they would use all their influence to prevent the use of the said wine, excepting what was then in the kingdom, until such time as the Irish exports should be received in the kingdom of Portugal.\n\n11. Resolved, with only two dissenting voices, that they hold the right of private judgment in matters of religion equally sacred in others as in themselves; and that they rejoiced in the relaxation of the penal laws against the Papists, as a measure fraught with the happiest consequences to the union and prosperity of the inhabitants of Ireland.\n\nWhile these proceedings took place at Dungannon, the ministry carried all before them in parliament. In party prevalent a debate concerning the exclusive legislative privileges vails except of Ireland, a law member, speaking of the arbitrary fines in acts of England, asserted, that \"power constituted parliament right;\" and a motion that the commons should be declared the representatives of the people was carried in the negative. These scandalous proceedings could not but hasten the ruin of their cause. The resolutions entered into at the Dungannon meeting were received throughout the kingdom with the utmost applause. A few days after, Mr Grattan, whose patriotism has been Mr Grattan already taken notice of, moved in the house of commons tan's motion for a long and spirited address to his majesty, declaring for an the rights of the kingdom, and afflicting the principle claring the which now began to prevail, that Ireland could legally independent be bound by no power but that of the king, lords, and deny of commons of the country; though the British parliament Ireland had assumed such a power. This motion was at present rejected, rejected by a large majority; but their eyes were soon enlightened by the volunteers.\n\nThese having now appointed their committees of correspondence, were enabled to communicate their sentiments to one another with the utmost facility and quickness. An association was formed in the name of Declaration the nobility, representatives, freeholders, and inhabitants of the counties of Armagh, wherein they set forth lunteers to the necessity of declaring their sentiments openly re-that pur-specting the fundamental and undoubted rights of the people.\n\nThey declared, that, in every situation in life, and with all the means in their power, they would maintain the constitutional right of the kingdom to be governed only by the king and parliament of Ireland; and that they would, in every instance, uniformly and frenziedly oppose the execution of any statutes, excepting such as derived their authority from the parliament just mentioned; and they pledged themselves, in the usual manner, to support what they now declared with their lives and fortune.\n\nThis declaration was quickly adopted by all the other counties, and similar sentiments became universally avowed throughout the kingdom. The change in the British ministry in the spring of 1782 facilitated the wishes of the people. The duke of Portland, who Favourable came over as lord lieutenant in April that year, sent a message of welcome to parliament. He informed them that \"his majesty, being concerned to find that the duke discontented and jealousies were prevailing among his Port-loyal subjects in Ireland, upon matters of great weight land, and importance, he recommended it to parliament to take...\"\nIreland take the same into their most serious consideration, in order to such a final adjustment as might give mutual satisfaction to his kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland.\n\nMr Grattan's second attempt in parliament the address which had been rejected before. On the 16th of April he began a speech to this purpose with a panegyric on the volunteers, and the late conduct of the people. The Irish, he said, were no longer a divided colony, but an united land, manifesting itself to the rest of the world in signal instances of glory. In the rest of Europe the ancient spirit was expired; liberty was yielded, or empire lost; nations were living upon the memory of past glory, or under the care of mercenary armies. In Ireland, however, the people by departing from the example of other nations, had become an example to them. Liberty, in former times and in other nations, was recovered by the quick feelings and rapid impulse of the populace. But in Ireland, at the present period, it was recovered by an act of the whole nation reasoning for three years on its situation, and then refusing itself by a settled tenor of right pervading the land. The meeting of the delegates at Dungannon was an original measure; and, like all of that kind, continued to be matter of surprise, until at last it became matter of admiration. Great measures, such as the meeting of the English at Runnymead, and of the Irish at Dungannon, were not the consequences of precedent, but carried in themselves both precedent and principle; and the public cause in both instances would infallibly have been lost had it been trusted to parliament. The meeting at Dungannon had resolved, that the claim of the British parliament was illegal; and this was a constitutional declaration. The Irish volunteers were associated for the preservation of the laws, but the conduct of the British parliament subverted all law. England, however, had no reason to fear the Irish volunteers; they would sacrifice their lives in her cause. The two nations formed a general confederacy. The perpetual annexation of the crown was a great bond, but magna charta was a greater. It would be easy for Ireland to find a king; but it would be impossible to find a nation who would communicate to them such a charter as magna charta; and it was this which made their natural connection with England. The Irish nation were too high in pride, character, and power, to suffer any other nation to make their laws. England had indeed brought forward the question, not only by making laws for Ireland the preceding session, but by enabling his majesty to repeal all the laws which England had made for America. Had she consented to repeal the declaratory law against America? and would she refuse to repeal that against Ireland? The Irish nation were incapable of submitting to such a dilution.\n\nMr Grattan now found his eloquence much more powerful than formerly. The motion which, during this very session, had been rejected by a great majority, was now agreed to after a short debate, and the address to his majesty prepared accordingly. In this, after thanking his majesty for his gracious message, and declaring their attachment to his person and government, they assured him, that the subjects of Ireland are a free people; that the crown of Ireland is an imperial crown, inseparably annexed to that of Britain, on which connection the interests and happiness of both nations essentially depend; but the kingdom of Ireland is distinct, with a parliament of its own: that there is no body of men competent to make laws to bind Ireland, except the king, lords, and commons thereof, nor any other parliament that hath any power or authority of any sort whatsoever, in this country, except the parliament of Ireland. They assured his majesty, that they humbly conceive, that in this right the very essence of their liberties did exist; a right which they, on the part of all Ireland, do claim as their birthright, and which they cannot yield but with their lives. They assured his majesty, that they had seen with concern certain claims advanced by the parliament of Great Britain, in an act intitled, \"For the better securing the dependency of Ireland,\" an act containing matter entirely irreconcilable to the fundamental rights of the nation. They informed his majesty, that they conceived this act, and the claims it advanced, to be the great and principal cause of the discontent and jealousies in the kingdom. They assured him, that his commons did most sincerely wish, that all the bills, which become law in Ireland, should receive the approbation of his majesty under the seal of Great Britain; but yet, that they conceived the practice of suppreffing their bills in the council of Ireland, or altering them anywhere, to be another just cause of discontent and jealousy. They further assured his majesty, that an act intitled, \"For the better accommodation of his majesty's forces,\" being unlimited in duration, and defective in some other circumstances, was another just cause of jealousy and discontent. These, the principal causes of jealousies and discontent in the kingdom, they had submitted to his majesty, in humble expectation of redress; and they concluded with an assurance, that they were more confident in the hope of obtaining redress, as the people of Ireland had been, and were, not more disposed to share the freedom of England, than to support her in her difficulties, and to share her fate.\n\nTo this remarkable address a most gracious answer was given. In a few days the lord lieutenant made a useful speech to both houses; in which he informed them, that, by the magnanimity of the king, and wisdom of the British parliament, he was enabled to assure them, that immediate attention had been paid to their representations, and that the legislature of Britain had concurred in a resolution to remove the causes of their discontent, and were united in a desire to gratify every wish expressed in the late address to the throne; and that, in the mean time, his majesty was graciously disposed to give his royal assent to acts to prevent the suppreffion of bills in the Irish privy-council, and to limit the mutiny-bill to the term of two years.\n\nThe joy which now diffused itself all over the kingdom was extreme. The warmest addresses were presented not only to his majesty but to the lord lieutenant. The commons instantly voted 100,000l. to his majesty, to enable him to raise 20,000 men for the navy; and soon after, 5000 men were likewise voted in the Irish establishment. The volunteers became in a peculiar manner the objects of gratitude and universal panegyric; but none was placed in so conspicuous\nous a light as Mr Grattan. Addresses of thanks flowed in upon him from all quarters; and the commons addressed his majesty to give him \u00a35,000l. as a recompense of his services; for which they promised to make provision.\n\nThis request was also complied with; but still the jealousies of the Irish were not completely eradicated. As the intended repeal of the declaratory act was found to be simple, without any clause expressly relinquishing the claim of right, several members of the house of commons were of opinion, that the liberties of Ireland were not yet thoroughly secured. The majority, however, were of opinion, that the simple repeal of the obnoxious act was sufficient; but many of the nation at large differed in sentiments. Mr Flood, a member of the house, and a zealous patriot, now took the lead in this matter; while Mr Grattan lost much of his popularity by espousing the contrary opinion. The matter, however, was to appearance finally settled by the volunteers, who declared themselves on Mr Grattan's side. Still some murmurs were heard; and it must be owned, that even yet the conduct of Britain appeared equivocal. An English law was passed, permitting importation from one of the West India islands to all his majesty's dominions; and of course including Ireland, though the trade of the latter had already been declared absolutely free. This was looked upon in a very unfavourable light. Great offence was also taken at a member of the English house of lords for a speech in parliament, in which he asserted, that Great Britain had a right to bind Ireland in matters of an external nature; and proposed to bring in a bill for that purpose. The public discontent was also greatly inflamed by some circumstances relating to this bill, which were particularly obnoxious. Lord Beauchamp, in a letter addressed to one of the volunteer corps, was at pains to show that the security of the legislative privileges obtained from the parliament of Britain was insufficient. The lawyers corps, also, who took the question into consideration, were of the same opinion; but the circumstance which gave the greatest offence was, that the chief justice in the English court of king's bench gave judgement in an Irish cause directly contrary to a law which had limited all such judgements to the first of June. All these reasons of discontent, however, were removed on the death of the marquis of Rockingham, and the appointment of the new ministry who succeeded him. Lord Temple came over to Ireland, and his brother and secretary Mr Grenville went to England, where he made such representations of the discontent which prevailed concerning the insufficiency of the declaratory act, that Mr Townshend, one of the secretaries of state, moved in the house of commons for leave to bring in a bill to remove from the minds of the people of Ireland all doubts respecting their legislative and judicial privileges. This bill contained, in the fullest and most express terms, a relinquishment on the part of the British legislature of all claims of a right to interfere with the judgment of the Irish courts, or to make laws to bind Ireland in time to come. Thus the contest was at last ended; and ever since this kingdom has continued to flourish, and to enjoy the blessings of tranquillity and peace, free from every kind of restriction either on its commerce or manufactures, till the commencement of the rebellion in 1798.\n\nSome time after the above transaction, the commercial propositions of Mr Pitt were rejected by both houses of the Irish parliament; and in the latter end of the year 1788, very warm debates took place on the regency bill; but the sudden and unexpected recovery of his majesty put an end to this political contest. The question respecting the emancipation of the Roman Catholics was much agitated about this period, and the ministry rendered themselves still more popular by appointing Earl Fitzwilliam to succeed the marquis of Buckingham as lord lieutenant of Ireland. It is to be presumed, however, that the joy of the people on this occasion chiefly originated from the hope, that the bill for the Catholic emancipation, brought in by Mr Grattan on the 12th of February 1795, and another on the 14th of the same month, for the diminution of the national expenditure, would be allowed to pass. The bill in favour of Catholic emancipation was rejected on the 4th of May, by a majority of 71, which had a powerful tendency to increase the popular discontent. Of this disaffection the rulers of France determined to avail themselves, and fitted out a fleet for the invasion of Ireland, consisting of 18 sail of the line, 13 frigates, two 120 guns, with transports, and 25,000 men, which were under the command of General Hoche. This formidable armament sailed from Brest on the 10th of December 1796; but so tempestuous was the weather that the fleet was dispersed; the squadron under the command of Admiral Bouvet returned to Brest on the 31st after reaching Bantry bay; a ship of the line and two frigates perished at sea; another French frigate was taken by the British, and a French ship of the line escaped, after fighting for some time against two British ships.\n\nIt was no doubt a fortunate circumstance for Britain, yet the internal anarchy and confusion of Ireland were still rapidly gaining ground. The members of the society of United Irishmen, instituted in the year 1791, professed to have no other objects in view than a reform in parliament, and that the people of every religious profession should enjoy an equality of civil rights; but it was afterwards undeniably proved, that they anxiously wished to bring about a revolution, and establish a republican government, similar to that which then deluged France with blood. The members swore \"to obtain a complete reform in the legislature, on the principles of civil, political, and religious liberty; and never to inform, or give evidence, in any court, against any member of that or similar societies.\" So plausible were these objects, that their numbers increased with astonishing rapidity, and their divisions and subdivisions were soon extended all over the kingdom. Many loyal subjects, afraid of the extension of Roman Catholic privileges, also formed associations under the title of Orangemen, in order to deprive Papists of arms; and they in their turn assumed the name of defenders: in consequence of which the most terrible outrages were committed on both sides. The United Irishmen still continued the most numerous; but the first\nIreland\n\nThe first direct communication between them and the French directory took place in 1795 through the medium of one Mr Lewins; and in the following year the invasion, already mentioned, was concerted on the frontiers of France, between Lord Fitzgerald, Arthur O'Connor, and General Hoche, the failure of which did not seem to intimidate the rebels. Arms continued to be distributed with secrecy among the members, and a correspondence with the French directory was still preserved.\n\nAs proceedings of such a nature were justly alarming to the British government, the Insurrection Act was passed in March 1796, by which magistrates were authorized to place the people under martial law; a measure no doubt justifiable from the alarming nature of the times; but it certainly had the effect of increasing the discontented, and was also productive of numerous acts of oppression. Yet such as were connected with the United Irishmen were guilty of actions equally atrocious. So fully convinced were they of ultimate success, that in December 1797 an executive directory was nominated for the government of the Irish republic, consisting of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, Mr A. O'Connor, Mr Oliver Bond, Dr McNiven, and Counsellor Emmet. With such consummate art was their conspiracy planned, and with such profound secrecy was it conducted, that there is great reason to believe it might have been carried into effect, had not Mr Reynolds made a discovery in March 1798, which led to the apprehension of the principal ringleaders, and Fitzgerald received a mortal wound while resisting the officers. This reverse of fortune did not prevent the nomination of another directory; but its fate was similar to the former, and information was given against them by a Captain Armstrong, who had entered into their society for the purpose of betraying them. John and Henry Sheares, two of the directors, were apprehended on the 21st of May 1798; Mr Neilon and a number more of the same description on the 23rd, and the metropolis was proclaimed in a state of insurrection. The guards were made three times stronger than before; and the whole city might be considered as forming but one garrison. Dublin was thus delivered from the dreadful havoc and devastation premeditated by the rebels; but in the provinces of Leinster and Connaught, as well as in various other places, they appeared in formidable bodies, intercepted the mail coaches, and thus gave the signal for a general insurrection.\n\nIn their attack upon the town of Naas, on the 24th of May, they experienced a signal defeat from Lord Gosford at the head of the Armagh militia, and left 400 men dead on the field. General Dundas defeated a considerable body of the rebels near Kilcullen, and on the 25th Lord Roden vanquished another body of them about 400 strong, the leaders of whom were taken and executed. On the 26th they shared the same fate at Tallagh hill, when 350 of them were slain. They attacked the town of Carlow to the number of 1000, where they were defeated with the loss of 400 men; but as the inhabitants fired upon the king's troops, one half of the town was burnt in revenge. The rebels made an attack upon Kildare on the 29th, but the gallant conduct of Sir J. Duff and the troops under his command, made them soon retire with the loss of 200 men. In Wicklow and Wexford, however, the rebellion raged with the most dreadful fury; in the latter of which they were computed to have 15000 men on the 25th of May, when they surrounded and cut to pieces the North York militia at Oulard, commanded by Colonel Foot and Major Lombard. They attacked and carried the town of Enniscorthy, but with the loss of 400 men, and a party of the Meath militia fell into their hands on the 29th. The town of Wexford surrendered to them next day, when Harvey, Fitzgerald, and Colclough, who had been made prisoners on the 26th for treason, were instantly set at liberty, and Harvey was appointed their commander-in-chief. Having left a garrison in the town, the rebel commander marched on the 5th of June to attack New Ross, where Major-general Johnston obstinately defended the town for several hours, and at last forced the enemy to retreat with considerable loss. This defeat so exasperated the rebels, that they butchered 105 royalists whom they found in the jail of Wexford. Their attempt upon Gorey was ineffectual, as well as that upon Newton Barry on the 3d of June, where Colonel Letrange defeated them with the loss of 500 men killed in the action. On the following day, however, the tide of fortune seemed to turn in their favour near Slievebary mountain, where the royal forces under Colonel Walpole were defeated with the loss of 54 men, and the commander himself was slain in the action. Encouraged by this success, they resolved to make an attack upon Arklow; but the grape-shot of General Needham made terrible havoc among them; yet their strong position near Vinegar hill was still maintained by their main body, from which it was found impracticable to dislodge them before the 21st, when they were nearly surrounded by General Lake, with his troops in five columns, led into action by Generals Dundas, Johnson, Eustace, Duff, and Loftus. The carnage was terrible, as the rebels defended themselves with great obstinacy for an hour and a half, and lost 13 pieces of cannon. The town of Wexford surrendered next day, and on the 26th Harvey and Colclough were apprehended on one of the Saltee islands, who were tried and executed, together with Keughe, the rebel governor of Wexford.\n\nThe details of carnage and bloodshed are by no means agreeable to the feelings of humanity, yet a regard to historical truth obliges us to give them, but in as concise a manner as we possibly can. The rebels gained possession of Antrim about the 7th of June, but were soon obliged to abandon it by the exertions of General Nugent. Still, however, a spirit of insurrection continued formidable in the counties of Antrim and Down; but the rebels were defeated on the 12th at Ballynahinch, where they lost upwards of 400 men, and the royal forces only 20 in killed and wounded. Munro, their general, was taken prisoner and executed. It is to be lamented that both rebels and royalists feigned, during this unnatural contest, to be such utter strangers to every principle of humanity, that some have deemed it a very difficult matter to determine which party was the worst, although the bishop of Killala, who suffered much for his attachment to government, gives it against the latter. This, however, was destined to be terminated in a very short time, for Marquis Cornwallis was now appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland, and arrived in Dublin on the 20th of June.\nThe first measure, adopted by his excellency, soon after his arrival, had a more powerful effect in crushing the rebellion than all the rigorous measures formerly pursued. On the 7th of July he made an offer of his majesty's pardon to all who should surrender before a certain day. The consequence of this proclamation was, that numbers returned to their allegiance, and delivered up all the arms in their possession. Some, however, of the most notorious offenders were tried by a special commission, condemned, and executed, such as J. and H. Sheares, McCann, Byrne, and others. Mr Oliver Bond, who was condemned on the 23rd of July, had powerful interest made for him in order to save his life on account of his respectable connexions. The sentence of death was to be changed into banishment, on condition he would tell all he knew respecting the rebellion. He was accordingly pardoned, but his death happened soon after. Some of the most desperate of the rebels still continued to lurk about the mountains of Wicklow and Wexford, notwithstanding the proclamation of the amnesty, but these were gradually reduced.\n\nIt was the general opinion about this time, that the rebellion was completely ended, when the people were suddenly and unexpectedly alarmed by the landing of a body of French troops under General Humbert. This happened at Killala, on the 22nd of August 1798. Their number being at first very much exaggerated, Lord Cornwallis despaired to march against them in person at the head of the army. In the mean time Humbert marched on towards Castlebar, where he engaged the British forces under General Lake, obliging them to retreat with the loss of six pieces of cannon, and a considerable number of men. Lord Cornwallis came up with the French near Castlebar, and forced them to retreat; and General Humbert having been joined by a number of the rebels, he made a circuitous march in order to favour their escape, in consequence of which the greater part of them got away in safety. Ninety-three of them and three of their generals were taken prisoners. The French having surrendered, the public were astonished to find that this tremendous army amounted to no more than 844 men!\n\nOn the 16th of September a French brig made its appearance off the island of Rutland, on the north-west coast of Donegal, where the crew landed, together with General Rey and the celebrated Napper Tandy, sustaining the rank of a French general of brigade. On inquiring after Humbert, they seemed astonished at being informed that he and his men were prisoners. In the end of September a ship of the line and eight frigates, with troops and ammunition for Ireland, sailed from Brest harbour; but the coast was too well defended by the squadron under the command of Sir J. B. Warren, for such an armament to be successful. The ship of the line, called the Hoche, struck after a gallant defence; and the whole squadron was captured, with the exception of two frigates. This defeat was a death-blow to the hopes of the French as well as to the Irish rebels. The celebrated Theobald Wolfe Tone was found among the prisoners in the Hoche, who was considered as the ablest man at Paris from Ireland, in respect of negotiating. He was tried by a court martial at Dublin, where it was allowed that he made a very weak defence, neither denying nor excusing his crime, but resting the merits of his plea on the idea of his being, as he thought, a citizen of France, and an officer in the service of that country. His arguments, however, were ineffectual, and the court would not even grant his request to be shot rather than hanged, in consequence of which he committed suicide in prison. The spirit of rebellion might be said to die with this wonderful man; for the few rebels who still continued with General Holt, the last of the rebel chiefs, gradually laid down their arms, as did Holt himself, who was banished for life.\n\nAt the termination of this horrible contest, it was computed that not fewer than 30,000 persons lost their lives, independent of many thousands who were wounded or transported.\n\nThe only remaining event of any importance connected with the history of this country, is its union with Great Britain. This event had been long in contemplation, but it was first announced in the British house of commons on the 22nd of January 1799, by a message from his majesty, conceived in these words:\n\n\"George R. His majesty is persuaded, that the unremitting industry with which our enemies persevere in their avowed design of effecting the separation of Ireland from this country, cannot fail to engage the particular attention of parliament; and his majesty recommends it to this house, to consider of the most effectual means of finally defeating this design, by disposing the parliaments of both kingdoms, to provide in the manner which they shall judge most expedient, for settling such a complete and final adjustment, as may best tend to improve and perpetuate a connexion essential for their common security, and consolidate the strength, power, and resources of the British empire.\"\n\nOn the 31st the measure was taken into consideration, when Mr Pitt moved seven resolutions as the basis of it, which were opposed by Mr Sheridan, who gave it as his decided opinion, that the fair and free approbation of parliament could never be ascertained, while any of its members were under government influence, on which account he opposed the union; as did also Messrs Grey, Tierney, Jones, Sir F. Burdett, General Fitzpatrick, Dr Lawrence and others. It also with considerable opposition in the house of peers, and in the Irish parliament the opposition was formidable. In the address to his majesty, the paragraph recommending an union was voted to be expunged, by a majority of 111 against 106, in consequence of which the city of Dublin was twice illuminated. In the house of peers, however, a majority appeared in favour of the union; and when it was introduced in form by a message from the lord lieutenant, it was carried in favour of the union, after a long and interesting debate, by a majority of 161 against 115. The articles of the intended union were transmitted to England by the lord lieutenant; they were again submitted to the British parliament on the 2nd of April; on the 2nd of July the bill received the royal assent, and the union took place on the 1st of January 1801.\n\nIn consequence of this union, which we trust will prove an unspeakable blessing to both countries, the Irish are to have a share of all the commerce of Great Britain, with the exception of such parts of it as belong to chartered companies, and consequently not free to the inhabitants of the British empire indiscriminately.\nThe commons of Ireland are represented by a hundred members in the imperial parliament; the spiritual and temporal peerage of that country by four bishops and twenty-eight lay-lords, who are elected by the bishops and peers of Ireland, and hold their seats for life; and the title of his Britannic majesty is \"king of the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, defender of the faith,\" the title of king of France being now laid aside. The former laws and courts of justice in Ireland are still retained, as also the court of chancery, and the king of Great Britain is still represented by a lord-lieutenant. No part of the debt contracted by Britain prior to the union is to be paid by Ireland, which only contributes to the expenses of the empire in the ratio of 1 to 7\u00bd. But as this in time might prove extravagantly favourable to that country, in consequence of a rapid increase of its trade and commerce, it may be revised and altered by parliament in the course of twenty years. By one clause of the act of union it is declared, that such peers of Ireland as are not elected into the house of lords, are competent to sit in the house of commons as representatives of British towns and counties, on condition that they give up all the privileges of the peerage during their continuance in the lower house.\n\nThe climate of Ireland would almost perfectly agree with that of England, were the soil equally improved, being abundantly fruitful both in corn and grass, especially the latter; in consequence of which, an infinite number of black cattle and sheep are bred, particularly in the province of Connaught. Few countries produce finer grain than that which grows in the improved parts of this kingdom. The northern and eastern counties are best cultivated and inclosed, and the most populous.\n\nIreland is known to have many rich mines; and there is no inconsiderable prospect of gold and silver in some parts of the kingdom. No country in the world abounds more in beautiful lakes, both fresh and salt water ones; and it is also plentifully watered with many beautiful rivers. The commodities which Ireland exports, as far as her present trade will permit, are hides, tallow, beef, butter, cheese, honey, wax, hemp, metals, and fish: wool and flax were, till December 23, 1779, prohibited; but her linen trade is of late grown of very great consequence. England, in the whole, is thought to gain yearly by Ireland upwards of 1,400,000l., and in many other respects she must be of very great advantage to that kingdom. Formerly, indeed, she was rather a burden to her elder sister than any benefit; but the times are changed now, and improve every day.\n\nMr O'Halloran says, the linen manufacture was carried on in Ireland in very early days to a great extent; and Gratianus Lucius quotes a description of the kingdom, printed at Leyden in 1627; in which the author tells us, \"That this country abounds with flax, which is sent ready spun in large quantities to foreign nations. Formerly (says he) they wove great quantities of linen, which was mostly consumed at home, the natives requiring above 30 yards of linen in a shirt or shift.\" So truly expensive was the Irish fashion of making up shirts, on account of the number of plaits and folds, that, in the reign of Henry VIII. a statute passed, by which they were forbidden, under a severe penalty, to put more than seven yards of linen in a shirt or shift.\n\nWe may form some idea of what the trade of Ireland must have been in former times, when, so late as the reign of Brian Boru, who died in 1014, notwithstanding the ravages and dilapidations which a Danish war, of above 200 years continuance, must have produced throughout the kingdom, the annual duties arising from goods imported into the single port of Limerick, and paid in red wine, amounted to 365 pipes! Even so lately as the last century, it is scarcely credible what riches this city derived from the bare manufacture of shoes, which were exported in amazing quantities; whereas now, instead of shoes and boots, we see the raw hides shipped off for foreign markets.\n\nNo country in the world seems better situated for a maritime power than Ireland, where the ports are convenient to every nation in Europe, and the havens safe and commodious. The great plenty of timber, the superior excellence of the oak, and the acknowledged skill of her ancient artizans in wood-works, are circumstances clearly in her favour. That the Irish formerly exported large quantities of timber, is manifest from the churches of Gloucester, Westminster monastery and palace, &c. being covered with Irish oak.\n\nThe government of the kingdom is in the hands of a viceroy, or lord-lieutenant, who lives in very great splendour. In his absence there are lords justices (styled their excellencies), generally three in number, viz. lord primate, lord high chancellor, and, before the union, the speaker of the house of commons. The parliament of Ireland, while it existed, was regulated in the same way as the British parliament.\n\nIreland is divided into four large provinces, and those again into 32 counties, as follows:\n\n### I.

Supposing therefore the numbers to have increased at the same rate, the number of houses now cannot be less than 454,135; which, allowing five persons to a family, will make the number of inhabitants 2,260,650: but as the return of the houses by hearth-collectors is rather under than above the truth, and as there are many families in every parish who are by law excused from that tax, and therefore not returned, the number on a moderate estimate will be 2,500,000. Sir W. Petty reckoned 162,000 cabins without a chimney; and if there be an equal number of such houses now, the number of people will be above 3,000,000.\n\nIt has been frequently observed by the most celebrated writers on political arithmetic, that plenty of food, frequency of marriage, a salubrious climate, a mild and equitable government, and an increased demand for labour, are the never failing criteria of an increasing population in any country whatever. The three first of these have contributed in a very powerful manner to increase the population of Ireland in the 18th century. The climate of that country has changed for the better in a most astonishing degree since the middle of the 17th century. The extensive forests with which it once abounded, no longer exist, to obstruct the circulation of a free current of air; and some inquisitive philosophers have hazarded an opinion, that the atmosphere of Ireland contains a larger proportion of oxygen in any given quantity, than is to be met with in some other countries. It cannot be known what effect this may have on the population of a country, because it is found by eminent chemists, that about 75 of oxygen in 100 parts of atmospheric air, constitute the proportion discovered by analysis of the air in different climates, and at different heights.\n\nThat the population of Ireland is increasing, notwithstanding the ravages of the late rebellion, appears from the rapid increase and flourishing state of trade and commerce, which unavoidably occasions an increase of labour, and that again a multiplication of hands. All articles of the nature of provisions, as well as manufactures, have rapidly increased, and the tillage in particular is five times more extensive than it was about the year 1783, so that five times more people are employed in that single department of labour than were required at the forementioned period. The people thus engaged must also furnish employment for a much greater number of mechanics of all descriptions, as the numerous and varied branches of trade depend on each other like the links of a chain. The astonishing increase of the quantity of many articles imported into Ireland for home consumption, such as coals, drapery, tobacco, tea, and sugar, may be regarded as another decisive proof of an increased population. In 1783, there were 230,135 tons of coals imported, but in 1804 there were 417,030 tons, notwithstanding the consumption was greatly diminished, owing to an augmentation of 7s. per ton on the price of that important article. There were 353,753 yards of old drapery imported in 1783; but in 1804, according to the custom-house books, they amounted to no fewer than 1,330,304 yards, or almost a fourfold increase. In the year 1783, there were imported of tobacco 3,459,861 pounds; but in 1804 that quantity was almost doubled; and as the use of that article has greatly declined, it follows of consequence, that the population has wonderfully increased. The same fact is also proved from the consumption of tea and sugar at these two different periods, the quantity of both articles having been doubled in 1804.\n\nIf then we allow, on an average, six persons to each house in Ireland, it will appear from accurate returns made in the year 1777, that there were 2,692,556 people in that country, and 3,900,000 in 1788. If it be admitted as a fact (in support of which many respectable documents could be produced), that the population of Ireland has, since the year 1791, experienced an annual average increase of nearly 91,448 souls, it may fairly be concluded that the whole inhabitants of that country cannot be estimated much under 5,395,436 souls. It must at the same time be acknowledged, that the causes affecting the population of Ireland have not always operated with uniformity, and therefore a permanently accurate standard cannot be fixed, although there is every reason to believe that it is rather on the increase than the contrary. The average number of persons which we have assigned to each house is indeed greater than what is found to obtain in England or Wales (viz. 5\u00bd), but it is fully warranted by the actual survey of different counties. Mr Arthur Young found the average number to be six in some parts of the province of Ulster; the same at Drumoland in the province of Munster; and at Kilfane it was 6\u00bd.\nMr Tighe considers six as the average number in the county of Kilkenny; while in the town of Cove, and county of Cork, it was found no less than 9\u00bd. The same author asserts that in one village he found the average number to be 9, and in others 7 and 8, so that 6 must be considered as a moderate estimate; and Mr Newenham seems fully warranted, from these considerations, in estimating the population of Ireland, in round numbers, at 5,400,000 souls.\n\nAs numerous reasons conspire to evince, that the population of this country is doubled in the course of 46 years, we think with Mr Newenham, that it is extremely probable that it will not amount to less than 8,413,224 by the year 1837; and yet Ireland is fully competent to support this population, immense as it is.\n\nAccording to Young, Newenham, and others, the soil in point of fertility even surpasses that of England; it contains not such a large proportion of waste land, and many extensive tracts of the productive soil seem to be wholly unrivalled in respect of fertility. For an ample detail of the uncommon richness and fertility of the soil of Ireland in general, we refer our readers to the instructive Tour of Mr A. Young, which contains many experiments made by himself on the soils of different counties.\n\nWhat a valuable acquisition to the British empire, of which it now happily forms a constituent part, since it can augment the military strength of the whole in a very powerful manner, and make such respectable additions to the British revenue as cannot fail to result from its flourishing commerce. Ireland in a state of enmity against Britain, both weakened the latter, and rendered herself vulnerable in a high degree; but since both are happily united, and have only one common interest, we trust that the most daring enemy shall ever find them invulnerable.\n\nBeauty seems to be more diffused in England, among the lower ranks of life, than in Ireland; which may, however, be attributed to the mere modes of living. In England, the meanest cottager is better fed, better lodged, and better dressed, than the most opulent farmers here, who, unaccustomed to what our peasants reckon the comforts of life, know no luxury but in deep potations of aquavite.\n\nFrom this circumstance, we may account for a fact reported by the officers of the army here. They say, that the young fellows of Ireland, who offer to enlist, are more generally below the given height than in England. There can be no appeal from their testimony; for they were Irish, and the standard is an infallible test. No reason, indeed, can be given why the causes which promote or prevent the growth of other animals, should not have similar effects upon the human species. In England, where there is no stint of provisions, the growth is not checked; but, on the contrary, it is extended to the utmost bound of nature's original intention; whereas, in Ireland, where food is neither in the same quantity nor of the same quality, the body cannot expand itself, but is dwarfed and stunted in its dimensions. The gentlemen of Ireland are full as tall as those of England: the difference, then, between them and the commonalty, can only proceed from the difference of food.\n\nThe inhabitants, in general, of this kingdom are very far from, what they have too often and unjustly been represented by those of our country who never saw them, a nation of wild Irish. Miserable and oppressed, as by far too many of them are, an Englishman will find as much civility in general, as amongst the same class in his own country: and, for a small pecuniary consideration, they will exert themselves to please you as much as any people perhaps in the king's dominions. Poverty and oppression will naturally make mankind sour, rude, and unsociable; and eradicate, or at least suppress, all the more amiable principles and passions of humanity. But it should seem unfair and ungenerous to judge of, or decide against, the natural disposition of a man reduced by indigence and oppression almost to desperation. Let commerce, agriculture, and arts, but call forth the dormant activity of their genius, and raise the native spirit of enterprise, which now lies torpid within them; let liberal laws unfetter their minds, and plenty cheer their tables; they will soon show themselves deserving to rank with the most respectable societies in Europe.\n\n\"The lower Irish,\" says Carr, \"are remarkable for their ingenuity and docility, and a quick conception; in Ireland, in their properties they are equalled only by the Scotch. It is curious to see with what scanty materials they will work; they build their own cabins, and make bridles, stirrups, cruppers, and ropes for every rustic purpose, of hay; and British adjutants allow that Irish recruits are sooner made soldiers of than English ones.\n\n\"That the Irish are not naturally lazy, is evident from the quantity of laborious work which they will perform, when they have much to do, which is not frequently the case in their own country, and are adequately paid for it, so as to enable them to get proper food to support severe toil. Upon this principle, in England, an Irish labourer is always preferred.\n\n\"The handomest peasants in Ireland are the natives of Kilkenny and the neighbourhood; and the most wretched and squalid near Cork and Waterford, and in Munster and Connaught. In the county of Roscommon the male and female peasantry and horses are handsome, the former are fair and tall, and possess great flexibility of muscle: the men are the best leapers in Ireland: the finest hunters and most expert huntsmen are to be found in the fine sporting county of Fermanagh. In the county of Meath the peasants are very heavily limbed. In the county of Kerry, and along the western shore, the peasants very much resemble the Spaniards in expression of countenance, and colour of hair.\n\n\"The intrusion of the common people is in the lowest state of degradation. In the summer a wretched uncharacterized itinerant derives a scanty and precarious existence by wandering from parish to parish, and opening a school in some ditch covered with heath and furze, to which the inhabitants send their children to be instructed by the miserable breadloafers being, who is nearly as ignorant as themselves; and in the winter these pedagogue pedlars go from door to door offering their services, and pick up just sufficient to prevent themselves from perishing by famine. What proportion of morals and learning can flow from such a source into the mind of the ragged young pupil, can easily be imagined, but cannot be reflected upon without serious concern.\"\nIreland. concern. A gentleman of undoubted veracity stated, not long since, before the Dublin association for distributing bibles and testaments amongst the poor, that whole parishes were without a bible.\n\n\"Their hospitality, when their circumstances are not too wretched to display it, is remarkably great. It is thus beautifully described by Mr Curran. 'The hospitality of other countries is a matter of necessity, or convention: in savage nations, of the first; in polished, of the latter: but the hospitality of an Irishman is not the running account of policed and ledgered courtezies, as in other countries: it springs, like all his other qualities, his faults, his virtues, directly from the heart. The heart of an Irishman is by nature bold, and he confides; it is tender, and he loves; it is generous, and he gives; it is social, and he is hospitable.'\"\n\nThe bogs wherewith Ireland is in some places overgrown, are not injurious to health, as is commonly imagined: the watery exhalations from these are neither so abundant nor so noxious as those from marshes, which become prejudicial to the various animal and vegetable substances which are left to putrefy as soon as the waters are exhaled by the sun. Bogs are not, as one might suppose from their blackness, masses of putrefaction; but, on the contrary, they are of such a texture, as to resist putrefaction above any other substance we know of. A shoe, all of one piece of leather, very neatly stitched, was taken out of a bog some years ago, yet entirely fresh\u2014from the very fashion of which, there is scarce room to doubt that it has lain there some centuries. Butter, called rougkin, had been found in hollowed trunks of trees, where it had been hid so long, that it was become hard and almost friable, yet not devoid of uneateness; that the length of time it had been buried was very great, we learn from the depth of the bog, which was ten feet, that had grown over it. But the common phenomenon of timber-trees dug out of these bogs not only found, but also so embalmed as afterwards to defy the injuries of time, demonstrate the antiseptic quality of them. The horns of the moose-deer must have lain many centuries in a bog; for the Irish histories do not recognize the existence of the animal whereon they grew. Indeed, human bodies have, in many places, been dug up entire, which must have lain there for ages. The growth of bogs, however, is variable in different places, from the variety of conditions in the situation, soil, humidity, and quantity of vegetable food; in some places it is very rapid, in others very slow; and therefore their altitudes cannot afford any certain measure of time. In the manufacturing counties of the north, peat-fuel has become so scarce, that turberries let from five to eight guineas an acre. In some places they are so eradicated, there does not remain a trace of them, the ground being now converted into rich meadows and sweet pastures.\n\nIf we trust to authorities, we must conclude that Ireland was not originally inferior to England, either in the fertility of the soil or salubrity of the climate. When this country shall have felt the happy effects of the late concessions and indulgences of the British parliament, by repealing several acts which restrained the trade of this kingdom with foreign ports, and allowing the exportation of woollen manufactures and glats, and shall have received further indulgences from the same authority; and when the spirit of industry shall be infused, in consequence of it, into the common people; their country will not be inferior to any other on the globe under the same parallel.","sp":344,"ep":382},{"h":"IRENAEUS","t":"St., a bishop of Lyons, was born in Greece about the year 120.

He calls that a sensible part of the human body, which upon being touched transmits the impression of it to the soul; and in brutes, he calls those parts sensible, the irritation of which occasions evident signs of pain and disquiet in the animal. On the contrary, he calls that insensible, which being burnt, tore, pricked, or cut till it is quite destroyed, occasions no sign of pain nor convulsion, nor any sort of change in the situation of the body. From the result of many cruel experiments he concludes, that the epidermis is insensible; that the skin is sensible in a greater degree than any other part of the body; that the fat and cellular membrane are insensible; and the muscular flesh sensible, the sensibility of which he attributes rather to the nerves than to the flesh itself. The tendons, he says, having no nerves distributed to them, are insensible. The ligaments and capsules of the articulations are also concluded to be insensible; whence Dr. Haller infers, that the sharp pains of the gout are not seated in the capsule of the joint, but in the skin, and in the nerves which creep upon its external surface. The bones are all insensible, says Dr. Haller, except the teeth; and likewise the marrow. Under his experiments the periosteum and pericranium, the dura and pia mater, appeared insensible; and he infers, that the sensibility of the nerves is owing to the medulla, and not to the membranes. The arteries and veins are held susceptible of little or no sensation, except the carotid, the lingual, temporal, pharyngeal, labial, thyroidal, and the aorta near the heart; the sensibility of which is ascribed to the nerves that accompany them. Sensibility is allowed to the internal membranes of the stomach, intestines, bladder, ureters, vagina, and womb, on account of their being of the same nature with the skin: the heart is also admitted to be sensible; but the lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys, are possessed of a very imperfect, if any, sensation. The glands, having few nerves, are endowed with only an obtuse sensation. Some sensibility is allowed to the tunica choroidis and the iris, though in a less degree than the retina; but none to the cornea. Dr. Haller concludes, in general, that the nerves alone are sensible of themselves; and that, in proportion to the number of nerves apparently distributed to particular parts, such parts possess a greater or less degree of sensibility.\n\nIrritability, he says, is so different from sensibility, that the most irritable parts are not at all sensible, and vice versa. He alleges facts to prove this position, and also to demonstrate, that irritability does not depend upon the nerves, which are not irritable, but upon the original formation of the parts which are susceptible of it. Irritability, he says, is not proportioned to sensibility; in proof of which, he observes, that the intestines, though rather less sensible than the stomach, are more irritable; and that the heart is very irritable, though it has but a small degree of sensation.\n\nIrritability, according to Dr. Haller, is the distinguishing characteristic between the muscular and cellular fibres; whence he determines the ligaments, periosteum, meninges of the brain, and all the membranes composed of the cellular substance, to be void of irritability. The tendons are unirritable; and though he does not absolutely deny irritability to the arteries, yet his experiments on the aorta produced no contraction. The veins and excretory ducts are in a small degree irritable, and the gall-bladder, the ductus choledochus, the ureters and urethra, are only affected by a very acid corrosive; but the lacteal vessels are considerably irritable. The glands and mucous sinuses, the uterus in quadrupeds, the human matrix, and the genitals, are all irritable; as are also the muscles, particularly the diaphragm. The oesophagus, stomach, and intestines, are irritable; but of all the animal organs the heart is endowed with the greatest irritability. In general, there is nothing irritable in the animal body but the muscular fibres; and the vital parts are the most irritable. This power of motion, arising from irritations, is supposed\nto be different from all other properties of bodies, and probably resides in the glutinous mucus of the muscular fibres, altogether independent of the influence of the soul. The irritability of the muscles is said to be destroyed by drying of the fibres, congealing of the fat, and more especially by the use of opium in living animals. The physiological system, of which an abstract has been now given, has been adopted and confirmed by Caffell and Zimmermann, and also by Dr Brockleby, who suggests, that irritability, as distinguished from sensibility, may depend upon a series of nerves different from such as serve either for voluntary motion or sensation. This doctrine, however, has been controverted by M. le Cat, and particularly by Dr Whytt in his Physiological Essays.

Some suppose her to be the same as Io, who was changed into a cow, and restored to her human form in Egypt, where she taught agriculture, and governed the people with mildness and equity, for which reasons she received divine honours after death.\n\nAccording to some traditions mentioned by Plutarch, Isis married her brother Osiris, and was pregnant by him even before she had left her mother's womb. These two ancient deities, as some authors observe, comprehended all nature and all the gods of the heathens. Isis was the Venus of Cyprus, the Minerva of Athens, the Cybele of the Phrygians, the Ceres of Eleusis, the Proserpine of Sicily, the Diana of Crete, the Bellona of the Romans, &c. Osiris and Isis reigned conjointly in Egypt; but the rebellion of Typhon, the brother of Osiris, proved fatal to this sovereign. The ox and the cow were the symbols of Osiris and Isis; because these deities, while on earth, had diligently applied themselves to cultivating the earth. As Isis was supposed to be the moon, as Osiris the sun, she was represented as holding a globe in her hand, with a vessel full of ears of corn. The Egyptians believed that the yearly and regular inundations of the Nile proceeded from the abundant tears which Isis shed for the loss of Osiris, whom Typhon had basely murdered. The word *Isis*, according to some, signifies \"ancient,\" and on that account the inscriptions on the statues of the goddesses were often in these words: \"I am all that has been, that shall be; and none among mortals has hitherto taken off my veil.\" The worship of Isis was universal in Egypt, the priests were obliged to observe perpetual chastity, their head was closely shaved, and they always walked barefooted, and clothed themselves in linen garments. They never ate onions, they abstained from salt with their meat, and were forbidden to eat the flesh of sheep and of hogs. During the night they were employed in continual devotion near the statue of the goddess.

These last have observed, that the East Indies, which abound in islands more than any other part of the world, are likewise, more annoyed with earthquakes, tempests, lightnings, volcanoes, &c. than any other part. Others again conclude, that islands are as ancient as the world, and that there were some at the beginning; and among other arguments, support their opinion from Gen. x. 5, and other passages of Scripture.\n\nVarenius thinks that there have been islands produced each of these ways. St Helena, Alcetion, and other steep rocky islands, he supposes to have become so by the sea's overflowing their neighbouring campaigns; but by the heaping up huge quantities of sand, and other terrestrial matter, he thinks the islands of Zealand, Japan, &c. were formed. Sumatra and Ceylon, and most of the East India islands, he thinks, were rent off from the main land; and concludes, that the islands of the Archipelago were formed in the same way, imagining it probable that Deucalion's flood might contribute towards it. The ancients had a notion that Delos, and a few other islands, rose from the bottom of the sea; which, how fabulous soever it may appear, agrees with later observations. Seneca takes notice, that the island Thera rose thus out of the Aegean sea in his time, of which the mariners were eye witnesses.\n\nIt is indeed very probable, that many islands have existed not only from the deluge, but from the creation of the world; and we have undoubted proofs of the formation of islands in all the different ways above-mentioned. Another way, however, in which islands are frequently formed in the South sea, is by the coraline infects. On this subject there is a curious dissertation by Alexander Dalrymple, Esq. in the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1768, to which we refer the reader. See also Geography Index.\n\nIslands of Ice. See Ice Island.\n\nFloating Islands. Histories are full of accounts of floating islands; but the greatest part of them are either false or exaggerated. What we generally see of this kind is no more than the concretion of the lighter and more viscous matter floating on the surface of the water in cakes; and, with the roots of the plants, forming conglomerates of different sizes, which, not being fixed to the shore in any part, are blown about by the winds, and float on the surface. These are generally found in lakes, where they are confined from being carried too far; and, in process of time, some of them acquire a very considerable size. Seneca tells us of many of these floating islands in Italy; and some later writers have described not a few of them in other places. But, however true these accounts might have been at the time when they were written, very few proofs of their authenticity are now to be found; the floating islands having either disappeared again, or been fixed to the sides in such a manner as to make a part of the shore. Pliny tells us of a great island which at one time swam about in the lake Cutilia in the country of Reatinum, which was discovered to the old Romans by a miracle; and Pomponius tells us, that in Lydia there were several islands so loose in their foundations, that every little accident shook and removed them.\n\nIsland (or Icelana) Crystal.

Most of the eastern astronomers and geographers place it in N. Lat. 32\u00b0 25'. E. Long. 86\u00b0 40'. It stands in a very extensive plain, surrounded by mountains; and has eight districts belonging to it, that contain about 400 towns and villages. The fertility of the soil, the mildness of the seasons, and the fine temperature of the air, all conspire to render Ispahan one of the most charming and delightful cities in the world. It is unanimously agreed, that the present city is of no great antiquity; and the two parts into which it is divided, preserve the names of two contiguous towns, from the junction of which it was formed. The inhabitants of these, notwithstanding their neighbourhood, bear an inveterate antipathy to each other; which they discover on all public occasions. Spauhawm owes the glory it now possesses to the great Shah Abas; who, after the conquest of the kingdoms of Lar and Ormus, charmed with the situation of this place, made it the capital of his empire, between the years 1620 and 1628. The mountains, with which this city is surrounded, defend it alike from the sultry heats of summer and the piercing winds of the winter season; and the plain on which it stands is watered by several rivers, which contribute alike to its ornament and use. Of these rivers, the Zenderoud, after being joined by the Mahmood, passes by Spauhawm; where it has three fine bridges over it, and is as broad as the Ispahan Scine at Paris. The waters of these united streams are sweet, pleasant, and wholesome, almost beyond comparison; as indeed are all the springs found in the gardens belonging to the houses of Spauhawm. The extent of Spauhawm is very great; not less perhaps than 20 miles within the walls, which are of earth, poorly built, and so covered with houses and shaded with gardens, that in many places it is difficult to discover them. The Persians are wont to say, Spauhawm nigripetion, i.e. Spauhawm is half the world. Chardin says, that some reckon the number of inhabitants at 1,000,000; but he did not look upon it as more populous than London, or containing more than 600,000. At a distance, the city is not easily distinguished; many of the streets being adorned with plantains, and every house having its garden, the whole looks like a wood. The streets in general are neither broad nor convenient; there being three great evils which attend them: the first is, that being built on common sewers, they are frequently broke up, which is very dangerous, considering that most people are on horseback; the second is, that there are many wells or pits in them, which are not less dangerous; the third arises from the people's emptying all their ordure from the tops of their houses: this last, indeed, is in some measure qualified by the dryness of the air, and by its being quickly removed by the peasants, who carry it away to dung their grounds. Some reckon eight, and others ten gates, besides posterns; but all agree that there is no difficulty of entering at any hour of the day or night. The three principal suburbs annexed to it are, Abas-Abad, built by Shah Abas, and belonging to the people of Tauris; Julfa, inhabited by a colony of Armenians, called by some New Julfa, to distinguish it from the ancient city of that name, situated in Armenia, upon the Araxes, whence the original inhabitants of New Julfa were brought; and Ghebr-Abad, or, as the Arabs pronounce it, Kebr-Abad, the street of the magians, occupied entirely by the professors of magism, or the religion of the ancient Persians. The river Zenderoud separates the city of Ispahan and Abas-Abad from Julfa and Ghebr-Abad. This city has suffered greatly since the commencement of the dreadful revolution in 1721; the whole kingdom from that period, till a few years ago, having been almost a continued scene of blood, ravages, and confusion. A celebrated modern traveller, who was on the spot, tells us, that the inhabitants of Julfa, not many years before the above revolution happened, amounted to 30,000 souls; had 13 churches, and above 100 priests; and paid the Persian court 200 tomans yearly for the free exercise of their religion: that some of the streets were broad and handsome, and planted with trees, with canals and fountains in the middle; others narrow and crooked, and arched at top; others again, though extremely narrow, as well as turning and winding many ways, were of an incredible length, and resembled so many labyrinths: that, at a small distance from the town, there were public walks adorned with plane-trees on either hand, and ways paved with stones, fountains, and cisterns: that there were above 100 caravanserais for the use of merchants and travellers, many of which were built by the kings and prime nobility of Persia: that, as little rain fell there, the streets were frequently full of dust, which rendered the city disagreeable during a considerable\nconsiderable part of the summer; that the citizens, however, to make this inconvenience more tolerable, used to water them when the weather was warmer than usual; that there was a castle in the eastern part of the town, which the citizens looked upon as impregnable, in which the public money, and most of the military stores, were said to be kept; that notwithstanding the baths and caravanserais were almost innumerable, there was not one public hospital; that most of the public buildings were rather neat than magnificent, though the great meydan or market-place, the royal palace (which is three quarters of a league in circumference), and the alley denominated Toher bag adjoining to it, made a very grand appearance; that the former contained the royal mosque; the building denominated kayserich, where all sorts of foreign commodities were exposed to sale; and the mint, styled by the Persians ferra-bhaneh, where the current money of the kingdom was coined; that, besides the native Persians, there were then in Isfahan above 10,000 Indians all supported by trade; 20,000 Georgians, Circassians, and Tartars of Daghestan or Lefgees, with a considerable number of English, Dutch, Portuguese, and a few French; that the Capuchins, disfacedicated or barefooted Carmelites, Jesuits, Dominicans, and Austin friars, had likewise their convents here, though they were unable to make any converts; and that there were above 100 mosques and public colleges. But since the fatal period above mentioned, the suburb of Jaffa was almost totally abandoned by the Armenians. The government of Isfahan, twenty-three leagues long and as many broad, comprehending several districts, most of them formerly well peopled, appeared not many years ago little better than a desert; most of the inhabitants of that fertile and delightful tract being fled and dispersed. Multitudes of them had taken a precarious refuge in the mountains of Loristan, lying between Isfahan and Suffer, whose lands were left untilled, and their houses mouldered into ruins. In short, all the distresses of an unsuccessful war, or the invasion of a barbarous enemy, could not have plunged the people of Isfahan into greater misery than the victories of their tyrannical king Nadir Shah, who seemed more solicitous to humble his own subjects than his enemies.

One great cause of the defeat which the Persians received here was the bad conduct of their monarch, who led his numerous forces into a narrow place, where they had not room to act. Alexander was so much surprized when he first received the news that Darius was behind him, that he could scarcely believe it to be true; but when he was thoroughly satisfied of the fact, and that Darius had again passed the river Pinarus, he called a council of war, wherein, without asking any body's advice, he only told them, that he hoped they would remember their former actions; and that they, who were always conquerors, were about to fight people who were always beat. He further observed, that Darius seemed to be infatuated, since he had with such expedition quitted an open and campaign country, where his numbers might have acted with advantage, to fight in a place inclosed, where the Macedonian phalanx might be well drawn up, and where his numbers could only incommode him. He then made the necessary dispositions for repassing the mountains, posted guards where he found them necessary, and then commanded his troops to refresh themselves, and to take their rest till morning.\n\nAt break of day he began to repass the mountains, obliging his forces to move in close order where the road was narrow, and to extend themselves as they had...\nIffus had more room; the right wing keeping always close to the mountain, and the left to the sea-shore. On the right there was a battalion of heavy-armed troops, besides the targeteers under the command of Nicanor the son of Parmenio. Next these, extending to the phalanx, were the corps of Ctenus and Perdiccas; and on the left the respective bodies commanded by Amyntas, Ptolemy, and Meleager. The foot appointed to support them were commanded by Craterus; but the whole left wing was committed to Parmenio, with strict orders not to decline from the sea-shore, lest the Persians should surround them. Darius ordered 20,000 foot and 30,000 horse to retire, finding that he already wanted room to draw up the rest. His first line consisted of 30,000 Greek mercenaries, having on their right and left 60,000 heavy-armed troops, being the utmost the ground would allow. On the left, towards the mountain, he posted 20,000 men, which, from the hollow situation of the place, were brought quite behind Alexander's right wing. The rest of his troops were formed into close and useless lines behind the Greek mercenaries, to the number in all of 60,000 men. When this was done, he suddenly recalled the horse who had retired, sending part of them to post on his right against the Macedonians commanded by Parmenio; and the rest he ordered to the left towards the mountain: but, finding them unserviceable there, he sent the greatest part of them to the right; and then took upon himself, according to the custom of the Persian kings, the command of the main body. As soon as Alexander perceived that the weight of the Persian horse was disposed against his left wing, he dispatched, with as much secrecy as he could, the Thessalian cavalry thither, and supplied their places on the right by some brigades of horse from the van, and light-armed troops. He also made such dispositions, that notwithstanding the mighty advantage of the hollow mountain, the Persians could not surround him. But, as these precautions had considerably weakened the centre of his army, he ordered those advanced posts on the enemy's left, of which he was most apprehensive, to be attacked at the very beginning of the fight; and, when they were easily driven from them, he recalled as many troops as were necessary to strengthen his centre.\n\nWhen all things were in order, Alexander gave strict command, that his army should march very slowly. As for Darius, he kept his troops fixed in their posts, and in some places threw up ramparts; whence the Macedonians rightly observed, that he thought himself already a prisoner. Alexander at the head of the right wing engaged first, and without any difficulty broke and defeated the left wing of Darius. But, endeavouring to pass the river Pinarus after them, his troops in some measure losing their order, the Greek mercenaries fell upon them in flank, and made them fight, not only for victory, but for their lives. Ptolemy the son of Seleucus, and 120 Macedonians of some rank, were killed upon the spot. But the foot next to Alexander's right wing coming in feebly to its relief, fell upon the mercenaries in flank, amongst whom a dreadful carnage was made; they being in a manner surrounded by the horse and light-armed troops, which at first pursued the left wing, and the foot that now passed the river. The Persian horse on the right still fought gallantly; but, when they were thoroughly informed of the rout of their left wing and of the destruction of the Greek mercenaries, and that Darius himself was fled, they began to break, and betake themselves to flight also. The Thessalian cavalry pursued them close at the heels; and the narrow craggy roads incommode them exceedingly, so that vast numbers of them perished. As for Darius, he fled, soon after the left wing was broken, in a chariot with a few of his favourites: as far as the country was plain and open, he escaped well enough; but, when the roads became rocky and narrow, he quitted it, and mounting a horse, rode all the night: his chariot, in which were his cloak and his bow, fell into the hands of Alexander, who carried them back to his camp.\n\nIn respect to the battle of Iffus, Diodorus informs us, that Alexander looked everywhere about for Darius; and, as soon as he discovered him, with his handful of guards attacked him and the flower of the Persian army which was about him; being as desirous of obtaining this victory by his personal valour, as of subduing the Persian empire by the courage of his soldiers. But when Oxathres, the brother of Darius, saw Alexander's design, and how fiercely he fought to accomplish it, he threw himself, with the horse who were about him, between his brother's chariot and the enemy, where an obstinate fight was maintained, till the dead bodies rose like an entrenchment about the chariot of Darius. Many of the Persian nobility were slain, and Alexander himself was wounded in the thigh. At last the horses in the chariot of Darius started, and became so unruly, that the king himself was forced to take the reins; the enemy, however, pressed so hard upon him, that he was constrained to call for another chariot, and mounted it in great danger. This was the beginning of the rout, which soon after became general. According to this author, the Persians lost 200,000 foot, and 10,000 horse; the Macedonians 300 foot, and 150 horse.\n\nJustin informs us, that the Persian army consisted of 400,000 foot, and 100,000 horse. He says, that the battle was hard fought; that both the kings were wounded; and that the Persians still fought gallantly when their king fled, but that they were afterwards speedily and totally routed: he is very particular as to their loss, which he says amounted to 61,000 foot, 10,000 horse, and 40,000 taken prisoners; of the Macedonians he says there fell no more than 130 foot, and 150 horse. Curtius says, that of the Persians there fell 100,000 foot, and 10,000 horse: of Alexander's army 504, he says, were wounded; 32 foot and 150 horse killed.

The same trials of skill were exhibited here as at the other three.\nthree sacred games; and particularly those of music and poetry.

It is complained, indeed, that it has too many diminutives and superlatives, or rather augmentatives; but without any great reason: for if those words convey nothing farther to the mind than the just ideas of things, they are no more faulty than our pleonasms and hyperboles.\n\nThe language corresponds to the genius of the people, who are slow and thoughtful: accordingly their language runs heavily, though smoothly; and many of their words are lengthened out to a great degree. They have a great taste for music; and to gratify their passion this way, have altered abundance of their primitive words; leaving out consonants, taking in vowels, softening and lengthening out their terminations, for the sake of the cadence.\n\nHence the language is rendered extremely musical, and succeeds better than any other in operas and some parts of poetry: but it fails in strength and nervousness; and a great part of its words, borrowed from the Latin, become so far disguised that they are not easily Italian characterized.\n\nThe multitude of sovereign states into which Italy has been divided has given rise to a great number of different dialects in that language; which, however, are all good in the place where they are used. The Tuscan is usually preferred to the other dialects, and the Roman pronunciation to that of the other cities; whence the Italian proverb, Lingua Toscana in bocca Romana.\n\nThe Italian is generally pretty well understood throughout Europe; and is frequently spoken in Germany, Poland, and Hungary. At Constantinople, in Greece, and in the ports of the Levant, the Italian is used as commonly as the language of the country: indeed in those places it is not spoken so pure as in Tuscany, but is corrupted with many of the proper words and idioms of the place; whence it takes a new name, and is called Frank Italian.","sp":391,"ep":391},{"h":"ITALIC CHARACTER","t":"in Printing.

Its length from Aosta, at the foot of the Alps in Savoy, to the utmost verge of Calabria, is about 600 miles; but its breadth is very unequal, being in some places near 400 miles, in others not above 25 or 30.\n\nItaly was anciently known by the names of Saturnia, Oenotria, Hesperia, and Aufonia. It was called names, Saturnia from Saturn; who, being driven out of Crete by his son Jupiter, is supposed to have taken refuge there. The names of Oenotria and Aufonia are borrowed from its ancient inhabitants the Oenotrians and Aufones; and that of Hesperia or Western was given it by the Greeks, from its situation with respect to Greece. The name of Italia, or Italy, which in process of time prevailed all over the rest, is by some derived from Italos, a king of the Siculi; by others, from the Greek word Italos, signifying an ox; this country abounding, by reason of its rich pastures, with oxen of an extraordinary size and beauty. All these names were originally peculiar to particular provinces of Italy, but afterwards applied to the whole country.\n\nThis country, like most others, was in ancient times divided into a great number of petty states and kingdoms. Afterwards when the Gauls settled in the western, and many Greek colonies in the eastern parts,\nItaly, it was divided, with respect to its inhabitants, into three great parts, viz. Gallia Cisalpina, Italy properly so called, and Magna Graecia. The most western and northern parts of Italy were in great part peopled by the Gauls; and hence took the name of Galia, with the epithets of Cisalpina and Citerior, because they lay on the side of the Alps next to Rome; and Togata, with relation to the Roman gown or dress of which the inhabitants used; but this last epithet is of a much later date than the former. This appellation was antiquated in the reign of Augustus, when the division of Italy into eleven provinces, introduced by that prince, took place. Hence it is that the name of Cisalpine Gaul frequently occurs in the authors who flourished before, and scarce even in those who wrote after, the reign of Augustus. This country extended from the Alps and the river Varus, parting it from Transalpine Gaul, to the river Aelius; or, as Pliny will have it, to the city of Ancona, in the ancient Picenum. On the north, it was divided from Rhaetia by the Alps, called Alpes Rhaeticae; and from Illyricum by the river Formio: but on this side, the borders of Italy were, in Pliny's time, extended to the river Arbia in Istria. On the south, it reached to the Ligurian sea, and the Apennines parting it from Etruria; so that under the common name of Cisalpine Gaul were comprehended the countries lying at the foot of the Alps, called by Pliny and Strabo the Subalpine countries, Liguria, Gallia Cispadana and Transpadana, Italy, properly so called, extended, on the coast of the Adriatic, from the city of Ancona to the river Trento, now the Fortore; and on the Mediterranean, from the Macra to the Silanus, now the Sele. Magna Graecia comprised Apulia, Lucania, and the country of the Brutii. It was called Greece, because most of the cities on the coast were Greek colonies. The inhabitants gave it the name of Great, not as if it was larger than Greece, but merely out of ostentation, as Pliny informs us.\n\nAll these countries were inhabited by a great number of different nations settled at different times, and from many different parts. The names of the most remarkable of them were the Aborigines, or those whose origin was utterly unknown, and consequently were thought to have none; the Sabines, Hetrurians or Tuscani, the Umbri, Samnites, Campani, Apuli, Calabri, Lucani, the Brutii, and the Latins. From a colony of the latter proceeded the Romans, who gradually subdued all these nations one after another, and held them in subjection for upwards of 700 years. All these nations were originally brave, hardy, temperate, and well skilled in the art of war; and the Romans much more so than the rest. Their subjection to Rome, however, inured them to slavery; their oppression by the emperors broke their spirit; and the vast wealth which was poured into the country from all parts of the world, during the time of the Roman prosperity, corrupted their manners, and made them degenerate from their former valour. Of this degeneracy the barbarous nations of the north took the advantage to invade the empire in innumerable multitudes. Though often repelled, they never failed to return; and it was found necessary to take great numbers of them into the Roman service, in order to defend the empire against the rest of their countrymen.\n\nIn the year 476, the Heruli, presuming on the services they had done the empire, demanded a third part of the lands of Italy; and being refused, chose one by the He-odoacer, a man of low birth, but of great valour and ruli- experience, for their king; and having totally destroyed the remains of the Roman empire, proclaimed Odoacer king of Italy. The new monarch, however, did not think proper to alter the Roman form of government, but suffered the people to be governed by the senate, consuls, &c., as before. He enjoyed his dignity in peace till the year 488, when Zeno, emperor of Constantinople, being hard pressed by Theodoric king of the Ostrogoths, advised him to turn his arms against Odoacer, whom he could easily overcome, and thus make himself sovereign of one of the finest countries in the world.\n\nTheodoric accepted the proposal with great joy, invaded by and set out for Italy, attended by an infinite number of people, carrying with them their wives, children, effects, on waggons. Several Romans of great distinction attended him in this war; while, on the other hand, many of his countrymen chose to remain in Thrace, where they became a separate nation, and lived for a long time in amity with the Romans. The Goths, being destitute of shipping, were obliged to go round the Adriatic. Their march was performed in the depth of winter; and during the whole time, a violent famine and plague raged in their army. They were also opposed by the Gepidae and Sarmatians; but at last having defeated these enemies, and overcome every other obstacle, they arrived in Italy in the year 489. Theodoric advanced to the river Santius, now Zonzo, near Aquileia, where he halted for some time to refresh his troops. Here he was met by Odoacer at the head of a very numerous army, but composed of many different nations commanded by their respective chiefs, and consequently without sufficient union or zeal for the common cause. Theodoric therefore gained an easy victory, cut many of his enemies in pieces, and took their camp. Odoacer retired to the plains of Verona, and encamped there at a small distance from the city; but Theodoric pursued him close, and soon forced him to a second engagement. The Goths obtained another victory; but it cost them dear. Odoacer's men made a much better resistance than before, and great numbers fell on both sides. The victory, however, was so far decisive, that Odoacer was obliged to shut himself up in Ravenna; so that Theodoric having now no enemy to oppose him in the field, besieged and took several important places, and among the rest Milan and Pavia. At the same time, Tufa, commander in chief of Odoacer's forces, deserted to the enemy with the greatest part of the troops he had with him, and was immediately employed in conjunction with a Gothic officer in pursuit of his sovereign. Odoacer had left that city, and was advanced as far as Faenza, where he was closely besieged by Tufa; but the traitor, declaring again for his old master, joined him with all his troops, and delivered up several officers that had been appointed by Theodoric to serve under him. These were sent in irons to Ravenna; and Odoacer being joined by Frideric, one of Theodoric's allies, with a considerable body of troops, once more advanced against his enemies. He recovered all Liguria, took the city of\nItaly. Milan, and at last besieged Theodoric himself in Pavia. The Goths, having brought all their families and effects along with them, were greatly distressed for want of room; and must have undoubtedly submitted, if their enemies had continued to agree among themselves. The quarrels of his followers proved the ruin of Odoacer. Theodoric finding that the enemy permitted the vigour of their operations, applied for succours to Alaric king of the Visigoths, who had settled in Gaul. As the Visigoths and Ostrogoths were originally one and the same nation, and the Visigoths had received among them some years before a great number of Ostrogoths under the conduct of Videmer cousin-german to Theodoric, the supplies were readily granted. The inaction of the enemy gave these succours time to arrive; upon which Theodoric instantly joined them, and marching against his enemies gave them a total overthrow. Odoacer again took refuge in Ravenna, but was closely besieged by Theodoric in 492. The siege lasted three years; during which Odoacer defended himself with great bravery, and greatly annoyed the besiegers with his fallacies. Theodoric, however, impatient of delay, leaving part of his army to blockade the city, marched with the rest against the strong holds which Odoacer had garrisoned. All these he reduced with little difficulty; and in 492 returned to the siege of Ravenna. The besieged were now reduced to great limits both by the enemy without and a famine within, the price of wheat being risen to fix pieces of gold per bushel. On the other hand, the Goths were quite worn out with the fatigues of such a long siege; so that both parties being willing to put an end to the war, Odoacer sent John bishop of Ravenna to Theodoric with terms of accommodation. Jornandes informs us, that Odoacer only begged his life; which Theodoric bound himself, by a solemn oath, to grant him: but Procopius says, that they agreed to live together on equal terms. This last seems very improbable; but whatever were the terms of the agreement, it is certain that Theodoric did not keep them; for having a few days after invited Odoacer to a banquet, he dispatched him with his own hand. All his servants and relations were massacred at the same time: except his brother Arnulphus, and a few more, who had the good luck to make their escape, and retired beyond the Danube.\n\nTheodoric thus Theodoric became master of all Italy, and proclaimed took upon himself the title of king of that country, as king of Ita. Odoacer had done before; though, with a pretended ly, and uses deference to the emperor of Constantinople, he sent messengers asking liberty to assume that title after he had actually taken it. Having secured his new kingdom as well as he could by foreign alliances, Theodoric next applied himself to legislation, and enacted many salutary laws besides those of the Romans which he retained. He chose Ravenna for the place of his residence, in order to be near at hand to put a stop to the incursions of the barbarians. The provinces were governed by the same magistrates that had presided over them in the times of the emperors, viz., the consuls, correctors, and praefects. But besides these, he sent, according to the custom of the Goths, inferior judges, distinguished by the name of counts, to each city. These were to administer justice, and to decide all controversies and disputes. And herein the policy of the Goths far excelled that of the Romans. For in the Roman times a whole province was governed by a consularius, a corrector, or a praefect, who resided in the chief city, and to whom recourse was to be had at a great charge from the most remote parts; but Theodoric, besides these officers, appointed not only in the principal cities, but in every small town and village, inferior magistrates of known integrity, who were to administer justice, and by that means save those who had law-suits the trouble and expense of recurring to the governor of the whole province; no appeals to distant tribunals being allowed, but in matters of the greatest importance, or in cases of manifest injustice.\n\nUnder the administration of Theodoric Italy enjoyed as great happiness as had been experienced under the very best emperors. As he had made no alteration in the laws except that above mentioned; so he contented himself with the same tributes and taxes that had been levied by the emperors; but was, on all occasions of public calamity, much more ready to remit them than most of the emperors had been. He did not treat the natives as those of the other Roman provinces were treated by the barbarians who conquered them. These stripped the ancient proprietors of their lands, estates, and possessions, dividing them among their chiefs; and giving to one a province with the title of duke, to another a frontier country with the title of marquis; to some a city with the title of count, to others a castle or village with the title of baron. But Theodoric, who piqued himself upon governing after the Roman manner, and observing the Roman laws and institutions, left every one in the full enjoyment of his ancient property. As to religion, though he himself, like most of his countrymen, professed the tenets of Arius, he allowed his subjects to profess the orthodox doctrine without molestation, giving liberty even to the Goths to renounce the doctrines in which they had been educated, and embrace the contrary opinions. In short, his many virtues, and the happiness of his subjects, are celebrated by all the historians of those times. The end of his reign, however, was fulfilled by the death of the celebrated philosopher Boethius, and his father-in-law Symmachus. They were both beheaded, Beheaded in Pavia, on an unjust suspicion of treason; and Boethius and Symmachus was the sentence put in execution when the king repented, and abandoned himself to the most pungent and dies of sorrow. The excess of his grief affected his understanding; griefing: for not long after, the head of a large fish being served up to supper, he fancied the head of the fish to be that of Symmachus threatening him in a ghastly manner. Hereupon, seized with horror and amazement, he was carried to his bed-chamber, where he died in a few days, on the 2d of September 526.\n\nAfter the death of Theodoric, the kingdom devolved to Athalaric his grandson; who being at that time only eight years of age, his mother Amalafuntha took upon her the regency. Her administration was equally upright with that of Theodoric himself; but the barbarians of whom her court was composed, finding fault with the encouragement she gave to learning, forced the regent to abandon the education of her son. The latter thereupon plunged into all manner of wickedness, and behaved to his mother with the greatest arrogance; and, the faction finding themselves thus strengthened, at last commanded the queen to retire from court.\n\nAmalafuntha,\nAmalasuntha, exerting her authority, seized three of the ringleaders of the sedition, whom she confined in the most remote parts of Italy. But these maintaining a secret correspondence with their friends and relations, never ceased to stir up the people against her; infomuch, that the queen, apprehending that the faction might in the end prevail, wrote to the emperor Justinian, begging leave to take refuge in his dominions. The emperor readily complied with her request, offering a noble palace at Durazzo for her habitation; but the queen having in the mean time caused the three ringleaders to be put to death, and no new disturbances arising thereupon, she did not accept of the emperor's offer. In 533, Athalaric having contracted a lingering distemper by his riotous living and debaucheries, Amalasuntha, to avoid the calamities with which Italy was threatened in case of his death, formed a design of delivering it up to Justinian; but before her scheme was ripe for execution, Athalaric died. Upon which the queen took for her colleague one Theodotus her cousin; obliging him, however, to swear that he would foster her to enjoy and exercise her former power. This he very readily did, but soon forgot his promise; and when she took the liberty to remind him of it, caused her to be feigned and confined in an island of the lake Bolsena in Tuscany. But as Theodotus had great reason to believe that this conduct would be resented by Justinian, he obliged her to write to him that no injury or injustice had been done her. Along with this letter he sent one written by himself, and filled with heavy complaints against Amalasuntha. The emperor, however, was so far from giving credit to what Theodotus urged against her, that he openly espoused her cause, wrote her a most affectionate letter, and assured her of his protection. But before this letter could reach her, the unhappy princess was strangled in the bath by the friends of those whom in the reign of her son she had deservedly put to death for raising disturbances in the state.\n\nOn the news of Amalasuntha's death, Justinian resolved upon an immediate war with the Goths; and, to facilitate the enterprise, used his utmost endeavours to induce the Franks to assist him. To his solicitations he added a large sum of money; which last was very acceptable to his new allies. They promised to assist the emperor to the utmost of their power; but instead of performing their promise, while Justinian's arms were employed against the Goths, Thierri, the eldest son of Clovis, seized several cities of Liguria, the Alpes Cottiae, and great part of the present territory of Venice, for himself. Justinian, however, found sufficient resources in the valour of Belisarius, notwithstanding the defection of his treacherous allies. This celebrated general was vested with the supreme command, and absolute authority. His instructions were to pretend a voyage to Carthage, but to make an attempt upon Sicily; and if he thought he could succeed in the attempt, to land there; otherwise to sail for Africa, without discovering his intentions. Another general, named Mundus, commander of the troops in Illyricum, was ordered to march into Dalmatia, which was subject to the Goths, and attempt the reduction of Salona, the better to open a passage into Italy. This he accomplished without difficulty, and Belisarius made himself master of Sicily sooner than he himself had expected. The island was reduced on the last of December 535; upon which Belisarius, without loss of time, passed over to Reggio, which opened its gates to him. From Reggio he pursued his march to Rome, the provinces of Abrutium, Lucania, Puglia, Calabria, and Samnium, readily submitting to him. The city of Naples endured a siege; but Belisarius entered through an aqueduct, and gave it up to be plundered by his followers.\n\nTheodotus alarmed at these successes, and having neither capacity nor inclination to carry on the war, sent ambassadors to Justinian with proposals of peace. He agreed to renounce all pretensions to the island of Sicily; to send the emperor yearly a crown of gold weighing 300 pounds; and to supply him with 3000 men whenever he should think proper to demand them. Several other articles were contained in the proposal, which amounted to the owning of Justinian for his lord, and that he held the crown of Italy only through his favour. As he apprehended, however, that these offers might not yet be satisfactory, he recalled his ambassadors for further orders. They were now directed to inform Justinian, that Theodotus was willing to resign the kingdom to him, and content himself with a pension suitable to his quality. But he obliged them by an oath not to mention this proposal, till they found that the emperor would not accept of the other. The first proposals were accordingly rejected as they had supposed; upon which the ambassadors produced the second, signed by Theodotus himself, who in his letter to the emperor told him, among other things, that being unacquainted with war, and addicted to the study of philosophy, he preferred his quiet to a kingdom. Justinian, transported with joy, and imagining the war already finished, answered the king in a most obliging manner, extolling his wisdom, and giving him besides what he demanded the greatest honours of the empire. The agreement being confirmed by mutual oaths, lands were assigned to Theodotus out of the king's domain, and orders were dispatched to Belisarius to take possession of Italy in his name.\n\nIn the mean time, a body of Goths having entered Dalmatia, with a design to recover the city of Salona, were encountered by an inferior army of Romans, commanded by the son of Mundus above mentioned. The Goths proved victorious; and the young general of the Romans was killed, and most of his army cut in pieces. Mundus marched against the enemy to revenge the death of his son; but met with no better success, his troops being defeated, and he himself killed in the engagement. Upon this the Romans abandoned Salona and all Dalmatia; and Theodotus, elated with his success, refused to fulfil the articles of the treaty. Justinian dispatched Constansianus, an officer of great valour and experience, into Illyricum, with orders to raise forces there, and to enter Dalmatia; at the same time he wrote to Belisarius to pursue the war with the utmost vigour.\n\nThe Goths were now reduced to the greatest straits. Constansianus drove them out of Dalmatia; and Belisarius having reduced all the provinces which compose the present kingdom of Naples, advanced towards Rome. The chief men of the nation, finding their king incapable of preventing the impending ruin, assembled\nItaly. semblable without his consent, and dispatched ambass-\nsadors to Belifarius with proposals of peace. These \nproposals were rejected; and Belifarius returned for \nanswer, that he would hearken to no terms, nor heath \nhis sword, till Italy was reannexed to the empire to \nwhich it belonged. The Goths finding Theodotus \nstill inactive, unanimously deposed him; and chose in \nhis stead one Vitiges, a man of great valour, but of a \nmean descent. Theodotus fled to Ravenna; but the \nnew king dispatched after him a messenger, who soon \novertook him and cut off his head.\n\nVitiges began his government by writing a circular \nletter, in which he exhorted his countrymen to exert \ntheir ancient courage, and fight bravely for their lives \nand liberties. He then marched with what forces he \ncould collect towards Rome; but not thinking himself \nable to defend that city against the Roman forces, he \nabandoned it to Belifarius, and arriving at Ravenna \nwas joined by the Goths from all parts, so that he \nsoon found himself at the head of a considerable army. \nBelifarius in the mean time entered Rome without op-\nposition, on the 9th or 10th of December 537. The \nGothic garrison retired by the Porta Flaminia, while \nBelifarius entered by the Porta Asinaria. Leudaris, \ngovernor of the city, who stood behind, was sent, to-\ngether with the keys, to the emperor. Belifarius \nimmediately applied himself to the repairing of the \nwalls and other fortifications; filled the granaries \nwith corn, which he caused to be brought from Sicily; \nand stored the place with provisions, as if he had been \npreparing for a siege; which gave no small uneasiness \nto the inhabitants, who chose rather that their city \nshould lie open to every invader, than that they should \nbe liable to the calamities of a siege. While Belifarius \nwas thus employed at Rome, the city of Benevento, \nwith great part of the territory of Samnium, was de-\nlivered up to him: at the same time the cities of Nar-\nnia, Spoleto, and Perugia, revolting from the Goths, \nreceived Roman garrisons; as did most of the cities of \nTuscany.\n\nIn the mean time, Vitiges having collected an army \nof 150,000 men, resolved to march directly to Rome, \nand engage Belifarius; or, if he declined an engage-\nment, to lay siege to the city. But apprehending \nthat the Franks, who were in confederacy with the \nemperor, might fall upon him at the same time, he \nsent ambassadors to them, with offers of all the Gothic \npossessions in Gaul, besides a considerable sum of \nmoney, provided they joined him against the emperor. \nThe Franks with their usual treachery consented to the \nproposal, received the money and the territories agreed \non, and then refused to fulfil the terms of the treaty. \nVitiges, however, began his march to Rome, leaving \nbehind him all the fortified towns on the road, the \nreduction of which he knew would cost him too much \ntrouble. Belifarius, whose army, reduced by the \nmany towns he had garrisoned, did not now amount \nto above 5000 men, dispatched messengers to Constan-\ntianus in Tuscany; and to Bellas, by nation a Goth, \nbut of the emperor's party, in Umbria, with orders \nto join him with all possible expedition; writing at \nthe same time to the emperor himself for supplies in \nthe most pressing manner. Constantianus joined him \npursuant to his orders; and soon after, Bellas, fall-\ning in with part of the enemy's vanguard, killed a \nconsiderable number of them, and put the rest to flight. \nBelifarius had built a fort upon a bridge about a mile \nfrom Rome, and placed a strong garrison in it to \ndispute the passage with the enemy; but the garrison, \nfeeling with a panic at the approach of the Goths, \nabandoned their post in the night, and fled into Cam-\npania. Early in the morning Vitiges passed over great \npart of his army, and marched on till he was met by \nBelifarius, who, knowing nothing of what had hap-\npened, came with 1000 horse to view the ground \nabout the bridge. He was greatly surprized when he \nbeheld the enemy marching up against him; however, \nengaged lest he should heighten their courage by his flight or \nmen be-\nretreat, he stood his ground, and received the enemy at \nthe head of his small body, exposing himself, without \nhis usual prudence and discretion, to the greatest dan-\ngers. Being known by some fugitives, and discovered \nto the enemy, they all aimed at him alone, which \nmade his own men the more solicitous to defend him; \nso that the whole contest was for some time about his \nperson. At last the Goths were driven back to their \ncamp, which the Romans with great temerity attempt-\ned to force. In this attempt, however, they met with \nsuch a vigorous resistance, that they soon abandoned \nthe enterprise, and retired with precipitation to a \nneighbouring eminence; whence they were forced down \nby the enemy, put to flight, and pursued to the very \ngates of the city. Here they were in greater danger \nthan ever; for those within, fearing that the enemy \nmight in that confusion enter with them, refused to \nadmit them. The general himself cried out earnestly \nto them, telling who he was, and commanding them \nto open the gates; but as they had been informed by \nthose who first fled, that he was slain, and they could \nnot distinguish him on account of the blood and dust \nwith which his face was covered, they gave no ear to \nwhat he said. In this extremity, having encouraged \nhis men, who were now driven into a narrow compass, \nto make a last effort, he put himself at their head, and \nattacked the enemy with such fury, that the Goths \nimagining fresh troops were falling out upon them, \nbegan to give ground, and at last retired to their \ncamp. The Roman general did not pursue them; but \nentered the city, where he was received with loud accla-\nmations.\n\nA few days after, the city was closely invested by \nVitiges; who, to distress the inhabitants, pulled down \nthe aqueducts by which water was conveyed into the Goths' \ncity, and which had been built at an immense charge \nby the Roman emperors. Belifarius on his part omit-\nted nothing for his defence; in such that the coward-\nly citizens assembled in a tumultuous manner, and railed \nat the general on account of his supposed temerity. \nVitiges, to encourage this mutinous disposition, dis-\npatched ambassadors to the senate with proposals of \npeace. These ambassadors, however, were dismissed \nwithout any answer, and the siege was begun with \ngreat vigour. Belifarius made a gallant defence, and \nin seven months is said to have destroyed 40,000 of \nthe Goths. About this time he received a supply of \n1600 archers from the emperor; and these, in several \nsuccessful actions, are said to have killed 4000 more of \nthe enemy.\n\nThe Romans, elated with their successes, now be-\ncame impatient for an engagement; and at last, not-\nwithstanding\nwithstanding all the remonstrances of their general, forced him to lead them out against the enemy. The success was answerable to the rash attempt. The Romans were defeated, with the loss of some of their bravest officers, and a great many of their common soldiers; after which they contented themselves with falling out in small parties, which they commonly did with the greatest success.\n\nBut though the Romans had the satisfaction of thus cutting off their enemies, they were most grievously afflicted with a famine and plague; insomuch that the inhabitants, no longer able to bear their calamities, were on the point of forcing Belisarius to venture a second battle, when a reasonable supply of troops, viz. 3000 Ilaurians, 800 Thracian horse, and 1300 horde of other nations, together with 500 Italians who joined them by the way, arrived at Rome. Belisarius immediately fell back by the Flaminian gate, and fell upon the Goths in order to give his allies time to enter by the opposite side of the city, which they did without the loss of a man.\u2014The Goths hearing of the arrival of these troops, and their numbers being magnified as is usual in such cases, began to despair of becoming masters of the city; especially as the famine and plague raged with great violence in their camp, and their army was much reduced. Ambassadors were therefore dispatched to Belisarius with proposals of peace; but the only thing they could obtain was a cessation of arms for three months, during which time they might send ambassadors to the emperor. The negotiations with the emperor, however, proved unsuccessful; and the siege was pursued with great vigour till Vitiges received the news of the taking of Rimini by the Romans. As this city was but a day's journey from Ravenna, the Goths were so much alarmed, that they immediately raised the siege of Rome, after it had continued a year and nine days. Belisarius fell upon their rear as they passed the bridge of the Tiber, and cut great numbers of them in pieces, while others, struck with panic, threw themselves into the river and were drowned.\n\nThe first enterprise of Vitiges, after raising the siege of Rome, was an attempt upon Rimini; but while he was employed in this siege, the Romans made themselves masters of Milan; upon which a Gothic general, named Uraia, was immediately dispatched with a powerful army to retake it. In the mean time, however, a supply of 7000 Romans arrived from the emperor, under the command of Narset, a celebrated general. The immediate consequence of this was the raising of the siege of Rimini; for Vitiges perceiving the two Roman armies coming against him, and concluding, from the many fires they made, that they were much more numerous than they really were, fled in such haste, that the greatest part of the baggage was left behind. The confusion of the Goths was so great, that, had not the garrison been extremely feeble, they might have easily cut them off in their retreat, and thus put an end to the war at once. The success of the Romans, however, was now retarded by some misunderstandings between the two generals: so that, though Belisarius made himself master of Urbinum and Urbicentum, while Narset reduced some other places, yet the important city of Milan was suffered to fall into the hands of the Goths, who massacred all the inhabitants that were able to bear arms, to the number of 300,000, and sold the women for slaves. The city was also totally demolished; and this disaster made such an impression on the mind of Justinian, that he immediately recalled Narset, and gave the command of his troops to Belisarius.\n\nVitiges, who had promised himself great advantages from the disagreement of the two generals, was much disappointed by the recall of Narset; and therefore dreading the power of Belisarius when at the head of a formidable army, thought of engaging in alliance with some foreign prince. In his choice, however, he was somewhat at a loss. He knew the treachery of the Franks, and therefore did not apply to them. He applied to the Lombards; but, though tempted by the offer of a large sum of money, they continued inviolably attached to the Roman interest. At last he found means to persuade Chosroes king of Persia to make war upon Justinian, which he thought would infallibly procure the recall of Belisarius. But the Roman general, understanding his design, pushed on the war in the most vigorous manner; while, in the meantime, the treacherous Franks, thinking both nations sufficiently weakened by their mutual hostilities, resolved to attack both, and seize upon the country for which they contended. Accordingly, Theodebert, unmindful of the oaths he had taken both to the Goths and Romans, passed the Alps at the head of 150,000, or, as some will have it, 200,000 men, and entered Liguria. As no hostilities were committed by them on their march, the Goths concluded that they were come to their assistance; and therefore took care to supply them with provisions. Thus they crossed the Po without opposition; and having secured the bridge, marched towards the place, where a body of Goths was encamped; who, looking upon them as friends, admitted them without hesitation. But they were soon convinced of their mistake; for the Franks falling unexpectedly upon them, drove them out of the camp with great slaughter, and seized on their baggage and provisions. A body of Romans that lay at a small distance from the Goths concluding that they had been defeated by Belisarius, advanced with great joy to meet him as they imagined; but the Franks falling unexpectedly upon them, drove them out of the camp with great slaughter, and seized on their baggage and provisions. Thus they acquired a very considerable booty and store of provisions; but the latter being soon consumed, and the country round about quite exhausted, vast numbers of the Franks perished; so that Theodebert at last found himself obliged to return. In his way he destroyed Genoa and several other places, and arrived in his own dominions loaded with booty.\n\nIn the mean time, Belisarius was making great progress. He took the cities of Auximum and Pesulacum, after an obstinate siege; the inhabitants of the former having for some time fed on grass before they would surrender. After this he invested Ravenna, the capital of all the Gothic dominions in Italy. The place was defended by a very numerous garrison, commanded by the king in person, who exerted all his bravery in the defence of his metropolis. As the siege, however, was pushed on with great vigour, it was evident that the city must at last submit; and the great success of the Romans began to give jealousy to the neighbouring potentates.\npotentates. Theodebert king of the Franks offered to afflit Vitiges with an army of 500,000 men; but Belisarius, being informed of this negotiation, sent ambassadours to Vitiges, putting him in mind of the treachery of the Franks, and assured him that the emperor was ready to grant him very honourable terms. The king, by the advice of his counsellors, rejected the alliance of the Franks, and sent ambassadours to Constantinople; but in the mean time, Belisarius, in order to bring the citizens to his own terms, bribed one of them to set fire to a magazine of corn, by which means the city was soon starved for want of provisions. But, notwithstanding this disaster, they still continued to hold out, till the arrival of the ambassadours from Constantinople, who brought very favourable terms. These were, That the country beyond the Po, with respect to Rome, should remain to the Goths; but that the rest of Italy should be yielded to the emperor, and the royal treasure of the Goths should be equally divided between him and the king. To these conditions, however, Belisarius positively refused to assent; being desirous of leading captive the king of the Goths, as he had formerly done the king of the Vandals, to Constantinople. He therefore pursued the siege with more vigour than ever, without hearkening to the complaints of his soldiers and officers, who were quite tired out with the length of the siege: he only obliged such of the officers as were of opinion that the town could not be taken, to express their opinion in writing, that they might not deny it afterwards.\n\nThe Goths were as weary of the siege as the Romans; but fearing lest Justinian should transplant them to Thrace, formed a resolution, without the consent of their king, of surrendering to Belisarius himself, and declaring him emperor of the west. To this they were the more encouraged by the refusal of Belisarius to agree to the terms propounded by the emperor; whence they concluded that he designed to revolt, and make himself emperor of Italy. Of this, however, Belisarius had no design; but thought proper to accept of that title, in order to accelerate the surrender of the city, after acquainting his principal officers with what had passed. Vitiges at last discovered the plot; but finding himself in no condition to oppose it, he commended the resolution of his people, and even wrote to Belisarius, encouraging him to take upon him the title of king, and assuring him of his affiance. Upon this Belisarius pressed the Goths to surrender; which, however, they still refused, till he had taken an oath that he would treat them with humanity, and maintain them in the possession of all their rights and privileges. He was then admitted into the city, where he conducted himself with great moderation towards the Goths; but seized on the royal treasure, and secured the person of the king. The Roman army, when it entered Ravenna, appeared so very inconsiderable, that the Gothic women on beholding it could not forbear spitting in the faces of their husbands, and reviling them as cowards.\n\nThe captivity of Vitiges, and the capture of Ravenna, did not terminate the war. Belisarius was soon after recalled to take the command of the army in the east. The Goths were greatly surprized that he should leave his new kingdom out of regard to the orders of the emperor; but, after his departure, chose one Ildebaldo, a man of great experience in affairs both civil and military, for their king. He revived the drooping spirits of his countrymen, defeated the Romans, and reduced all the province of Venetia; but was in a short time murdered, and Eraric, a Rugian, succeeded to the throne. He was scarcely invested with the sovereignty, when his subjects began to think of deposing him, and raising Totila to the throne; which the latter accepted, upon condition that they previously dispatched Eraric. This was accordingly done; after which Totila was proclaimed king of Italy in the year 542.\n\nThe new king proved a very formidable enemy to the Romans, who now lost ground everywhere. They made an attempt on the city of Verona; in which they miscarried through their own avarice, having disputed about the division of the plunder till the opportunity of taking the town was past. They were next defeated in two bloody engagements; the consequence of which was, that the Goths made themselves masters of all the strong places in Tuscany. From thence marching into Campania and Samnium, they reduced the strong town of Beneventum, and laid siege to Naples. During the siege of this last place, several detachments were sent from the king's army, which took Cumae, and recovered all Brutia, Lucania, Apulia, and Calabria, where they found considerable sums which had been gathered for the emperor's use. The Romans, in the mean time, disheartened by their losses, and deprived of those sums which should have paid their wages, refused to take the field. A considerable fleet was therefore sent by Justinian to the relief of Naples; but Totila, having timely notice of this design, manned, with incredible expedition, a great number of light vessels; which, falling unexpectedly on the Roman fleet, took or sunk every ship, and made prisoners of all on board, excepting a few who escaped in their boats. A similar fate attended another fleet dispatched from Sicily for the same purpose. They put to sea in the depth of winter; and, meeting with a violent storm, were driven ashore near the enemy's camp; who sunk the ships, and made what slaughter they pleased of the seamen and soldiers. Upon this second disaster, the Neapolitans, despairing of further relief, submitted to Totila; who granted them honourable terms, and treated them with great humanity. As they had been long pinched with famine, Totila, apprehending they might endanger their lives by indulging their appetites too much at first, placed guards at the gates to prevent their going out, taking care at the same time to supply them sparingly with provisions, but increasing their allowance every day. Being thus by degrees restored to their former strength, he ordered the gates to be let open, and gave every one full liberty to stay in the city or remove as he thought fit. The garrison he treated with extraordinary kindness. They were first supplied with ships to carry them to Constantinople; but the king having discovered that their real design was to fail to Rome, in order to reinforce the garrison of that city (which they knew he was soon to besiege), he was so far from punishing them as they expected, that he furnished them with horses, waggons, and provisions, and ordered a body of Goths to escort them to Rome by land.\nItaly, land, as the winds had proved unfavourable for their passage by sea.\n\nTotila having thus become master of Naples and most of the other fortresses in these parts, began to think of reducing Rome also. He first attempted to persuade the citizens to surrender; but finding his persuasions ineffectual, he sent a detachment of his army into Calabria to reduce Otranto, which had not yet submitted; after which, he marched with the rest of his forces against the towns in the neighbourhood of Rome. The city of Tibur, now Tivoli, about 18 miles from Rome, was betrayed to him; and all the inhabitants, together with their bishop, were put to the sword. Several other strong holds in the neighbourhood of that city he took by storm; so that Rome was in a manner blocked up by land, all communication with the neighbouring country being cut off.\n\nJustinian, in the mean time, being greatly perplexed by the bad news he every day received from Italy, recalled Belisarius from Persia, notwithstanding the success which attended him there. To save Rome, however, was now impossible even for Belisarius himself. As soon as he arrived in Italy, finding himself unable either to relieve the towns which were besieged, or to stop the progress of the Goths, he dispatched letters to Justinian, informing him, that being destitute of men, arms, and money, it was impossible for him to prosecute the war; upon which the emperor ordered new levies to be made, all the veterans being engaged in the Persian war. In the mean time, however, Totila pursued his good fortune; took the cities of Firmum, Aculum, Auximum, Spoletum, &c., and at length advanced to Rome, which he invested on all sides. As he drew near the city, two officers, whom Belisarius had sent into the city, ventured to make a fall, though contrary to the express orders of their general, thinking they should surprise the Goths; but they were themselves taken in an ambuscade, and, most of their men being cut in pieces, narrowly escaped falling into the hands of the enemy. Belisarius made several attempts to relieve the city: but all of them, however well concerted, by some accident or other proved unsuccessful; which gave him so much uneasiness, that he fell into a feverish disorder, and was for some time thought to be in danger of his life. The city was soon reduced to great straits; a dreadful famine ensued; and the unhappy citizens having consumed everything that could be supposed to give them nourishment, even the grapes that grew near the walls, were obliged, it is said, to feed on their own excrements. Many put an end to their lives, in order to free themselves from the intolerable calamities they suffered. The rest addressed their governor Bessas in the most pathetic manner, intreating him to supply them with food; or if that was not in his power, either to give them leave to go out of the town, or to terminate their miseries by putting them to death. Bessas replied, that to supply them with food was impossible; to let them go, unsafe; and to kill them impious. In the end, however, he suffered those who were willing to retire, to leave the city, upon paying him a sum of money; but most of them either died on the road, or were cut in pieces by the enemy. At last, the besieged, unable to bear their miseries any longer, began to mutiny, and to press their governor to come to an agreement with Totila. This, however, he still refused; upon which, four of the Iaurians who guarded one of the gates, went privately to the camp of Totila, and offered to admit him into the city. The king received this proposal with great joy; and sending four Goths of great strength and intrepidity into the town, along with them, he silently approached the gates in the nighttime with his whole army. The gates were opened by the Iaurians, as they had promised; and upon the first alarm, Bessas with most of the soldiers and officers fled out of the town. The inhabitants took sanctuary in the churches; and only 60 of them and 26 soldiers were killed after the town was taken. Totila, however, gave his soldiers full liberty to plunder the city; which they did for several days together, stripping the inhabitants of all their wealth, and leaving nothing in their houses but naked walls; by which means many persons of distinction were reduced to beg their bread from door to door. In the house of Bessas was found an immense treasure, which he had scandalously amassed during the siege, by selling to the people, at an exorbitant price, the corn which had been stored up for the use of the garrison.\n\nTotila, thus become master of Italy, sent ambassadors to Justinian with very respectful letters, desiring to live on the same terms with him that Theodoric had done with his predecessor Anailafius; promising in that case to respect him as his father, and to assist him, when he pleased, with all his force, against any other nation whatever. On the contrary, if the emperor rejected his offers, he threatened to level Rome with the ground, to put the whole senate to the sword, and to carry the war into Illyricum. The emperor returned no other answer than that he referred the whole to Belisarius, who had full power to manage all things of that nature. Upon this Totila resolved to destroy the city; and had actually thrown down a third part of the wall, when he received a letter from Belisarius, disfavouring him from his intention. After having seriously considered this letter, Totila thought proper to alter his resolution with regard to the destruction of the city; but sent every one of the inhabitants into Lucania, without leaving a single person in the metropolis. Belisarius hearing of this, immediately returned to the capital, and undertook to repopulate and repair it. He cleared the ditch which had been filled by Totila, but was for the present obliged to fill up the breaches in the walls with stones loosely heaped upon one another, and in this situation the city was again attacked by the Goths. Belisarius, however, had taken care to supply the inhabitants with plenty of provisions, so that they were now in no danger of suffering by famine; and the assaults of the enemy were vigorously repelled, notwithstanding the bad situation of the fortifications, so that Totila at last abandoned the enterprise.\n\nIn the mean time the Persians gained great advantages over the Romans in the East, so that there was a necessity for recalling Belisarius a second time. He was no sooner gone, than Totila renewed his efforts with greater vigour than ever; and at the same time the Franks, concluding that both Romans and Goths would be much weakened by such a destructive war, seized upon Venetia, which belonged to both nations, and made it a province of the French empire. Totila did not oppose them; but having obtained a reinforcement of\nof 6000 Lombards, returned immediately before Rome, fully intent on making himself master of that metropolis. Having closely invested it by sea and land, he hoped in a short time to reduce it by famine; but against this the governor wisely provided, by causing corn to be sown within the walls; so that he could probably have defeated the power of Totila, had not the city been again betrayed by the Haurians, who opened one of the gates and admitted the enemy.\n\nThus the empire of the Goths was a third time established in Italy; and Totila, immediately on his becoming master of Rome, dispatched ambassadors to Justinian, offering to assist him as a faithful ally against any nation whatever, provided he would allow him the quiet possession of Italy. But Justinian was so far from hearkening to this proposal, that he would not even admit the ambassadors into his presence; upon which Totila resolved to pursue the war with the utmost vigour, and to make himself master not only of those places which the Romans possessed in Italy, but in Sicily also. This he fully accomplished; when Narves, who had formerly been joined in the command with Belifarius, was appointed general, with absolute and uncontrolled authority. But while this general was making the necessary preparations for his expedition, Totila, having equipped a fleet of 300 galleys, sent them to pillage the coasts of Greece, where they got an immense booty. They made a descent on the island of Corfu; and having laid it waste, they failed to Epirus, where they surprised and plundered the cities of Nicopolis and Anchialus, taking many ships on the coast, among which were some laden with provisions for the army of Narves. After these successes they laid siege to Ancona in Dalmatia. Being defeated, however, both by sea and land, Totila once more sent ambassadors to Constantinople, offering to yield Sicily and all Dalmatia, to pay an annual tribute for Italy, and to assist the Romans as a faithful ally in all their wars; but Justinian, bent upon driving the Goths out of Italy, would not even suffer the ambassadors to appear in his presence.\n\nTotila finding that no terms could be obtained, began to levy new forces, and to make great preparations by sea and land. He soon reduced the islands of Corfuca and Sardinia; but this was the last of his successes. Narves arrived in Italy with a very formidable army, and an immense treasure to pay the troops their arrears, the want of which had been one great cause of the bad success of Belifarius in his last expedition. He immediately took the road to Rome; while Totila assembled all his forces, in order to decide the fate of Italy by a general engagement. The battle proved very obstinate; but at last the Gothic cavalry being put to the rout, and retiring in great confusion among the infantry, the latter were thereby thrown into such disorder, that they could never afterwards rally. Narves, observing their confusion, encouraged his men to make a last effort; which the Goths not being able to withstand, betook themselves to flight, with the loss of 6000 men killed on the spot. Totila finding the day irrecoverably lost, fled with only five horsemen for his attendants; but was pursued and mortally wounded by a commander of one of the bodies of barbarians who followed Narves. He continued his flight, however, for some time longer; but was at last obliged to halt in order to get his wound dressed, soon after which he expired.\n\nThis disaster did not yet entirely break the spirit of the Goths. They chose for their king one Teia, deservedly esteemed one of the most valiant men of their nation, and who had on several occasions distinguished himself in a most eminent manner. All the valour and experience of Teia, however, were now insufficient to stop the progress of the Romans. Narves made himself master of a great number of cities, and of Rome itself, before the Goths could assemble their forces.\u2014The Roman general next proceeded to invest Cumae; which Teia determined at all events to relieve, as the royal treasure was lodged in that city. This brought on an engagement, which, if Procopius is to be credited, proved one of the most bloody that ever was fought. The Roman army consisted of vast multitudes brought from different nations: the Goths were few in comparison; but, animated by despair, and knowing that all was at stake, they fought with the utmost fury. Their king placed himself in the first rank, to encourage his men by his example; and is said to have given such proofs of his valour and conduct as equalled him to the most renowned heroes of antiquity. The Romans discovering him, and knowing that his death would probably put an end to the battle, if not to the war itself, directed their whole force against him, some attacking him with spears, and others discharging against him showers of darts and arrows. Teia maintained his ground with great intrepidity, received the missiles weapons on his shield, and killed a great number of the enemy with his own hand. When his shield was so loaded with darts that he could not easily wield it, he called for another. Thus he shifted his shield three times; but as he attempted to change it another time, his breast being necessarily exposed for a moment, a dart struck him in that moment with such force, that he immediately fell down dead in the place where he had stood from the beginning of the battle, and upon heaps of the enemy whom he had killed. The Romans, seeing him fall, cut off his head and exposed it to the sight of the Goths, not doubting but they would be immediately disheartened and retire. In this, however, they were disappointed. The Goths maintained the fight with great vigour, till night put an end to the engagement. The next day the engagement was renewed early in the morning, and continued till night; but on the third day, the Goths despairing of being able to overcome an enemy so much superior to them in numbers, sent deputies to Narves, offering to lay down their arms, provided such of them as chose to remain in Italy were allowed to enjoy their estates and possessions without molestation, as subjects of the empire; and those who were willing to retire elsewhere, were suffered to carry with them all their goods and effects. To these terms Narves readily assented; and thus the empire of the Goths in Italy was finally destroyed, the country now becoming a province of the eastern Roman empire.\n\nIn this conquest Narves had been assisted, as already observed, by many barbarous nations, among whom were the Lombards, at that time settled in Pannonia. On the conclusion of the war, they were dismissed with rich presents, and the nation for some time continued...\ncontinued faithful allies to the Romans. In the mean time Julian dying, Narfes, who governed Italy with an absolute sway, was accused to the emperor Justin II. and to the empress Sophia, of aspiring to the sovereignty of the country. Hereupon he was recalled, and Longinus sent to succeed him. As Narfes was an eunuch, the empress is reported to have said, that his employment at Constantinople should be to distribute in the apartment of her women the portion of wool which each was to spin. Narfes, enraged at this farce, replied, that he should begin such a web as he should never be able to finish; and immediately dispatched messengers to Alboinus king of the Lombards, inviting them into Italy. Along with the messengers he sent some of the best fruits the country afforded, in order to tempt him the more to become master of such a rich kingdom.\n\nAlboinus, highly pleased with the opportunity of invading a country with which his subjects were already well acquainted, began without loss of time to make the necessary preparations for his journey. In the month of April, 568, he set out with his whole nation, men, women, and children; carrying with them all their moveables. This promiscuous multitude arrived by the way of Istria; and advancing through the province of Venetia, found the whole country abandoned, the inhabitants having fled to the neighbouring islands in the Adriatic. The gates of Aquileia were opened by the few inhabitants who had courage to stay; most of them, however, had fled with all their valuable effects; and among the rest the patriarch Paulinus, who had carried with him all the sacred utensils of the churches. From Aquileia, Alboinus proceeded to Forum Julii, of which he likewise became master without opposition. Here he spent the winter; during which time he erected Friuli into a dukedom, which has continued ever since. In 569, he made himself master of Trivigli, Oderzo, Monte Selce, Vicenza, Verona, and Trent; in each of which cities he left a strong garrison of Lombards under the command of an officer, whom he distinguished by the title of duke; but these dukes were only officers and governors of cities, who bore the title no longer than the prince thought proper to continue them in their command or government. Padua and some other cities Alboinus left behind him without attempting to reduce them, either because they were too well garrisoned, or because they lay too much out of his way. In 572, he entered Liguria. The inhabitants were so terrified at his approach, that they left their habitations with such of their effects as they could carry off, and fled into the most mountainous and inaccessible parts of the country. The cities of Brescia, Bergamo, Lodi, Como, and others quite to the Alps, being left almost without inhabitants, submitted of course; after which he reduced Milan, and was thereupon proclaimed king of Italy.\n\nBut though the Lombards had thus conferred the title of king of Italy on their sovereign, he was by no means possessed of the whole country, nor indeed was it ever in the power of the Lombards to get possession of the whole. Alboinus having made himself master of Venetia, Liguria, Aemilia, Hetruria, and Umbria, applied himself to legislation and the civilization of his subjects. But before he could make any progress in this work, he was taken off by the treachery of his wife; and Clephis, one of the nobles, chosen king in his stead. Clephis rebuilt some cities which had been ruined during the wars between the Goths and Romans, and extended his conquests to the very gates of Rome; but as he behaved both to the Romans and Lombards with the greatest cruelty, he was murdered, after a short reign of 18 months. His cruelty gave the Lombards such an aversion against regal power, that they changed their form of government, being governed only by their dukes for the space of ten years. During this interregnum, they proved successful in their wars with the Romans, and made themselves masters of several cities; but perceiving that their kingdom, thus divided, could not subsist, they resolved once more to submit to the authority of one man; and accordingly, in 585, Autharis was chosen king of the Lombards.\n\nThe great object of ambition to the new race of subdued Lombard monarchs was the conquest of all Italy; and Charlemagne, as related under the article France, No. 27. As the Lombards, however, had not been possessed of the whole territory of Italy, so the whole of it never came into the possession of Charlemagne; neither since the time of the Goths, has the whole of this country been under the dominion of any single state. Some of the southern provinces were still possessed by the emperors of Constantinople; and the liberal grants of Pepin and Charlemagne himself to the pope, had invested him with a considerable share of temporal power. The territories of the pope indeed were supposed to be held in vassalage from France; but this the popes themselves always stoutly denied. The undivided territory of Italy, therefore, was restricted to dominions of Piedmont, the Milanese, the Mantuan, the territory of Genoa, Parma, Modena, Tuscany, Bologna, the dukedoms of Friuli, Spoleto, and Benevento; the last of which contained the greatest part of the present kingdom of Naples.\n\nThe feudal government which the Lombards had introduced into Italy, naturally produced revolts and commotions, as the different dukes inclined either to change their masters or to set up for themselves. Several revolts indeed happened during the life of Charlemagne himself; which, however, he always found means to crush; but after his death, the sovereignty of Italy became an object of contention between the kings of France and the emperors of Germany. That great monarch had divided his extensive dominions among his children; but they all died during his lifetime, except Louis, whom he associated with himself in the empire, and who succeeded to all his dominions after his death. From this time we may date the troubles with which Italy was so long overwhelmed; and of which, as they proceeded from the ambition of those called kings of Italy and their nobles, of the kings of France, and of the emperors of Germany, it is difficult to have any clear idea. The following short sketch, however, may perhaps give some satisfaction on this perplexed subject.\n\nAt the time Louis the son of Charlemagne was declared emperor of the West, Italy was held by Berengar, the son of Pepin, brother to Louis. Though this time of Bernard bore the title of king, yet he was only acknowledged.\ncounted a vassal of the emperor. His ambition, however, soon prompted him to rebel against his uncle; but being abandoned by his troops, he was taken prisoner, had his eyes pulled out, and died three days after. As the disturbances still continued, and the nobles of Lombardy were yet very refractory, Lothaire, eldest son to the emperor, was in the year 823 sent into Italy; of which country he was first crowned king at Rome, and afterwards emperor of the West, during his father's lifetime. But though his abilities were sufficient to have settled everything in a state of tranquillity, his unbounded ambition prompted him to engage in a rebellion against his father; whom he more than once took prisoner; though in the end he was obliged to submit, and ask pardon for his offences, which was obtained only on condition of his not passing the Alps without leave obtained from his father.\n\nIn the mean time, the Saracens, taking advantage of these intestine wars, landed on the coasts of Italy, and committed such ravages, that even the bishops were obliged to arm themselves for the defence of the country. Lothaire, however, after returning from his unnatural war with his father, was so far from attempting to put an end to these ravages, or to restore tranquillity, that he seized on some places belonging to the see of Rome, under pretence that they were part of his kingdom of Lombardy; nor would he forbear these encroachments till expressly commanded to do so by his father. After having embroiled himself, and almost lost all his dominions, in a war with his brothers after the death of Louis, and declared his son, also called Louis, king of Italy, this ambitious prince died, leaving to Louis the title of emperor as well as king of Italy, with which he had before invested him.\n\nThe new emperor applied himself to the restoration of tranquillity in his dominions, and driving out the Saracens from those places which they had seized in Italy. This he fully accomplished, and obliged the infidels to retire into Africa; but in 875 he died without naming any successor. After his death, some of the Italian nobles, headed by the duke of Tuscany, represented to the pope, that as Louis had left no successor, the regal dignity, which had so long been usurped by foreigners, ought now to return to the Italians. The pope, however, finding that Charles the Bald, king of France, had such an ambition for the imperial crown, that he would stick at nothing to obtain it, resolved to gratify him, though at as high a price as possible. He accordingly crowned him emperor and king of Lombardy, on condition of his owning the independency of Rome, and that he himself only held the empire by the gift of the pope. This produced a conspiracy among the discontented nobles; and at the same time the Saracens renewing their incursions, threatened the ecclesiastical territories with the utmost danger. The pope solicited the emperor's assistance with the greatest earnestness; but the latter died before anything effectual could be done; after which, being distressed by the Saracens on one hand, and the Lombard nobles on the other, the unhappy pontiff was forced to fly into France. Italy now fell into the utmost confusion and anarchy; during which time many of the nobles and states of Lombardy assumed an independency, which they have ever since retained.\n\nIn 877, the pope was reconducted to Italy with an army by Boson, son-in-law to Louis II. of France; but though he inclined very much to have raised this prince to the dignity of king of Italy, he found his interest insufficient for that purpose, and matters remained in their former situation. The nobles, who had driven out the pope, were now indeed reconciled to him; but notwithstanding this reconciliation, the state of the country was worse than ever: the great men renouncing the authority of any superior, and every one claiming to be sovereign in his own territories. To add to the calamities which ensued through the ambition of these despots, the Saracens committed everywhere the most terrible ravages; till at last the Italian nobles, despising the kings of the Carolingian race, who had weakened themselves by their mutual dissensions, began to think of throwing off even all nominal submission to a foreign yoke, and retaining the imperial dignity among themselves. Thus they hoped, that, by being more united among themselves, they might be more able to resist the common enemy. Accordingly in 885 they went to Pope Adrian; and requesting him to join them in asserting the independency of Italy, they obtained of him the two following decrees, viz. That the popes, after their election, might be consecrated without waiting for the presence of the king or his ambassadors; and that, if Charles the Grofs died without sons, the kingdom of Italy, with the title of emperor, should be conferred on some of the Italian nobles.\n\nThese decrees were productive of the worst consequences imaginable. The emperor complained of being deprived of his right; and the dissensions between the Italian nobles themselves became more fatal than ever. The two most powerful of these noblemen, Berengarius duke of Friuli, and Guido or Vido duke of Spoleto, entered into an agreement, that on the death of the emperor the former should seize on the kingdom of Italy, and the latter on the kingdom of France. Berengarius succeeded without opposition; but Vido was disappointed, the French having already chosen Eudes or Otho for their king. Upon this he returned to Italy, and turned his arms against Berengarius. Vido proved victorious in an engagement, and drove his rival into Germany; where he fought the affiance of Arnolpus, who had succeeded to the crown after the death of Charles. Having thus obtained the kingdom of Italy, Vido employed his time in reforming the abuses of the state, and confirming the grants formerly given to the pope, out of gratitude for his having sanctified his usurpation and declared him lawful king of Italy. This tranquillity, however, was of short duration. Arnolpus sent an army into Italy; the Saracens from Spain ravaged the northern parts of the country, and getting possession of a castle near the Alps, held it for many years after, to the great distress of the neighbouring parts, which were exposed to their continual incursions; and at the same time Benevento was besieged and taken by the forces of the eastern emperor, so that Vido found his empire very considerably circumscribed in its dimensions.\n\nThe new king, distressed by so many enemies, associated his son Lambert with him in the government,\nand bribed the Germans to return to their own country. In 893, however, they again invaded Italy; but were suddenly obliged to leave the country, after having put Berengarius in possession of Pavia. In the mean time, Vido died, and his son Lambert drove out Berengarius; but having joined a faction, headed by one Sergius, against Pope Formosus, the latter offered the kingdom of Italy to Arnolphi; who thereupon entered the country with an army, besieged and took Rome, massacring the faction of Sergius with the most unrelenting cruelty.\n\nArnolphus thus master of Italy, and crowned emperor by the pope, began to form schemes of strengthening himself in his new acquisitions by putting out the eyes of Berengarius; but the latter having timely notice of this treachery, fled to Verona; and the Italians were so provoked at this and the other cruelties of Arnolphus, that they drove him out of the country. His departure occasioned the greatest confusion at Rome. Formosus died soon after; and the successors to the papal dignity, having now no army to fear, excited the greatest disturbances. The body of Formosus was dug up and thrown into the Tiber by one pope; after which that pope was strangled, and Formosus' body buried again in the Vatican, by order of another. At last the coronation of Arnolphus was declared void, the Sergian faction entirely demolished, and the above-mentioned decrees of Adrian were annulled; it being now determined that the elected popes should not be consecrated but in presence of the emperor or his ambassadors.\n\nDuring these confusions Lambert enjoyed the kingdom in quiet; but the nobles hating him on account of his arbitrary and tyrannical government, began again to think of Berengarius. In the mean time, however, another faction offered the crown to Louis king of Arles. This new competitor entered Italy with an army in 899; but was forced by Berengarius to renounce his claim upon oath, and to swear that he would never again enter Italy, even though he should be invited to be crowned emperor.\u2014This oath, however, was soon forgotten. Louis readily accepted of another invitation, and was crowned king of Italy at Pavia in 901. The following year he forced Berengarius to fly into Bavaria; but having unwisely disbanded his army, as thinking himself now securely seated on the throne, Berengarius, who watched every opportunity, surprized him at Verona, and put out his eyes.\n\nThus Berengarius at last became king of Italy without a rival; and held his kingdom for 20 years afterwards, without any opposition from his subjects, who at last became sensible of the mischiefs arising from civil discord. He was not yet, however, without troubles. The Hungarians invaded Italy with a formidable army, and advanced within a small distance of Pavia. Berengarius armed the whole force of his dominions; and came against them with such a multitude, that the Hungarians retired without venturing an engagement. A great many of their men were lost in passing a river; upon which they sent deputies to Berengarius, offering to restore all their booty, and never to come again into Italy, provided they were allowed a safe retreat. These conditions were imprudently denied; upon which the Hungarians attacked the army of Berengarius in despair, and defeated them with great slaughter. After this they overran the whole country, and plundered the towns of Trevilo, Vicenza, and Padua, without resistance, the inhabitants flying everywhere into fortified places. This devastation they continued for two years; nor could their departure be procured without paying them a large sum of money; which, however, proved of little avail; for the following year they returned and ravaged the territory of Friuli without control. Scarcely were these invaders departed, when the Saracens, who had settled at the foot of the Alps, invaded Apulia and Calabria, and made an irruption as far as Acqui in the neighbourhood of Pavia; while the inhabitants, instead of opposing them, fled to some forts which had been erected in the time of the first irruption of the Hungarians. In 912, however, John, prelate of Ravenna, having attained the papal dignity by means of Theodora wife of Alderbert count of Tuscany, applied himself to regulate the affairs of the church, and to repel the insults of the Saracens. While he was considering on the most proper methods of effecting this, one of the Saracens, who had received an injury from his countrymen, fled to Rome, and offered to deliver the Italians from their invasions, if the pope would but allow him a small body of men. His proposals being accepted, 65 young men were chosen, all well armed; who being conducted by the Saracens into by paths, attacked the infidels as they were returning from their inroads, and several times defeated great parties of them. These losses affecting the Saracens, a general alliance was concluded amongst all their cities; and having fortified a town on the Garigliano, they abandoned the rest, and retired hither. Thus they became much more formidable than before; which alarming the pope, he consulted with Arnolphus prince of Benevento and Capua, sending at the same time ambassadors to Constantine the Greek emperor, inviting him to an alliance against the infidels. The Saracens, unable to withstand such a powerful combination, were besieged in their city; where being reduced to great straits, they at last set fire to it, and fellied out into the woods; but being pursued by the Italians, they were all cut off to a man.\n\nIn this expedition it is probable that Berengarius gave great assistance; for this very year, 915, he was crowned emperor by the pope. This gave displeasure to many of the ambitious nobles; conspiracies were repeatedly formed against him; in 922, Rodolphus king of Burgundy was crowned also king of Italy; and in 924, Berengarius was treacherously assassinated at Verona; of which disturbances the Hungarians taking the advantage, plundered the cities of Mantua, Brescia, and Bergamo. Marching afterwards to Pavia, they Pavia plundered it closely on all sides; and about the middle of March 925, taking advantage of the wind, they fell burnt by fire to the houses next the walls, and during the confusion broke open the gates, and getting possession of the city treated the inhabitants with the greatest barbarity. Having burnt the capital of the kingdom, they next proceeded to Placentia, where they plundered the suburbs; and then returned to Pannonia laden with booty.\n\nThe affairs of Italy now fell into the utmost confusion. A faction was formed against Rodolphus in favour of Hugh count of Arles. The latter prevailed, and was crowned king at Pavia in 927. The Italians, however, soon repented of their choice. The Romans\nItaly first invited him to be their governor, and then drove him out with disgrace; at the same time choosing a consul, tribunes, &c., as if they had designed to assert their ancient liberty. One faction, in the mean time, offered the crown to Rodolphus, and the other to Arnold duke of Bavaria, while the Saracens took this opportunity to plunder the city of Genoa.\n\nHugh, in the mean time, was not inactive. Having collected an army, he marched directly against Arnold, and entirely defeated him. Rodolphus delivered him from all apprehensions on his part, by entering into an alliance with him, and giving his daughter Adelaide in marriage to Lotharius, Hugh's son. Being thus free from all danger from foreign enemies, he marched against the Romans; but with them he also came to an agreement, and even gave his daughter in marriage to Albert, whom they had chosen consul. In the meantime the country was infested by the Hungarians and Saracens, and at the same time depopulated by a plague. Endless conspiracies were formed against Hugh himself; and at last, in 947, he was totally deprived of the regal power by Berengarius, grandson to the first king of that name; soon after which he retired into Burgundy, and became a monk.\n\nThough Berengarius was thus possessed of the supreme power, he did not assume the title of king till after the death of Lotharius, which happened in 950; but in the mean time Italy was invaded by Henry duke of Bavaria, and the Hungarians. The former took and plundered the city of Aquileia, and ravaged the neighbouring country; after which he returned without molestation into Germany; the latter made a furious irruption; and Berengarius being unable to oppose them, was at last obliged to purchase their departure by money. In raising the sum agreed upon, however, Berengarius is said to have been more oppressive than even the Hungarians themselves. Every individual, without distinction of age or sex, was obliged to pay so much for their head, not excepting even the poor. The churches were likewise robbed; by which means the king raised an immense sum of money, ten bullocks of which he gave to the Hungarians, but kept the much greater part to himself.\n\nBerengarius, not yet satisfied, wanted to be put in possession of Pavia, which was held by Adelaide, the widow of Lotharius. In order to obtain his purpose, he proposed a marriage between her and his son Adelbert. This proposal was rejected; upon which Berengarius besieged and took the city. The queen was confined in a neighbouring castle, from whence she made her escape by a contrivance of her confessor. With him and one female attendant she concealed herself for some days in a wood; but being obliged to remove from thence for want of food, she applied for protection to Adelard bishop of Reggio. By him she was recommended to his uncle Attila, who had a strong castle in the neighbourhood of Canoza. Here she was quickly besieged by Berengarius; upon which messengers were dispatched to Otho king of Germany, acquainting him, that, by expelling Berengarius, and marrying Adelaide, he might easily obtain the kingdom of Italy. This proposal he readily accepted, and married Adelaide; but allowed Berengarius to retain the greatest part of his dominions, upon condition of his doing homage for them to the kings of Germany.\n\nVol. XI. Part I.\n\nHe deprived him, however, of the dukedom of Friuli and marquisate of Verona, which he gave to Henry duke of Bavaria.\n\nBerengarius, thus freed from all apprehension, not only opprobred his subjects in a most tyrannical manner, but revolted against Otho himself. This at last provoked Italy and cured his ruin: for, in 961, Otho returned with an army into Italy, where he was crowned king by the archbishop of Milan; and the year following was crowned emperor by the pope. On this occasion he received the imperial crown from his holiness, and kissed his feet with great humility: after which they both went to the altar of St Peter, and bound themselves by a solemn oath, the pope to be always faithful to the emperor, and to give no assistance to Berengarius or Adelbert his enemies; and Otho, to consult the welfare of the church, and to restore to it all its patrimony granted by former emperors. Otho, besides this, bestowed very rich presents on the church of St Peter. He ordained that the election of popes should be according to the canons; that the elected pope should not be consecrated till he had publicly promised, in presence of the emperor's commissaries, to observe every thing formerly specified with regard to the rights of the emperors; that these commissaries should constantly reside at Rome, and make a report every year how justice was administered by the judges; and in case of any complaints, the commissaries should lay them before the pope; but if he neglected to intimate them, the imperial commissaries might then do what they pleased.\n\nThus we see that Otho, however much he might allow the pope's supremacy in spiritual matters, plainly assumed the sovereignty in temporals to himself; and thus Italy was for upwards of 300 years accounted a part of the German empire. The popes, however, by no means relished this superiority of the emperor. The latter was hardly departed, when the pope, (John XII.) broke the oath which he had just before sworn with so much solemnity; and entered first into an alliance with Adelbert count of Tuscany to expel the Germans, and then solicited the Hungarians to invade Italy. This treachery was soon punished by Otho. He returned with part of his army, and assembled a council of bishops. As the pope did not appear, Otho pretended great concern for his absence. The bishops replied, that the consciousness of his guilt made him afraid to show himself. The emperor then inquired particularly into his crimes; upon which the bishops accused him of filling the palace with lewd women, of ordaining a bishop in a stable, castrating a cardinal, drinking the devil's health, &c. As the pope still refused to appear in order to justify himself from these charges, he was formally deposed; the pope and Leo the chief secretary, though a layman, elected in his stead.\n\nThe new pope, in compliment to the emperor, granted a bull, by which it was ordained that Otho and his successors should have a right of appointing the popes and investing archbishops and bishops; and that none should dare to consecrate a bishop without leave obtained from the emperor. Thus were the affairs of the Italians still kept in the utmost confusion even during the reign of Otho I., who appears to have been a wife and active prince. He was no sooner gone, than the\nnew pope was deposed, all his decrees annulled, and John replaced. The party of Leo was now treated with great cruelty; but John was soon stopped in his career; for about the middle of May, the same year (964), in which he had been restored, being surprised in bed with a Roman lady, he received a blow on the head from the devil (according to the authors of those times), of which he died eight days after. After his death a cardinal deacon, named Benedict, was elected by the Romans, but deposed by Otho, and banished to Ham-\n\nburgh.\n\nThe emperor was scarce returned to Germany, when his fickle Italians revolted, and sent for Adelbert, who had fled to Corsica. But being soon reduced, they continued quiet for about a year; after which they revolted again, and imprisoned the pope. Otho, however, provoked at their rebellious disposition, soon returned, and punished the rebels with great severity; after which he made several laws for the better regulation of the city of Rome, granting several privileges to the Venetians, and caused his son Otho, then only thirteen years of age, to be crowned emperor.\n\nThis ceremony being over, Otho dispatched an ambassador to Nicephorus, emperor of Constantinople, demanding his step-daughter Theophania in marriage for the young emperor; but upon this alliance being rejected, and that not without circumstances of the most atrocious perfidy, Otho instantly invaded the countries of Apulia and Calabria, and entirely defeated the Greek army in those parts. In the mean time, however, Nicephorus being killed, and his throne usurped by John Zimilces, Otho immediately entered into an alliance with the latter, and easily obtained Theophania for his son. She was crowned with great solemnity on the 8th of April 969: at the same time it is pretended by some authors, that the Greeks renounced their rights to Calabria and Apulia; though this is denied by others. After the celebration of this marriage, the emperor undertook an expedition against the Saracens, who still resided at the foot of the Alps; but being informed of the death of several nobles in Germany, he thought proper to return thither, where he died of an apoplexy in the year 973.\n\nAt the time of Otho's death Italy was divided into the provinces of Apulia, Calabria, the dukedom of Benevento, Campania, Terra Romana, the dukedom of Spoleto, Tuscany, Romagna, Lombardy, and the marquises of Ancona, Verona, Friuli, Treviso, and Genoa. Apulia and Calabria were still claimed by the Greeks; but all the rest were either immediately subject to, or held of, the kings of Italy. Otho conferred Benevento (including the ancient Samnium) on the duke of that name. Campania and Lucania he gave to the dukes of Capua, Naples, and Salerno. Rome with its territory, Ravenna with the exarchate, the dukedom of Spoleto, with Tuscany, and the marquisate of Ancona, he granted to the pope; and retained the rest of Italy under the form of a kingdom. Some of the cities were left free, but all tributary. He appointed several hereditary marquises and counties, but referred to himself the sovereign jurisdiction in their territories. The liberty of the cities consisted in a freedom to choose their own magistrates, to be judged by their own laws, and to dispose of their own revenues, on condition that they took the oath of allegiance to the king, and paid the customary tribute. The cities that were not free were governed by the commissaries or lieutenants of the emperor; but the free cities were governed by two or more consuls, afterwards called podestates, chosen annually, who took the oath of allegiance to the emperor before the bishop of the city or the emperor's commissary. The tribute exacted was called foderum, parata, et man-\n\njonicum. By the foderum was meant a certain quantity of corn which the cities were obliged to furnish to the king when marching with an army or making a progress through the country; though the value of this was frequently paid in money. By the parata was understood the expense laid out in keeping the public roads and bridges in repair; and the manjonicum included those expenses which were required for lodging the troops or accommodating them in their camp. Under pretence of this last article, the inhabitants were sometimes stripped of all they possessed, except their oxen and seed for the land. Besides regulating what regarded the cities, Otho distributed honours and positions to those who had served him faithfully. The honours consisted in the titles of duke, marquis, count, captain, valvafior, and valvafin: the positions were, besides land, the duties arising from harbours, ferries, roads, fish-ponds, mills, salt-pits, the uses of rivers, and all pertaining to them, and such like. The dukes, marquises, and counts, were those who received dukedoms, marquises, and counties, from the king in fiefs; the captains had the command of a certain number of men by a grant from the king, duke, marquis, or count; the valvafors were subordinate to the captains, and the valvafins to them.\n\nNo sooner was the death of Otho I., known in Italy, Great than, as if they had been now freed from all restraint, turbulence the nobles declared war against each other: some cities revolted, and chose to themselves consuls; while the dominions of others were seized by the nobles, who confirmed their power by erecting citadels. Rome especially was harassed by tumults, occasioned chiefly by the factious practices of one Cincius, who preferred his fellow-citizens to restore the ancient republic. As the pope continued firm in the interests of the emperor, Cincius caused him to be strangled by one Franco a cardinal deacon; who was soon after rewarded with the pontificate, and took upon him the name of Boniface VII. Another pope was chosen by the faction of the count of Tuscany; who being approved by the emperor, drove Cincius and Boniface out of the city. Disturbances of a similar kind took place in other cities, though Milan continued quiet and loyal in the midst of all this uproar and confusion.\n\nIn the mean time Boniface fled for refuge to Constantinople, where he excited the emperor to make war against Otho II. In 979 an army was accordingly sent into Italy, which conquered Apulia and Calabria; but the next year Otho entered Italy with a formidable army; and having taken a severe revenge on the authors of the disturbances, drove the Greeks entirely out of the provinces they had seized. Having then caused his son Otho III. at that time a boy of ten years of age, to be proclaimed emperor, he died at Rome in the year 983. Among the regulations made by this emperor, one is very remarkable, and must give us a strange\nItaly strange idea of the inhabitants of Italy at that time. He made a law, That no Italian should be believed upon his oath; and that in any dispute which could not be decided otherwise than by witnesses, the parties should have recourse to a duel.\n\nOtto III. succeeded to the empire at twelve years of age; and during his minority the disturbances in Italy revived. Cincius, called also Crescentius, renewed his scheme of restoring the republic. The pope (John XV.) opposing his schemes, was driven out of the city; but was soon after recalled, on hearing that he had applied to the emperor for assistance. A few years after Crescentius again revolted, and expelled Gregory V. the successor of John XV.; raising to the papal dignity a creature of his own, under the name of John XVI. Otho, enraged at this insult, returned to Rome with a powerful army in 998, besieged and took it by assault; after which he caused Crescentius to be beheaded, and the pope he had set up to be thrown headlong from the castle of St. Angelo, after having his eyes pulled out, and his nose cut off. Four years after, he himself died of the smallpox; or, according to some, was poisoned by the widow of Crescentius, whom he had debauched under a promise of marriage, just as he was about to punish the Romans for another revolt.\n\nOtho was succeeded in the imperial throne by Henry duke of Bavaria, and grandson to Otho II. Henry had no sooner settled the affairs of Germany, than he found it necessary to march into Italy against Ardoin marquis of Ivrea, who had assumed the title of king of Italy. Him he defeated in an engagement, and was himself crowned king of Italy at Pavia in 1005; but a few years after, a new contest arose about the papal chair, which again required the presence of the emperor. Before he arrived, however, one of the competitors (Benedict VIII.) had got the better of his rival, and both Henry and his queen received the imperial crown from his hands. Before the emperor entered the church, the pope proposed to him the following question: \"Will you observe your fidelity to me and my successors in every thing?\" To which, though a kind of homage, he submitted, and answered in the affirmative. After his coronation, he confirmed the privileges bestowed on the Roman see by his predecessors, and added some others of his own; still however, reserving for himself the sovereignty and the power of sending commissaries to hear the grievances of the people. Having repelled the incursions of the Saracens, reduced some more rebellions of his subjects, and reduced the greatest part of Apulia and Calabria, he died in the year 1024.\n\nThe death of this emperor was, as usual, followed by a competition for the crown. Conrad being chosen emperor of Germany, was declared king of Italy by the archbishop of Milan; while a party of the nobles made offer of the crown to Robert king of France, or his son Hugh. But this offer being declined, and likewise another to William duke of Guinne, Conrad enjoyed the dignity conferred on him by the archbishop without molestation. He was crowned king of Italy at Monza in 1026; and the next year he received the imperial crown from Pope John XX. in presence of Canute the Great, king of England, Denmark, and Norway, and Rodolph III., king of Burgundy. His reign was similar to that of his predecessors. The Italians revolted, the pope was expelled, the malecontents were subdued, and the pope restored, after which the emperor returned to Germany, and died in 1039.\n\nUnder Henry III. who succeeded Conrad, the disturbances were prodigiously augmented. Pope Sylvester II. was driven out by Benedict; who in his turn was expelled by John bishop of Sabinum, who assumed the title of Sylvester III. Three months after Benedict was restored, and excommunicated his rivals; but soon after resigned the pontificate for a sum of money. In a short time he reclaimed it; and thus there were at once three popes, each of whom was supported on a branch of the papal revenue, while all of them made themselves odious by the scandalous lives they led. At last a priest called Gratian put an end to this singular triumvirate. Partly by artifice, and partly by presents, he persuaded all the three to renounce their pretensions to the papacy; and the people of Rome, out of gratitude for so signal a service to the church, chose him pope, under the name of Gregory VI. Henry III. took umbrage at this election, in which he had not been consulted, and marched with an army into Italy. He deposed Gregory, as having been guilty of simony, and filled the papal chair with his own chancellor Heidiger, bishop of Bamberg, who assumed the name of Clement II. and afterwards consecrated Henry and the empress Agnes. This ceremony being over, and the Romans having sworn never to elect a pope without the approbation of the reigning emperor, Henry proceeded to Capua, where he was visited by Drago, Rainphilus, and other Norman adventurers; who leaving their country at different times, had made themselves masters of great part of Apulia and Calabria, at the expense of the Greeks and Saracens. Henry entered into treaty with them; and not only solemnly invited the Normans to submit to his authority, but also with them with those territories which they had acquired by force of arms, but prevailed on the pope to excommunicate the Beneventines, who had refused to open their gates to him, and bestowed that city and its dependencies, as fiefs of the empire, upon the Normans, provided they took possession by force of arms. The emperor was scarce returned into Germany when he received intelligence of the death of Clement II. He was succeeded in the apostolic see by Damaus II.; who also dying soon after his elevation, Henry nominated Bruno bishop of Toul to the vacant chair. This Bruno, who was the emperor's relation, immediately assumed the pontificals; but being a modest and pious prelate, he threw them off on his journey, by the persuasion of a monk of Cluny, named Hildebrand, afterwards the famous Gregory VII. and went to Rome as a private man. \"The emperor alone (said Hildebrand) has no right to create a pope.\" He accompanied Bruno to Rome, and secretly retarded his election, that he might arrogate to himself the merit of obtaining it. The scheme succeeded to his wish; Bruno, who took the name of Leo IX., believing himself indebted to Hildebrand for the pontificate, favoured him with his particular friendship and confidence; and hence originated the power of this enterprising monk, of obscure birth, but boundless ambition, who governed Rome so long, and whose zeal for\nthe exaltation of the church occasioned so many troubles to Europe.\n\nLeo soon after his elevation waited on the emperor at Worms, to crave alliance against the Norman princes, who were become the terror of Italy, and treated their subjects with great severity. Henry furnished the pope with an army; at the head of which he marched against the Normans, after having excommunicated them, accompanied by a great number of bishops and other ecclesiastics, who were all either killed or taken prisoners, the Germans and Italians being totally routed. Leo himself was led captive to Benevento, which the Normans were now masters of, and which Henry had granted to the pope in exchange for the fief of Bamberg in Germany; and the apolitical see is to this day in possession of Benevento, by virtue of that donation. The Normans, however, who had a right to the city by a prior grant, restored it, in the mean time, to the princes of Lombardy; and Leo was treated with so much respect by the conquerors, that he revoked the sentence of excommunication, and joined his sanction to the imperial investiture for the lands which they held in Apulia and Calabria. Leo died soon after his release; and the emperor about the same time caused his infant son, afterwards the famous Henry IV., to be declared king of the Romans, a title still in use for the acknowledged heir of the empire. Gebhard, a German bishop, was elected pope, under the name of Victor II., and confirmed by the address of Hildebrand, who waited on the emperor in person for that purpose, though he disdained to consult him beforehand. Perhaps Hildebrand would not have found this task so easy, had not Henry been involved in a war with the Hungarians, who pressed him hard, but whom he obliged at last to pay a large tribute, and furnish him annually with a certain number of fighting men.\n\nAs soon as the emperor had finished this war and others to which it gave rise, he marched into Italy to inspect the conduct of his sister Beatrice, widow of Boniface marquis of Mantua, and made her prisoner. She had married Gozelo, duke of Lorraine, without the emperor's consent; and contrived her daughter Matilda, by the marquis of Mantua, to Godfrey duke of Spoleto and Tuscany, Gozelo's son by a former marriage. This formidable alliance justly alarmed Henry; he therefore attempted to dissolve it, by carrying his sister into Germany, where he died soon after his return, in the 39th year of his age, and the 16th of his reign.\n\nThe emperor, in his last journey to Italy, concluded an alliance with Contarini, doge of Venice. That republic was already rich and powerful, though it had only been enfranchised in the year 998, from the tribute of a mantle of cloth of gold, which it formerly paid, as a mark of subjection to the emperor of Constantinople. Genoa was the rival of Venice in power and commerce, and was already in possession of the island of Corsica, which the Genoese had taken from the Saracens. These two cities engrossed at this time almost all the trade of Europe. There was no city in any respect equal to them either in France or Germany.\n\nHenry IV. was only five years old at his father's death. The popes made use of the reprieve given them by his minority, to flake off in great measure their dependence upon the emperors. After a variety of councils about the pontificate, Nicholas II., a creature of Hildebrand's, was elected; who, among others, passed the following celebrated decree, viz. That for the future, the cardinals only should elect the pope; and that the election should afterwards be confirmed by the rest of the clergy and the people, \"Saving the honour (adds he) due to our dear son Henry, now king; and who, if it please God, shall be one day emperor, according to the right which we have already conferred upon him.\" After this he entered into a treaty with the Norman princes above-mentioned; who, though they had lately sworn to hold their possessions from the emperor, now swore to hold them from the pope; and hence arose the pope's claim of sovereignty over the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily.\n\nThus was the power of the German emperors in Italy greatly diminished, and that of the popes proportionally exalted; of which Henry soon had sufficient evidence. For having assumed the government into his own hands in the year 1072, being then 22 years of age, he was summoned by Alexander II., to appear before the tribunal of the holy see, on account of his loose life, and to answer the charge of having exposed the investiture of bishops to sale; at the same time that the pope excited his German subjects to rebel against him. The rebels, however, were defeated, and peace was restored to Germany; but soon after, Hildebrand above-mentioned being elected to the pontificate under the name of Gregory VII., openly affirmed the superiority over every earthly monarch whatever. He began with excommunicating every ecclesiastic who should receive a benefice from the hands of a layman, and every layman who should take upon him to confer such a benefice. Henry, instead of resenting this insolence, submitted, and wrote a penitential letter to the pope: who, upon this, condescended to take him into favour, after having severely reprimanded him for his loose life; of which the emperor now confessed himself guilty.\n\nThe quarrel between the church and the emperor was, however, soon brought to a crisis by the following accident. Solomon king of Hungary, being deposed by his brother G\u00e9za, had fled to Henry for protection, and renewed the homage of Hungary to the empire. Gregory, who favoured G\u00e9za, exclaimed against this act of submission; and said in a letter to Solomon, \"You ought to know that the kingdom of Hungary belongs to the Roman church; and learn that you will incur the indignation of the holy see, if you do not acknowledge that you hold your dominions of the pope, and not of the emperor.\" Henry, though highly provoked at this declaration, thought proper to treat it with neglect; upon which Gregory refused the dilate about investitures. The predecessors of Henry had always enjoyed the right of nominating bishops and abbots, and of giving them investiture by the cross and the ring. This right they had in common with almost all princes. The predecessors of Gregory VII. had been accustomed on their part, to send legates to the emperors, in order to entreat their affluence, to obtain their confirmation, or desire them to come and receive the papal sanction, but for no other purpose. Gregory, however, sent\ntwo legates to summon Henry to appear before him as a delinquent, because he still continued to betray investitures, notwithstanding the apostolic decree to the contrary; adding, that if he should fail to yield obedience to the church, he must expect to be excommunicated and deposed. Incensed at this arrogant message from one whom he considered as his vassal, Henry dismissed the legates with very little ceremony, and in 1106 convoked an assembly of all the princes and dignified ecclesiastics at Worms; where, after mature deliberation, they concluded, that Gregory having usurped the chair of St Peter by indirect means, infected the church of God with a great many novelties and abuses, and deviated from his duty to his sovereign in several scandalous attempts, the emperor, by that supreme authority derived from his predecessors, ought to divest him of his dignity, and appoint another in his place. In consequence of this determination, Henry sent an ambassador to Rome, with a formal deprivation of Gregory; who, in his turn, convoked a council, at which were present 110 bishops, who unanimously agreed that the pope had just cause to depose Henry, to dissolve the oath of allegiance which the princes and states had taken in his favour, and to prohibit them from holding any correspondence with him on pain of excommunication; which was immediately fulminated against the emperor and his adherents. \"In the name of Almighty God, and by our authority (said Gregory), I prohibit Henry, the son of our emperor Henry, from governing the Teutonic kingdom and Italy; I release all Christians from their oath of allegiance to him; and strictly forbid all persons from serving or attending him as king!\" The circular letters written by this pontiff breathe the same spirit with his sentence of deposition. He there repeats several times, that \"bishops are superior to kings, and made to judge them!\" expressions alike artful and presumptuous, and calculated for bringing in all the churchmen of the world to his standard.\n\nGregory knew well what consequences would follow the thunder of the church. The German bishops came immediately over to his party, and drew along with them many of the nobles: the flame of civil war still lay smothering, and a bull properly directed was sufficient to set it in a blaze. The Saxons, Henry's old enemies, made use of the papal displeasure as a pretence for rebelling against him. Even Guelph, to whom the emperor had given the duchy of Bavaria, supported the malecontents with that power which he owed to his sovereign's bounty: nay, those very princes and prelates who had assisted in deposing Gregory, gave up their monarch to be tried by the pope; and his holiness was solicited to come to Augsburg for that purpose.\n\nWilling to prevent this odious trial at Augsburg, Henry took the unaccountable resolution of suddenly passing the Alps at Tirol, accompanied only by a few domestics, to ask absolution of Pope Gregory his opponent; who was then in Canoza, on the Apennine mountains, a fortress belonging to the countess or duchess Matilda above mentioned. At the gates of this place the emperor presented himself as a humble penitent. He alone was admitted within the outer court; where, being stripped of his robes, and wrapped in sackcloth, he was obliged to remain three days, in the month of January, bare-footed and fasting; before he was permitted to kiss the feet of his holiness; who all that time was shut up with the devout Matilda, whose spiritual director he had long been, and, as some say, her gallant. But be that as it may, her attachment to Gregory, and her hatred to the Germans, was so great, that she made over all her estates to the apostolic see; and this donation is the true cause of all the wars which since that period have raged between the emperors and the popes. She possessed in her own right great part of Tuscany, Mantua, Parma, Reggio, Placentia, Ferrara, Modena, Verona, and almost the whole of what is now called the patrimony of St Peter, from Viterbo to Orvieto; together with part of Umbria, Spoleto, and the Marche of Ancona.\n\nThe emperor was at length permitted to throw himself at the pontiff's feet; who condescended to grant him absolution, after he had sworn obedience to him in all things, and promised to submit to his solemn deposition at Augsburg; so that Henry got nothing but disgrace by his journey; while Gregory, elated by his triumph, and now looking upon himself (not altogether without reason) as the lord and master of all the crowned heads in Christendom, laid in several of his letters, that it was his duty \"to pull down the pride of kings.\"\n\nThis extraordinary accommodation gave much difficulty to the princes of Italy. They never could forgive the insolence of the pope, nor the abject humility of the emperor. Happily, however, for Henry, their indignation at Gregory's arrogance overbalanced their detestation of his meanness. He took advantage of this temper; and by a change of fortune, hitherto unknown to the German emperors, he found a strong party in Italy, when abandoned in Germany. All Lombardy took arms against the pope, while he was raising all Germany against the emperor. Gregory, on the other hand, made use of every art to get another emperor elected in Germany; and Henry, on his part, left nothing undone to persuade the Italians to elect another pope. The Germans chose Rodolph, duke of Swabia, who was solemnly crowned at Mentz; and Gregory, chosen emmetiating on this occasion, behaved truly like the supreme judge of kings. He had depoed Henry, but still it was in his power to pardon that prince: he therefore affected to be displeased that Rodolph was consecrated without his order; and declared, that he would acknowledge as emperor and king of Germany, him of the two competitors who should be most submissive to the holy see.\n\nHenry, however, trifling more to the valour of his troops than to the generosity of the pope, set out immediately for Germany, where he defeated his enemies in several engagements; and Gregory, seeing no hopes of submission, thundered out a second sentence of excommunication against him, confirming at the same time the election of Rodolph, to whom he sent a golden crown, on which the following well-known verse, equally haughty and puerile, was engraved.\n\n*Petra dedit Petro, Petrus diadema Rodolpho.*\n\nThis donation was also accompanied with a most enthusiastic anathema against Henry. After depriving him of strength and combat, and condemning him never to be victorious, it concludes with the following remarkable\nmarkable apostrophe to St Peter and St Paul: \"Make all men tenible, that as you can bind and looie every thing in heaven, you can also upon earth take from or give to every one, according to his deserts, empires, kingdoms, principalities\u2014let the kings and the princes of the age then instantly feel your power, that they may not dare to despise the orders of your church; let your justice be so speedily executed upon Henry, that nobody may doubt but he falls by your means, and not by chance.\"\n\nIn order to avoid the effects of this second excommunication, Henry assembled at Brixen, in the county of Tirol, about 20 German bishops who, acting also for the bishops of Lombardy, unanimously resolved, that the pope, instead of having power over the emperor, owed him obedience and allegiance; and that Gregory VII., having rendered himself unworthy of the papal chair by his conduct and rebellion, ought to be deposed from a dignity he so little deserved. They accordingly degraded Hildebrand; and elected in his room Guibert, archbishop of Ravenna, a person of undoubted merit, who took the name of Clement III.\n\nHenry promised to put the new pope in possession of Rome; but he was obliged, in the mean time, to employ all his forces against his rival Rodolph, who had reassembled a large body of troops in Saxony. The two armies met near Merburg, and both fought with great fury; but the fortune of the day seemed inclined to Rodolph, when his hand was cut off by the famous Godfrey of Bouillon, then in the service of Henry, and afterwards renowned for his conquest of Jerusalem. Discouraged by the misfortune of their chief, the rebels immediately gave way; and Rodolph perceiving his end approaching, ordered the hand that was cut off to be brought him, and made a speech to his officers on the occasion, which could not fail to have an influence on the emperor's affairs. \"Behold (said he) the hand with which I took the oath of allegiance to Henry; and which oath, at the instigation of Rome, I have violated, in perdition aspiring at an honour that was not my due.\"\n\nThus delivered from this formidable antagonist, Henry soon dispersed the rest of his enemies in Germany, and set out for Italy in order to settle Clement in the papal chair. But the gates of Rome being shut against him, he was obliged to attack it in form. The siege continued upwards of two years; Henry during that time being obliged to quell some insurrections in Germany. The city was at length carried by assault, and with difficulty saved from being pillaged; but Gregory was not taken: he retired into the castle of St Angelo, and thence defied and excommunicated the conqueror. The new pope was, however, consecrated with the usual ceremonies; and expressed his gratitude by crowning Henry, with the concurrence of the Roman senate and people. Mean while the siege of St Angelo was going on; but the emperor being called about some affairs into Lombardy, Robert Guiscard took advantage of his absence to release Gregory, who died soon after at Salerno. His last words, borrowed from the Scripture, were worthy of the greatest saint: \"I have loved justice, and hated iniquity; therefore I die in exile.\"\n\nHenry, however, did not enjoy all the advantages which might have been expected from the death of Gregory. The subsequent popes trod in the paths of their predecessor. In 1101, Paschal II. excited young Henry to rebel against his father. The emperor did all in his power to dissuade him from proceeding to extremities, but in vain. The young prince persisted in his rebellious intentions; and having by feigned submissions prevailed on the emperor to abandon his army, he treacherously seized and confined him. Henry, however, found means to escape from his confinement, and attempted to engage all the sovereigns of Europe in his quarrel; but before any thing effectual could be done, he died at Liege in the year 1106.\n\nThe dispute about investitures was not terminated by the deposition and death of Henry IV. His son Henry V. pursued the very same conduct for which he had deposed his father. Paschal opposed him with violence; upon which Henry gave him an invitation into Germany, to end the dispute in an amicable manner. Paschal did not think proper to accept of this invitation; but put himself under the protection of Philip I., king of France, who undertook to mediate between the contending parties. His mediation, however, proved ineffectual, and Henry was prevented by the wars in Hungary and Poland from paying any further attention to the affair of investitures. At last, having settled his affairs in Germany, he took a resolution of going to Rome, in order to settle the dispute personally with the pope. To give his arguments the greater weight, however, he marched at the head of an army of 80,000 men. Paschal received him with great appearance of friendship, but would not renounce the claim of investitures; and Henry, finding himself deceived in his expectations, ordered the pope to be seized. The consul put the citizens in arms to defend the pope, and a battle was fought within the walls of Rome. The slaughter was so great, that the waters of the Tiber were tinged with blood. The Romans were defeated, and Paschal was taken prisoner. The latter renounced his right of investiture; solemnly swore never to resume it, and broke his oath as soon as Henry was gone, by fulminating the sentence of excommunication against him. In 1114 died the countess Matilda, who had bequeathed all her domains to the pope, as we have already observed; but Henry thinking himself the only lawful heir, alleged, that it was not in Matilda's power to alienate her estates, which depended immediately on the empire. He therefore set out for Lombardy, and sent ambassadors to the pope, beseeching him to revoke the sentence of excommunication above mentioned. Paschal, however, would not even favour the ambassadors with an audience; but dreading the approach of Henry himself, he took refuge among the Norman princes in Apulia. Henry arrived at Rome in 1117; but being soon after obliged to leave it in order to settle some affairs in Tuscany, the pope returned to Rome, but died in a few days. On the third day after his decease, Cardinal Cajetan was elected his successor, without the privity of the emperor, under the name of Gelasius II. The new pope was instantly deposed by Henry; who set up the archbishop of Prague, under the name of Gregory VIII. Gelasius, though supported by the Norman princes, was obliged to take refuge\nrefuge in France, where he died; and the archbishop of Vienna was elected by the cardinals then present under the name of Calixtus II.\n\nThe new pope attempted an accommodation with Henry; which not succeeding, he excommunicated the emperor, the antipope, and his adherents. He next set out for Rome, where he was honourably received; and Gregory VIII. was forced to retire to Sutri, a strong town garrisoned by the emperor's troops. Here he was besieged by Calixtus and the Norman princes. The city was soon taken, and Gregory thrown into prison by his competitor; but at last, the states of the empire being quite wearied out with such a long quarrel, unanimously supplicated Henry for peace. He referred himself entirely to their decision; and a diet being assembled at Wurtzburg, it was decreed that an embassy should be immediately sent to the pope, deeming that he would convolve a general council at Rome, by which all disputes might be determined. This was accordingly done, and the affair of investitures at length regulated in the following manner, viz. That the emperor should leave the communities and chapters at liberty to fill up their own vacancies, without bestowing investitures with the crofs and ring; that he should restore all that he had unjustly taken from the church; that all elections should be made in a canonical manner, in presence of the emperor or his commissaries; and whatever disputes might happen should be referred to the decision of the emperor, assisted by the metropolitan and his suffragans; that the person elected should receive from the emperor the investiture of the fiefs and secular rights, not with the crofs, but with the sceptre; and should pay allegiance to him for these rights only.\n\nAfter the death of Henry, the usual disorders took place in Italy; during which, Roger duke of Apulia conquered the island of Sicily, and assumed the right of creating popes, of whom there were two at that time, viz. Innocent II. and Anacletus. Roger drove out the former, and Lothario emperor of Germany the latter, forcing Roger himself at the same time to retire into Sicily. The emperor then conducted Innocent back to Rome in triumph; and having subdued all Apulia, Calabria, and the rest of Roger's Italian dominions, erected them into a principality, and bestowed it, with the title of duke, upon Renaud, a German prince, and one of his own relations.\n\nIn the reign of Conrad III. who succeeded Lothario, the celebrated factions called the Guelphs and Gibelines*, arose, which for many years deluged the cities of Italy with blood. They took their origin during a civil war in Germany, in which the enemies of the emperor were styled Guelphs, and his friends Gibelines; and these names were quickly received in Italy as well as other parts of the emperor's dominions. Of this civil war many of the cities in Italy took the advantage to set up for themselves; neither was it in the power of Conrad, who during his whole reign was employed in unsuccessful crusades, to reduce them; but in 1158 Frederic Barbarossa, successor to Conrad, entered Italy at the head of a very numerous and well disciplined army. His army was divided into several columns, for the conveniency of entering the country by as many different routes. Having passed the Alps, he reduced the town of Brescia; where he made several salutary regulations for the preservation of good order and military discipline. Continuing to advance, he besieged Milan, which surrendered at discretion. He was crowned king of Lombardy at Monza; and having made himself master of all the other cities of that country, he ordered a minute inquiry to be set on foot concerning the rights of the empire, and exacted homage of all those who held of it, without excepting even the bishops. Grievances were redressed; magistracies reformed; the rights of regality disfused and ascertained; new laws enacted for the maintenance of public tranquillity and the encouragement of learning, which now began to revive in the school of Bologna; and, above all, subvassals were not only prohibited from alienating their lands, but also compelled, in their oath to their lords paramount, to except the emperor nominally, when they swore to serve and assist them against all their enemies. The pope took umbrage at this behaviour towards the ecclesiastics; but Frederic justified what he had done, telling his deputies it was but reasonable they should do homage for the fiefs they possessed; as Jesus Christ himself, though the lord of all the sovereigns upon earth, had deigned to pay for himself and St Peter the tribute which was due to Caesar.\n\nFrederic having sent commissaries to superintend the election of new magistrates at Milan, the inhabitants were so much provoked at this infringement of their old privileges, that they insulted the imperialists, revolted, and refused to appear before the emperor's tribunal. This he highly resented, and resolved to chastise them severely; for which purpose he sent for a reinforcement from Germany, which soon after arrived with the empress, while he himself ravaged Liguria, declared the Milanese rebels to the empire, and plundered and burnt the city of Crema which was in alliance with that of Milan.\n\nIn the mean time, Pope Adrian IV. dying, two opposite factions elected two persons known by the names of Victor II. and Alexander III. The emperor's allies necessarily acknowledged the pope chosen by him; and those princes who were jealous of the emperor, acknowledged the other. Victor II. Frederic's pope, had Germany, Bohemia, and one half of Italy on his side; while the rest submitted to Alexander III. The emperor took a severe revenge on his enemies; Milan was razed from the foundation, and and default firewood on its ruins; Brescia and Placentia were always dismantled; and the other cities which had taken part Ian, &c. with them were deprived of their privileges. Alexander III. however, who had excited the revolt, returned to Rome after the death of his rival; and at his return the civil war was renewed. The emperor caused another pope, and after his death a third, to be elected. Alexander then fled to France, the common asylum of every pope who was oppressed by the emperors; but the flames of civil discord which he had raised continued daily to spread. In 1168, the cities of Italy, supported by the Greek emperor and the king of Sicily, entered into an association for the defense of their liberties; and the pope's party at length prevailed. In 1176, the imperial army, worn out by fatigues and diseases, was defeated by the confederates, and Frederic himself narrowly escaped. About the same time, he was defeated at sea by the Venetians;\nand his eldest son Henry, who commanded his fleet, fell into the hands of the enemy. The pope, in honour of this victory, sailed out into the open sea, accompanied by the whole senate; and after having pronounced a thousand benedictions on that element, threw into it a ring as a mark of his gratitude and affection. Hence the origin of that ceremony which is annually performed by the Venetians, under the notion of eloping the Adriatic. These misfortunes disfitted the emperor towards a reconciliation with the pope: but, reckoning it below his dignity to make an advance, he rallied his troops, and exerted himself with so much vigour in repairing his loss, that the confederates were defeated in a battle; after which he made proposals of peace, which were now joyfully accepted, and Venice was the place appointed for a reconciliation. The emperor, the pope, and a great many princes and cardinals, attended; and there the emperor, in 1177, put an end to the dispute, by acknowledging the pope, killing his feet, and holding his stirrup while he mounted his mule. This reconciliation was attended with the submission of all the towns of Italy which had entered into an association for their mutual defence. They obtained a general pardon, and were left at liberty to use their own laws and forms of government, but were obliged to take the oath of allegiance to the emperor as their superior lord. Calixtus, the antipope, finding himself abandoned by the emperor in consequence of this treaty, made also his submission to Alexander, who received him with great humanity; and in order to prevent for the future those disturbances which had so often attended the elections of the popes, he called a general council, in which it was decreed, that no pope should be deemed duly elected without having two-thirds of the votes in his favour.\n\nThe affairs of Italy being thus settled, Barbarossa returned to Germany; and having quieted some disturbances which had arisen during his absence in Italy, at last undertook an expedition into the Holy Land; where having performed great exploits, he was drowned as he was swimming in the river Cydnus, in the year 1190. He was succeeded by his son Henry VI, who at the same time became heir to the dominions of Sicily by the right of his wife, daughter of William king of that country. After settling the affairs of Germany, the new emperor marched with an army into Italy, in order to be crowned by the pope, and to recover the succession of Sicily, which was usurped by Tancred his wife's natural brother. For this purpose, he endeavoured to conciliate the affections of the Lombards, by enlarging the privileges of Genoa, Pisa, and other cities, in his way to Rome; where the ceremony of the coronation was performed by Celestine III, on the day after Easter in the year 1191. The pope, then in the 86th year of his age, had no sooner placed the crown upon Henry's head, than he kicked it off again, as a testimony of the power residing in the sovereign pontiff to make and unmake emperors at his pleasure.\n\nThe coronation being over, Henry prepared for the conquest of Naples and Sicily; but in this he was opposed by the pope: for though Celestine considered Tancred as an usurper, and desired to see him deprived of the crown of Sicily, which he claimed as a fief of the fee, yet he was much more averse to the emperor's being put in possession of it, as that would render him too powerful in Italy for the interest of the church. Henry, however, without paying any regard to the threats and remonstrances of his holiness, took almost all the towns of Campania, Calabria, and Apulia; invested the city of Naples; and sent for the Genoese fleet, which he had before engaged, to come and form the blockade by sea: but before its arrival, he was obliged to raise the siege, in consequence of a dreadful mortality among his troops: and all future attempts upon Sicily were ineffectual during the life of Tancred.\n\nThe whole reign of Henry from this time seems to have been a continued train of the most abominable and cruel perjuries and cruelties. Having treacherously seized and imprisoned Richard I. of England, in the manner related under that article, No. 128\u2014130, he had no sooner received the ransom paid for his royal captive, than he made new preparations for the conquest of Sicily. As Tancred died about this time, the emperor, with the assistance of the Genoese, accomplished his purpose. The queen-dowager surrendered Salerno, and her right to the crown, on condition that her son William should possess the principality of Tarentum; but Henry no sooner found himself master of the place, than he ordered the infant king to be castrated, to have his eyes put out, and to be confined in a dungeon. The royal treasure was transported to Germany, and the queen and her daughter confined in a convent.\n\nIn the mean time, the empress, though near the age of 50, was delivered of a son, named Frederic; and Henry soon after assembled a diet of the princes of Germany, to whom he explained his intentions of rendering the imperial crown hereditary, in order to prevent those disturbances which usually attended the election of emperors. A decree passed for this purpose; and Frederic, yet in his cradle, was declared king of the Romans. Soon after, the emperor being solicited to undertake a crusade, obeyed the injunctions of the pope, but in such a manner as to make it turn out to his own advantage. He convoked a general diet at Worms, where he solemnly declared his resolution of employing his whole power, and even of hazarding his life, for the accomplishment of so holy an enterprise; and he expatiated upon the subject with so much eloquence, that almost the whole assembly took the cross. Nay, such multitudes from all the provinces of the empire enlisted themselves, that Henry divided them into three large armies; one of which, under the command of the bishop of Mentz, took the route of Hungary, where it was joined by Margaret, queen of that country, who entered herself in this pious expedition, and actually ended her days in Palestine: the second was assembled in Lower Saxony, and embarked in a fleet furnished by the inhabitants of Lubeck, Hamburg, Holstein, and Friesland: and the emperor in person conducted the third into Italy, in order to take vengeance on the Normans in Naples and Sicily who had risen against his government.\n\nThe rebels were humbled; and their chiefs were condemned to perish by the most excruciating tortures. One Jornandi, of the house of the Norman princes, was tied naked on a chair of red-hot iron, and crowned\ncrowned with a circle of the same burning metal, which was nailed to his head. The empresses, shocked at such cruelty, renounced her faith to her husband, and encouraged her countrymen to recover their liberties. Resolution sprung from despair. The inhabitants took themselves to arms; the empress Constantia headed them; and Henry, having dismissed his troops, no longer thought necessary to his bloody purposes, and sent them to pursue their expedition to the Holy Land, was obliged to submit to his wife, and to the conditions which she was pleased to impose on him in favour of the Sicilians. He died at Messina in 1197, soon after this treaty; and, as was supposed, of poison administered by the empress.\n\nThe emperor's son Frederic had already been declared king of the Romans, and consequently became emperor on the death of his father; but as Frederic II. was yet a minor, the administration was committed to his uncle the duke of Swabia, both by the will of Henry and by an assembly of the German princes. Other princes, however, incensed to see an elective empire become hereditary, held a new diet at Cologne, and chose Otho duke of Brunswick, son of Henry the Lion. Frederic's title was confirmed in a third assembly at Arniburg; and his uncle, Philip duke of Swabia, was elected king of the Romans, in order to give greater weight to his administration. These two elections divided the empire into two powerful factions, and involved all Germany in ruin and desolation. Innocent III., who had succeeded Celestin in the papal chair, threw himself into the scale of Otho, and excommunicated Philip and all his adherents. This able and ambitious pontiff was a sworn enemy of the house of Swabia; not from any personal animosity, but out of a principle of policy. That house had long been terrible to the popes, by its continual possession of the imperial crown; and the accession of the kingdom of Naples and Sicily made it still more to be dreaded. Innocent, therefore, gladly seized the present favourable opportunity for divesting it of the empire, by supporting the election of Otho, and fanning divisions among the Swabian party. Otho was also patronized by his uncle, the king of England; which naturally inclined the king of France to the side of his rival. Faction clashed with faction; friendship with interest; caprice, ambition, or resentment, gave the way; and nothing was beheld on all hands but the horrors and the miseries of civil wars.\n\nMeanwhile, the empress Constantia remained in Sicily, where all was peace, as regent and guardian for her infant son Frederic II., who had been crowned king of that island, with the consent of Pope Celestin III. But she also had her troubles. A new investiture from the holy see being necessary, on the death of Celestin, Innocent III., his successor, took advantage of the critical situation of affairs for aggrandizing the papacy, at the expense of the kings of Sicily. They petitioned, as has been already observed, the privilege of filling up vacant benefices, and of judging all ecclesiastical causes in the last appeal: they were really popes in their own island, though vassals of his holiness. Innocent pretended that these powers had been surreptitiously obtained; and demanded, that Constantia should renounce them in the name of her son, and do liege, pure, and simple homage for Sicily.\n\nBut before anything was settled relative to this affair, the empress died, leaving the regency of the kingdom to the pope; so that he was enabled to prescribe what conditions he thought proper to young Frederic. The troubles of Germany still continued; and the pope redoubled his efforts to detach the princes and prelates from the cause of Philip, notwithstanding the remonstrances of the king of France, to whom he proudly replied, \"Either Philip must lose the empire, or I the papacy.\" But all these dissensions and troubles in Europe did not prevent the formation of another crusade, or expedition into Asia, for the recovery of the Holy Land. Those who took the cross were principally French and Germans; Baldwin, count of Flanders, was their commander; and the Venetians, as greedy of wealth and power as the ancient Carthaginians, furnished them with ships, for which they took care to be amply paid both in money and territory. The Christian city of Zara, in Dalmatia, had withdrawn itself from the government of the republic; the army of the cross undertook to reduce it to obedience; and it was besieged and taken, notwithstanding the threats and excommunications of the pope.\n\nWhile the crusaders were spreading desolation through the east, Philip and Otho were in like manner desolating the west. At length Philip prevailed; and Otho, obliged to abandon Germany, took refuge in England. Philip, elated with success, confirmed his election by a second coronation, and proposed an accommodation with the pope, as the means of finally establishing his throne; but before it could be brought about, he fell a sacrifice to private revenge, being assassinated by the count Palatine of Bavaria, whose daughter he had promised to marry, and afterwards rejected. Otho returned to Germany, on the death of Philip; married that prince's daughter; and was crowned at Rome by Pope Innocent III., after yielding to the holy see the long-disputed inheritance of the countess Matilda, and confirming the rights and privileges of the Italian cities. But these concessions, as far at least as regarded the pope, were only a sacrifice to present policy: Otho, therefore, no sooner found himself in a condition to act offensively, than he resumed his grant; and in 1210 not only recovered the possessions of the empire, but made hostile incursions into Apulia, ravaging the dominions of young Frederic king of Naples and Sicily, who was under the protection of the holy see. For this reason he was excommunicated by Innocent; and Frederic, now 17 years of age, was elected emperor by a diet of the German princes. Otho, however, on his return to Germany, finding his party still considerable, and not doubting but he should be able to humble his rival by means of his superior force, entered into an alliance with his uncle John king of England, against Philip Augustus king of France, A.D. 1213. The unfortunate battle of Bouvines, where the confederates were defeated, completed the fate of Otho. He attempted to retreat into Germany, but was prevented by young Frederic; who had marched into the empire at the head of a powerful army, and was everywhere received with open arms. Thus abandoned by all the princes of Germany, and altogether without resource, Otho retired to Brunswick, where he lived four years as a private man, dedicating his time to the duties of religion.\nFrederic II., being now universally acknowledged emperor, was crowned at Aix-la-Chapelle in 1215, with great magnificence; when, in order to preserve the favour of the pope, he added to the other solemnities of his coronation a vow to go in person to the Holy Land.\n\nThe bad success of this expedition hath been already taken notice of under the article Croisade. The emperor had, on various pretences, refused to go into the east; and in 1225, the pope, incensed at the loss of Damietta, wrote a severe letter to him, taxing him with having sacrificed the interests of Christianity by delaying so long the performance of his vow, and threatening him with immediate excommunication if he did not instantly depart with an army to Aifa. Frederic, exasperated at these reproaches, renounced all correspondence with the court of Rome: renewed his ecclesiastical jurisdiction in Sicily; filled up vacant sees and benefices; and expelled some bishops, who were creatures of the pope, on pretence of their being concerned in practices against the state.\n\nThe pope at first threatened the emperor with the thunder of the church, for presuming to lift up his hand against the sanctuary; but finding Frederic not to be intimidated, he became sensible of his own imprudence in wantonly incurring the resentment of so powerful a prince, and thought proper to soothe him by submissive apologies and gentle exhortations. They were accordingly reconciled, and conferred together at Veroli in 1226; where the emperor, as a proof of his sincere attachment to the church, published some very severe edicts against heresy, which seem to have authorized the tribunal of the inquisition. A solemn assembly was afterwards held at Ferentino, where both the pope and the emperor were present, together with John de Brienne, titular king of Jerusalem, who was come to Europe to demand succours against the sultan of Egypt. John had an only daughter named Yolanda, whom he proposed as a wife to the emperor, with the kingdom of Jerusalem as her dower, on condition that Frederic should within two years perform the vow he had made to lead an army into the Holy Land. Frederic married her on these terms, because he chose to please the pope; and since that time the kings of Sicily have taken the title of king of Jerusalem. But the emperor was in no hurry to go and conquer his wife's portion, having business of more importance on his hands at home. The chief cities of Lombardy had entered into a secret league, with a view to renounce his authority. He convoked a diet at Cremona, where all the German and Italian noblemen were summoned to attend. A variety of subjects were there discussed; but nothing of consequence was settled. An accommodation, however, was soon after brought about by the mediation of the pope; who, as umpire of the dispute, decreed, that the emperor should lay aside his resentment against the confederate towns, and that the towns should furnish and maintain 400 knights for the relief of the Holy Land.\n\nPeace being thus concluded, Honorius reminded the emperor of his vow; Frederic promised compliance; but his holiness died before he could see the execution of a project which he seemed to have so much at heart. He was succeeded in the papal chair by Gregory IX., brother of Innocent III.; who, pursuing the same line of policy, urged the departure of Frederic for the Holy Land; and finding the emperor still backward, declared him incapable of the imperial dignity, as having incurred the sentence of excommunication. Frederic, incensed at such insolence, ravaged the patrimony of St Peter; and was actually excommunicated. The animosity between the Guelphs and Gibellines revived; the pope was obliged to quit Rome; and Italy became a scene of war and desolation, or rather of a hundred civil wars; which, by inflaming the minds and exciting the resentment of the Italian princes, accustomed them too much to the horrid practices of poisoning and assassination.\n\nDuring these transactions, Frederic, in order to remove the cause of all these troubles, and gratify the prejudices of a superstitious age, by the advice of his friends resolved to perform his vow; and he accordingly embarked for the Holy Land, leaving the affairs of Italy to the management of Renaldo duke of Spoleto. The pope prohibited his departure before he should be absolved from the censures of the church; but Frederic went in contempt of the church, and succeeded better than any person who had gone before him. He did not indeed delocate Aifa, and gratify the barbarous zeal of the times by spilling the blood of infidels; but he concluded a treaty with Mladen, sultan of Egypt and master of Syria, by which the end of his expedition seemed fully answered. The sultan ceded to him Jerusalem and its territory as far as Joppa; Bethlehem, Nazareth, and all the country between Jerusalem and Ptolemais; Tyre, Sidon, and the neighbouring territories: in return for which, the emperor granted the Saracens a truce of ten years; and in 1230 prudently returned to Italy, where his presence was much wanted.\n\nFrederic's reign, after his return from the east, was one continued quarrel with the popes. The cities of Lombardy had revolted during his absence, at the instigation of Gregory IX.; and before they could be reduced, the same pontiff excited the emperor's son Henry, who had been elected king of the Romans, to rebel against his father. The rebellion was suppressed, the prince was confined, and the emperor obtained a complete victory over the afflicated towns. But his troubles were not yet ended. The pope excommunicated him anew, and sent a bull, filled with the most absurd and ridiculous language, into Germany, in order to sow division between Frederic and the princes of the empire.\n\nFrederic retorted in the same strain, in his apology to the princes of Germany, calling Gregory the Great Dragon, the Antichrist, &c. The emperor's apology was sustained in Germany; and finding he had nothing to fear from that quarter, he resolved to take ample vengeance on the pope and his associates. For that purpose he marched to Rome, where he thought his party was strong enough to procure him admission; but this favourite scheme was defeated by the activity of Gregory, who ordered a crusade to be preached against the emperor, as an enemy of the Christian faith; a step which incensed Frederic so much, that he ordered all his prisoners who wore the cross to be exposed to the most cruel tortures. The two factions of the Guelphs and Gibellines continued to rage with greater violence than ever, involving cities, districts, and...\nand even private families, in troubles, divisions, and civil butchery; no quarter being given on either side. Meanwhile Gregory IX died, and was succeeded in the see of Rome by Celestine IV, and afterwards by Innocent IV, formerly Cardinal Fiesque, who had always expressed the greatest regard for the emperor and his intellect. Frederic was accordingly congratulated upon this occasion; but having more penetration than those about him, he sagely replied, \"I see little reason to rejoice; the cardinal was my friend, but the pope will be my enemy.\" Innocent soon proved the justice of this conjecture. He attempted to negotiate a peace for Italy; but not being able to obtain from Frederic his exorbitant demands, and in fear for the safety of his own person, he fled into France, assembled a general council at Lyons, and in 1245 deposed the emperor.\n\nConrad, the emperor's second son, had already been declared king of the Romans, on the death of his brother Henry, which now followed his confinement; but the empire being now declared vacant by the pope, the German bishops (for none of the princes were present), at the instigation of his holiness, proceeded to the election of a new emperor; and they chose Henry landgrave of Thuringia, who was styled in derision, The king of priests. Innocent now renewed the crusade against Frederic. It was proclaimed by the preaching friars, since called Dominicans, and the minor friars, known by the name of Cordeliers or Franciscans. The pope, however, did not confine himself to these measures only, but engaged in conspiracies against the life of an emperor who had dared to resist the decree of a council, and oppose the whole body of the monks and zealots. Frederic's life was several times in danger from plots, poisonings, and assassinations; which induced him, it is said, to make choice of Mahometan guards, who, he was certain, would not be under the influence of the prevailing superstition.\n\nAbout this time the landgrave of Thuringia dying, the same prelates who had taken the liberty of creating one emperor made another; namely, William count of Holland, a young nobleman of 20 years of age, who bore the same contemptuous title with his predecessor. Fortune, which had hitherto favoured Frederic, seemed now to desert him. He was defeated before Parma, which he had long besieged; and to complete his misfortune, he soon after learned, that his natural son Entius, whom he had made king of Sardinia, was worsted and taken prisoner by the Bolognese.\n\nIn this extremity Frederic retired to his kingdom of Naples, in order to recruit his army; and there died of a fever in the year 1250. After his death, the affairs of Germany fell into the utmost confusion, and Italy continued long in the same distracted state in which he had left it. The clergy took arms against the laity; the weak were oppressed by the strong; and all laws divine and human were disregarded. After the death of Frederic's son Conrad, who had assumed the imperial dignity as successor to his father, and the death of his competitor William of Holland, a variety of candidates appeared for the empire, and several were elected by different factions, among whom was Richard earl of Cornwall, brother to Henry II, king of England; but no emperor was properly acknowledged till the year 1273, when Rodolph, count of Hapsburg, was unanimously raised to the vacant throne. During the interregnum which preceded the election of Rodolph, Denmark, Holland, and Hungary, entirely freed themselves from the homage they were wont to pay to the empire; and much about the same time several German cities erected a municipal form of government, which still continues. Lubeck, Cologne, Brunswick, and Dantzig, united for their mutual defense against the encroachments of the great lords, by a famous association, called the Hanseatic league; and these towns were afterwards joined by 80 others, belonging to different states, which formed a kind of commercial republic. Italy also, during this period, assumed a new plan of government. That freedom for which the cities of Lombardy had so long struggled, was confirmed to them for a sum of money; they were emancipated by the fruits of their industry. Sicily likewise changed its government and its prince; of which revolution a particular account is given under the article Sicily.\n\nFrom the time of Frederic II, we may date the ruin of the German power in Italy. The Florentines, the Pisans, the Genoese, the Luccans, &c., became independent, and could not again be reduced. The power of the emperor, in short, was in a manner annihilated, when Henry VII undertook to restore it in the beginning of the 14th century. For this purpose a diet was held at Frankfort, where proper supplies being granted for the emperor's journey, well known by the name of the Roman expedition, he set out for Italy, accompanied by the dukes of Austria and Bavaria, the archbishop of Trier, the bishop of Liege, the counts of Savoy and Flanders, and other noblemen, together with the militia of all the imperial towns. Italy was still divided by the factions of the Guelphs and Gibelines, who butchered one another without humanity or remorse. But their contest was no longer the same: it was not now a struggle between the empire and the priesthood, but between faction and faction, inflamed by mutual jealousies and animosities. Pope Clement V had been obliged to leave Rome, which was in the anarchy of popular government. The Colonna, the Orsini, and the Roman barons, divided the city; and this division was the cause of a long abode of the popes in France, so that Rome seemed equally lost to the popes and the emperors. Sicily was in the possession of the house of Arragon, in consequence of the famous massacre called the Sicilian vespers, which delivered that island from the tyranny of the French. Carobert, king of Hungary, disputed the kingdom of Naples with his uncle Robert, son of Charles II, of the house of Anjou. The house of Este had established itself at Ferrara; and the Venetians wanted to make themselves masters of that country. The old league of the Italian cities no longer subsisted. It had been formed with no other view than to oppose the emperors; and since they had neglected Italy, the cities were wholly employed in aggrandizing themselves, at the expense of each other. The Florentines and the Genoese made war upon the republic of Pisa. Every city was also divided into factions within itself. In the midst of these troubles Henry VII appeared in Italy in the year 1311, and caused himself to be crowned king of Lombardy at Milan. But the Guelphs had concealed the old iron crown of the Lombard kings, as\nItaly if the right of reigning were attached to a small circlet of metal. Henry ordered a new crown to be made, with which the ceremony of inauguration was performed.\n\nCremona was the first place that ventured to oppose the emperor. He reduced it by force, and laid it under heavy contributions. Parma, Vicenza, and Placentia, made peace with him on reasonable conditions. Padua paid 100,000 crowns, and received an imperial officer as governor. The Venetians presented Henry with a large sum of money, an imperial crown of gold enriched with diamonds, and a chain of very curious workmanship. Brescia made a desperate resistance, and sustained a very severe siege; in the course of which the emperor's brother was slain, and his army diminished to such a degree, that the inhabitants marched out under the command of their prefect Thibault de Druslatt, and gave him battle; but they were repulsed with great loss, after an obstinate engagement; and at last obliged to submit, and their city was dismantled. From Brescia Henry marched to Genoa, where he was received with expressions of joy, and splendidly entertained. He next proceeded to Rome; where, after much bloodshed, he received the imperial crown from the hands of the cardinals. Clement V., who had originally invited Henry into Italy, growing jealous of his success, had league with Robert king of Naples and the Urfini faction, to oppose his entrance into Rome. He entered it in spite of them by the assistance of the Colonnas. Now master of that ancient city, Henry appointed it a governor; and ordered, that all the cities and states of Italy should pay him an annual tribute. In this order he comprehended the kingdom of Naples, to which he was going to make good his claim of superiority by arms, when he died at Benevento in 1313, as is commonly supposed, of poison given him by a Dominican friar, in the consecrated wine of the sacrament.\n\nThe efforts of Henry VII. were unable to restore the imperial power in Italy. From this time the authority of the emperor in that country consisted in a great measure in the conveniency which the Gibellines found in opposing their enemies under the sanction of his name. The power of the pope was much of the same nature. He was less regarded in Italy than in any other country in Christendom. There was indeed a great party who called themselves Guelphs; but they affected this distinction only to keep themselves independent of the imperialists; and the states and princes who called themselves Guelphs paid little more acknowledgment to his holiness than sheltering themselves under his name and authority. The most desperate wars were carried on by the different cities against each other; and in these wars Caltruccio Caltraccani, and Sir John Hawkwood an Englishman, are celebrated as heroes. A detail of these transactions would furnish materials for many volumes; and after all seems to be but of little importance, since nothing material was effected by the utmost efforts of valour, and the belligerent states were commonly obliged to make peace without any advantage on either side. By degrees, however, this martial spirit subsided; and in the year 1492, the Italians were so little capable of resisting an enemy, that Charles VIII. of France conquered the whole kingdom of Naples in six weeks, and might easily have subdued the whole country had it not been for his own imprudence. Another attempt on Italy was made by Louis XII. and a third by Francis I., as related under the article France. In the reigns of Louis XIII. and XIV. an obstinate war was carried on between the French and Spaniards, in which the Italian states bore a very considerable share. The war concluded in 1660, with very little advantage to the French, who have been always unsuccessful in their Italian wars. The like bad success attended them in that part of the world, in the war which commenced between Britain and Spain in the year 1740. But the particulars of these wars, with regard to the different states of Italy, naturally fall to be considered under the history of those states into which the country is now divided; viz. Sardinia, Milan or the Milanese, Genoa, Venice, Tuscany or Florence, Lucca, St Marino, Parma, Mantua, Modena, Rome, and Naples.\n\nThe air in Italy is very different, according to the different situations of the several countries contained in it. In those on the north of the Apennines it is more temperate, but on the south it is generally very warm. The air of the Campania of Rome, and of the Ferrarese, is said to be unhealthful; which is owing to the lands not being duly cultivated, nor the marshes drained. That of the other parts is generally pure, dry, and healthy. In summer, the heat is very great in the kingdom of Naples; and would be almost intolerable, if it was not somewhat alleviated by the sea breezes. The soil of Italy in general is very fertile, being watered by a great number of rivers. It produces a great variety of wines, and the best oil in Europe; excellent silk in abundance; corn of all sorts, but not in such plenty as in some other countries; oranges, lemons, citrons, pomegranates, almonds, raisins, sugar, mulberry-trees without number, figs, peaches, nectarines, apricots, pears, apples, filberts, chestnuts, &c. Most of these fruits were at first imported by the Romans from Asia Minor, Greece, Africa, and Syria, and were not the natural products of the soil. The tender plants are covered in winter on the north side of the Apennines, but on the south side they have no need of it. This country also yields good pasture; and abounds with cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes, wild boars, mules, and horses. The forests are well stored with game; and the mountains yield not only mines of iron, lead, alum, sulphur, marble of all sorts, alabaster, jasper, porphyry, &c. but also gold and silver; with a great variety of aromatic herbs, trees, shrubs, and evergreens, as thyme, lavender, laurel, and bay, wild olive trees, tamarinds, juniper, oaks, and pines.\n\nA very extensive trade is carried on in many places in Italy, particularly at Leghorn, Genoa, Bologna, Venice, and Naples; the country having a great variety of commodities and manufactures for exportation, especially wine, oil, perfumes, fruits, and silks. Travellers also bring large sums of money into Italy, besides what they lay out in pictures, curiosities, relics, antiquities, &c.\n\nThe Italians are generally well proportioned, though their complexions are none of the best. As to dress, they follow the fashions of the countries on which they border, or to which they are subject; namely, those of France, Spain, and Germany. With respect to their genius and taste in architecture, painting, carving, and music,\nmusick, they are thought to excel greatly, and to leave the other nations of Europe far behind them; but their music seems too soft and effeminate to deserve all the praise bestowed on it; and their houses are far inferior to those of England in respect of convenience. No country hath produced better politicians, historians, poets, painters, and sculptors; we mean since the revival of the arts and sciences, exclusive of those of ancient times. The Italians are very affable, courteous, ingenious, sober, and ready-witted; but extremely jealous, vindictive, lascivious, ceremonious, and superstitious. In respect to jealousy, indeed, it is said a very extraordinary change has taken place; and that the Italians are now less indulgent and complaisant to their wives than the most polite husbands in France itself. In their tempers, the Italians seem to be a good medium between the French and Spaniards; neither so gay and volatile as the one, nor so grave and solemn as the other. Boiled snails, served up with oil and pepper, or fried in oil, and the hinder parts of frogs, are reckoned dainty dishes. Kites, jackdaws, hawks, and magpies, are also eaten not only by the common people but by the better sort. Wine is drank here both in summer and winter cooled by ice or snow. The women affect yellow hair, as the Roman ladies and courtizans formerly did. They also use paint and wafles, both for their hands and faces. The day here is reckoned from sunset to sunset, as the Athenians did of old.\n\nRevolution. Amidst the convulsions which agitated Europe in consequence of the French revolution, the different states of Italy were not permitted to enjoy repose. Bonaparte, whose unprecedented and extraordinary success has hitherto even exceeded his military talents, made a rapid conquest of the whole of this country; the battles of Arcola and Lodi are memorable for the desperate valour with which they were fought, and Mantua surrendered on the 2d of February 1797, at ten o'clock at night. The immediate consequence of these successes was the conquest of the popish territories, which was not effected without the effusion of much blood. Different changes and modifications were made in its political constitution after these victories, and the emperor of France was in the illus proclaimed king of Italy. A detail of military and other transactions in Italy, in so far as they stood connected with the political schemes and conquests of the French government, has already been given under the article France, to which we refer our readers.\n\nAccording to Boetticher, the present population of Italy including the islands of Sicily and Sardinia, ought not to be estimated at more than 13,000,000. The kingdom of Naples and Sicily is supposed to contain about 6,000,000; the central part about 3,000,000; and the northern part about 4,000,000.","sp":391,"ep":417},{"h":"ITCH","t":"a cutaneous disease, appearing in small watery pustules on the skin; commonly of a mild nature, though sometimes attended with obstinate and dangerous symptoms.

We must therefore, he observes, not expect to find them in the same proportionate number in patients who for many months have been afflicted with the disease, as in those in whom its appearance is recent, and where it is confined to the fingers or wrists. The cause of this difference with respect to the pustules, he conjectures, may be owing to the death of the insect after it has deposited its eggs.\n\nA small transparent vesicle being found, a very minute white point, distinct from the surrounding fluid, may be discovered, and very often even without the affluence of a glass; this is the insect, which may be easily taken out on the point of a needle or penknife, and when placed on a green cloth may be seen much more distinctly, and observed to move. All this, we must remark, probably depends on optical deception.","sp":417,"ep":417},{"h":"ITEA","t":"a genus of plants belonging to the pentandra class; and in the natural method ranking with those of which the order is doubtful.

The windward passage right before it hath the island of Cuba on the west, and Hispaniola on the east, and is about 25 leagues in breadth.\n\nThis island was discovered by Admiral Christopher Columbus in his second voyage, who landed upon it May 5, 1494; and was so much charmed with it, as always to prefer it to the rest of the islands: in consequence of which, his son chose it for his dukedom. It was settled by Juan d'Esquivel, A.D. 1509, who built the town, which, from the place of his birth, he called Seville, and 11 leagues farther to the east flood Melilla. Orifton was on the south side of the island, seated on what is now called Blue Fields River. All these are gone to decay; but St Jago, now Spanish-town, is still the capital. The Spaniards held this country 160 years, and in their time the principal commodity was cacao; they had an immense flock of horses, asses, and mules, and prodigious quantities of cattle. The English landed here under Penn and Venables, May 11, 1654, and quickly reduced the island. Cacao was also their principal commodity till the old trees decayed, and the new ones did not thrive; and then the planters from Barbados introduced sugar-canes, which hath been the great staple ever since.\n\nThe prospect of this island from the sea, by reason of its constant verdure, and many fair and false bays, is wonderfully pleasant. The coast, and for some miles within, the land is low; but removing farther, it rises and becomes hilly. The whole isle is divided by a ridge of mountains running east and west, some rising\nto a great height; and these are composed of rock and a very hard clay; through which, however, the rains that fall incessantly upon them have worn long and deep cavities, which they call gullies. These mountains, however, are far from being unpleasing, as they are crowned even to their summits with a variety of fine trees. There are also about a hundred rivers that issue from them on both sides: and, though none of them are navigable for any thing but canoes, are both pleasing and profitable in many other respects. The climate, like that of all countries between the tropics, is very warm towards the sea, and in marshy places unhealthy; but in more elevated situations, cooler; and, where people live temperately, to the full as wholesome as in any part of the West Indies. The rains fall heavy for about a fortnight in the months of May and October; and, as they are the cause of fertility, are styled seasons. Thunder is pretty frequent, and sometimes showers of hail: but ice and snow are never seen, although on the tops of the mountains, and at no very great height, the air is exceedingly cold.\n\nThe most eastern parts of this ridge are known under the name of the Blue Mountain. This great chain of rugged rocks defends the south side of the island from those boisterous north-west winds, which might be fatal to their produce. Their streams, though small, supply the inhabitants with good water, which is a great blessing, as their wells are generally brackish. The Spaniards were persuaded that these hills abounded with metals; but we do not find that they wrought any mines; or if they did, it was only copper, of which they said the bells in the church of St Jago were made. They have several hot springs, which have done great cures. The climate was certainly more temperate before the great earthquake; and the island was supposed to be out of the reach of hurricanes, which since that time it hath severely felt. The heat, however, is very much tempered by land and sea breezes; and it is asserted, that the hottest time of the day is about eight in the morning. In the night, the wind blows from the land on all sides, so that no ships can then enter their ports.\n\nIn an island so large as this, which contains above five millions of acres, it may be very reasonably conceived that there are great variety of soils. Some of these are deep, black, and rich, and mixed with a kind of potters earth; others shallow and sandy; and some of a middle nature. There are many savannahs, or wide plains, without stones, in which the native Indians had luxuriant crops of maize, which the Spaniards turned into meadows, and kept in them prodigious herds of cattle. Some of these savannahs are to be met with even amongst the mountains. All these different soils may be justly pronounced fertile, as they would certainly be found, if tolerably cultivated, and applied to proper purposes. A sufficient proof of this will arise from a very cursory review of the natural and artificial produce of this spacious country.\n\nIt abounds in maize, pulse, vegetables of all kinds, meadows of fine grass, a variety of beautiful flowers, and as great a variety of oranges, lemons, citrons, and other rich fruits. Useful animals there are of all sorts, horses, asses, mules, black cattle of a large size, and sheep, the flesh of which is well tasted, though their wool is hairy and bad. Here are also goats and hogs in great plenty; sea and river fish; wild, tame, and water-fowl. Amongst other commodities of great value, they have the sugar-cane, cacao, indigo, pimento, cotton, ginger, and coffee; trees for timber and other uses, such as mahogany, manchineel, white wood which no worm will touch, cedar, olives, and many more. Besides these, they have fustick, red wood, and various other materials for dyeing. To these we may add a multitude of valuable drugs, such as guaiacum, china, farfarailla, castia, tamarinds, vanellas, and the prickly-pear or opuntia, which produces the cochineal; with no inconsiderable number of odoriferous gums. Near the coast they have salt-ponds, from which at one time they supplied their own consumption, and might certainly make any quantity they pleased.\n\nAs this island abounds with rich commodities, it is happy likewise in having a number of fine and safe ports. Point Morant, the eastern extremity of the island, hath a fair and commodious bay. Passing on to the south, there is Port Royal: on a neck of land which forms one side of it, there stood once the fairest town in the island; and the harbour is as fine a one as can be wished, capable of holding a thousand large vessels, and still the station of our squadron. Old Harbour is also a convenient port, so is Maccary Bay; and there are at least twelve more between this and the western extremity, which is Point Negrillo, where our ships of war lie when there is a war with Spain. On the north side there is Orange bay, Cold harbour, Rio Novo, Montego bay, Port Antonio, one of the finest in the island, and several others. The north-west winds, which sometimes blow furiously on this coast, render the country on that side less fit for canes, but pimento thrives wonderfully; and certainly many other staples might be raised in small plantations, which are frequent in Barbadoes, and might be very advantageous here in many respects.\n\nThe town of Port Royal stood on a point of land running far out into the sea, narrow, sandy, and incapable of producing anything. Yet the excellence of the port, the convenience of having ships of seven hundred tons coming close up to their wharfs, and other advantages, gradually attracted inhabitants in such a manner, that though many of their habitations were built on piles, there were near two thousand houses in the town in its most flourishing state, and which let at high rents. The earthquake by which it was overthrown happened on the 7th of June 1692, and numbers of people perished in it. This earthquake was followed by an epidemic disease, of which upwards of three thousand died: yet the place was rebuilt; but the greatest part was reduced to ashes by a fire that happened on the 9th of January 1703, and then the inhabitants removed mostly to Kingston. It was, however, rebuilt for the third time; and was rising towards its former grandeur, when it was overwhelmed by the sea, August 28, 1742. There is, notwithstanding, a small town there at this day. Hurricanes since that time have often happened, and occasioned terrible devastations.\n\nThe island is divided into three counties, Middlesex, Surry, and Cornwall; containing 20 parishes, over each of which presides a magistrate styled a captain; but there\nthese parishes in point of size are a kind of hundreds. The whole contain 36 towns and villages, 18 churches and chapels, and about 23,000 white inhabitants.\n\nThe administration of public affairs is by a governor and council of royal appointment, and the representatives of the people in the lower house of assembly. They meet at Spanish-town, and things are conducted with great order and dignity. The lieutenant-governor and commander in chief has 500l. currency, or 3571l. 8s. 6\u00bdd. sterling besides which, he has a houle in Spanish-town, a pen or a farm adjoining, and a polin or mountain for provisions: a secretary, an under-secretary, and a domestic chaplain.\n\nThe honourable the council consists of a president and 10 members; with a clerk, at 270l. a chaplain 100l., usher of the black rod and messenger 250l.\n\nThe honourable the assembly consists of 43 members, one of whom is chosen speaker. To this assembly belong a clerk, with 100l. salary; a chaplain, 150l.; messenger, 700l.; deputy, 100l.; and printer, 200l.\n\nThe number of members returned by each parish and county are, for Middlesex 17, viz. St Catharine 3, St Dorothy 2, St John 2, St Thomas in the Vale 2, Clarendon 2, Vere 2, St Mary 2, St Ann 2: For Surrey 16, viz. Kingston 3, Port Royal 3, St Andrew 2, St David 2, St Thomas in the Elst 2, Portland 2, St George 2: For Cornwall 10, viz. St Elizabeth 2, Westmoreland 2, Hanover 2, St James 2, Trelawney 2.\n\nThe high court of chancery consists of the chancellor (governor for the time being), 25 masters in ordinary, and 20 masters extraordinary; a register, and clerk of the patents; serjeant at arms, and mace-bearer. The court of vice admiralty has a sole judge, judge surrogate, and commissary, king's advocate, principal registrar, marshal, and a deputy-marshal. The court of ordinary, consists of the ordinary (governor for the time being), and a clerk. The supreme court of judicature has a chief justice, 120l. and 16 assistant judges; attorney-general, 400l.; clerk of the court, 100l.; clerk of the crown, 350l.; solicitor for the crown: 33 commissioners for taking affidavits; a provost-marshal-general, and eight deputies; 18 barristers, besides the attorney-general and advocate-general; and upward of 120 practising attorneys at law.\n\nThe commerce of Jamaica is very considerable, not only with all parts of Great Britain and Ireland, but with Africa, North and South America, the West Indies, and the Spanish main. The ships annually employed are upwards of 500 sail.\n\nThe following account of the exports of this island in 1770, as given by Abb\u00e9 Raynal, but which in several particulars appears to be under-rated, will contribute more than all that hath been said, to show the importance of Jamaica. They consisted in 2249 bales of cotton, which at 10 pounds per bale, the price in the island, amounts to 22,490l.; 1873 hundred weight of coffee, at three pounds five shillings per hundred, 6088l.; 2753 bags of ginger, at two pounds five shillings per bag, 6194l.; 2211 hides, at seven shillings per hide, 773l.; 16,475 puncheons of rum, at 10l. per puncheon, 164,750l. Mahogany, 15,282 pieces and 8500 feet, 50,000l. Of pimento, 2,089,734 pounds weight, 52,243l. Sugar, 57,675 hogheads, 6425 tierces, 52 barrels, at seventeen pounds ten shillings per hoghead, twelve pounds per tierce, and four pounds per barrel, amounting in the whole to 1,086,620l. Saraparilla, 205 bags, at ten pounds per bag, 2250l. Exports to Great Britain and Ireland, 1,301,210l. To North America, 1,463,24l. To the other islands, 595l. Total of the exports, 1,538,730l.\n\nThe following is a general view of the property and chief produce of the whole island in 1786, as prefixed by Mr Beckford to his descriptive account of Jamaica.\n\n| Counties | Sugar Estates | Other Settlements | Slaves | Produce Hhds. of Sugar | Cattle |\n|----------|---------------|-------------------|--------|-----------------------|--------|\n| Middlesex| 323           | 917               | 87100  | 31500                 | 75000  |\n| Surrey   | 350           | 540               | 75600  | 34900                 | 80000  |\n| Cornwall | 388           | 561               | 90000  | 39000                 | 69500  |\n| Total    | 1061          | 2018              | 255700 | 105400                | 224500 |\n\nIt should be here observed, that where two hogheads of sugar are made, there is at least one puncheon of rum; but the proportion has been of late years more considerable: the quantity of the latter will therefore be 52,700 puncheons.\n\nA comparative view between the years 1768 and 1786.\n\n|                  | Middlesex in 1768 | Middlesex in 1786 | Surrey in 1768 | Surrey in 1786 | Cornwall in 1768 | Cornwall in 1786 | Total in 1768 | Total in 1786 | Amount of Increase |\n|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|\n| Sugar Estates    | 239               | 323               | 146            | 350            | 266             | 388             | 651          | 1061        | 410              |\n| Sugar Hhds.      | 24050             | 31500             | 15010          | 34900          | 29100           | 39000           | 68160        | 105400      | 37240            |\n| Negroes           | 66744             | 87100             | 39542          | 75600          | 60614           | 93000           | 166900       | 255700      | 88800            |\n| Cattle            | 59510             | 73000             | 21465          | 80000          | 54775           | 69500           | 133750       | 224500      | 88750            |\nFrom the above scheme it appears, how considerable has been the increase of sugar-estates, and consequently of produce of negroes and cattle in eighteen years; and in the same portion of time (it is said), if proper encouragement were given, they might be augmented in a threefold proportion.\n\nThe common valuation of an estate in Jamaica is as follows:\n\n| Item                        | Sterling |\n|-----------------------------|----------|\n| Cane land (the canes upon it valued separately) at | \u00a322 per acre |\n| Plants                      | 22 ditto |\n| Cane land, in ratoons and young plants, | 15 ditto |\n| Pasture land                | 8 ditto |\n| Wood land                   | 4 ditto |\n| Provisions                  | 14 ditto |\n| Negroes                     | 57 ditto |\n| Mules                       | 22 ditto |\n| Steers                      | 10 ditto |\n| Breeding cattle, &c.        | 5 ditto |\n| Works, water, carts, &c.    | from 7 to 10,000 |\n\nIf a planter would wish to leave his estate for a number of years, his income would be large if he could get only 10d. sterling a day for his negroes (the loss made good), without requiring anything for his land or works.","sp":30,"ep":33},{"h":"JAMBI","t":"or JAMBIS, a sea-port town and small kingdom of Asia, on the eastern coast of the island of Sumatra.

He was called to be an apostle, together with St John, as they were mending their nets with their father Zebedee, who was a fisherman; when Christ gave them the name of Boanerges, or Sons of Thunder. They then followed Christ, were witnesses with St Peter of the transfiguration on Mount Tabor, and accompanied our Lord in the garden of olives. It is believed that St James first preached the gospel to the dispersed Jews; and afterwards returned to Judea, where he preached at Jerusalem, when the Jews raised up Herod Agrippa against him, who put him to a cruel death about the year 44.

His life was so holy, that Josephus con-\nJames fiders the sin of Jerusalem as a punishment inflicted on that city for his death. He was the author of the epistle which bears his name.\n\nSt James of the Sword, (San Jago del Espada), a military order in Spain, instituted in 1170, under the reign of Ferdinand II, king of Leon and Galicia. Its end was to put a stop to the incursions of the Moors; three knights obliging themselves by a vow to secure the roads. An union was proposed and agreed to in 1170 between these and the canons of St Eloy; and the order was confirmed by the pope in 1175. The highest dignity in that order is that of grand master, which has been united to the crown of Spain. The knights are obliged to make proof of their descent from families that have been noble for four generations on both sides; they must also make it appear, that their said ancestors have neither been Jews, Saracens, nor heretics; nor even to have been called in question by the inquisition. The novices are obliged to serve six months in the galleys, and to live a month in a monastery. Heretofore they were truly religious, and took a vow of celibacy; but Alexander III. gave them a permission to marry. They now make no vows but of poverty, obedience, and conjugal fidelity; to which, since the year 1624, they have added that of defending the immaculate conception of the holy Virgin. Their habit is a white cloak, with a red cross on the breast. This is esteemed the most considerable of all the military orders in Spain; the king carefully preserves the office of grand master in his own family, on account of the rich revenues and offices, whereof it gives him the disposal. The number of knights is much greater now than formerly, all the grandees choosing rather to be received into this than into the order of the golden fleece; insomuch as this puts them in a fair way of attaining to commands, and gives them many considerable privileges in all the provinces of Spain, but especially in Catalonia.\n\nJames, the name of several kings of Scotland and of Great Britain. See (Histories of) Scotland and Britain.\n\nJames I, king of Scotland in 1423, the first of the house of Stuart, was not only the most learned king, but the most learned man, of the age in which he flourished. This ingenious and amiable prince fell into the hands of the enemies of his country in his tender youth, when he was flying from the snares of his unnatural ambitious uncle, who governed his dominions, and was suspected of designs against his life. Having secretly embarked for France, the ship was taken by an English privateer off Flamborough-head; and the prince and his attendants (among whom was the earl of Orkney) were confined in a neighbouring castle until they were sent to London. See (History of) Scotland.\n\nThe king of England knew the value of the prize he had obtained, and kept it with the most anxious care. The prince was conducted to the Tower of London immediately after he was seized, April 12. A.D. 1405, in the 13th year of his age; and there kept a close prisoner till June 10. A.D. 1407, when he was removed to the castle of Nottingham, from whence he was brought back to the Tower, March 1. A.D. 1414, and there confined till August 3. in the same year, when he was conveyed to the castle of Windsor, where he was detained till the summer of A.D. 1417; when Henry V. for political reasons, carried him with him into France in his second expedition. In all these fortresses, his confinement, from his own account of it, was so severe and strict, that he was not so much as permitted to take the air. In this melancholy situation, so unsuitable to his age and rank, books were his chief companions, and study his greatest pleasure. He rose early in the morning, immediately applied to reading, to divert him from painful reflections on his misfortunes, and continued his studies, with little interruption, till late at night. James being naturally sensible, ingenious, and fond of knowledge, and having received a good education in his early youth, under the direction of Walter Wardlaw bishop of St Andrews's, by this close application to study, became an universal scholar, an excellent poet, and exquisite musician. That he wrote as well as read much, we have his own testimony, and that of all our historians who lived near his time. Bowmanker, the continuator of Fordun, who was his contemporary, and personally acquainted with him, spends ten chapters in his praises, and in lamentations on his death; and, amongst other things, says, that his knowledge of the scriptures, of law, and philosophy, was incredible. Hector Boece tells us, that Henry IV. and V. furnished their royal prisoner with the best teachers in all the arts and sciences; and that, by their affluence, he made great proficiency in every part of learning and the fine arts; that he became a perfect master in grammar, rhetoric, poetry, music, and all the secrets of natural philosophy, and was inferior to none in divinity and law. He observes further, that the poems he composed in his native tongue were so beautiful, that you might easily perceive he was born a poet; but that his Latin poems were not so faultless; for though they abounded in the most sublime sentiments, their language was not so pure, owing to the rudeness of the times in which he lived. This prince's skill in music was remarkable. Walter Bower abbot of Inchcolm, who was intimately acquainted with that prince, assures us, that he excelled all mankind in that art both vocal and instrumental; and that he played on eight different instruments (which he names), and especially on the harp, with such exquisite skill, that he seemed to be inspired. King James was not only an excellent performer, but also a capital composer, both of sacred and secular music; and his fame on that account was extensive, and of long duration. Above a century after his death, he was celebrated in Italy as the inventor of a new and pleasing kind of melody, which had been admired and imitated in that country. This appears from the following testimony of Alessandro Tafioni, a writer who was well informed, and of undoubted credit. \"We may reckon among us moderns, James king of Scotland, who not only composed many sacred pieces of vocal music, but also of himself invented a new kind of music, plaintive and melancholy, different from all others; in which he hath been imitated by Carlo Gesualdo prince of Venosa, who, in Alessandria, our age, hath improved music with new and admirable inventions.\" As the prince of Venosa imitated the Duke of Devonshire, King James, the other musicians of Italy imitated the John Hawkins, prince of Venosa. \"The most noble Carlo Gesualdo, kins, vol. iv., do p. 51, 61.\nJames do, the prince of musicians of our age, introduced such a style of modulation, that other musicians yielded the preference to him; and all singers and players on stringed instruments, laying aside that of others, everywhere embraced his. All the lovers, therefore, of Italian or Scotch music, are much indebted to the admirable genius of King James I., who, in the gloom and solitude of a prison, invented a new kind of music, plaintive indeed, and suited to his situation, but at the same time so sweet and soothing, that it hath given pleasure to millions in every succeeding age.\n\nAs James I. of Scotland was one of the most accomplished princes that ever filled a throne, he was also one of the most unfortunate. After spending almost 20 years in captivity, and encountering many difficulties on his return into his native kingdom, he was murdered by barbarous assassins in the prime of life. In the monuments of his genius, he hath been almost equally unfortunate. No vestiges are now remaining of his skill in architecture, gardening, and painting; though we are assured by one who was well acquainted with him, that he excelled in all these arts*. Many of the productions of his pen have also perished; for he tells us himself that he wrote much\u2020; and we know of only three of his poems that are now extant, viz. Chrift's Kirk on the Green\u2014Peebles at the Play\u2014and the King's Quair, which was lately discovered by Mr Warton, and hath been published by another gentleman\u2021. But slender as these remains are, they afford sufficient evidence, that the genius of this royal poet was not inferior to that of any of his contemporaries; and that it was equally fitted for the gayest or the gravest strains.\n\nJames II. king of Scotland, 1437, succeeded his father, being then not seven years of age; and was killed at the siege of Roxburgh in 1460, aged 29.\n\nJames III. king of Scotland, succeeded his father, in 1460, in the 7th year of his age. The most striking feature in the character of this prince, unjustly represented as tyrannical by several historians, was his fondness for the fine arts, and for those who excelled in them, on whom he bestowed more of his company, confidence, and favour, than became a king in his circumstances. This excited in his fierce and haughty nobles dislike and contempt of their sovereign, and indignation against the objects of his favour; which produced the most pernicious consequences, and ended in a rebellion that proved fatal to James, who was slain in 1488, aged 36.\n\nJames IV. king of Scotland, succeeded his father in 1488. He was a pious and valiant prince; subdued his rebellious subjects; and afterwards, taking part with Louis XII. against Henry VIII. of England, he was slain in the battle of Flodden-field in 1513, aged 41.\u2014This king is acknowledged to have had great accomplishments both of mind and body. His Latin epistles are classical, compared with the barbarous style of the foreign princes with whom he corresponded. Like his father, he had a taste for the fine arts, particularly that of sculpture. The attention he paid to the civilization of his people, and his distribution of justice, merit the highest praise. After all, the virtues of James appear to have been more shining than solid; and his character was that of a fine gentleman and a brave knight, rather than a wife or a great monarch. At the time of his death, he was only in his forty first year. Like all the princes of his family (to his great grandson James VI.) his person was handsome, vigorous, and active. From their coins, it does not appear that either he, or any of his predecessors of the Stuart race, wore their beards, as did all his successors, to the reign of Charles II.\n\nJames V. king of Scotland, in 1513, was but 18 months old when his father lost his life. When of age, he assisted Francis I. king of France against the emperor Charles V.; for which service Francis gave him his eldest daughter in marriage, in 1535. This princess died in two years; and James married Mary of Lorraine, daughter of Claud duke of Guise, and widow of Louis d'Orleans, by whom he had only one child, the unfortunate Mary queen of Scots, born only eight days before his death, which happened December 13, 1542, in the 35th year of his age. This was the first prince of his family who died a natural death since its elevation to the throne. He died, however, of a broken heart, occasioned by differences with his barons. He was formed by nature to be the ornament of a throne and a blessing to his people; but his excellent endowments were rendered in a great measure ineffectual by an improper education. Like most of his predecessors, he was born with a vigorous, graceful person, which, in the early part of his reign, was improved by all the manly exercises then in use. This prince was the author of a humorous composition in poetry, which goes by the name of the Gaberlunzie Man.\n\nJames VI. king of Scotland in 1567, and of England in 1603, was son of Mary queen of Scots; whom he succeeded in Scotland, as he did Elizabeth in England. Strongly attached to the Protestant religion, he dignified himself in its support; which gave rise to the horrid conspiracy of the Papists to destroy him and all the English nobility by the Gunpowder Plot, discovered November 5, 1605. The following year, a political test of loyalty was required, which secured the king's person, by clearing the kingdom of those disaffected Roman Catholic subjects who would not submit to it. The chief glory of this king's reign consisted in the establishment of new colonies, and the introduction of some manufactures. The nation enjoyed peace, and commerce flourished during his reign. Yet his administration was despaired both at home and abroad: for, being the head of the Protestant cause in Europe, he did not support it in that great crisis, the war of Bohemia; abandoning his son-in-law the elector Palatine; negotiating when he should have fought, deceived at the same time by the courts of Vienna and Madrid; continually sending illustrious ambassadors to foreign powers, but never making a single ally. He valued himself much upon his polemical writings; and so fond was he of theological disputations, that to keep them alive, he founded, for this express purpose, Chelsea-college; which was converted to a much better use by Charles II. His Basilicon Doron, Commentary on the Revelation, writings against Bellarmine, and his Demonologia, or doctrine of witchcraft, are sufficiently known. There is a collection of his writings and speeches in one folio volume. Several other pieces of his are extant; some of them in the Cabala, others in manuscript in the British Museum,\nJames, and others in Howard's collection. He died in 1625, in the 59th year of his age, and 23rd of his reign.\n\nJames II, king of England, Scotland, &c., 1685, grandson of James I. succeeded his brother Charles II. It is remarkable, that this prince wanted neither courage nor political abilities whilst he was duke of York; on the contrary, he was eminent for both: but when he ascended the throne, he was no longer the same man. A bigot from his infancy to the Romish religion and to its hierarchy, he sacrificed everything to establish them, in direct contradiction to the experience he had acquired, during the long reign of his brother, of the genius and character of the people he was to govern. Guided by the Jesuit Peters his confessor, and the infamous chancellor Jeffries, he violated every law enacted for the security of the Protestant religion; and then, unable to face the resentment of his injured subjects, he fled like a coward, instead of disarming their rage by a diffusion of his Popish ministers and priests. He rather chose to live and die a bigot, or, as he believed, a saint, than to support the dignity of his ancestors, or perish beneath the ruins of his throne. The consequence was the revolution in 1689. James II. died in France in 1710, aged 68. He wrote Memoirs of his own life and campaigns to the restoration; the original of which is preserved in the Scotch college at Paris. This piece is printed at the end of Ramsay's life of Marshal Turenne. 2. Memoirs of the English affairs, chiefly naval, from the year 1660 to 1673. 3.

Three letters; which were published by William Fuller, gent. in 1702, with other papers relating to the court of St Germain, and are said in the title page to be printed by command.\n\nJames, Thomas, a learned English critic and divine, born about the year 1571. He recommended himself to the office of keeper of the public library at Oxford, by the arduous undertaking of publishing a catalogue of the MSS in each college library at both universities. He was elected to this office in 1602, and held it 18 years, when he resigned it to prosecute his studies with more freedom. In the convocation held with the parliament at Oxford in 1625, of which he was a member, he moved to have proper commissioners appointed to collate the MSS of the fathers in all the libraries in England, with the Popish editions, in order to detect the forgeries in the latter; but this proposal not meeting with the desired encouragement, he engaged in the laborious task himself, which he continued until his death in 1629. He left behind him a great number of learned works.\n\nJames, Richard, nephew of the former, entered into orders in 1615; but, being a man of humour, of three sermons preached before the university, one concerning the observation of Lent was without a text, according to the most ancient manner; another against the text; and the third beside it. About the year 1619, he travelled through Wales, Scotland, Shetland, into Greenland and Russia, of which he wrote observations. He assisted Selden in composing his Marmora Arundeliana; and was very serviceable to Sir Robert Cotton, and his son Sir Thomas, in defining and settling their noble library. He died in 1683; and has an extraordinary character given him by Wood for learning and abilities.\n\nJames, Dr Robert, an English physician of great eminence, and particularly distinguished by the preparation of a most excellent fever-powder, was born at Kinverton in Staffordshire, A.D. 1723; his father a major in the army, his mother a sister of Sir Robert Clarke. He was of St John's college in Oxford, where he took the degree of A.B. and afterwards practised physic at Sheffield, Lichfield, and Birmingham successively. Then he removed to London, and became a licentiate in the college of physicians; but in what years is not known. At London he applied himself to writing as well as practising physic; and in 1743, published a Medical Dictionary, in 3 vols folio. Soon after he published an English translation, with a supplement by himself, of Ramazzini de morbis aris- cum; to which he also prefixed a piece of Frederic Hoffman upon Endemical Distempers, 8vo. In 1746, The Practice of Physic, 2 vols 8vo; in 1760, On Canine Madness, 8vo; in 1764, A Diffenatory, 8vo. June 25, 1755, when the king was at Cambridge, James was admitted by mandamus to the doctorship of physic. In 1788, were published, A Dissertation upon Fevers, and A Vindication of the Fever-powder, 8vo; with A Short Treatise on the Disorders of Children, and a very good print of Dr James. This was the 8th edition of the Dissertation, of which the first was printed in 1751; and the purpose of it was, to set forth the success of this powder, as well as to describe more particularly the manner of administering it. The Vindication was posthumous and unfinished; for he died March 23, 1776, while he was employed upon it.\u2014Dr James was married, and left several sons and daughters.\n\nJames's Powder, a medicine prepared by Robert James, which is known also by the name of James's fever powder.

He studied under Rubens, at Antwerp; and, after his return, applied with indefatigable industry to portraits in oil, though he sometimes practised\npractised in miniature, and also in history and landscapes. His largest portraits were somewhat less than life. His earliest works were chiefly on board, afterwards on fine linen cloth smoothly primed with a proper tone to help the harmony of his shadows. His excellence is said to consist in delicacy and softness, with a clear and beautiful colouring; his shades not charged, but helped by varnish, with little appearance of the pencil. When King Charles I visited Scotland in 1633, the magistrates of Edinburgh, knowing his majesty's taste, employed this art to make drawings of the Scottish monarchs; with which the king was so pleased, that, encouraging the painter, he sat to him, and rewarded him with a diamond ring from his own finger. It is observable, that Jamyn always drew himself with his hat on, either in imitation of his master Rubens, or on having been indulged in that liberty by the king when he sat to him. Many of Jamyn's works are in both the colleges of Aberdeen; and the Sibyls there he is said to have drawn from living beauties in that city. His best works are from the year 1630 to his death, which happened at Edinburgh in 1644.","sp":33,"ep":37},{"h":"JAMYN","t":"AMADIS, a celebrated French poet in the 16th century. He is esteemed the rival of Ronsard, who was his contemporary and friend. He was secretary and chamber-reader in ordinary to Charles IX. and died about 1585. He wrote, 1. Poetical works, two vols. 2. Philosophical discourses to Paficarhis and Rodanthe, with seven academical discourses. 3. A translation of the Iliad of Homer, begun by Hugh Sabel, and finished by Jamyn; with a translation into French verse of the three first books of the Odyssey.\n\nJANE of Flanders, a remarkable lady, who seems to have possessed in her own person all the excellent qualities of both sexes, was the wife of John de Mountfort, a competitor for the dukedom of Brittany upon the death of John III. This duke, dying without issue, left his dominions to his niece Jane, married to Charles de Blois nephew to the king of France; but John de Mountfort, brother to the late duke though by a second marriage, claimed the duchy, and was received as successor by the people of Nantes. The greatest part of the nobility swore fealty to Charles de Blois, thinking him best supported. This dispute occasioned a civil war; in the course of which John was taken prisoner, and sent to Paris. This misfortune would have entirely ruined his party, had not his interest been supported by the extraordinary abilities of his wife, Jane of Flanders. Bold, daring, and intrepid, she fought like a warrior in the field; shrewd, sensible, and sagacious, she spoke like a politician in the council; and endowed with the most amiable manners and winning address, she was able to move the minds of her subjects by the force of her eloquence, and mould them exactly according to her pleasure. She happened to be at Rennes when she received the news of her husband's captivity; but that disaster, instead of depressing her spirits, served only to raise her native courage and fortitude. She forthwith assembled the citizens; and, holding in her arms her infant son, recommended him to their care and protection in the most pathetic terms, as the male heir of their ancient dukes, who had always governed them with lenity and indulgence, and to whom they had ever professed the most zealous attachment. She declared herself willing to run all hazards with them in Jane's cause; pointed out the resources that still remained in the alliance of England; earnestly beseeching them to make one vigorous effort against an usurper, who being forced upon them by the intrigues of France, would, as a mark of his gratitude, sacrifice the liberties of Brittany to his protector. The people moved by the affecting appearance, and animated by the noble conduct of the princess, vowed to live and die with her in defending the rights of her family; and their example was followed by almost all the Bretons. The countess went from place to place, encouraging the garrisons of the several fortresses, and providing them with every thing necessary for their subsistence; after which she shut herself up with her son in Hennebon, where she resolved to wait for the succours which the king of England (Edward III.) had promised to send to her assistance. Charles de Blois, accompanied by the dukes of Burgundy and Bourbon, and many other noblemen, took the field with a numerous army, and having reduced Rennes, laid siege to Hennebon, which was defended by the countess in person. This heroine repulsed the assailants in all their attacks with the most undaunted courage; and observing one day that their whole army had left the camp to join in a general storm, she rushed forth at a postern-gate, with three hundred horse, set fire to their tents and baggage, killed their tutors and servants, and raised such a terror and consternation through all their quarters, that the enemy gave over their assault, and getting betwixt her and the walls, endeavoured to cut off her retreat to the city. Thus intercepted, she put the spurs to her horse, and without halting, galloped directly to Brest, which lay at the distance of two-and-twenty miles from the scene of action. There being supplied with a body of five hundred horse, she immediately returned, and fighting her way through one part of the French camp, was received into Hennebon, amidst the acclamations of the people. Soon after this the English succours appeared, and obliged the enemy to raise the siege.","sp":37,"ep":37},{"h":"JANEIRO","t":"or RIO-JANEIRO, a river and province of Brazil in South America, seated between the tropic of Capricorn and 22\u00b0 of S.

Vossius derives the word from genosvera, which in the Turkish language signifies new homines or militae. D'Herbelot tell us, that janizarii signifies a new band, or troop; and that the name was first given by Amurath.\nJanizaries, rath I. called the Conqueror, who choosing out one-fifth part of the Christian prisoners whom he had taken from the Greeks, and instructing them in the discipline of war and the doctrines of their religion, sent them to Hagi Bekta sche (a person whose pretended piety rendered him extremely revered among the Turks), to the end that he might confer his blessing on them, and at the same time give them some mark to distinguish them from the rest of the troops.\u2014Bekta sche, after blessing them in his manner, cut off one of the sleeves of the fur-gown which he had on, and put it on the head of the leader of this new militia; from which time, viz. the year of Christ 1361, they have still retained the name jenicheri, and the fur-cap.\n\nAs, in the Turkish army, the European troops are distinguished from those of Asia; the janizaries are also distinguished into janizaries of Constantinople, and of Damascus. Their pay is from two aspers to twelve per diem; for when they have a child, or do any signal piece of service, their pay is augmented.\u2014Their dress consists of a dolman, or long gown, with short sleeves, which is given them annually by the grand seignior on the first day of Ramazan. They wear no turbeau; but, in lieu of that, a kind of cap, which they call zarcola, and a long hood of the same stuff hanging on their shoulders. On solemn days they are adorned with feathers, which are stuck in a little cage on the fore part of the bonnet.\u2014Their arms, in Europe, in time of war, are a sabre, a carbine or musket, and a cartouch-box hanging on the left side. At Constantinople, in time of peace, they wear only a long staff in their hand. In Asia, where powder and firearms are more uncommon, they wear a bow and arrows, with a poignard, which they call lianiere.\u2014Though the janizaries are not prohibited marriage, yet they rarely marry, nor then but with the consent of their officers; as imagining a married man to make a worse soldier than a bachelor.\u2014It was Ofman, or Ottoman, or, as others will have it, Amurath, who first instituted the order of janizaries. They were at first called jaja, that is, footmen, to distinguish them from the other Turks, the troops whereof consisted mostly of cavalry. The number of janizaries is generally above 40,000; divided into 162 companies or chambers called odas, in which they live together at Constantinople as in a convent. They are of a superior rank to all other soldiers, and are also more arrogant and factious, and it is by them that the public tranquillity is mostly disturbed. The government may therefore be said to be in the hands of the janizaries. They have, however, some good qualities: they are employed to escort travellers, and especially ambassadors and persons of high rank, on the road; in which case, they behave with the utmost zeal and fidelity.\n\nJanizaries, at Rome, are officers or pensioners of the pope, called also participantes, on account of certain rites or duties which they enjoy in the annates, bulls, or expeditions, and the Roman chancery.\u2014Most authors are mistaken in the nature of their office: the truth is, they are officers of the third bench or college of the Roman chancery. The first bench consists of writers, the second of abbreviators, and the third of janizaries; who are a kind of correctors and revisors of the pope's bulls.\n\nJansen, Cornelius, bishop of Ypres, one of the most learned divines of the 17th century, and principal of the sect called from his name Jansenists. He was born in Holland of Catholic parents, and studied at Louvain. Being sent to foment some bufaloes of consequence relating to the university, into Spain, the Catholic king, viewing with a jealous eye the intriguing policy of France, engaged him to write a book to expose the French to the pope as no good Catholics, since they made no scruple of forming alliances with Protestant states. Jansen performed this task in his Mars Gallicus; and was rewarded with a mitre, being promoted to the see of Ypres in 1635. He had, among other writings, before this, maintained a controversy against the Protestants upon the points of grace and predestination; but his Augustinus was the principal labour of his life, on which he spent above 20 years. See the next article.\n\nJansenists, in Church History, a sect of the Roman Catholics in France, who followed the opinions of Jansenius, bishop of Ypres, and doctor of divinity of the universities of Louvain and Douay, in relation to grace and predestination.\n\nIn the year 1640, the two universities just mentioned, and particularly Father Molina and Father Leonard Cellius, thought fit to condemn the opinions of the Jesuits on grace and free-will. This having set the controversy on foot, Jansenius opposed to the doctrine of the Jesuits the sentiments of St Augustine; and wrote a treatise on grace, which he entitled Augustinus. This treatise was attacked by the Jesuits, who accused Jansenius of maintaining dangerous and heretical opinions; and afterwards, in 1642, obtained of Pope Urban VIII. a formal condemnation of the treatise written by Jansenius: when the partizans of Jansenius gave out that this bull was spurious, and composed by a person entirely devoted to the Jesuits. After the death of Urban VIII., the affair of Jansenius began to be more warmly controverted, and gave birth to an infinite number of polemical writings concerning grace. And what occasioned some mirth, was the titles which each party gave to their writings; one writer published The torch of St Augustine, another found Snuffers for St Augustine's torch, and Father Veron formed Agag for the Jansenists, &c. In the year 1650, 68 bishops of France subscribed a letter to Pope Innocent X. to obtain an inquiry into and condemnation of the five following propositions, extracted from Jansenius's Augustinus: 1. Some of God's commandments are impossible to be observed by the righteous, even though they endeavour with all their power to accomplish them. 2. In the state of corrupted nature, we are incapable of resisting inward grace. 3. Merit and demerit, in a state of corrupted nature, does not depend on a liberty which excludes necessity, but on a liberty which excludes constraint. 4. The Semipelagians admitted the necessity of an inward preventing grace for the performance of each particular act, even for the beginning of faith: but they were heretics in maintaining that this grace was of such a nature, that the will of man was able either to resist or obey it. It is Semipelagianism to say, that Jesus Christ died, or shed his blood, for all mankind in general.\n\nIn the year 1652, the pope appointed a congregation for examining into the dispute in relation to grace. In this congregation Jansenius was condemned; and the\nJanssens, the bull of condemnation, published in May 1653, filled all the pulpits in Paris with violent outcries and alarms against the heresy of the Jansenists. In the year 1656, Pope Alexander VII issued another bull, in which he condemned the five propositions of Janfe-\nnus. However, the Jansenists affirm, that these propo-\nsitions are not to be found in this book; but that some of his enemies having caused them to be printed on a sheet, inserted them in the book, and thereby de-\nceived the pope. At last Clement XI put an end to the di-\npute by his constitution of July 17, 1705, in which, after having recited the constitutions of his predeces-\nsors in relation to this affair, he declares, \"That in order to pay a proper obedience to the papal constitu-\ntions concerning the present question, it is necessary to receive them with a respectful silence.\" The clergy of Paris, the same year, approved and accepted this bull, and none dared to oppose it.\n\nThis is the famous bull Unigenitus, so called from its beginning with the words Unigenitus Dei Filius, &c., which has occasioned so much confusion in France.","sp":37,"ep":39},{"h":"JANSSEN","t":"Cornelius, called Johnson, an eminent paint-\ner of portraits, was born at Amsterdam (though in the Chronological tables, and in Sandrart, it is im-\nproperly asserted that he was born in London), and he resided in England for several years; where he was engaged in the service of King James I. and painted several excellent portraits of that monarch, as also of his children and of the principal nobility of his court. He had not the freedom of hand, nor the grace of Vandyck; but in other respects he was accounted his equal, and in the finishing his pictures superior. His paintings are easily distinguished by their smooth, clear, and delicate tints, and by that character of truth and nature with which they are strongly marked. He generally painted on board; and, for the most part, his draperies are black; probably because the opposition of that tint made his flesh colours appear more beauti-\nfully bright, especially in his female figures. It is said that he used a quantity of ultramarine in the black colours, as well as in his carnations; which may be one great cause of their preserving their original lustre even to this day. Frequently he painted in a small size in oil, and often copied his own works in that manner.

On this day all animosities were suspended, and friends gave and received new year's gifts, called Strene.

They extend from the 30th to the 41st degree of north latitude, and from the 130th to the 147th of east longitude.\n\nWere South and North Britain divided by an arm of the sea, Japan might be most aptly compared to England, Scotland, and Ireland, with their respective smaller islands, peninsulas, bays, channels, &c., all under the same monarch.\n\nThe Europeans call the empire Japan; but the inhabitants Nippon, from the greatest island belonging to it; and the Chinese Cipbon, probably on account of its eastern situation; these names signifying, in both languages, the Basis or Foundation of the Sun. It was first discovered by the Portuguese about the year of Christ 1542.\n\nMost of the islands which compose it are surrounded with such high craggy mountains, and such shallow and boisterous seas, that failing about them is extremely dangerous; and the creeks and bays are choked up with such rocks, shelves, and sands, that it looks as if Providence had designed it to be a kind of little world by itself. These seas have likewise many dangerous whirlpools, which are very difficult to pass at low water, and will suck in and swallow up the largest vessels, and all that comes within the reach of their vortex, dashing them against the rocks at the bottom; inasmuch that some of them are never seen again, and others thrown upon the surface at some miles distance. Some of these whirlpools also make a noise terrible to hear.\n\nThe Chinese pretend that the Japan islands were first peopled by themselves; but it is more probable that the original inhabitants were a mixture of different nations, driven thither by those tempestuous seas, at different times.\n\nAs these islands lie in the fifth and sixth climates, they would be much hotter in summer than England, were not the heats refreshed by the winds which continually blow from the sea around them, and to which they are much exposed by the height of their situation: this circumstance, however, not only renders their winters excessively cold, but the seasons more inclement. They have great falls of snow in winter, which are commonly followed by hard frosts. The rains in summer are very violent, especially in the months of June and July, which on that account are called satuki, or water-months. The country is also much subject to dreadful thunders and lightnings, as well as storms and hurricanes, which frequently do a great deal of damage.\n\nThe soil, though naturally barren and mountainous, by the industry of the inhabitants, not only supplies them with every necessary of life, but also furnishes other countries with them; producing, besides corn, the finest and whitest rice and other grains, with a great variety of fruits, and vast numbers of cattle of all sorts. Besides rice, and a sort of wheat and barley, with two sorts of beans, they have Indian wheat, millet, and several other kinds in great abundance. Their seas, lakes, and rivers, abound with fish; and their mountains, woods, and forests, are well stocked with horses, elephants, deer, oxen, buffaloes, sheep, hogs, and other useful animals. Some of their mountains also are enriched with mines of gold, silver, and copper, exquisitely fine, besides tin, lead, iron, and various other minerals and fossils; whilst others abound with several sorts of marble and precious stones. Of these mountains, some may be justly ranked among the natural rarities of this country; one, in particular, in the great island of Nippon, is of such prodigious height as to be easily seen forty leagues off at sea, though its distance from the shore is about eighteen. Some authors think it exceeds the famous Peak of Teneriffe; but it may rather be called a clutter or group of mountains, among which are no less than eight dreadful volcanoes, burning with incredible fury, and often laying waste the country round about them; but, to make some amends, they afford great variety of medicinal waters, of different degrees of heat; one of these, mentioned by Varenius, is said to be as hot as burning oil, and to torch and consume everything thrown into it.\n\nThe many brooks and rivers that have their sources among the mountains, form a great number of delightful cascades, as well as some dreadful cataracts. Among the great variety of trees in the forests here, the cedars exceed all of that kind through India, for straightness, height, and beauty. They abound in most of the islands, especially the largest.\n\nTheir seas, besides fish, furnish them with great quantities of red and white coral, and some pearls of great value, besides a variety of sea plants and shells; which last are not inferior to those that are brought from Ambon, the Molucca and other eastern islands.\n\nThe vast quantity of sulphur with which most of the Japan islands abounds, makes them subject to frequent and dreadful earthquakes. The inhabitants are so accustomed to them, that they are scarcely alarmed at any, unless they chance to be very terrible indeed, and lay whole towns in ruins, which very often proves the case. On these occasions, they have recourse to extraordinary sacrifices, and acts of worship, to their deities or demons, according to the different notions of each fact, and sometimes even proceed to offer human victims; but in this case they only take some of the vilest and most abandoned fellows they can meet with, because they are only sacrificed to the malevolent deities.\nThe religion throughout Japan, it is well known, is Pagan, split into several sects, who live together in the greatest harmony. Every sect has its own temple and priests. The spiritual emperor, the Dairi, is the chief of their religion. They acknowledge and honour a Supreme Being. The author of this relation (Dr Thunberg) saw two temples of the God of gods of a majestic height. The idol that represented this god was of gilded wood, and of so prodigious a size, that upon his hands six persons might fit in the Japanese fashion; his shoulders were five toises broad. In the other temple, the infinite power of this god was represented by little gods to the number of 33,333; all standing round the great idol that represented God. The priests, who are numerous in every temple, have nothing to do but to clean the pavement, light the lamps, and dress the idol with flowers. The temples are open to everybody, even to the Hollanders; and in case they are in want of a lodging in the suburbs, when they go to the court of Jeddo, they are entertained with hospitality in these temples.\n\nThe Roman Catholic religion had once made a considerable progress in this country, in consequence of a mission conducted by the Portuguese and Spanish Jesuits; among whom the famous Saint Francis Xavier was employed, but soon relinquished the service. There were also some Franciscan friars of Spain engaged at last. The Jesuits and friars were supplied from Goa, Macao, and the Manilhas. At first the undertaking proceeded with the most rapid success, but ended at last in the most tragic manner, all owing to the pride and haughtiness, the misconduct, rapacity, and tenacity of extravagant conspiracy of the fathers against the state. This folly and madness produced a persecution of 40 years duration, terminated by a most horrible and bloody massacre, not to be paralleled in history. After this the Portuguese, as likewise the Christian religion, were totally expelled the country, and the most effectual means taken for preventing their return. The natives are for this purpose prohibited from going out of the country; and all foreigners are excluded from an open and free trade; for as to the Dutch and Chinese, under which last name some other eastern nations go thither, they are shut up whilst they remain there, and a most strict watch is kept upon them, inasmuch that they are no better than prisoners; and the Dutch, it is said, to obtain a privilege even so far, declared themselves to be no Christians, but Dutchmen. This calumny, however, Dr Kempfer has endeavoured to wipe off, but not altogether to satisfaction.\n\nIt was about the year of Christ 1549, or six years after the first discovery, that the fathers of the society arrived there, being induced by the favourable representations of a young Japanese who had fled to Goa. Till the year 1625, or near 1630, the Christian religion spread through most of the provinces of the empire, many of the princes and lords openly embracing it; and \"there was very good reason to hope, that within a short compass of time the whole empire would have been converted to the faith of our Saviour, had not the ambitious views, and the impatient endeavours of the fathers to reap the temporal as well as the spiritual fruits of their care and labour, so provoked the supreme majesty of the empire as to raise against themselves and their converts a persecution which hath not its parallel in history, whereby the religion they preached, and all those that professed it, were in a few years time entirely exterminated.\"\u2014The fathers had made a progress so great, that the princes of Bungu, Arima, and Omura who had been baptized, \"sent, in the year 1582, some of their nearest relations, with letters and presents to pay homage to the then pope, Gregory XIII, and to assure his holiness of their filial submission to the church; an account of which most celebrated embassy hath been given in the works of that incomparable historian Thuanus, and by many other Roman catholic writers.\"\n\nBut notwithstanding this pleasing prospect, the emperor, anno 1586, issued proclamations for the suppression of the religion, and the persecution began. This, however, at first had not that effect which the government expected; for though, according to the letters of the Jesuits, 20,570 persons suffered death for the faith of Christ in the year 1590 only, yet in 1591 and 1592, when all the churches were actually shut up, they made 12,000 new converts. The business was finally concluded by the massacre at Simabara, about the year 1640. The reasons of the emperor's proclamations, making it death to embrace the religion, were as follow: 1. The new religion occasioned considerable alterations in the Japanese church, and was prejudicial in the highest degree to the heathen clergy. 2. It was feared the innovation in religion might be attended with fatal consequences even in regard to the sick; but what more immediately gave rise to them was, as the Japanese of credit confessed to Dr Kempfer, pride and covetousness; pride among the great ones, and covetousness in people of less note; the spiritual fathers aiming not only at the salvation of their souls, but having an eye also to their money and lands, and the merchants disposing of their goods in the most furious and unreasonable manner. To confine ourselves to the clergy here: they \"thought it beneath their dignity to walk on foot any longer; nothing would serve them but they must be carried about in stately chairs, mimicking the pomp of the pope and his cardinals at Rome. They not only put themselves on an equal footing with the greatest men of the empire, but, swelled with ecclesiastical pride, fancied that even a superior rank was nothing but their due. One day happened, that a Portuguese bishop met upon the road one of the counsellors of state on his way to court. The haughty prelate would not order his chair to be stopped, in order to alight and to pay his respects to the great man, as is usual in that country; but without taking any notice of him, nay, indeed without showing him so much as common marks of civility, he very contemptuously bid his men carry him by. The great man, exasperated to so signal an affront, thenceforward bore a mortal hatred to the Portuguese, and, in the height of his just resentment, made his complaint to the emperor himself, with such an odious picture of the insolence, pride, and vanity of this nation, as he expected could not but raise the emperor's utmost indignation.\" This happened in 1566. The next year the persecution began anew, and 26 persons, of the number whereof were two foreign Jesuits, and several other fathers of the Franciscan order, were executed on the cross. The emperor Jijoas had usurped the crown on his pupil Tidajori, who, as likewise the greater part of his court and party, had been either Christians themselves,\nelves, or at least very favourably inclined to that religion; so that reasons of state mightily co-operated to forward the persecution.\n\nSome Franciscan friars, whom the governor of the Manilhas had sent as his ambassadors to the emperor of Japan were guilty at this time of a most imprudent step: they, during the whole time of their abode in the country, preached openly in the streets of Macao where they resided; and of their own accord built a church, contrary to the imperial commands, and contrary to the advice and earnest solicitations of the Jesuits.\n\nSome time after, a discovery of a dangerous conspiracy, which the fathers, and the yet remaining adepts of their religion, entered into against the person of the emperor as a heathen prince, put a finishing stroke to the affair, and hastened the sentence which was pronounced soon after, that the Portuguese should for ever be banished the emperor's dominions; for till then the state seemed disposed to spare the merchants and secular persons, for the purpose of continuing trade and commerce with them, which was looked upon as an affair independent of religion. The affair of the conspiracy was as follows: the Dutch had had an eye to the trade of Japan before 1602, and in 1611 had liberty of a free commerce granted them by the imperial letters patent, and had actually a factory at Firando. The Dutch were then at war with Spain, which was then sovereign of the Portuguese dominions; so that it was natural for them to be trying to supplant them. The Portuguese, on their parts, made use of all malicious inventions to blacken their characters, calling them rebels and pirates, whence it was natural for the Dutch to endeavour to clear, and even to revenge, themselves. Now they \"took an homeward-bound Portuguese ship near the Cape of Good Hope, on board of which they found some traitorous letters to the king of Portugal, written by one Captain Moro, who was chief of the Portuguese in Japan, himself a Japanese by birth, and a great zealot for the Christian religion. The Dutch took special care to deliver the said letters to their protector the prince of Firando, who communicated them without loss of time to the governor of Nagasaki, a great friend to the Portuguese. Captain Moro having been taken up, boldly, and with great assurance, denied the fact, and so did all the Portuguese then at Nagasaki. However, neither the governor's favour, nor their constant denial, were able to clear them, and to keep off the cloud which was ready to break over their heads. Hand and seal convinced them; the letter was sent up to court, and Captain Moro sentenced to be burnt alive on a pale, which was executed accordingly. This letter laid open the whole plot which the Japanese Christians, in conjunction with the Portuguese, had laid against the emperor's life and throne; the want they stood in of ships and soldiers, which were promised them from Portugal; the names of the Japanese princes concerned in the conspiracy; and lastly, to crown all, the expectation of the papal blessing. This discovery made by the Dutch was afterwards confirmed by another letter written by the said Captain Moro to the Portuguese government at Macao, which was intercepted and brought to Japan by a Japanese ship.\"\n\nConsidering this, and the suspicions which the court had then already conceived against the Portuguese, it was no difficult matter thoroughly to ruin the little credit and favour they had as yet been able to preserve; and the rather, since the strict imperial orders notwithstanding, they did not leave off privately to bring over more ecclesiastics. Accordingly, in the year 1637, an imperial proclamation was sent to the governors of Nagasaki, with orders to see it put in execution. It was then that the empire of Japan was shut for ever both to foreigners and natives.\n\nNow, although the governors of Nagasaki, on receipt of these commands, took care they should be obeyed, yet the directors of the Portuguese trade maintained themselves in Japan two years longer, hoping to obtain leave to stay in the island of Delima, and there to continue their trade. But they found themselves at last wholly disappointed; for the emperor was resolved to get rid of them; and on assurance given him by the Dutch East India company that they would supply for the future what commodities had been imported by the Portuguese, he declared the Portuguese and the Castilians, and whoever belonged to them, enemies of the empire, forbidding the importation of even the goods of their country, Spanish wines only excepted, for the use of the court. And thus the Portuguese lost their profitable trade and commerce with Japan, and were totally expelled the country before the latter end of the year 1639 or 1640; and thus ended the fruitless popish mission in this empire, for the Portuguese have never been able to restore themselves; and the Dutch have it not in their power to do any one thing in favour of religion, were they so inclined; but, as it appears, they are very indifferent as to that, and are in but little credit with the Japanese.\n\nAccording to Dr Thunberg's researches, the Japanese have never been subdued by any foreign power, not even in the most remote periods; their chronicles contain such accounts of their valour, as one would rather incline to consider as fabulous inventions than actual occurrences, if later ages had not furnished equally striking proofs of it. When the Tartars, for the first time in 792, had overrun part of Japan, and when, after a considerable time had elapsed, their fleet was destroyed by a violent storm in the course of a single night, the Japanese general attacked, and so totally defeated his numerous and brave enemies, that not a single person survived to return and carry the tidings of such an unparalleled defeat. In like manner, when the Japanese were again, in 1281, invaded by the warlike Tartars, to the number of 240,000 fighting men, they gained a victory equally complete. The extirpation of the Portuguese, and with them of the Christian religion, towards the beginning of the 17th century, as already mentioned, was so complete, that scarce a vestige can now be discerned of its ever having existed there.\n\nWith respect to the government of these islands, it is and has been for a long time monarchical; though formerly it seems to have been split into a great number of petty kingdoms, which were at length all swallowed by one. The imperial dignity had been enjoyed for a considerable time before the year 1500, by a regular succession of princes, under the title of daimios, a name supposed to have been derived from Dairo the head of that family. Soon after that epoch, such a dreadful civil war broke out, and lasted so many years, that the empire was quite ruined. During these distractions and confusions, a common fol-\nJapan, died, by name Tayckoy, a person of obscure birth, but of an enterprising genius, found means to raise himself to the imperial dignity; having, in little more than three years time, by an uncommon share of good fortune, subdued all his competitors and opponents and reduced all their cities and castles. The dairo not being in a condition to obstruct or put a stop to his progress, was forced to submit to his terms; and might perhaps have been condemned to much harder, had not Tayckoy been apprehensive lest his soldiers, who still revered their ancient natural monarch, should have revolted in his favour. To prevent this, he granted him the supreme power in all religious matters, with great privileges, honours, and revenues annexed to it; whilst himself remained invested with the whole civil and military power, and was acknowledged and proclaimed king of Japan. This great revolution happened in 1517, and Tayckoy reigned several years with great wisdom and tranquillity; during which he made many wholesome laws and regulations, which still subsist, and are much admired to this day. At his death, he left the crown to his son Tayckofama, then a minor; but the treacherous prince under whose guardianship he was left deprived him of his life before he came of age. By this murder, the crown passed to the family of Jejafama, in which it still continues. Tayckoy and his successors have contented themselves with the title of cubo, which, under the dairos, was that of prime minister, whose office is now supprested; so that the cubo, in all secular concerns, is quite as absolute and despotic, and has as extensive a power over the lives and fortunes of all his subjects, from the petty kings down to the lowest persons, as ever the dairos had. The dairo resides constantly at Meaco, and the cubo at Jeddo.\n\nThe inhabitants of Japan are well-grown, agile, and active, and at the same time stout-limbed, though they do not equal in strength the northern inhabitants of Europe. The colour of the face is commonly yellow; which sometimes varies to brown, and sometimes to white. The inferior fort, who during their work in summer have often the upper parts of the body naked, are sun-burnt and brown; women of distinction, who never go uncovered into the open air, are perfectly white.\n\nThe national character, consists in intelligence and prudence, frankness, obedience, and politeness, good-nature and civility, curiosity, industry, and dexterity, economy and sobriety, hardiness, cleanliness, justice and uprightness, honesty and fidelity; in being also mistrustful, superstitious, haughty, resentful, brave and invincible.\n\nIn all its transactions, the nation shows great intelligence, and can by no means be numbered among the savage and uncivilized, but rather is to be placed among the polished. The present mode of government, admirable skill in agriculture, sparing mode of life, way of trading with foreigners, manufactures, &c., afford convincing proofs of their cunning, firmness, and intrepid courage. Here there are no appearances of that vanity so common among the Asiatics and Africans, of adorning themselves with shells, glass-beads, and polished metal plates: neither are they fond of the useless European ornaments of gold and silver lace, jewels, &c., but are careful to provide themselves, from the productions of their own country, with neat clothes, well-tasted food, and good weapons.\n\nTheir curiosity is excessive; nothing imported by the Europeans escapes it. They ask for information concerning every article, and their questions continue till they become wearisome. It is the physician, among the traders, that is alone regarded as learned, and particularly during the journey to court and the residence at Jeddo, the capital of the empire, that he is regarded as the oracle, which they trust can give responses in all things, whether in mathematics, geography, physics, chemistry, pharmacy, zoology, botany, medicine, &c.\n\nEconomy has its peculiar abode in Japan. It is a virtue admired as well in the emperor's palace as in the meanest cottage. It makes those of small pretensions content with their little, and it prevents the abundance of the rich from overflowing in excess and voluptuousness. Hence it happens, that what in other countries is called scarcity and famine, is unknown here; and that, in so very populous a state, scarce a person in necessity, or a beggar, should be found.\n\nThe names of families, and of single persons, are under very different regulations from ours. The family name is never changed, but is never used in ordinary conversation, and only when they sign some writing; to which they also for the most part affix their seal. There is also this peculiarity, that the surname is always placed first; just as in botanical books the generic name is always placed before the specific name. The praenomen is always used in addressing a person; and it is changed several times in the course of life. A child receives at birth from its parents a name, which is retained till it has itself a son arrived at maturity. A person again changes his name when he is invested with any office; as also when he is advanced to a higher trust; some, as emperors and princes, acquire a new name after death. The names of women are less variable; they are in general borrowed from the most beautiful flowers.\n\nAfter marriage, the wife is confined to her own apartment, from whence she hardly ever flirts, except once a-year to the funeral-rites of her family; nor is she permitted to see any man, except perhaps some very near relation, and that as seldom as can be. The wives, as well as in China and other parts of the east, bring no portion with them, but are rather bought by the husband of their parents and relations. The bridegroom most commonly sees his bride for the first time upon her being brought to his house from the place of the nuptial ceremony: for in the temple where it is performed she is covered over with a veil, which reaches from the head to the feet. A husband can put his wives to a more or less severe death, if they give him the least cause of jealousy, by being seen barely to converse with another man, or suffering one to come into their apartment.\n\nThe dress of the Japanese deserves, more than that of any other people, the name of national; since they are not only different from that of all other men, but are also of the same form in all ranks, from the monarch to his meanest subject, as well as in both sexes; and what exceeds all credibility, they have not been altered for at least 2444 years. They universally consist of night-gowns, made long and wide, of which several\nveral are worn at once by all ranks and all ages. The more distinguished and the rich have them of the finest silk; the poorer sort of cotton. Those of the women reach down to the ground, and sometimes have a train; in the men, they reach down to the heels; travellers, soldiers, and labourers, either tuck them up, or wear them only down to the knees. The habit of the men is generally of one colour; the women have theirs variegated and frequently with flowers of gold interwoven. In summer, they are either without lining, or have but a thin one; in winter they are stuffed to a great thickness with cotton or silk. The men seldom wear a great number; but the women thirty, fifty, or more, all so thin, that they scarce together amount to five pounds. The undermost serves for a shirt, and is therefore either white or blue, and for the most part thin and transparent. All these gowns are fastened round the waist with a belt, which in the men are about a hand's-breadth, in the women about a foot; of such a length that they go twice round the waist, and afterwards are tied in a knot with many ends and bows. The knot, particularly among the fair sex, is very conspicuous, and immediately informs the spectator whether they are married or not. The unmarried have it behind, on their back; the married before. In this belt the men fix their sabres, fans, pipe, tobacco, and medicine boxes. In the neck the gowns are always cut round, without a collar; they therefore leave the neck bare; nor is it covered with cravat, cloth, or any thing else. The sleeves are always ill made, and out of all proportion wide; at the opening before, they are half sewed up, so that they form a sack, in which the hands can be put in cold weather; they also serve for a pocket. Girls in particular have their sleeves so long that they reach down to the ground. Such is the simplicity of their habit, that they are soon dressed; and to undress, they need only open their girdle and draw in their arms.\n\nAs the gowns, from their length, keep the thighs and legs warm, there is no occasion for stockings; nor do they use them in all the empire. Among poorer persons on a journey, and among soldiers, who have not such long gowns, one sees bulkins of cotton. Shoes, or, more properly speaking, flippers, are of all that is worn by the Japanese, the simplest, the meanest, and the most miserable, though in general used among high and low, rich and poor. They are made of interwoven rice-straw; and sometimes, for persons of distinction, of reeds split very thin. They consist only of a sole, without upper leathers or quarters. Before, there palls over, transversely, a bow of linen, of a finger's breadth; from the point of the shoe to this bow goes a thin round band, which running within the great toe, serves to keep the shoe fixed to the foot. The shoe being without quarters, slides, during walking, like a flipper. Travellers have three bands of twisted straw, by which they fasten the shoe to the foot and leg, to prevent its falling off. The Japanese never enter their houses with shoes, but put them off in the entrance. This precaution is taken for the sake of their neat carpets. During the time the Dutch reside in Japan, as they have sometimes occasion to pay the natives visits in their houses, and as they have their own apartment at the factory covered with the same sort of carpets, they do not wear European shoes, but have in their stead red, green, or black slippers, which can easily be put off at entering in. They, however, wear stockings, with toes of cotton, fastened by buckles. These shoes are made in Japan, and may be washed whenever they become dirty.\n\nThe way of dressing the hair is not less peculiar to this people, and less universally prevalent among them, than the use of their long gowns. The men shave the head from the forehead to the neck; and the hair remaining on the temples, and in the nape, is well befineared with oil, turned upwards, and then tied with a white paper thread, which is wrapped round several times. The ends of the hair beyond the head, are cut crofs-ways, about a finger's length being left. This part, after being patted together with oil, is bent in such a manner that the point is brought to the crown of the head; in which situation it is fixed by patting the same thread round it once. Women, except such as happen to be separated from their husbands, have no part of their head.\n\nThe head is never covered with hat or bonnet in winter or in summer, except when they are on a journey; and then they use a conical hat, made of a sort of grass, and fixed with a ribband. Some travelling women, who are met with on the roads, have a bonnet like a shaving basin inverted on the head, which is made of cloth, in which gold is interwoven. On other occasions, their naked heads are preferred, both from rain and the sun, by umbrellas. Travellers, moreover, have a sort of riding-coat, made of thick paper oiled. They are worn by the upper servants of princes, and the suite of other travellers. Dr Thunberg and his fellow-travellers, during their journey to court, were obliged to provide such for their attendants when they passed through the place where they are made.\n\nA Japanese always has his arms painted on one or more of his garments, especially on the long and short gowns, on the sleeves, or between the shoulders; so that nobody can steal them; which otherwise might easily happen in a country where the clothes are so much alike in stuff, shape, and size.\n\nThe weapons of the Japanese consist of a bow and arrows, sabre, halbert, and mukket. The bows are very large, and the arrows long, as in China. When the bows are to be bent and discharged, the troop always rests on one knee, which hinders them making a speedy discharge. In the spring the troops assemble to practice shooting at a mark. Mukkets are not general; Dr Thunberg only saw them in the hands of persons of distinction, in a separated and elevated part of the audience room. The barrel is of the common length; but the stock is very short, and there is a match in the lock. The sabre is their principal and best weapon, which is universally worn, except by the peasants. They are commonly a yard long, a little crooked, and thick in the back. The blades are of an incomparable goodness, and the old ones are in very high esteem. They are far superior to the Spanish blades so celebrated in Europe. A tolerably thick nail is easily cut in two without any damage to the edge; and a man, according to the account of the Japanese, may be clefled asunder. A separate faith is never used, but the sword is stuck in the belt, on the left side, with the edge upwards, which to a European appears ridiculous. All persons in office wear two such sabres, one of their own, and\nand the other the sword of office, as it is called; the latter is always the longer. Both are worn in the belt on the same side, and so disposed as to cross each other. When they are fitting, they have their sword of office laid on one side or before them.\n\nThe sciences are very far from having arrived at the same height in Japan as in Europe. The history of the country is, notwithstanding, more authentic, perhaps, than that of any other country; and it is studied, without distinction, by all. Agriculture, which is considered as the art most necessary, and most conducive to the support and prosperity of the kingdom, is nowhere in the world brought to such perfection as here; where neither civil nor foreign war, nor emigration, diminishes population; and where a thought is never entertained, either of getting possession of other countries, or to import the useless and often hurtful productions of foreign lands; but where the utmost care is taken that no turf lies uncultivated, and no produce of the earth unemployed. Astronomy is pursued and respected; but the natives are unable, without the aid of Chinese, and sometimes of Dutch almanacks, to form a true calendar, or calculate an eclipse of the sun or moon within minutes and seconds. Medicine has neither arrived, nor is it likely to arrive, at any degree of perfection. Anatomy is totally unknown; the knowledge of diseases imperfect, intricate, and often fabulous. Botany, and the knowledge of medicines, constitute the whole of their skill. They use only simples; and these generally in diuretic and diaphoretic decoctions. They are unacquainted with compound medicines. Their physicians always indeed feel the pulse; but they are very tedious, not quitting it for a quarter of an hour; besides, they examine first one, and then the other arm, as if the blood was not driven by the same heart to both pulses. Besides those diseases which they have in common with other countries, or peculiar to themselves, the venereal disease is very frequent, which they only understand how to alleviate by decoctions, thought to purify the blood. Salivation, which their physicians have heard mentioned by the Dutch surgeons, appears to them extremely formidable, both to conduct and to undergo; but they have lately learned the art of employing the sublime with much success.\u2014Jurisprudence is not an extensive study in Japan. No country has thinner law-books, or fewer judges. Explanations of the law, and advocates, are things altogether unknown; but nowhere, perhaps, are the laws more certainly put in force, without respect to persons, without partiality or violence. They are very strict, and lawsuits very short. The Japanese know little more of physics or chemistry than what they have learned of late years of the Europeans.\n\nTheir computation of time takes its rise from Min-o, or 660 years before Christ. The year is divided according to the changes of the moon; so that some years consist of twelve, and others of thirteen, months; and the beginning of the year falls out in February or March. They have no weeks consisting of seven days, or of six working days, and a holiday; but the first and fifteenth days of the month serve for holidays. On these days no work is done. On new-year's day they go round to wish one another a new year, with their whole families, clad in white and blue chequered, their holiday-dresses; and they rest almost the whole of the first month. The day is divided only into twelve hours; and in this division they are directed the whole year by the rising and setting of the sun. They reckon six o'clock at the rising, and five likewise at the setting of the sun. Mid-day and mid-night are always at nine. Time is not measured by clocks or hour-glasses, but with burning matches, which are twisted together like ropes, and divided by knots. When the match is burnt to a knot, which indicates a certain portion of time elapsed, notice is given during the day, by striking the bells of the temples; and in the night, by the watchmen striking two boards against one another. A child is always reckoned a year old at the end of the year of his birth, whether this happen at the beginning or the close. A few days after the beginning of the year, is performed the horrid ceremony of trampling on images representing the cross and the Virgin Mary with her child. The images are of melted copper, and are said to be scarce a foot in height. This ceremony is intended to impress every individual with hatred of the Christian doctrine, and the Portuguese, who attempted to introduce it there; and also to discover whether there is any remnant of it left among the Japanese. It is performed in the places where the Christians chiefly resided. In Nagasaki it lasts four days; then the images are conveyed to the circumjacent places, and afterwards are laid aside against the next year. Every person, except the Japanese governor and his attendants, even the smallest child, must be present; but it is not true, as some have pretended, that the Dutch are also obliged to trample on the image. Overseers are appointed in every place, who assemble the people in companies in certain houses, call over the name of everyone in his turn, and take care that everything goes on properly. The children, not yet able to walk, have their feet placed upon it; older persons pass over it from one side of the room to the other.\n\nThe Japanese are much addicted to poetry, music, and painting: the first is said to be grand as to the style and imagery, loveliness, and cadence; but, like that of the Chinese, is not easily understood or relished by the Europeans. The same may be said of their music, both vocal and instrumental; the best of which, of either kind, would hardly be tolerable to a nice European ear.\n\nThey pretend, like the Chinese, to have been the inventors of printing from time immemorial, and their method is the same with theirs on wooden blocks; but they excel them in the neatness of cutting them, as well as in the goodness of their ink and paper. They likewise lay claim to the invention of gunpowder; and are vastly superior to the Chinese in the use of all sorts of fire-arms, especially of artillery, as well as the curiosities of their fire-works.\n\nTheir manner of writing is much the same as that of the Chinese, viz. in columns from top to bottom, and the columns beginning at the right and ending at the left hand. Their characters were also originally the same, but now differ considerably.\n\nTheir language hath some affinity with the Chinese, though it appears from its various dialects to have been a kind of compound of that and other languages, derived from the various nations that first peopled those islands. It is not only very regular, polite, elegant, and copious, but abounds with a great variety of synonyms,\nnonyma, adapted to the nature of the subject they are upon, whether sublime, familiar, or low; and to the quality, age, and sex, both of the speaker and person spoken.\n\nThe Japanese are commonly very ingenious in most handicraft trades; and excel even the Chinese in several manufactures, particularly in the beauty, goodness, and variety of their silks, cottons, and other stuffs, and in their Japan and porcelain wares. No eastern nation comes up to them in the tempering and fabricating of scimitars, swords, muskets, and other such weapons.\n\nThe Japanese architecture is much in the same taste and style as that of the Chinese, especially as to their temples, palaces, and other public buildings; but in private ones they affect more plainness and neatness than show. These last are of wood and cement, consisting of two stories: they dwell only in the lower; the upper chamber serving for wardrobes. The roofs are covered with rush-mats three or four inches thick. In every house there is a small court, ornamented with trees, shrubs, and flower-pots; as likewise with a place for bathing. Chimneys are unknown in this country, although fire is needed from the cold month of October till the end of March. They heat their rooms with charcoal contained in a copper stove, which they sit round. Their cities are generally spacious, having each a prince or governor residing in them. The capital of Jeddo is 21 French leagues in circumference. Its streets are straight and large. There are gates at little distances, with an extremely high ladder, which they ascend to discover fires. Villages differ from cities in having but one street; which often extends several leagues. Some of them are situated so near each other, that they are only separated by a river or a bridge.\n\nThe principal furniture of the Japanese consists in straw-mats, which serve them for seats and beds; a small table for every one who chooses to eat is the only movable. The Japanese sit always upon their haunches. Before dinner begins, they make a profound bow and drink to the health of the guests. The women eat by themselves. During the courses, they drink a glass of sakki, which is a kind of beer made of rice kept constantly warm; and they drink at each new morsel. Tea and sakki are the most favourite drink of this people; wine and spirits are never used, nor even accepted when offered by the Dutch. Sakki, or rice beer, is clear as wine, and of an agreeable taste; taken in quantity, it intoxicates for a few moments, and causes headache. Both men and women are fond of tobacco, which is in universal vogue and smoked continually. The gardens about their houses are adorned with a variety of flowers, trees, verdure, baths, terraces, and other embellishments. The furniture and decorations of the houses of persons of distinction consist in Japan-work of various colours, curious paintings, beds, couches, screens, cabinets, tables, a variety of porcelain jars, vases, tea-equipment, and other vessels and figures, together with swords, guns, scimitars, and other arms. Their retinues are more or less numerous and splendid according to their rank; but there are few of the lords who have less than 50 or 60 men richly clad and armed, some on foot, but most on horseback. As for their petty kings and princes, they are seldom seen without 300 or 200 at least, when they either wait on the emperor, which is Japan one-half of the year, or attend him abroad.\n\nWhen a prince or great man dies, there are commonly about 10, 20, or more youths of his household, and such as were his greatest favourites, who put themselves to a voluntary death, at the place where the body is buried or burned: as soon as the funeral pile, consisting of odoriferous woods, gums, spices, oils, and other ingredients, is set on fire, the relations and friends of the deceased throw their presents into it, such as clothes, arms, victuals, money, sweet herbs, flowers, and other things which they imagine will be of use to him in the other world. Those of the middle or lower rank commonly bury their dead, without any other burning than that of some odoriferous woods, gums, &c. The sepulchres in which the bones and ashes of persons of rank are deposited, are generally very magnificent, and situated at some distance from the towns.\n\nThe Dutch and Chinese are the only nations allowed to traffic in Japan. The Dutch at present send but two ships annually, which are fitted out at Batavia, and sail in June, and return at the end of the year. The chief merchandise is Japanese copper and raw camphor. The wares which the Dutch company import are, coarse sugar, ivory, a great quantity of tin and lead, a little cast iron, various kinds of fine chintzes, Dutch cloth of different colours and fineness, ferge wood for dyeing, tortoise-shell, and coqus Arabicus. The little merchandise brought by the officers on their own account, consists of saffron, theriac, sealing-wax, glass-beads, watches, &c., &c. About the time when the Dutch ships are expected, several outposts are stationed on the highest hills by the government; they are provided with telephones, and long before their arrival give the governor of Nagasaki notice. As soon as they anchor in the harbour, the upper and under officers of the Japanese immediately betake themselves on board, together with interpreters; to whom is delivered a chest, in which all the sailors' books, the muster-roll of the whole crew, six small barrels of powder, six barrels of balls, six muskets, six bayonets, six pistols, and six swords are deposited; this is supposed to be the whole remaining ammunition after the imperial garrison has been saluted. These things are conveyed on shore, and preserved in a separate warehouse, nor are they returned before the day the ship quits the harbour.\n\nDuties are quite unknown as well in the inland part as on the coast; nor are there any customs required either for exported or imported goods; an advantage enjoyed by few nations. But, to prevent the importation of any forbidden wares, the utmost vigilance is observed; then the men and things are examined with the eyes of Argus. When any European goes on shore, he is examined before he leaves the ship, and afterwards on his landing. This double search is exceedingly strict; so that not only the pockets and clothes are broached with the hands, but the pudenda of the meaner sort are pressed, and the hair of the flaves. All the Japanese who come on board are searched in like manner, except only their superior officers: so also are the wares either exported or imported, first on board, and then at the factory, except the great chests, which are opened at the factory, and so carefully examined that\nthey strike the very sides lest they should be hollow. The bed-clothes are often opened, and the feathers examined; rods of iron are run into the pots of butter and confections: a square hole is made in the cheese, and a long pointed iron is thrust into it in all directions. Their suspicion is carried so far, that they take out and break one or two of the eggs brought from Batavia.\n\nThe interpreters are all natives; they speak Dutch in different degrees of purity. The government permits no foreigner to learn their language, lest they should by means of this acquire the knowledge of the manufactures of the country; but 40 or 50 interpreters are provided to serve the Dutch in their trade, or on any other occasion.\n\nThe interpreters are very inquisitive after European books, and generally provide themselves with some from the Dutch merchants. They peruse them with care, and remember what they learn. They besides endeavour to get information from the Europeans; for which purpose they ask numberless questions, particularly respecting medicine, physics, and natural history. Most of them apply to medicine, and are the only physicians of their nation who practise in the European manner, and with European medicines, which they procure from the Dutch physicians. Hence they are able to acquire money, and to make themselves respected.\n\nAmong the vegetable productions peculiar to Japan, we may take notice of the aletris japonica, camellia japonica, and the volkameria japonica. The trumpet-flower, or bignonia catalpa of Linnaeus, is very common, bearing a resemblance to the epidendrum vanilla, the berries of which are said to constitute an article of commerce. Here also we find the mimosa arborea, and tallow tree, together with the plantain, cocoa-nut tree, the chamereps excelsa, and the cycas circinalis, adorning the woods near the sea shore.\n\nIt is a singular circumstance, that in the whole empire of Japan, neither sheep nor goats are to be met with, the goats being deemed pernicious to cultivation; and the vast quantities of silk and cotton with which it abounds, are considered as an excellent substitute for wool. There are few quadrupeds of any kind, either swine, horses, or cattle, as the Japanese live upon fish, poultry, and vegetables. Some wolves are seen in the northern provinces; and foxes are considered as demons incarnate.\n\nGold and silver abound in Japan, and copper richly impregnated with gold, which constitutes the chief wealth of many provinces. Iron is said to be scarcer than any other metal, which of consequence they are not fond of exporting. Amber, sulphur, pit-coal, red agate, asbestos, porcelain, clay, pumice and white marble, are also found in considerable quantities; but, according to Kempfer, neither antimony nor mercury. As Europeans have seldom visited the interior parts of the country, the natural curiosities of Japan are but very little known.\n\nJapan Earth.

In the older practice, such priming was always used; and is at present retained in the French manner of japanning coaches and snuff-boxes of the papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9; but in the Birmingham manufacture here, it has been always rejected. The advantage of using such priming or undercoat is, that it makes a saving in the quantity of varnish used; because the matter of which the priming is composed fills up the inequalities of the body to be varnished; and makes it easy, by means of rubbing and water-polishing, to gain an even surface for the varnish; and this was therefore such a convenience in the case of wood, as the giving a hardness and firmness to the ground was also in the case of leather, that it became an established method; and is therefore retained even in the instance of the papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 by the French, who applied the received method of japanning to that kind of work on its introduction. There is nevertheless this inconvenience always attending the use of an undercoat of size, that the japan coats of varnish and colour will be constantly liable to be cracked and peeled off by any violence, and will not endure near so long as the bodies japanned in the same manner, but without any such priming; as may be easily observed in comparing the wear of the Paris and Birmingham snuff-boxes; which latter, when good of their kind, never peel or crack, or suffer any damage, unless by great violence, and such a continued rubbing as wastes away the substance of the varnish; while the japan coats of the Parisians crack and fly off in flakes, whenever any knock or fall, particularly near the edges, expose them to be injured. But the Birmingham manufacturers, who originally practised the japanning only on metals, to which the reason above given for the use of priming did not extend, and who took up this art of themselves as an invention, of course omitted at first the use of any such undercoat; and not finding it more necessary in the instance of papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 than on metals, continue still to reject it. On which account, the boxes of their manufacture are, with regard to the wear, greatly better than the French.\n\nThe laying on the colours in gum-water, instead of varnish, is also another variation from the method of japanning formerly practised; but the much greater strength of the work, where they are laid on in varnish or oil, has occasioned this way to be exploded with the greatest reason in all regular manufactures: however, they who may practise japanning on cabinets, or other such pieces as are not exposed to much wear and violence,\nJapanning violence, for their amusement only, and consequently may not find it worth their while to encumber themselves with the preparations necessary for the other methods, may paint with water-colours on an undercoat laid on the wood or other substance of which the piece to be japanned is formed; and then finished with the proper coats of varnish, according to the methods below taught: and if the colours are tempered with the strongest ifinglafs size and honey, instead of gum-water, and laid on very flat and even, the work will not be much inferior in appearance to that done by the other method, and will last as long as the old Japan.\n\nOf Japan Grounds.\u2014The proper grounds are either such as are formed by the varnish and colour, where the whole is to remain of one simple colour; or by the varnish either coloured or without colour, on which some painting or other decoration is afterwards to be laid. It is necessary, however, before we proceed to speak of the particular grounds, to show the manner of laying on the priming or undercoat, where any such is used.\n\nThis priming is of the same nature with that called clear coating, or vulgarly clear-coating, practised erroneously by the house-painters; and consists only in laying on and drying in the moist even manner a composition of size and whiting, or sometimes lime instead of the latter. The common size has been generally used for this purpose; but where the work is of a nicer kind, it is better to employ the glovers or the parchment size; and if a third of ifinglafs be added, it will be still better, and, if not laid on too thick, much less liable to peel and crack. The work should be prepared by this priming, by being well smoothed with the fifth-flake or glass-blaver; and, being made thoroughly clean, should be brushed over once or twice with hot size, diluted with two-thirds of water, if it be of the common strength. The priming should then be laid on with a brush as even as possible; and should be formed of a size whose consistence is between the common kind and glue, mixed with as much whiting as will give it a sufficient body of colour to hide the surface of whatever it is laid upon, but not more.\n\nIf the surface be very clean on which the priming is used, two coats of it laid on in this manner will be sufficient; but if, on trial with a fine wet rag, it will not receive a proper water polish on account of any inequalities not sufficiently filled up and covered, two or more coats must be given it; and whether a greater or less number be used, the work should be smoothed, after the last coat but one is dry, by rubbing it with the Dutch rushes. When the last coat is dry, the water polish should be given, by passing over every part of it with a fine rag gently moistened, till the whole appear perfectly plain and even. The priming will then be completed, and the work ready to receive the painting or coloured varnish; the rest of the proceedings being the same in this case as where no priming is used.\n\nWhen wood or leather is to be japanned, and no priming is used, the best preparation is to lay two or three coats of coarse varnish composed in the following manner:\n\n\"Take of rectified spirit of wine one pint, and of coarse feed-lac and resin each two ounces. Dissolve the japanning-feed-lac and resin in the spirit; and then strain off the varnish.\"\n\nThis varnish, as well as all others formed of spirit of wine, must be laid on in a warm place; and, if it can be conveniently managed, the piece of work to be varnished should be made warm likewise; and for the same reason all dampness should be avoided; for either cold or moisture chills this kind of varnish, and prevents it taking proper hold of the substance, on which it is laid.\n\nWhen the work is so prepared, or by the priming with the composition of size and whiting above described, the proper japan ground must be laid on, which is much the best formed of shell-lac varnish, and the colour desired, if white be not in question, which demands a peculiar treatment, or great brightness be not required, when also other means must be pursued.\n\nThe colours used with the shell-lac varnish may be any pigments whatever which give the tint of the ground desired; and they may be mixed together to form browns or any compound colours.\n\nAs metals never require to be undercoated with whiting, they may be treated in the same manner as wood or leather, where the undercoat is omitted, except in the instances particularly spoken of below.\n\nWhite Japan Grounds.\u2014The forming a ground perfectly white, and of the first degree of hardness, remains hitherto a desideratum, or matter sought for, in the art of japanning, as there are no substances which form a very hard varnish but what have too much colour not to deprive the whiteness, when laid on of a due thickness over the work.\n\nThe nearest approach, however, to a perfect white varnish, already known, is made by the following composition:\n\n\"Take flake white, or white lead, washed over and ground up with a sixth of its weight of starch, and then dried; and temper it properly for spreading with the mastick varnish prepared as under the article VARNISH.\n\n\"Lay these on the body to be japanned, prepared either with or without the undercoat of whiting, in the manner as above ordered; and then varnish it over with five or six coats of the following varnish:\n\n\"Provide any quantity of the best feed-lac; and pick out of it all the clearest and whitest grains, reserving the more coloured and fouler parts for the coarse varnishes, such as that used for priming or preparing wood or leather. Take of this picked feed-lac two ounces, and of gum-animal three ounces; and dissolve them, being previously reduced to a grofs powder, in about a quart of spirit of wine; and strain off the clear varnish.\"\n\nThe feed-lac will yet give a slight tinge to this composition; but cannot be omitted where the varnish is wanted to be hard; though, when a softer will answer the end, the proportion may be diminished, and a little crude turpentine added to the gum animal to take off the brittleness.\n\nA very good varnish, free entirely from all brittleness, may be formed by dissolving as much gum animal as the oil will take, in old nut or poppy oil; which must be made to boil gently when the gum is put into it. The\nJapaning ground of white colour itself may be laid on in this varnish, and then a coat or two of it may be put over the ground; but it must be well diluted with oil of turpentine when it is used. This, though free from brittleness, is nevertheless liable to suffer by being indented or bruised by any slight strokes; and it will not well bear any polish, but may be brought to a very smooth surface without, if it be judiciously managed in the laying it on. It is likewise somewhat tedious in drying, and will require some time where several coats are laid on; as the lac ought not to contain much oil of turpentine.\n\nBlue Japan Grounds.\u2014Blue japan grounds may be formed of bright Prussian blue, or of verditer glazed over by Prussian blue, or of smalt. The colour may be best mixed with shell-lac varnish, and brought to a polishing state by five or six coats of varnish of seed-lac: but the varnish, nevertheless, will somewhat injure the colour by giving to a true blue a cast of green, and fouling in some degree a warm blue by the yellow it contains: where, therefore, a bright blue is required, and a less degree of hardness can be dispensed with, the method before directed in the case of white grounds must be pursued.\n\nRed Japan Grounds.\u2014For a scarlet japan ground, vermillion may be used: but the vermilion has a glaring effect, that renders it much less beautiful than the crimson produced by glazing it over with carmine or fine lake: or even with rose-pink, which has a very good effect used for this purpose. For a very bright crimson, nevertheless, instead of glazing with carmine, the Indian lake should be used, dissolved in the spirit of which the varnish is compounded, which it readily admits of when good: and, in this case, instead of glazing with the shell-lac varnish, the upper or polishing coats need only be used; as they will equally receive and convey the tinge of the Indian lake, which may be actually dissolved by spirit of wine: and this will be found a much cheaper method than the using carmine. If, nevertheless, the highest degree of brightness be required, the white varnishes must be used.\n\nYellow Japan Grounds.\u2014For bright yellow grounds, the king's yellow, or the turpeth mineral, should be employed, either alone or mixed with fine Dutch pink: and the effect may be still more heightened by dissolving powdered turmeric root in the spirit of wine of which the upper or polishing coat is made; which spirit of wine must be strained from off the dregs before the seed-lac be added to it to form the varnish.\n\nThe shell-lac varnish is not equally injurious here, and with greens, as in the case of other colours; because, being only tinged with a reddish yellow, it is little more than an addition to the force of the colours.\n\nYellow grounds may be likewise formed of the Dutch pink only; which, when good, will not be wanting in brightness, though extremely cheap.\n\nGreen Japan Grounds.\u2014Green grounds may be produced by mixing the king's yellow and bright Prussian blue, or rather the turpeth mineral and Prussian blue; and a cheap, but fouler kind, by verdigris with a little of the above-mentioned yellows, or Dutch pink. But, where a very bright green is wanted, the crystals of verdigris, called distilled verdigris, should be employed; and to heighten the effect, they should be laid on a ground of leaf-gold, which renders the colour extremely brilliant and pleasing.\n\nThey may any of them be used successfully with good seed-lac varnish, for the reason before given; but will be still brighter with white varnish.\n\nOrange-coloured Japan Grounds.\u2014Orange-coloured japan grounds may be formed by mixing vermillion or red-lead with king's yellow, or Dutch pink; or the orange-lac, which will make a brighter orange ground than can be produced by any mixture.\n\nPurple Japan Grounds.\u2014Purple japan grounds may be produced by the mixture of lake and Prussian blue; or a fouler kind, by vermillion and Prussian blue. They may be treated as the rest with respect to the varnish.\n\nBlack Japan Grounds to be produced with Heat.\u2014Black grounds may be formed by either ivory-black or lamp black: but the former is preferable where it is perfectly good.\n\nThese may be always laid on with shell-lac varnish; and have their upper or polishing coats of common seed-lac varnish, as the tinge or fulness of the varnish can be here no injury.\n\nCommon Black Japan Grounds on Iron or Copper, produced by means of Heat.\u2014For forming the common black japan grounds by means of heat, the piece of work to be japanned must be painted over with drying oil; and, when it is of a moderate dryness, must be put into a stove of such degree of heat as will change the oil to black, without burning it so as to destroy or weaken its tenacity. The stove should not be too hot when the work is put into it, nor the heat increased too fast; either of which errors would make it blister: but the slower the heat is augmented, and the longer it is continued, provided it be restrained within the due degree, the harder will be the coat of japan.\n\nThis kind of varnish requires no polish, having received, when properly managed, a sufficient one from the heat.\n\nThe fine Tortoise-shell Japan Ground produced by means of Heat.\u2014The best kind of tortoise-shell ground produced by heat is not less valuable for its great hardness, and enduring to be made hotter than boiling water without damage, than for its beautiful appearance. It is to be made by means of a varnish prepared in the following manner:\n\n\"Take of good linseed oil one gallon, and of umbre half a pound: boil them together till the oil become very brown and thick: strain it then through a coarse cloth, and set it again to boil; in which state it must be continued till it acquire a pitchy consistence; when it will be fit for use.\"\n\nHaving prepared thus the varnish, clean well the iron or copper plate or other piece which is to be japanned; and then lay vermillion tempered with shell-lac varnish, or with drying oil diluted with oil of turpentine, very thinly, on the places intended to imitate the more transparent parts of the tortoise-shell. When the vermillion is dry, brush over the whole with the black varnish, tempered to a due consistence with oil of turpentine; and when it is set and firm, put the work into a stove, where it may undergo a very strong heat, and must be continued a considerable time; if even three weeks or a month, it will be the better.\nJapanning. This was given amongst other receipts by Kunckel; but appears to have been neglected till it was revived with great success in the Birmingham manufactures, where it was not only the ground of snuff-boxes, dressing-boxes, and other such lesser pieces, but of those beautiful tea-waiters which have been so justly esteemed and admired in several parts of Europe where they have been sent. This ground may be decorated with painting and gilding, in the same manner as any other varnished surface, which had best be done after the ground has been duly hardened by the hot stove; but it is well to give a second annealing with a more gentle heat after it is finished.\n\nMethod of Painting Japan Work.\u2014Japan work ought properly to be painted with colours in varnish, though, in order for the greater dispatch, and, in some very nice works in small, for the freer use of the pencil, the colours are sometimes tempered in oil; which should previously have a fourth part of its weight of gum-arabic dissolved in it; or, in default of that, of the gums sandarac or mastic. When the oil is thus used, it should be well diluted with spirit of turpentine, that the colours may be laid more evenly and thin; by which means, fewer of the polishing or upper coats of varnish become necessary.\n\nIn some instances, water-colours are laid on grounds of gold, in the manner of other paintings; and are best, when so used, in their proper appearance, without any varnish over them; and they are also sometimes so managed as to have the effect of embossed work. The colours employed in this way, for painting, are both prepared by means of sizing glaze corrected with honey or sugar-candy. The body of which the embossed work is raised, need not, however, be tinged with the exterior colour; but may be best formed of very strong gum-water, thickened to a proper consistence by bole-armenian and whiting in equal parts; which being laid on the proper figure, and repaired when dry, may be then painted with the proper colours tempered in the sizing glaze, or in the general manner with shell-lac varnish.\n\nManner of Varnishing Japan Work.\u2014The last and finishing part of japanning lies in the laying on and polishing the outer coats of varnish; which are necessary, as well in the pieces that have only one simple ground of colour, as with those that are painted. This is in general best done with common feed-lac varnish, except in the instances and on those occasions where we have already shown other methods to be more expedient; and the same reasons which decide as to the fitness or propriety of the varnishes, with respect to the colours of the ground, hold equally with regard to those of the painting: for where brightness is the most material point, and a tinge of yellow will injure it, feed-lac must give way to the whiter gums; but where hardness, and a greater tenacity, are most essential, it must be adhered to; and where both are so necessary, that it is proper one should give way to the other in a certain degree reciprocally, a mixed varnish must be adopted.\n\nThis mixed varnish, as we have already observed, should be made of the picked feed-lac. The common feed-lac varnish, which is the most useful preparation of the kind hitherto invented, may be thus made:\n\nTake of feed-lac three ounces, and put it into water to free it from the sticks and filth that are frequently intermixed with it; and which must be done by stirring it about, and then pouring off the water, and adding fresh quantities in order to repeat the operation, till it be freed from all impurities, as it very effectually may be by this means. Dry it then, and powder it grossly, and put it, with a pint of rectified spirit of wine, into a bottle, of which it will not fill above two-thirds. Shake the mixture well together; and place the bottle in a gentle heat, till the feed appear to be dissolved; the shaking being in the meantime repeated as often as may be convenient; and then pour off all that can be obtained clear by this method, and strain the remainder through a coarse cloth. The varnish thus prepared must be kept for use in a bottle well stoppt.\"\n\nWhen the spirit of wine is very strong, it will dissolve a greater proportion of the feed-lac; but this will saturate the common, which is seldom of a strength sufficient for making varnishes in perfection. As the chilling, which is the most inconvenient accident attending those of this kind, is prevented, or produced more frequently, according to the strength of the spirit; we shall therefore take this opportunity of showing a method by which weaker rectified spirits may with great ease, at any time, be freed from the phlegm, and rendered of the first degree of strength.\n\n\"Take a pint of the common rectified spirit of wine, and put it into a bottle, of which it will not fill above three parts. Add to it half an ounce of pearl-ashes, salt of tartar, or any other alkaline salt, heated red-hot, and powdered, as well as it can be without much loss of its heat. Shake the mixture frequently for the space of half an hour; before which time, a great part of the phlegm will be separated from the spirit, and will appear, together with the undissolved part of the salts, in the bottom of the bottle. Let the spirit then be poured off, or freed from the phlegm and salts, by means of a trituration separating funnel; and let half an ounce of the pearl-ashes, heated and powdered as before, be added to it, and the same treatment repeated. This may be done a third time, if the quantity of phlegm separated by the addition of the pearl-ashes appear considerable. An ounce of alum reduced to powder and made hot, but not burnt, must then be put into the spirit, and suffered to remain some hours; the bottle being frequently shaken: after which, the spirit, being poured off from it, will be fit for use.\"\n\nThe addition of the alum is necessary, to neutralize the remains of the alkaline salt or pearl-ashes; which would otherwise greatly deprive the spirit with respect to varnishes and lacquer, where vegetable colours are concerned; and must consequently render another distillation necessary.\n\nThe manner of using the feed-lac or white varnishes is the same, except with regard to the substance used in polishing; which, where a pure white or great cleanness of other colours is in question, should be itself white; whereas the browner sorts of polishing dust, as being cheaper, and doing their business with greater dispatch, may be used in other cases. The pieces of work to be varnished should be placed near a fire, or in a room where there is a stove, and made perfectly dry;\nJAP\n\nJapaning dry; and then the varnish may be rubbed over them by the proper brushes made for that purpose, beginning in the middle, and passing the brush to one end; and then with another stroke from the middle, passing it to the other. But no part should be crossed or twice passed over, in forming one coat, where it can possibly be avoided. When one coat is dry, another must be laid over it; and this must be continued at least five or six times, or more, if on trial there be not sufficient thickness of varnish to bear the polish, without laying bare the painting or the ground colour underneath.\n\nWhen a sufficient number of coats is thus laid on, the work is fit to be polished: which must be done, in common cases, by rubbing it with a rag dipped in Tripoli or pumice-stone, commonly called rotten stone, finely powdered; but towards the end of the rubbing, a little oil of any kind should be used along with the powder; and when the work appears sufficiently bright and glossy, it should be well rubbed with the oil alone, to clean it from the powder, and give it a still brighter lustre.\n\nIn the case of white grounds, instead of the Tripoli or pumice-stone, fine putty or whiting must be used; both which should be washed over to prevent the danger of damaging the work from any sand or other gritty matter that may happen to be commixed with them.\n\nIt is a great improvement of all kinds of japan work, to harden the varnish by means of heat; which, in every degree that it can be applied short of what would burn or calcine the matter, tends to give it a more firm and strong texture. Where metals form the body, therefore, a very hot stove may be used, and the pieces of work may be continued in it a considerable time; especially if the heat be gradually increased; but where wood is in question, heat must be sparingly used, as it would otherwise warp or shrink the body, so as to injure the general figure.","sp":48,"ep":52},{"h":"JAPHETH","t":"the son of Noah.

Yet, amidst this irregularity of conduct, his proficiency in the art was surprising; and his paintings rose into such high repute, that they were exceedingly coveted in Rome, and bought up at great prices. With an intention to visit his native city he at last left Rome; but passing through Lyons, and meeting some agreeable companions, they prevailed on him to stay there for some time, and he found as much employment in that city as he could possibly undertake or execute. But the profits which arose from his paintings were not proportionate to his profession; and in order to extricate himself from the encumbrances in which his extravagant life had involved him, he was induced to marry his hostess, who was old and disagreeable, but very rich. Mortified and ashamed at that adventure, he returned as expeditiously as possible to Amsterdam, accompanied by his wife, and there for some time followed his profession with full as much success as he had met with in Italy or Lyons. He returned to Rome the second time; and after a year or two spent there in his usual extravagant manner, he settled at Venice. In that city his merit was well known before his arrival, which procured him a very honourable reception. He lived there highly cared for, and continually employed; but died at the age of 38.

Lat. extending in length 700 miles, and in breadth about 100. It is situated to the south of Borneo, and fourth-cut.\nJava, south-east from the peninsula of Malacca, having Sumatra lying before it, from which it is separated by a narrow passage, now so famous in the world by the name of the Straits of Sunda. The country is mountainous and woody in the middle; but a flat coast, full of bogs and marshes, renders the air unhealthy. It produces pepper, indigo, sugar, tobacco, rice, coffee, cocoa-nuts, plantains, cardamoms, and other tropical fruits. Gold also, but in no great quantities, hath been found in it. It is diversified by many mountains, woods, and rivers; in all which nature has very bountifully bestowed her treasures. Many of the mountains are so high as to be seen at the distance of a number of leagues. That which is called the Blue Mountain is by far the highest of them all, and seen the farthest off at sea. They have frequent and very terrible earthquakes in this island, which shake the city of Batavia and places adjacent, to such a degree, that the fall of the houses is expected every moment. The waters in the road are excessively agitated, inasmuch that their motion resembles that of a boiling pot; and in some places the earth opens, which affords a strange and terrible spectacle. The inhabitants are of opinion, that these earthquakes proceed from the mountain Parang, which is full of sulphur, saltpetre, and bitumen. The fruits and plants of this island are in their several kinds excellent, and almost out of number. There are abundance of forests scattered over it, in which are all kinds of wild beasts, such as buffaloes, tygers, rhinoceroses, and wild horses, with an infinite variety of serpents, some of them of an enormous size. Crocodiles are prodigiously large in Java, and are found chiefly about the mouths of rivers; for, being amphibious animals, they delight mostly in marshes and savannahs. This creature, like the tortoise, lays its eggs in the hot sands, without taking any further care of them; the sun hatches them at the proper season, when the young run instantly into the water. There is, in short, no kind of animal wanting here: fowls they have of all sorts, and exquisitely good, especially peacocks, partridges, pheasants, wood-pigeons; and, for curiosity, they have the Indian bat, which differs little in form from ours; but its wings, when extended, measure a full yard, and the body of it is of the size of a rat. They have fish in great plenty, and very good; so that for the value of three-pence there may be enough bought to dine six or seven men. They have likewise a multitude of tortoises, the flesh of which is very little inferior to veal, and there are many who think it better.\n\nIt is said, that there are in the island upwards of 40 great towns, which, from the number of their inhabitants, would, in any other part of the world, merit the name of cities; and more than 4500 villages, besides hamlets, and straggling houses, lying very near each other, upon the sea coast, and in the neighbourhood of great towns: hence, upon a fair and moderate computation, there are within the bounds of the whole island, taking persons of both sexes, and of all ranks and ages, more than thirty millions of souls; so that it is thrice as populous as France, which, though twice as big, is not computed to have more than twenty millions of inhabitants.\n\nThere are a great many princes in the island, of which the most considerable are, the emperor of Macassar, who resides at Katalura, and the kings of Bantam and Japara. Upon the first of these many of the petty princes are dependent; but the Dutch are absolute masters of the greatest part of the island, particularly of the north coast, though there are some of the princes beyond the mountains, on the south coast, who still maintain their independency. The natives of the country, who are established in the neighbourhood of Batavia, and for a tract of about 40 leagues along the mountains of the country of Bantam, are immediately subject to the governor-general. The company send droffards, or commissaries, among them, who administer justice and take care of the public revenues.\n\nThe city of Batavia is the capital not only of this island but of all the Dutch dominions in India. It is an exceeding fine city, situated in the latitude of 6\u00b0 south, at the mouth of the river Jucatra, and in the bosom of a large commodious bay, which may be considered not only as one of the safest harbours in India, but in the world. The city is surrounded by a rampart 21 feet thick, covered on the outside with stone and fortified with 22 bastions. This rampart is environed by a ditch 45 yards over, and full of water, especially when the tides are high, in the spring. The avenues to the town are defended by several forts, each of which is well furnished with excellent brass cannon: no person is suffered to go beyond these forts without a passport. The river Jucatra passes through the midst of the town, and forms 15 canals of running water, all faced with free-stone, and adorned with trees that are ever green; over these canals are 56 bridges, besides those which lie without the town. The streets are all perfectly straight, and each, generally speaking, 30 feet broad. The houses are built of stone, after the manner of those in Holland. The city is about a league and a half in circumference, and has five gates; but there are ten times the number of houses without that there are within it. There is a very fine town-house, four Calvinist churches, besides other places of worship for all sorts of religions, a spin-huys or house of correction, an orphan house, a magazine of sea stores, several for spices, with wharfs and cord manufactories, and many other public buildings. The garrison consists commonly of between 2000 and 3000 men. Besides the forts mentioned above, there is the citadel of Batavia, a very fine regular fortification, situated at the mouth of the river, and flanked with four battions; two of which command the sea, and the other two the town. It is in the citadel that the governor-general of the Indies has his palace; over against which is that of the director-general, who is the next person to the governor. The counsellors, and other principal officers of the company, have also their apartments there; as have likewise the physician, the surgeon, and the apothecary. There are in it, besides, arsenals and magazines furnished with ammunition for many years. The city of Batavia is not only inhabited by Dutch, French, Portuguese, and other Europeans, established here on account of trade; but also by a vast number of Indians of different nations, Javanese, Chinese, Malaysians, Negroes, Ambonese, Armenians, natives of the isle of Bali, Mardykers or Topasses, Macaffers, Timors, Bougis, &c. Of the Chinese, there are, it is said,\nsaid, about 100,000 in the island; of which near 30,000 resided in the city till the year 1740, when the Dutch, pretending that they were in a plot against them, sent a body of troops into their quarter, and demanded their arms, which the Chinese readily delivered up; and the next day the governor sent another body, with orders to murder and massacre every one of the Chinese, men, women, and children. Some relate there were 20,000, others 30,000, that were put to death, without any manner of trial; and yet the barbarous governor, who was the instrument of this cruel proceeding, had the assurance to embark for Europe, imagining he had amassed wealth enough to secure him against any prosecution in Holland: but the Dutch, finding themselves detested and abhorred by all mankind for this piece of tyranny, endeavoured to throw the odium of it upon the governor, though he had the hands of all the council of Batavia, except one, to the order for the massacre. The states, therefore, dispatched a packet to the Cape of Good Hope, containing orders to apprehend the governor, and send him back to Batavia to be tried. He was accordingly apprehended at the Cape; but was never heard of afterwards. It supposed he was thrown over-board in his passage to Batavia, that there might be no farther inquiries into the matter; and it is said, all the wealth this merciful gentleman had amassed, and sent over before him in four ships, was cast away in the passage.\n\nBesides the garrison here, the Dutch had formerly about 15,000 men in the island, either Dutch, or formed out of the several nations they had enslaved; and they had a fleet of between 20 and 30 men of war, with which they gave law to every power on the coast of Asia and Africa, and to all the European powers that visit the Indian ocean, unless we should except the British: it was, however, but a little before the revolution that they expelled us from our settlement at Bantam.\n\nJavelin, in antiquity, a sort of spear five feet and an half long; the shaft of which was of wood, with a steel point.\u2014Every soldier in the Roman armies had seven of these, which were very light and slender.\n\nJawer, a city of Silesia, capital of a province of the same name, with a citadel, and a large square, surrounded with piazzas.

Iberia, according to Josephus, was first peopled by Tubal, the brother of Gomer and Magog. His opinion is confirmed by the Septuagint; for Melhech and Tubal are by these interpreters rendered Mochei and Iberians. We know little of the history of the country till the reign of Mithridates, when their king, named Artaces, siding with that prince against Lucullus, and afterwards against Pompey, was defeated by the latter with great slaughter; but afterwards obtained a peace, upon delivering up his sons as hostages. Little notice is taken of the succeeding kings by the ancient historians.

It is said, that he was assassinated by robbers; and that, when dying, he called upon some cranes he saw flying to bear witness. Some time after, one of the murderers seeing some cranes, said to his companions, \"There are the witnesses of Ibycus's death;\" which being reported to the magistrates, the assassins were put to the torture, and having confessed the fact, were hanged. Thence arose the proverb Ibyci Grues.\n\nIce, in Physiology, a solid, transparent, and brittle body.\nICE\n\nThe younger Lemery observes, that ice is only a re-establishment of the parts of water in their natural state; that the mere absence of fire is sufficient to account for this re-establishment; and that the fluidity of water is a real fusion, like that of metals exposed to the fire; differing only in this, that a greater quantity of fire is necessary to the one than the other. Galileo was the first that observed ice to be lighter than the water which composed it; and hence it happens, that ice floats upon water, its specific gravity being to that of water as eight to nine. This rarefaction of ice seems to be owing to the air-bubbles produced in water by freezing; and which, being considerably large in proportion to the water frozen, render the body so much specifically lighter: these air-bubbles, during their production, acquire a great expansive power, so as to burst the containing vessels, though ever so strong.\n\nM. Mairan, in a dissertation on ice, attributes the increase of its bulk chiefly to a different arrangement of the parts of the water from which it is formed; the icy skin on the water being composed of filaments, which, according to him, are found to be constantly and regularly joined at an angle of 60\u00b0; and which, by this angular disposition, occupy a greater volume than if they were parallel. He found the augmentation of the volume of water by freezing, in different trials, a 14th, an 18th, a 19th; and when the water was previously purged of air, only a 22d part: that ice, even after its formation, continues to expand by cold; for, after water had been frozen to some thickness, the fluid part being let out by a hole in the bottom of the vessel, a continuance of the cold made the ice convex; and a piece of ice, which was at first only a 14th part specifically lighter than water, on being exposed some days to the frost, became a 12th part lighter. To this cause he attributes the bursting of ice on ponds.\n\nWax, resins, and animal fats, made fluid by fire, instead of expanding like watery liquors, shrink in their return to solidity: for solid pieces of the same bodies sink to the bottom of the respective fluids; a proof that these bodies are more dense in their solid than in their fluid state. The oils which congeal by cold, as oil olive, and the essential oil of aniseeds, appear also to shrink in their congelation. Hence, the different dispositions of different kinds of trees to be burnt by, or to resist, strong frosts, are by some attributed to the juices with which the tree abounds; being in the one case watery, and in the other resinous or oily.\n\nThough it has been generally supposed that the natural crystals of ice are stars of five rays, forming angles of 60\u00b0 with each other, yet this crystallization of water, as it may properly be called, seems to be as much affected by circumstances as that of salts. Hence we find a considerable difference in the accounts of those who have undertaken to describe these crystals. M. Mairan informs us, that they are stars with five radii; and his opinion is confirmed by observing the figure of frost on glass. M. Rome de L'Isle determines the form of the solid crystal to be an equilateral octahedron. M. Hassenfratz found it to be a prismatic hexaedron; but M. d'Antic found a method of reconciling these seemingly opposite opinions. In a violent hail-storm, where the hailstones were very large, he found they had sharp wedge-like angles of more than half an inch; and in these he supposed it impossible to see two pyramidal tetraedra joined laterally, and not to conclude that each grain was composed of octaedrons converging to a centre. Some had a cavity in the middle; and he saw the opposite extremities of two opposite pyramids, which constitute the octahedron; he likewise saw the octahedron entire united in the middle: all of them were therefore similar to the crystals formed on a thread immersed in a saline solution. On these principles M. d'Antic constructed an artificial octahedron resembling one of the largest hailstones; and found that the angle at the summit of the pyramid was 45\u00b0, but that of the junction of the two pyramids 145\u00b0. It is not, however, easy to procure regular crystals in hailstones where the operation is conducted with such rapidity: in snow and hoar-frost, where the crystallization goes on more slowly, our author is of opinion that he sees the rudiments of octaedra.\n\nIce forms generally on the surface of the water: but this too, like the crystallization, may be varied by an alteration in the circumstances. In Germany, particularly the northern parts of that country, it has been observed that there are three kinds of ice. 1. That which forms on the surface. 2. Another kind formed in the middle of the water, resembling nuclei or small hail. 3. The ground ice which is produced at the bottom, especially where there is any fibrous substance to which it may adhere. This is full of cells like a wasp's nest, but less regular; and performs many strange effects in bringing up very heavy bodies from the bottom, by means of its inferiority in specific gravity to the water in which it is formed. The ice which forms in the middle of the water rises to the top, and there unites into large masses; but the formation both of this and the ground ice takes place only in violent and sudden colds, where the water is shallow, and the surface disturbed in such a manner that the congelation cannot take place. The ground ice is very destructive to dykes and other aquatic works. In the more temperate European climates these kinds of ice are not met with.\n\nIn many countries the warmth of the climate renders ice not only a desirable, but even a necessary article; so that it becomes an object of some consequence to fall upon a ready and cheap method of procuring it. We shall here take notice of some attempts made by Mr Cavallo to discover a method of producing a sufficient degree of cold for this purpose by the evaporation of volatile liquors. He found, however, in the course of these experiments, that ether was incomparably superior to any other fluid in the degree of cold it produced. The price of the liquor naturally induced him to fall upon a method of using it with as little waste as possible. The thermometer he made use of had the ball quite detached from the ivory piece on which the scale was engraved. The various fluids were then thrown upon the ball through the capillary aperture of a small glass vessel shaped like a funnel; and care was taken to throw them upon it so slowly, that a drop might now and then fall from the under part, excepting when these fluids were used, which\nwhich evaporate very slowly; in which case it was sufficient barely to keep the ball moist, without any drop falling from it. During the experiment, the thermometer was kept very gently turning round its axis, that the fluid made use of might fall upon every part of its ball. He found this method preferable to that of dipping the ball of the thermometer into the fluid and taking it out again immediately, or even of anointing it constantly with a feather. The evaporation, and consequently the cold, produced by it, may be increased by blowing on the thermometer with a pair of bellows; though this was not used in the experiments now to be related, on account of the difficulty of its being performed by one person, and likewise because it occasions much uncertainty in the results.\n\nThe room in which the experiments were made was heated to 64\u00b0 of Fahrenheit; and with water it was reduced to 56\u00b0, viz. 8\u00b0 below that of the room or of the water employed. The effect took place in about two minutes; but though the operation was continued for a longer time, it did not sink lower. With spirit of wine it sunk to 48\u00b0. The cold was greater with highly rectified spirit than with the weaker fort; but the difference is less than would be expected by one who had never seen the experiment made. The pure spirit produces its effect much more quickly. On using various other fluids which were either compound of water and spirituous liquors, or pure essences, he found that the cold produced by their evaporation was generally some intermediate degree between that produced by water and the spirit of wine. Oil of turpentine sunk the mercury three degrees; but olive oil and others, which evaporate very slowly, or not at all, did not sensibly affect the thermometer.\n\nTo observe how much the evaporation of spirit of wine, and consequently the cold produced by it, would be increased by electricity, he put the tube containing it into an insulating handle, and connected it with the conductor of an electrical machine, which was kept in action during the time of making the experiment; by which means one degree of cold seemed to be gained, as the mercury now sunk to 47\u00b0 instead of 48\u00b0, at which it had stood formerly. On trying the three mineral acids, he found that they heated the thermometer instead of cooling it; which effect he attributes to the heat they themselves acquired by uniting with the moisture of the atmosphere. The vitriolic acid, which was very strong and transparent, raised the mercury to 102\u00b0, the smoking nitrous acid to 72\u00b0, and the marine to 66\u00b0.\n\nThe apparatus for using the least possible quantity of ether for freezing water consists in a glass tube (fig. 1.) terminating in a capillary aperture, which is to be fixed upon the bottle containing the ether. Round the lower part of the neck at A some thread is wound, in order to let it fit the neck of the bottle. When the experiment is to be made, the stopper of the bottle containing the ether is to be removed, and the tube just mentioned put in its room. The thread round the tube ought also to be previously moistened with water or spit before it is put into the neck of the bottle, in order the more effectually to prevent the escape of the ether betwixt the neck of the phial and tube. Hold then the bottle by its bottom FG (fig. 2.)\n\nVol. XI. Part I.\n\nand keeping it inclined as in the figure, the small stream of ether issuing out of the aperture D of the tube DE, is directed upon the ball of the thermometer, or upon a tube containing water or other liquor that is required to be congealed. As ether is very volatile, and has the remarkable property of increasing the bulk of air, there is no aperture requisite to allow the air to enter the bottle while the liquid flows out. The heat of the hand is more than sufficient to force out the ether in a continued stream at the aperture D.\n\nIn this manner, throwing the stream of ether upon the ball of a thermometer in such a quantity that a drop might now and then, every ten seconds for instance, fall from the bulb of the thermometer, Mr Cavallo brought the mercury down to 3\u00b0, or 29\u00b0 below the freezing point, when the atmosphere was somewhat hotter than temperate. When the ether is very good, i.e. capable of dissolving elastic gum, and has a small bulb, not above 20 drops of it are required to produce this effect, and about two minutes of time; but the common fort must be used in greater quantity, and for a longer time; though at last the thermometer is brought down by this very nearly as low as by the best fort.\n\nTo freeze water by the evaporation of ether, Mr Cavallo takes a thin glass tube about four inches long, and one-fifth of an inch diameter, hermetically sealed at one end, with a little water in it, so as to take up about half an inch of the cavity, as is shewn at CB in fig. 3. Into this tube a slender wire H is also introduced, the lower extremity of which is twisted into a spiral, and serves to draw up the bit of ice when formed. He then holds the glass tube by its upper part A with the fingers of the left hand, and keeps it continually and gently turning round its axis, first one way and then the other: whilst with the right hand he holds the phial containing the ether in such a manner as to direct the stream on the outside of the tube, and a little above the surface of the water contained in it. The capillary aperture D should be kept almost in contact with the surface of the tube containing the water; and by continuing the operation for two or three minutes, the water will be frozen as it were in an instant; and the opacity will ascend to C in less than half a second of time, which makes a beautiful appearance. This congelation, however, is only superficial: and in order to congeal the whole quantity of water, the operation must be continued a minute or two longer; after which the wire H will be found kept very tight by the ice. The hand must then be applied to the outside of the tube, in order to soften the surface of the ice; which would otherwise adhere very firmly to the glass; but when this is done, the wire H easily brings it out.\n\nSometimes our author was accustomed to put into the tube a small thermometer instead of the wire H; and thus he had an opportunity of observing a very curious phenomenon unnoticed by others, viz. that in the winter time water requires a smaller degree of cold to congeal it than in the summer. In the winter, for instance, the water in the tube AB will freeze when the thermometer stands about 30\u00b0; but in the summer, or even when the thermometer stands at 60\u00b0, the quicksilver must be brought down to 10, 15, or even more degrees.\ngrces below the freezing point before any congelation can take place. In the summer time therefore a greater quantity of ether, and more time, will be required to congeal any given quantity of water than in winter. When the temperature of the atmosphere has been about 40\u00b0, our author has been able to congeal a quantity of water with an equal quantity of good ether; but in summer, two or three times the quantity are required to perform the effect. \"There seems (says he) to be something in the air, which, besides heat, interferes with the freezing of water, and perhaps of all fluids; though I cannot say from my own experience whether the above-mentioned difference between the freezing in winter and summer takes place with other fluids, as milk, oils, wines,\" &c.\n\nThe proportion of ether requisite to congeal water seems to vary with the quantity of the latter; that is, a large quantity of water seems to require a proportionably less quantity of ether to freeze it than a smaller one. \"In the beginning of the spring (says Mr Cavalli), I froze a quarter of an ounce of water with about half an ounce of ether: the apparatus being larger, though similar to that described above. Now as the price of ether, sufficiently good for the purpose, is generally about 18d. or 2s. per ounce, it is plain, that with an expense under two shillings, a quarter of an ounce of ice, or ice-cream, may be made in every climate, and at any time, which may afford great satisfaction to those persons, who, living in those places where no natural ice is to be had, never saw or tasted any such delicious refreshment. When a small piece of ice, for instance, of about ten grains weight, is required, the necessary apparatus is very small, and the expense not worth mentioning. I have a small box four inches and a half long, two inches broad, and one and a half deep, containing all the apparatus necessary for this purpose; viz. a bottle capable of containing about one ounce of ether; two pointed tubes, in case one should break; a tube in which the water is to be frozen, and a wire. With the quantity of ether contained in this small and very portable apparatus, the experiment may be repeated about ten times. A person who wishes to perform such experiments in hot climates, and in places where ice is not easily procured, requires only a larger bottle of ether besides the whole apparatus described above.\" Electricity increases the cold produced by means of evaporating ether but very little, though the effect is perceptible. Having thrown the electrified and also the unelectrified stream of ether upon the bulb of a thermometer, the mercury was brought down two degrees lower in the former than in the latter case.\n\nOur author observes, for the sake of those who may be inclined to repeat this experiment, that a cork confined this volatile fluid much better than a glass stopple, which is almost impossible to grind with such exactness as to prevent entirely the evaporation of the ether. When a stopple, made very nicely out of an uniform and close piece of cork, which goes rather tight, is put upon a bottle of ether, the smell of that fluid cannot be perceived through it; but he never saw a glass stopple which could produce that effect. In this manner, ether, spirit of wine, or any other volatile fluid, may be preserved, which does not corrode cork by its fumes. When the stopple, however, is very often taken out, it becomes loose, as it will also be by long keeping: in either of which cases it must be changed.\n\nBlink of the Ice, is a name given by the pilots to a bright appearance near the horizon, occasioned by the ice, and observed before the ice itself is seen.\n\nIce-Boats, boats so constructed as to sail upon ice, and which are very common in Holland, particularly upon the river Maese and the lake Y. See Plate CCLXXVIII. They go with incredible swiftness, sometimes so quick as to affect the breath, and are found very useful in conveying goods and passengers over lakes and great rivers in that country. Boats of different sizes are placed in a transverse form upon a 2\u00bd or 3 inch deal board; at the extremity of each end are fixed irons, which turn up in the form of skids; upon this plank the boat rests, and the two ends serve as out-riggers to prevent upsetting; whence ropes are fastened that lead to the head of the mast in the nature of throats, and others passed through a block across the bowprit; the rudder is made somewhat like a hatchet with the head placed downward, which being pressed down, cuts the ice, and serves all the purposes of a rudder in the water, by enabling the helmsman to steer, tack, &c.\n\nMethod of making Ice-Cream. Take a sufficient quantity of cream, and, when it is to be mixed with raspberry, or currant, or pine, a quarter part as much of the juice or jam, as of the cream: after beating and straining the mixture through a cloth, put it with a little juice of lemon into the mould, which is a pewter vessel, and varying in size and shape at pleasure; cover the mould, and place it in a pail about two-thirds full of ice, into which two handfuls of salt have been thrown; turn the mould by the hand-hold with a quick motion to and fro, in the manner used for milling chocolate, for eight or ten minutes; then let it rest as long, and turn it again for the same time; and having left it to stand half an hour, it is fit to be turned out of the mould and to be sent to table. Lemon juice and sugar, and the juices of various kinds of fruits, are frozen without cream; and when cream is used, it should be well mixed.\n\nIce-Hills, a sort of structure or contrivance common upon the river Neva at Petersburg, and which afford a perpetual fund of amusement to the populace. They are constructed in the following manner. A scaffolding is raised upon the river about 30 feet in height, with a landing place on the top, the ascent to which is by a ladder. From this summit a sloping plane of boards, about four yards broad and 30 long, descends to the superficies of the river; it is supported by strong poles gradually decreasing in height, and its sides are defended by a parapet of planks. Upon these boards are laid square masses of ice about four inches thick, which being first smoothed with the axe and laid close to each other, are then sprinkled with water; by these means they coalesce, and, adhering to the boards, immediately form an inclined plane of pure ice. From the bottom of this plane the snow is cleared away for the length of 200 yards, and the breadth of four, upon the level bed of the river; and the sides of this course, as well as the sides and top of the scaffolding, are ornamented with firs and pines. Each person, being provided with\nICE\n\na fledge, mounts the ladder; and having attained the summit, he feats himself upon his fledge at the upper extremity of the inclined plane, down which he suffers it to glide with considerable rapidity, poising it as he goes down; when the velocity acquired by the descent carries it above 100 yards upon the level ice of the river. At the end of this course, there is usually a similar ice-hill, nearly parallel to the former, which begins where the other ends; so that the person immediately mounts again, and in the same manner glides down the other inclined plane of ice. This diversion he repeats as often as he pleases. The boys also are continually employed in skating down these hills; they glide chiefly upon one skait, as they are able to poise themselves better upon one leg than upon two. These ice-hills exhibit a pleasing appearance upon the river, as well from the trees with which they are ornamented, as from the moving objects which at particular times of the day are defending without intermission.","sp":53,"ep":59},{"h":"JEALOUSY","t":"in Ethics, is that peculiar uneasiness which arises from the fear that some rival may rob us of the affection of one whom we greatly love, or suspicion that he has already done it.

See GEOFFREY.","sp":140,"ep":140},{"h":"JEFFREYS","t":"Sir GEORGE, Baron Wem, commonly called Judge Jeffreys, was the sixth son of John Jeffreys, Esq. of Acton in Denbighshire; and was educated at Westminster school, whence he removed to the Inner Temple, where he applied himself to the study of the law. Alderman Jeffreys, who was probably related to him, introduced him among the citizens of London, and he being a merry bottle companion, soon came into great business, and was chosen their recorder. He was afterwards chosen solicitor to the duke of York; and in 1680 was knighted, and made chief-justice of Chester. At length, resigning the recordership, he obtained the post of chief-justice of the king's-bench, and, soon after the accession of James II., the great seal. During the reign of King Charles II., he showed himself a bitter enemy to those dissenting ministers who, in that time of persecution, were tried by him: he was one of the greatest advisers and promoters of all the oppressions and arbitrary measures carried on in the reign of James II.; and his sanguinary and inhuman proceedings against Monmouth's unhappy adherents in the well will ever render his name infamous. Whenever the prisoner was of a different party, or he could please the court by condemning him, instead of appearing, according to the duty of his office, Jeffreys, as his counsel, he would scarce allow him to speak for himself; but would load him with the grossest and most vulgar abuses, browbeat, insult, and turn to ridicule the witnesse that spoke in his behalf; and even threaten the jury with fines and imprisonment, if they made the least hesitation about bringing in the prisoner guilty. Yet it is said, that when he was in temper, and matters perfectly indifferent came before him, no one became a seat of justice better. Nay, it even appears, that, when he was under no state influence, he was sometimes inclined to protect the natural and civil rights of mankind, of which the following instance has been given:\u2014The mayor and aldermen of Bristol had been used to transport convicted criminals to the American plantations, and fell them by way of trade. This turning to good account when any pilferers or petty rogues were brought before them, they threatened them with hanging; and then some officers who attended, earnestly persuaded the ignorant intimidated creatures to beg for transportation, as the only way to save them; and in general their advice was followed. Then, without more form, each alderman in course took one, and sold him for his own benefit; and sometimes warm disputes arose between them about the next turn. This infamous trade which had been carried on many years, coming to the knowledge of the lord chief justice, he made the mayor descend from the bench and stand at the bar, in his scarlet and fur, with his guilty brethren the aldermen, and plead as common criminals. He then obliged them to give securities to answer informations; but the proceedings were stopped by the Revolution.\u2014However, the brutality Jeffreys commonly showed on the bench, where his voice and visage were equally terrible, at length exposed him to a severe mortification. A scrivener of Wapping having a cause before him, one of the opponent's counsel said he was a strange fellow, and sometimes went to church, and sometimes to conventicles; and it was thought he was a trimmer. At this the chancellor fired: \"A trimmer?\" (said he); I have heard much of that monster, but never saw one. Come forth Mr Trimmer, and let me see your shape.\" He then treated the poor fellow so roughly, that, on his leaving the hall, he declared he would not undergo the terrors of that man's face again to save his life, and he should certainly retain the frightful impressions of it as long as he lived. Soon after, the prince of Orange coming, the lord chancellor, dreading the public resentment, disguised himself in a seaman's dress, in order to leave the kingdom; and was drinking in a cellar, when this scrivener coming into the cellar, and seeing again the face which had filled him with such horror, started; on which Jeffreys, fearing he was known, feigned a cough, and turned to the wall with his pot of beer in his hand. But Mr Trimmer going out, gave notice that he was there; and the mob rushing in seized him, and carried him before the lord mayor, who sent him with a strong guard to the lords of the council, by whom he was committed to the Tower, where he died in 1689.\u2014It is remarkable, that the late countess of Pomfret met with very rude insults from the populace on the western road, only because she was granddaughter to the inhuman Jeffreys.","sp":140,"ep":140},{"h":"JEFOFAILE","t":"(compounded of three French words, \"J'ay failli,\" \"I have failed\"), a term in law, used for an oversight in pleading or other proceeding at law.\n\nThe shewing of these defects or oversights was formerly often practised by the counsel; and when the jury came into court in order to try the issue, they said, This inquest you ought not to take; and after verdict they would say to the court, To judgment you ought not to go.

Sir Roger Jenyns, his father, was descended from the family of the Jenyns of Churchill in Somer-fethire. The country residence of Sir Roger was at Ely, in the isle of the same name, where he turned his attention to such kinds of business as rendered him most beneficial to his neighbours, for which amiable deportment in particular the honour of knighthood was conferred upon him by William III. Our author's mother, a lady of rank, learning and piety, superintended his education till it was necessary to place him under a tutor, for which purpose a Mr Hill was taken into the family, by whom he was instructed in the first rudiments of language, with such other branches of knowledge as were suited to his years. At this time Mr Hill\nJenyns Hill was called to a situation more advantageous, and Mr White succeeded him in the office of tutor to young Jenyns, a man eminent for his learning, taste, and ingenuity, by whom he was qualified for attending the university.\n\nHe was admitted into St John's College, Cambridge, in the year 1722, under Dr Edmondson, who was at that time one of the leading tutors of the college. Here his diligence and regular deportment did him the greatest honour, and the strict discipline observed in the college was perfectly agreeable to his natural inclinations. After quitting the college, his winter residence was in London, and he lived in the country during the summer season, being chiefly employed in the prosecution of such studies as were of a literary nature. His first publication, a poetical essay on the art of dancing, appeared without his name in 1727; but he was very soon discovered, and it was considered as a prelude of his future eminence.\n\nSoon after the death of his father, he was chosen in 1742 one of the members of parliament for the county of Cambridge, and from this period he retained his seat in the house of commons till the year 1780. The high opinion entertained by his constituents of his parliamentary conduct, may be learned from the unanimity of their choice; for he never but once experienced any opposition. He was chosen one of the commissioners of the board of trade and plantations in 1753, which office he retained till an alteration was made in the constitution of it by authority of parliament. He was married, first to the only daughter of Colonel Soame, of Dereham in Norfolk, who died without issue, and afterwards to the daughter of Henry Gray, Esq., of Hackney, who survived him. He died himself of a fever, after a few days illness, on the 18th of December, 1787, leaving no issue.\n\nHis temper was mild, sweet, and gentle, which he manifested indiscriminately to all. It was his earnest wish never to give offence to any; yet he made such liberal allowances for diversities of temper, that he was very rarely offended with others. He was punctual in the discharge of the duties of religion both in public and private, professing to be better pleased with the government and discipline of the church of England than of any other in Christendom, which, however, he considered as capable of important alterations and amendments, if it were previously and deliberately determined what these alterations should be. He possessed an uncommon vein of the most lively and genuine wit, which he never made use of to wound the feelings of others, but was rather very much offended with those who did, being convinced that distinguished endowments of the mind are as much intended to promote the felicity of others, as of those who possess them.\n\nNo man was ever a more genuine philanthropist, as he felt most sensibly for the miseries of others, and used every mean in his power to render them as happy as possible. His indigent neighbours in the country he viewed as a part of his family, in which light he considered them as entitled to his care and protection. As an author, Soame Jenyns certainly deserves a place among those who have excelled, whether we view him as a poet, or a writer of prose, in which latter capacity he ranks with the purest and most correct writers of the English language. He reasons with closeness and precision, and comes to the conclusion he means to establish by a regular chain of argument. His first publication on account of which he was attacked, was his Free Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Evil; but in a preface to the second edition he fully vindicated it against all the calumny, slander, and misrepresentation which had been thrown out against it, with that temper and moderation which distinguished him so eminently upon all occasions. His view of the Internal Evidences of the Christian Religion was published without his name in the year 1776, which gave delight and satisfaction to many eminent judges, and made converts of numbers who had been infidels before.","sp":141,"ep":142},{"h":"JEPHTHAH","t":"judge of Israel, and successor to Jair in the government of the people, was a native of Mizpeh, and the son of one Gilead by a harlot. This Gilead having married a lawful wife, and had children by her, these children drove Jephthah from his father's house, saying that he should not be heir with them. Jephthah retired into the land of Tob, and there he became captain of a band of thieves and such other people as he had picked up together. At that time, the Israelites beyond Jordan, seeing themselves preyed upon by the Ammonites, came to desire alliance from Jephthah; and that he would take upon him the command of them. Jephthah at first reproached them with the injustice which they had done him, or at least which they had not prevented, when he was forced from his father's house. But as these people were very earnest in their request, he told them, that he would succour them, provided that at the end of the war they would acknowledge him for their prince. This they consented to, and promised with an oath.\n\nJephthah, in the year of the world 2817, having been acknowledged prince of the Israelites in an assembly of the people, was filled with the spirit of God, and began to get his troops together; to that end, he went over all the land which the children of Israel possessed beyond Jordan. At the same time he made a vow to the Lord, that if he were successful against the Ammonites, he would offer up for a burnt-offering whatever should first come out of his house to meet him. The battle being fought, Jephthah remained conqueror, and ravaged all the land of Ammon. But as he returned to his house, his only daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: whereupon Jephthah tore his clothes, and said, \"Alas, my daughter, thou hast brought me very low, for I have made a vow unto the Lord, and cannot fail in the performance of it.\" His daughter answered, \"My father,\nJephthah, if thou hast made a vow unto the Lord, do with me as thou hast promised; grant me only the favour that I may be at liberty to go up to the mountains, and there for two months bewail my virginity with my companions.\" Jephthah granted her this liberty; and at the end of two months, he offered up his daughter, who died a virgin, a burnt-offering, agreeable to his vow, according to the opinion of most commentators.\n\nIn the mean time, the Ephraimites, jealous of the victory obtained by Jephthah over the Ammonites, passed the river Jordan in a tumultuous manner, came and complained to Jephthah that he had not invited them to this war, and threatened to set fire to his house. Jephthah answered them, that he had sent to desire their assistance; but observing that they did not come, he put his life in his hands and hazarded a battle. The Ephraimites not being satisfied with these reasons, Jephthah assembled the people of Gilead, gave them battle, and defeated them; so that there were two and forty thousand men of the tribe of Ephraim killed that day. We know nothing more in particular concerning the life of Jephthah, only that he judged Israel five years, and was buried in a city of Gilead.\n\nSt Paul (Heb. xi. 32.) places Jephthah among the saints of the Old Testament, the merit of whose faith distinguished them. But it must be observed, that there is something so extraordinary in Jephthah's vow, that notwithstanding the Scripture speaks of it in very plain and clear terms, yet such difficulties arise concerning it as perplex commentators. Some maintain, that this daughter of Jephthah was not sacrificed, as that would have been a violation of the law of Moses; and especially, when by the same law he might have redeemed his daughter for ten shekels of silver: therefore they contend, that it was something else Jephthah did to his daughter, such as devoting her to a state of celibacy, or dedicating her to the service of God. On the other hand, those who maintain the affirmative, or that Jephthah's daughter was actually sacrificed, urge, that the times wherein Jephthah lived were sadly addicted to idolatry; also the manner wherein he lived before he was called to the assistance of his country; but above all, the clear, evident, and express meaning of the text. They observe, that vows of perpetual virginity are institutions of a modern date; and had there been no more in it, there would have been little occasion for rending his clothes, and bemoaning himself as he did; besides the bitter lamentations made by herself, and by all the daughters of Israel in succeeding times. But if she was sacrificed, we may safely and confidently aver with Josephus, who says that she was, that this sacrifice was neither lawful nor acceptable to God; but, on the contrary, an abominable crime, that might, notwithstanding, have proceeded from a mistaken principle of religion.","sp":142,"ep":143},{"h":"JERBOA","t":"a species of quadruped belonging to the genus *Dipus*, and resembling in some of its characters, the mouse tribe. See *Dipus*, Mammalia Index.\n\n**JEREMIAH** (*the Prophecy of*), a canonical book of the Old Testament. This divine writer was of the race of the priests, the son of Hilkiah of Anathoth, of the tribe of Benjamin. He was called to the prophetic office when very young, about the 13th year of Josiah, and continued in the discharge of it about 40 years. He was not carried captive to Babylon with the other Jews, but remained in Judea to lament the desolation of his country. He was afterwards a prisoner in Egypt with his disciple Baruch, where it is supposed he died in a very advanced age. Some of the Christian fathers tell us he was stoned to death by the Jews, for preaching against their idolatry; and some say he was put to death by Pharaoh Hophrah, because of his prophecy against him. Part of the prophecy of Jeremiah relates to the time after the captivity of Israel, and before that of Judah, from the first chapter to the 44th; and part of it was in the time of the latter captivity, from the 45th chapter to the end. The prophet lays open the sins of Judah with great freedom and boldness, and reminds them of the severe judgments which had befallen the ten tribes for the same offences. He passionately laments their misfortune, and recommends a speedy reformation to them. Afterwards he predicts the grievous calamities that were approaching, particularly the 70 years captivity in Chaldea. He likewise foretells their deliverance and happy return, and the recompence which Babylon, Moab, and other enemies of the Jews, should meet with in due time. There are likewise several intimations in this prophecy concerning the kingdom of the Messiah; also several remarkable visions, and types, and historical passages relating to those times. The 52d chapter does not belong to the prophecy of Jeremiah, but probably was added by Ezra, and contains a narrative of the taking of Jerusalem, and of what happened during the captivity of the Jews, to the death of Jehoiachin. St Jerome has observed upon this prophet, that his style is more easy than that of Isaiah and Hosea; that he retains something of the rusticity of the village where he was born; but that he is very learned and majestic, and equal to those two prophets in the sense of his prophecy.","sp":143,"ep":143},{"h":"JERICHO","t":"or Hierichus, in Ancient Geography, a city of Judah; situated between Jordan and Jerusalem, at the distance of 150 stadia from the latter, and 60 from the former.

It produces opobalsamum, myrobalsam, and dates; from the leaf of which it is called the city of palm-trees, by Moses. The place is now called Raha; and is situated, M. Volney informs us, \"in a plain six or seven leagues long, by three wide, around which are a number of barren mountains, that render it extremely hot. Here formerly was cultivated the balm of Mecca. From the description of the Hadjes, this is a shrub similar to the pomegranate tree, with leaves like those of rue: it bears a pulpy nut, in which is contained a kernel that yields the resinous juice we call balm or balsam. At present there is not a plant of it remaining at Raha; but another species is to be found there, called zak-koun, which produces a sweet oil, also celebrated for healing wounds.

He studied at Rome under Donatus, the learned grammarian. After having received baptism, he went into Gaul, and there transcribed St. Hilary's book de Synoecia. He then went into Aquileia, where he contracted a friendship with Heliodorus, who prevailed on him to travel with him into Thrace, Pontus, Bithynia, Galatia, and Cappadocia. In 372 St Jerome retired into a desert in Syria, where he was persecuted by the orthodox of Melitius's party, for being a Sabellian, because he made use of the word Hypostasis, which had been used by the council of Rome in 369. This obliged him to go to Jerusalem; where he applied himself to the study of the Hebrew language, in order to receive a more perfect knowledge of the Holy Scriptures; and about this time he consented to be ordained, on condition that he should not be confined to any particular church. In 381, he went to Constantinople to hear St Gregory of Nazianzen; and the following year returned to Rome, where he was made secretary to Pope Damasus. He then instructed many Roman ladies in piety and the knowledge of the sciences, which exposed him to the calumnies of those whom he zealously reproved for their irregularities; and Pope Siricius not having all the esteem for him which his learning and virtue justly entitled him to, this learned doctor left Rome, and returned to the monastery of Bethlehem, where he employed himself in writing against those whom he called heretics, especially against Vigiliantius and Jovinian. He had a quarrel with John of Jerusalem and Rufinus about the Origenists. He was the first who wrote against Pelagius; and died on the 30th of September 420, at about 80 years of age.

In obedience to this citation, he went to Constance; but on his arrival, in 1415, finding Hus in prison, he set out for his own country. Being seized, however, on the way, imprisoned, and examined, he was so intimidated, that he retracted, and pretended to approve of the condemnation of Wickliff's and Hus's opinions; but on the 26th of May 1416, he condemned that recantation in these terms: \"I am not ashamed to confess here publicly my weakness.

It is situated in the English channel, 18 miles to the west of Normandy, and 84 to the south of Portland in Dorsetshire, and in the time of the Romans was called Caesarea. It is not above 12 miles in length, nor much above 6 where broadest, which is at the two extremities. It is defended by rocks and dangerous quicksands. On the north side the cliffs rise 40 or 50 fathoms high, which render it inaccessible on that side; but on the south the shore is almost level with the water. In the west part of the island is a large tract of land once cultivated and very fertile, but now a barren desert, caused by the westerly winds throwing up sand from the bottom to the top of the highest cliffs. The higher lands are diversified by gritty, gravelly, stony, and fine mould; the lower by a deep, rich, and heavy soil. The middle part of the island is somewhat mountainous, and so thick planted with trees, that at a distance it resembles one entire forest, though in walking through it there is hardly a thicket or any other thing to be seen but hedge-rows and orchards of apple-trees. The valleys under the hills are finely watered by brooks, and have plenty of cattle and small sheep, with very fine wool, and very sweet meat, which is ascribed to the shortness of the grass. The horses are good for draught; but few fit for the saddle. The island produces variety of trees, roots, and herbs; but not corn enough for the inhabitants, who therefore send for it to England and France, and sometimes to Danzig. The fields are inclosed by great mounds of earth, raised from 6 to 8 or 10 feet high, proportionably thick and solid, planted with quicksets and trees. As the air of this island is very healthy, those of the inhabitants who are temperate live to a great age: but the coast is very subject to storms by westerly winds, from which they have no land to shelter them nearer than North America; and there is a vast chain of rocks about the island, among which the tides and currents are so strong and rapid, that the navigation is dangerous to those who are not perfectly acquainted with the coast. The buildings of this island are generally of rag stone; but some of the wealthy inhabitants have their houses fronted with a reddish white stone, capable of being polished like marble, and of which there is a rich quarry on a hill called Montmado. The ordinary dwellings are thatched. The churches are very plain buildings, most of them with square steeples; and the communion...\nmunion table is not at the east end, as in the English churches, but placed just under the pulpit. The staple manufacture is knit stockings and caps, many thousand pairs of which are weekly sold at St Helier to the merchants; also cider, of which 25,000 hogsheads have been made here in one year. Their principal foreign trade is to Newfoundland; whither, particularly in 1732, they sent 24 ships; these proceed from thence to the Mediterranean to dispose of their fish.\n\nOn the south of the island the sea seems to have encroached upon the land (which, as we have before observed, declines on that side), and to have swallowed upwards of six square miles, making a very beautiful bay of about three miles long, and near the same in breadth. In the east corner of this bay stands the town of St Helier, very happily situated. But the principal haven is in the western corner of the bay, which receives its name from it, being called St Aubin's. There are, besides these, several other havens of less note; as, St Brelade's bay, at the back of St Aubin's; the great bay of St Ouen, which takes in the greatest part of the west side of the island, where the largest ships may ride in 12 and 15 fathoms, safe from all but east winds. La Crevasse is a port only for boats; Greve de Leocq and Port St John are also small havens on the north side, where is likewise Bonnenuit. On the east there is the bay of St Catharine, and the harbour of Rofel. To the south-west lies the haven de la Chaufl\u00e9e. The last we shall mention is the port de Pas, a very little to the eastward of St Aubin's bay.\n\nThe towns of St Helier and St Aubin, which, as already mentioned, stand both in the same bay called St Aubin's bay, opening to the south, are about three miles asunder. St Helier took its name from Elerius or Hellier, a holy man, who lived in this island many centuries ago, and was slain by the Pagan Normans at their coming hither. He is mentioned among the martyrs in the martyrology of Coutance. His little cell with the stone bed is still thrown among the rocks; and in memory of him a noble abbey of canons regular was founded in the little island in this bay, and annexed to Cherburg abbey in Normandy in the reign of Henry I., and suppressed as an alien priory. The town of St Helier stands at the foot of a long and high rocky hill at the east end. It is a well-built and populous place; greatly improved and enlarged within the last century; and contains about 400 houses, mostly shops, and near 2000 inhabitants. The marketplace in the centre is spacious, surrounded with handsome houses, among which is the Cohue-Royale or court of justice. At the top of the market-place is a statue of George II., of bronze gilt. The market is held on a Saturday, and much frequented.\n\nSt Aubin at the west end of the bay is principally inhabited by merchants and masters of ships, whom the neighbourhood of the port has invited hither. It is not more than half the size of the other town, though greatly increased within these 100 years; and has a good stone pier carried far into the sea, where ships of considerable burden lie safe under the guns of the adjoining fort.\n\nThe isle of St Helier, more to the east in the same bay, is in circuit near a mile, surrounded by the sea at or about every half flood. On the site of the abbey before mentioned is now Elizabeth castle, one of the largest and strongest fortresses in Britain. Queen Elizabeth began it, and gave it her name. Charles I. enlarged, and Charles II. who was twice here, completed it. It was the last fortress that held out for the king. It is the residence of the governor and garrison, and occupies the whole isle, from whence at low water is a passage called the bridge, half a mile long, formed of sand and stones. A citadel was begun in the last war on a hill, whence the castle might be bombarded, but since the peace left off.\n\nMount Orgueil castle, called also Gourray from the neighbouring village of that name, lies to the south of Rofel harbour in the bay of St Catharine. It was a place of strength before Henry V.'s time, and bid defiance to the attempts of the French under the constable De Gueldin 1374 at the end of the reign of Edward III. It was repaired by Queen Elizabeth, but is now neglected, yet preserves an air of grandeur answering its name even in ruins. The ascent to its top is by near 200 steps; and from thence by a telescope may be seen the two front towers of the cathedral of Coutance. The famous William Prynne was confined in it three years.\n\nThe island is divided into 12 parishes, which are so laid out that each has a communication with the sea; these are subdivided into 52 vintaines, so called from the number of 20 houses, which each is supposed to have formerly contained, just as in England 10 houses anciently made a tything. The whole number of inhabitants is computed at about 20,000, of which 3000 are able to bear arms, and are formed into regiments. Their general review is on the sandy bay between the two towns, when they are attended with a train of above 20 brass field pieces, and two small bodies of horse in the wings.\n\nThe chief officer is the governor, who has the custody of his majesty's castles, with the command of the garrisons and militia. The civil government is administered by a bailiff, assisted by 12 jurats. They have here also what they call an assembly of the states. These are convened by the governor or his deputy; the bailiff\u53ec\u96c6s himself and the jurats, the dean and clergy, and the 12 high constables.\n\nThere were formerly many druidical temples and altars in Jersey, some remains of which are still to be seen. The cromlechs are here called pouquelays, and there are some tumuli and keeps. Roman coins have also been dug up in this island; and there are the remains of a Roman camp in the manor of Dilamant. Christianity was first planted here in the middle of the 6th century, and the island made part of the see of Dol in Bretagne, and it is now governed by a dean. Besides the abbey of St Helier, here were four priories, Noirmont, St Clement, Bonnenuit, and le Leck, and above 20 chapels, now mostly ruined. During the last war this island, together with that of Guernsey, became an object of desire to France, whose vanity, no less than her interest, was concerned in depriving Britain of those last remnants of her continental possessions. The first attempt to achieve this conquest took place in the year 1779. A force of 5000 or 6000 men was embarked in flat-bottomed boats, and endeavoured to land in the bay of St Ouen, on the first of May.\nJersey, this attempt they were supported by five frigates and other armed vessels; but met with such a vigorous resistance from the militia of the island, assisted by a body of regulars, that they were compelled to retire without having landed a single person. Much discontent and mutual recrimination took place among the French naval and military officers on this failure; and though the expedition was represented by many as ill concerted, and destitute of every hope of success, another attempt was resolved on. Both the troops and seamen that had been employed in the former expedition were equally desirous of retrieving their honour; but they were for some time prevented from making any attempt of this kind by bad weather; and, before another opportunity offered, the squadron which was destined to cover their descent was attacked by Sir James Wallace, who drove them ashore on the coast of Normandy, silenced a battery under whose guns they had taken shelter, captured a frigate of 34 guns, with two rich prizes, burnt two other large frigates, and a considerable number of smaller vessels.\n\nThus the scheme of invading the island of Jersey was totally disconcerted, and laid aside for that time, but was resumed in the year 1781. The conduct of this second expedition was given to the baron de Rullecourt, who had been second in command when the former attempt was made. He was a man of courage, but fierce and violent in his disposition, and seems to have been very deficient in the prudence and conduct necessary for bringing any military enterprise to a successful issue. The force entrusted to him on the present occasion consisted of 2000 men; with whom he embarked in very tempestuous weather, hoping that he might thus be able to surprise the garrison. Many of his transports, however, were thus dispersed, and he himself, with the remainder, obliged to take shelter in some islands in the neighbourhood of Jersey. As soon as the weather grew calmer, he seized the opportunity of a dark night to effect landing at a place called Grouville, where he made prisoners of a party of militia. Hence he proceeded with the utmost expedition to St Helier's, the capital of the island, about three miles distant. His arrival was so unexpected, that he seized on a party of men who guarded it, together with the commanding officer, and the magistrates of the island. Rullecourt then drew up a capitulation, the terms of which were, that the island should be instantly surrendered to the French, and the garrison be sent to England; threatening the town with immediate destruction in case of non-compliance. It was in vain represented to him that no act of the deputy-governor and magistrates could be valid while they remained in his power; but, as Rullecourt still insisted, they were obliged to comply, lest his menaces should have been carried into execution. This point being gained, he advanced to Elizabeth castle in the neighbourhood of the town, summoning it to surrender in virtue of the capitulation for the town and island just concluded. To this a peremptory refusal was given, and followed by such a vigorous discharge of artillery, that he was obliged to retire into the town. In the mean time the British troops stationed in the island began to assemble from every quarter under the command of Major Pierion; who, on being required by the French commander to submit, replied, that if the French themselves did not, within 20 minutes, lay down their arms, he would attack them. This being refused, an attack was instantly made with such impetuosity, that the French were totally routed in less than half an hour, and driven into the market-place, where they endeavoured to make a stand. Their commander, exasperated at this unexpected turn of affairs, endeavoured to wreak his vengeance on the captive governor, whom he obliged to stand by his side during the whole time of the conflict. This, however, was quickly over; the French were broken on all sides, the baron himself mortally wounded, and the next in command obliged to surrender himself and the whole party prisoners of war; while the captive governor escaped without a wound. This second disaster put an end to all hopes of the French ministry of being able to reduce the island of Jersey, and was indeed no small mortification to them; 800 troops having been landed at that time, of which not one escaped. A monument was erected at the public expense in the church of St Helier, to the memory of Major Pierion, to whom the deliverance of the island was owing; but who unhappily fell in the moment of victory, when only 24 years of age.\n\nAll the landing places and creeks round the island are now fortified with batteries, and 17 or 18 watch-houses are erected on the headlands. There are round towers with embrasures for small cannon and loop-holes for small musketry; the entrance by a door in the wall out of the reach of man, and to be ascended by a ladder afterwards drawn up. This island, with those of Guernsey, Sark, Alderney, and their appendages, were parcel of the duchy of Normandy, and were united to the crown of England by the first princes of the Norman line. The language of the pulpit, and the bar, is the French, which is also that generally spoken by the people at large. They are governed by their own laws, which are for the most part the ducal customs of Normandy, being collected in an ancient book of customs entitled Le grand coutumier. The king's writ, or process from the courts of Westminster, is here of no force; but his commission is. They are not bound by any common acts of our parliaments, unless particularly named. All causes are originally determined by their own officers, the bailiff and jurats of the islands. But an appeal lies from them to the king and council in the last resort.\u2014Jersey is an earldom in the Villiers family.\n\nNew Jersey, or, as it is commonly called, the Jerseys (being two provinces united into one government), one of the united states of North America, lying from 39 to 41 degrees of north latitude, and from 74 to 75 degrees 30 minutes longitude west from London; in length 160 miles, in breadth 52.\n\nIt is bounded on the east by Hudson's river and the sea; on the south by the sea; on the west by Delaware bay and river, which divide it from the states of Delaware and Pennsylvania; and on the north, by a line drawn from the mouth of Mahakamak river, in latitude 41\u00b0 24', to a point on Hudson's river, in latitude 41\u00b0, containing about 8320 square miles, equal to 5,324,800 acres. New Jersey is divided into 13 counties, which are subdivided into 94 townships or precincts. In 1784, a census of the inhabitants was made by order of the legislature, when they amounted to 140,435, of which 10,501 were blacks. Of these blacks\nNew Jersey, blacks in 1739 only were slaves; so that the proportion of slaves to the whole of the inhabitants in the state is as one to 76. The population for every square mile is 18. As to the face of the country, soil, and productions, the counties of Sussex, Morris, and the northern part of Bergen, are mountainous. As much as five-eighths of most of the southern counties, or one-fourth of the whole state, is sandy and barren, unfit for cultivation. The land on the sea coast in this, like that in the most southern states, has every appearance of made ground. The soil is generally a light sand; and by digging, on an average, about 50 feet below the surface (which can be done, even at the distance of 20 or 30 miles from the sea, without any impediment from rocks or stones), you come to salt marsh. This state has all the varieties of soil from the worst to the best kind. It has a greater proportion of barrens than any of the states. The barrens produce little else but shrub oaks and white and yellow pines. In the hilly and mountainous parts of the state, which are not too rocky for cultivation, the soil is of a stronger kind, and covered in its natural state with flat oaks, hickories, chestnuts, &c., &c., and, when cultivated, produces wheat, rye, Indian corn, buckwheat, oats, barley, flax, and fruits of all kinds common to the climate. The land in this hilly country is good for grazing, and the farmers feed great numbers of cattle for New York and Philadelphia markets, and many of them keep large dairies. The markets of New York and Philadelphia receive a very considerable proportion of their supplies from the contiguous parts of New Jersey. And it is worthy of remark that these contiguous parts are exceedingly well calculated, as to the nature and fertility of their soils, to afford these supplies; and the intervention of a great number of navigable rivers and creeks renders it very convenient to market their produce. These supplies consist of vegetables of many kinds, apples, pears, peaches, plums, strawberries, cherries, and other fruits; cider in large quantities and of the best quality, butter, cheese, beef, pork, mutton, and the lesser meats.\n\nThe trade of this state is carried on almost solely with and from those two great commercial cities, New York on one side, and Philadelphia on the other; though it wants not good ports of its own. The articles exported, besides those already mentioned, are wheat, flour, horses, live cattle, hams, which are celebrated as being the best in the world, lumber, flaxseed, leather, and iron in great quantities in pigs and bars. Formerly copper ore was reckoned among their most valuable exports; but the mines have not been worked since the commencement of the late war. The iron manufactures is the greatest source of wealth to the state. Iron works are erected in Gloucester, Burlington, Morris, and other counties. The mountains in the county of Morris give rise to a number of streams necessary and convenient for these works, and at the same time furnish a copious supply of wood and ore of a superior quality. In this county alone are no less than seven rich iron mines, from which might be taken ore sufficient to supply the United States; and to work it into iron are two furnaces, two rolling and slitting mills, and about thirty forges, containing from two to four fires each. These works produce annually about 540 tons of bar iron, 800 tons of pigs, besides large quantities of hollow ware, sheet iron, and New Jersey nail rods. In the whole state, it is supposed there is yearly made about 1200 tons of bar iron, 1200 do. of pigs, 80 do. of nail rods, exclusive of hollow ware, and various other castings, of which vast quantities are made.\n\nThe character, manners, and customs of the people are various in different parts of the state. The inhabitants are a collection of Low Dutch, German, English, Scotch, Irish, and New Englanders, or their descendants. National attachment and mutual convenience have generally induced these several kinds of people to settle together in a body; and in this way their peculiar national manners, customs, and character, are still preserved, especially among the lower classes of people, who have little intercourse with any but those of their own nation. Religion, although its tendency is to unite people in those things that are essential to happiness, occasions wide differences as to manners, customs, and even character. The Presbyterian, the Quaker, the Episcopalian, the Baptist, the German and Low Dutch Calvinists, the Methodist, and the Moravian, have each their distinguishing characteristics, either in their worship, their discipline, or their dress. There is still another very perceptible characteristic difference, distinct from either of the others, which arises from the intercourse of the inhabitants with different states. The people in East Jersey trade to Philadelphia, and of course imitate their fashions, and imbibe their manners. The inhabitants of East Jersey trade to New York, and regulate their fashions and manners according to those of New York. So that the difference in regard to fashions and manners between East and West Jersey, is nearly as great as between New York and Philadelphia. The people of New Jersey are generally industrious, frugal, and hospitable. There are, comparatively, but few men of learning in the state, nor can it be said that the people in general have a taste for the sciences. The lower classes, in which may be included three-fifths of the inhabitants of the whole state, are ignorant, and are criminally neglectful in the education of their children. There are, in this state, about 50 Presbyterian congregations, subject to the care of three presbyteries, viz., that of New York, of New Brunswick, and Philadelphia; 40 congregations of the Friends; 30 of the Baptists; 25 of Episcopalians; 28 of the Dutch, besides a few Moravians and Methodists.\n\nThere are two colleges in New Jersey; one at Princeton, called Nassau Hall; the other at Brunswick, called Queen's College. The college at Princeton was first founded about the year 1738, and enlarged by Governor Belcher in 1747. It has an annual income of about 900l. currency; of which 200l. arises from funded public securities and lands, and the rest from the fees of the students. There is a grammar-school of about 30 scholars, connected with the college, under the superintendence of the president, and taught by two masters. Before the late revolution this college was furnished with a philosophical apparatus worth 100l. which (except the elegant orrery constructed by Mr Rittenhouse) was almost entirely destroyed during the war, as was also the library, which now consists of between 2000 and 3000 volumes.\u2014The charter for Queen's College at Brunswick was granted just before the war, in consequence of an application from a body of the Dutch church.\nNew Jersey church. Its funds, raised wholly by free donations, amounted soon after its establishment to $4000; but they were considerably diminished by the war. The students are under the care of a president. This college has lately increased both in numbers and reputation. There are also a number of flourishing academies in this state; one at Trenton, another in Hackensack, others at Orangedale, Freehold, Elizabeth-town, Burlington, Newark, Springfield, Morristown, Bordentown, and Amboy; but there are no regular establishments for common schools. The usual mode of education is for the inhabitants of a village or neighbourhood to join in affording a temporary support for a schoolmaster, upon such terms as is mutually agreeable. But the encouragement which these occasional teachers meet with, is generally such as that no person of abilities adequate to the business will undertake it, and of course little advantage is derived from these schools.\n\nThere are a number of towns in this state, nearly of equal size and importance, and none that has more than 200 houses, compactly built.\u2014Trenton is the largest town in New Jersey. This town, with Lambertown, which joins it on the south, contain 200 houses, and about 1500 inhabitants. Here the legislature meets, the supreme court sits, and the public offices are all kept, except the secretary's, which is at Burlington. On these accounts it is considered as the capital of the state.\u2014Burlington stands on the east side of the Delaware, 20 miles above Philadelphia by water, and 17 by land. The island, which is the most populous part of the city, is a mile and a quarter in length, and three quarters of a mile in breadth. On the island are 160 houses, 900 white and 100 black inhabitants. There are two houses for public worship in the town, one for the Friends or Quakers, who are the most numerous, and one for the Episcopalians. The other public buildings are two market-houses, a court-house, and the best gaol in the state. Besides these, there is an academy, a free school, a nail manufactory, and an excellent distillery, if that can be called excellent which produces a poison both of health and morals.\u2014Perth Amboy stands on a neck of land included between Raritan river and Arthur Kill sound. It lies open to Sandy Hook, and has one of the best harbours on the continent. Vessels from sea may enter it in one tide, in almost any weather.\u2014Brunswick was incorporated in 1784, and is situated on the south-west side of Raritan river, 12 miles above Amboy. It contains about 200 houses and 1600 inhabitants, one-half of which are Dutch. Its situation is low and unpleasant, being on the bank of the river, and under a high hill which rises back of the town.\u2014Princeton is a pleasant healthy village, of about 80 houses, 5\u00bd miles from New York, and 43 from Philadelphia.\u2014Elizabeth town and Newark are pleasant towns; the former is 15, and the latter nine miles from New York. Newark is famed for its good cider.\n\nThe government of this state is vested in a governor, legislative council, and general assembly. The governor is chosen annually by the council and assembly jointly. The legislative council is composed of one member from each county, chosen annually by the people. The general assembly is composed of three members from each county, chosen by the freemen. The council chooses one of their members to be vice-president, who, when the governor is absent from the state, possesses the supreme executive power. The council may originate any bills, excepting preparing and altering any money bill, which is the sole prerogative of the assembly.\n\nThe first settlers of New Jersey were a number of Dutch emigrants from New York, who came over between the years 1614 and 1620, and settled in the county of Bergen. Next after these, in 1627, came over a colony of Swedes and Finns, and settled on the river Delaware. The Dutch and Swedes, though not in harmony with each other, kept possession of the country many years. In March 1664, Charles II granted all the territory called by the Dutch New Netherlands, to his brother the duke of York. And in June 1664, the duke granted that part now called New Jersey to Lord Berkeley of Stratton, and Sir George Carteret, jointly; who, in 1665, agreed upon certain concessions with the people for the government of the province, and appointed Philip Carteret, Esq. their governor.\u2014The Dutch reduced the country in 1672; but it was restored by the peace of Westminster, February 9, 1674.\n\nThis state was the seat of war for several years, during the bloody contest between Great Britain and America; and her losses, both of men and property, in proportion to the population and wealth of the state, was greater than any other of the thirteen states.","sp":144,"ep":148},{"h":"JERSEY","t":"among woolcombers, denotes the finest wool, taken from the reft by dressing it with a Jersey comb.","sp":148,"ep":148},{"h":"JERUSALEM","t":"a very famous and ancient city, capital of Judea or Palestine, now a province of Turkey in Asia. According to Manetho, an Egyptian historian, it was founded by the shepherds who invaded Egypt in an unknown period of antiquity.* Accord. *See EGYPT, ing to Josephus, it was the capital of Melchisedek's kingdom, called Salem in the book of Genesis: and the Arabians affirm, that it was built in honour of Melchisedek by 12 neighbouring kings; which when they had done, he called it Jerusalem. We know nothing of it with certainty, however, till the time of King David, who took it from the Jebusites, and made it the capital of his kingdom, which it ever after continued to be. It was first taken in the days of Jebooth, by Hazael the king of Syria, who slew all the nobility, but did not destroy their city. It was afterwards taken by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who destroyed it, and carried away the inhabitants. Seventy years after, permission was granted by Cyrus king of Persia to the Jews to rebuild their city, which was done; and it continued the capital of Judea (though frequently suffering much from the Grecian monarchs of Syria and Egypt), till the time of Vespasian emperor of Rome, by whose lord Titus it was totally destroyed\u2020.\u2020 See JERUSALEM. It was, however, rebuilt by Adrian; and seemed likely to have recovered its former grandeur, being surrounded with walls, and adorned with several noble buildings; the Christians also being permitted to settle in it. But this was a short-lived change; so that when the empress Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, came to visit this city, she found it in the most forlorn and ruinous situation. Having formed a design of restoring it to its ancient lustre, she caused, with a great deal\nJerusalem deal of coft and labour; all the rubbish that had been thrown upon those places where our Saviour had suffered, been buried, &c., to be removed. In doing this, they found the cross on which he died, as well as those of the two malefactors who suffered with him; and, as the writers of those times relate, discovered by a miracle that which had borne the Saviour of mankind. She then caused a magnificent church to be built, which inclosed as many of the scenes of our Saviour's sufferings as could conveniently be done, and adorned the city with several other buildings. The emperor Julian is said to have formed a design of rebuilding the temple of Jerusalem, and of restoring the Jewish worship. This scheme was contrived on purpose to give the lie to our Saviour's prophecy concerning the temple and city of Jerusalem; namely, that the first should be totally destroyed, without one stone being left upon another; and that Jerusalem should be trodden down by the Gentiles till the times of the Gentiles were fulfilled. In this attempt, however, according to the accounts of the Christian writers of that age, the emperor was frustrated by an earthquake and fiery eruption from the earth, which totally destroyed the work, consumed the materials which had been collected, and killed a great number of the workmen.\n\nThis event hath been the subject of much dispute. Mr Warburton, who hath published a treatise expressly on the truth of this fact, hath collected the following testimonies in favour of it. The first is that of Ammianus Marcellinus, who tells us, \"Julian (having been already thrice consul), taking Salutius, prefect of the several Gauls, for his colleague, entered a fourth time on this high magistracy; and although his sensibility of the many and great events which this year was likely to produce made him very anxious for the future, yet he both pushed on the various and complicated preparations for this expedition with the utmost application, and, having an eye in every quarter, and being desirous to eternalize his reign by the greatness of his achievements, he projected to rebuild at an immense expense the proud and magnificent temple of Jerusalem; which (after many combats, attended with much bloodshed on both sides, during the siege by Vespasian) was with great difficulty taken and destroyed by Titus. He committed the conduct of this affair to Alypius of Antioch, who had formerly been lieutenant in Britain. When therefore this Alypius had set himself to the vigorous execution of his charge, in which he had all the assistance that the governor of the province could afford him, horrible balls of fire breaking out near the foundations, with frequent and reiterated attacks, rendered the place from time to time inaccessible to the scorched and blasted workmen; and the victorious element continuing, in this manner, obstinately and resolutely bent, as it were, to drive them to a distance, Alypius thought best to give over the enterprise.\"\n\nThe next testimony is that of Gregory Nazianzen. Speaking of the emperor Julian, he says, \"After having run through a course of every other tyrannical experiment against the faith, and upon trial despising all of them as trifling and contemptible, he at last brought down the whole body of the Jews upon us; whom, for their ancient turn to fictitious novelties, and an inveterate hatred of the Christian name, he chose as the fittest instrument for his machinations. These, under a show of great good-will, which hid his secret purpose, he endeavoured to convince from their sacred books and traditions, which he took upon him to interpret, that now was come the time foretold when they should return to their own land, rebuild their temple, and restore the law to its ancient force and splendor. When these things had been thoroughly infamated, and heartily entertained (for deceit finds easy admittance when it flatters our passions), the Jews set upon the work of rebuilding with great attention, and pushed on the project with the utmost labour and application. But when, now driven from their work by a violent whirlwind and a sudden earthquake, they fled together for refuge to a certain neighbouring church (some to deprecate the impending mischief; others, as is natural in such cases, to catch at any help that presents itself; and others again, enveloped in the crowd, were carried along with the body of those who fled); there are who say, the church refused them entrance; and that when they came to the doors which were wide open but a moment before, they found them on a sudden closed by a secret and invisible hand; a hand accustomed to work these wonders by the terror and confusion of the impious, and for the security and comfort of godly men. This, however, is now invariably affirmed and believed by all, that as they strove to force their way in by violence, the fire which burst from the foundations of the temple, met and stopped them. One part it burnt and destroyed, and another it desperately maimed, leaving them a living monument of God's commination and wrath against sinners. Thus the affair passed; and, let no man continue incredulous concerning this or the other miraculous works of God. But still the thing most wonderful and illustrious was, a light which appeared in the heavens, of a cross within a circle. That name and figure which impious men before esteemed so dishonourable upon earth, was now raised on high, and equally objected to the common view of all men; advanced by God himself as the trophy of his victory over unbelievers; of all trophies the most exalted and sublime. Nay further, they who were present, and partakers of the miracle we are now about to speak of, saw to this very day the sign or figure of the cross which was then marked or impressed upon their garments. For at that time, as these men (whether such as were of us or strangers) were showing these marks, or attending to others who showed them, each presently observed the wonder, either on himself or his neighbour; having a radiant mark on his body or on his garment, in which there is something that, in art and elegance, exceeded all painting or embroidery.\"\n\nNotwithstanding these testimonies, however, this fact hath been strenuously contested by others; and indeed it must be owned that the testimonies above mentioned are by no means unexceptionable. In the last, particularly, the propensity to the marvellous is so exceedingly great, that every one must at first sight be struck with it. It is true indeed, the most miraculous part of it, as it seemed to be to Gregory, namely, the appearance of crosses upon the garments and bodies of some of the people who were there, may be explained upon a natural principle; since the\nJerusalem are assured that lightning will sometimes produce effects of this kind; but even this is no decisive proof of the authenticity of the relation; though it cannot by any means discredit it, as some think. On the whole, however, it is not a matter of any consequence whether this event happened with the circumstances above mentioned or not. If Julian did make any attempt to rebuild the temple, it is certain that something obstructed the attempt, because the temple was never actually rebuilt. If he made no such attempt, the prophecy of our Saviour still holds good; and it surely cannot be thought to detract from the merit of a prophecy, that no body ever attempted to elude it, or prove it to be a falsehood.\n\nJerusalem continued in the hands of the eastern emperors till the reign of the caliph Omar, who reduced it under his subjection. The Saracens continued in possession of it till the year 1099, when it was taken by the Crusaders. They founded a new kingdom, of which Jerusalem was the capital, which lasted 88 years under nine kings. At last this kingdom was utterly ruined by Saladin; and though the Christians once more got possession of the city, they were again obliged to relinquish it. In 1217, the Saracens were expelled by the Turks, who have ever since continued in possession of it.\n\nThe city of Jerusalem, in its most flourishing state, was divided into four parts, each inclosed with its own walls; viz., 1. The old city of Jebus, which stood on Mount Zion, where the prophets dwelt, and where David built a magnificent castle and palace, which became the residence both of himself and successors; on which account it was emphatically called the City of David. 2. The lower city, called also the Daughter of Zion, being built after it; on which stood the two magnificent palaces which Solomon built for himself and his queen; that of the Maccabean princes; and the stately amphitheatre built by Herod, capable of containing 80,000 spectators; the strong citadel, built by Antiochus, to command and overtop the temple, but afterwards razed by Simon the Maccabee; and lastly, a second citadel, built by Herod, upon a high and craggy rock, and called by him Antonia. 3. The new city, mostly inhabited by tradesmen, artificers, and merchants; and, 4. Mount Moriah, on which was built the so famed temple of Solomon, described in the fifth and seventh chapters of the second book of Kings; and, since then, that rebuilt by the Jews on their return from Babylon, and afterwards built almost anew and greatly adorned and enriched by Herod.\n\nSome idea of the magnificence of this temple may be had from the following considerations. 1. That there were no less than 163,300 men employed in the work. 2. That notwithstanding that prodigious number of hands, it took up seven whole years in building. 3. That the height of this building was 120 cubits, or 82 yards, rather more than less; and the courts round it about half as high. 4. That the front, on the east side, was sustained by ramparts of square stone, of vast bulk, and built up from the valley below, which last was 300 cubits high, and being added to that of the edifice amounted to 420 cubits; to which, if we add, 5. The height of the principal tower above all the rest, viz. 60, will bring it to 480 cubits, which, reckoning at two feet to a cubit, will amount to 960 feet; but according to the length of that measure, as others reckon it, viz. at two feet and an half, it will amount to 1200 feet; a prodigious height thus from the ground, and such as might well make Josephus say, that the very design of it was sufficient to have turned the brain of any but Solomon. 6. The ramparts, which were raised in this manner, to fill up the prodigious chasm made by the deep valley below, and to make the area of a sufficient breadth and length for the edifice, were 1000 cubits in length at the bottom, and 800 at the top, and the breadth of them 100 more. 7. The huge buttresses which supported the ramparts were of the same height, square at the top, and 30 cubits broad, and jutted out 150 cubits at the bottom. 8. The stones, of which they were built, were, according to Josephus, 40 cubits long, 12 thick, and 8 high, all of marble, and so exquisitely joined, that they seemed one continued piece, or rather polished rock. 9. According to the same Jewish historian, there were 1433 columns of Parian marble, and twice that number of pilasters; and of such thickness, that three men could hardly embrace them, and their height and capitals proportionable, and of the Corinthian order. But it is likely Josephus hath given us these two last articles from the temple of Herod, there being nothing like them mentioned by the sacred historians, but a great deal about the prodigious cedars of Lebanon used in that noble edifice, the excellent workmanship of them adapted to their several ends and designs, together with their gildings and other curious ornaments. The only thing more we shall venture to add is, what is affirmed in Scripture, that all the materials of this stupendous fabric were finished and adapted to their several ends before they were brought to Jerusalem, that is, the stones in their quarries, and the cedars in Lebanon; so that there was no noise of axe, hammer, or any tool, heard in the rearing of it.\n\nAt present Jerusalem is called by the Turks Cudjemitarie, and Cudjiberiff; and is reduced to a poor thinly inhabited town, about three miles in circumference, situated on a rocky mountain, surrounded on all sides, except the north, with steep alcants and deep valleys; and these again environed with other hills, at some distance from them. In the neighbourhood of the city there grew some corn, vines, olives, &c. The lately church erected by the empress Helena, on Mount Calvary, is still standing. It is called the church of the sepulchre; and is kept in good repair by the generous offerings of a constant concourse of pilgrims, who annually resort to it, as well as by the contributions of several Christian princes. The walls of this church are of stone, and the roof of cedar; the east end incloses Mount Calvary, and the west the holy sepulchre; the former is covered with a noble cupola, open at top, and supported by 16 massive columns. Over the high altar, at the east end, is another stately dome. The nave of the church constitutes the choir; and in the inside alike are shown the places where the most remarkable circumstances of our Saviour's passion were transected, together with the tombs of Godfrey and Baldwin, the two first Christian kings of Jerusalem. In the chapel of the crucifixion is shown the very hole in the rock in which the cross is said to have\nJerusalem have been fixed. The altar in this chapel hath three crofes on it; and is richly adorned, particularly with four lamps of immense value that hang before it, and are kept constantly burning. At the west end is that of the sepulchre, which is hewn in that form out of the solid rock, and hath a small dome supported by pillars of porphyry. The cloister round the sepulchre is divided into sundry chapels, appropriated to the several sorts of Christians who reside there; as Greeks, Armenians, Maronites, Jacobites, Copts, Abyssines, Georgians, &c. and on the north-west side of it are the apartments of the Latins, who have the care of the church, and are forced to reside constantly in it; the Turks keeping the keys of it, and not suffering any of them to go out, but obliging them to receive their provisions in at a wicket. At Easter there are some grand ceremonies performed in the church, representing our Lord's passion, crucifixion, death, and resurrection, at which a vast concourse of pilgrims commonly assist. For a particular account of them, we refer the reader to Doctors Shaw and Pococke.\n\nOn Mount Moriah, on the south-east part of the city, is an edifice called Solomon's Temple, standing on or near the same spot as the ancient; but when or by whom erected is uncertain. In the midst of it is a Turkish mosque, where the Jewish sanctum sanctorum is supposed to have stood. The building, which Dr Pococke thinks must have been formerly a Christian church, is held in the utmost veneration by the Turks.\n\nThe city is now under the government of a fanatic, who resides in a house said to have been that of Pontius Pilate, over-against the castle of Antonia built by Herod the Great. Many of the churches erected in memory of some remarkable gospel transaction, have been since converted into mosques; into some of which money will procure admittance, but not into others. Both the friars and other Christians are kept so poor by the tyranny of the government, that the chief support and trade of the place consists in providing strangers with food and other accommodations, and selling them beads, relics, and other trinkets, for which they are obliged to pay considerable sums to the fanatic, as well as to his officers; and those are seldom too well contented with their usual duties, but they frequently extort some fresh ones, especially from the Franciscans, whose convent is the common receptacle for all pilgrims, and for which they have considerable allowances from the pope, and other crowned heads, besides the presents which strangers generally make them at their departure. The most remarkable antiquities in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem are, 1. The pools of Bethesda and Gihon; the former 120 paces long, 40 broad, and at least eight deep, but now without water; and the old arches, which it still discovers at the west end, are quite dammed up: the other, which is about a quarter of a mile without Bethlehem-gate, is a very stately edifice, 126 paces long, and 65 broad, lined with a wall and platter, and still well stored with water. 2. The tomb of the Virgin Mary, in the valley of Jehoshaphat, into which one descends by a magnificent flight of 47 steps. On the right hand as one goes down, is also the sepulchre of St Ann the mother, and on the left that of Joseph the husband, of the virgin-mother; some add likewise that of Jehoia-Jerusalem, him her father. In all these are erected altars for priests of all sorts to say mass, and the whole is cut into the solid rock. 3. The tomb of King Jehoshaphat, cut likewise into the rock, and divided into several apartments; in one of which is his tomb, which is adorned with a flatly portico and entablature over it. 4. That commonly called Absalom's pillar or place, as being generally supposed to be that which he is said to have erected in his life-time to perpetuate his memory, as he had no male issue. The place, however, both within and without, hath more the resemblance of a sepulchre than any thing else; though we do not read that he was buried there, neither do the people here affirm that he was. There is a great heap of stones about it, which is continually increasing; the superstitious Jews and Turks always throwing some as they pass, in token of their abhorrence of Absalom's unnatural rebellion against so good and holy a parent. The structure itself is about 20 cubits square, and 60 high, rising in a lofty square, adorned below with four columns of the Ionic order, with their capitals, entablatures, &c. to each front. From the height of 20 to 40 cubits, it is somewhat less, and quite plain, excepting a small fillet at the upper end; and from 40 to the top it changes into a round, which grows gradually into a point, the whole cut out of the solid rock. There is a room within, considerably higher than the level of the ground without, on the sides of which are niches, probably to receive coffins. 5. A little eastward of this is that called the tomb of Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, whom the Jews slew between the temple and the altar, as is commonly supposed. This fabric is all cut out of the natural rock, 18 feet high, and as many square; and adorned with Ionic columns on each front, cut out likewise of the same rock, and supporting a cornice. The whole ends in a pointed top, like a diamond. But the most curious, grand, and elaborate pieces, in this kind, are the grotts without the walls of Jerusalem, styled the royal sepulchres; but of what kings is not agreed on. They consist of a great number of apartments, some of them spacious, all cut out of the solid marble rock; and may justly be pronounced a royal work, and one of the most noble, surprising, and magnificent. For a particular account of them we must refer the reader, for want of room, to Pococke's Travels. In the neighbourhood of Jerusalem is a spot of ground, about 30 yards long and 15 broad, now the burying-place of the Armenians, which is known as the Accidama, or Field of Blood, formerly the Potters Field, and since styled Campo Santo, or the Holy Field, purchased with the price of Judas's treason, for the burial of strangers. It is walled round, to prevent the Turks abusing the bones of Christians; and one half of it is taken up by a building in the nature of a charnel house. Besides the above, a great many other antiquities in the city and its environs are shown to strangers; there being scarce any place or transaction mentioned either in the Old or New Testament, but they show the very spot of ground where the one stood, and the other was done; not only here, but all over Judea.","sp":148,"ep":151},{"h":"JESI","t":"an ancient town of Italy, in the territory of the church, and in the marca on march of Ancona.","sp":151,"ep":151},{"h":"JESSE","t":"ribbons that hang down from garlands or crowns in falconry; also short straps of leather fastened to the hawk's legs, and so to verves.","sp":151,"ep":152},{"h":"JESTING","t":"or concise wit, as distinguished from continued wit or humour, lies either in the thought, or the language, or both.

See IGNATIUS.\u2014The plan which this fantastic formed of its constitution and laws was suggested, as he gave out, and as his followers still teach, by the immediate inspiration of heaven. But notwithstanding this high pretension, his design met at first with violent opposition. The pope, to whom Loyola had applied for the sanction of his authority to confirm the institution, referred his petition to a committee of cardinals. They represented the establishment to be unnecessary as well as dangerous, and Paul refused to grant his approbation of it. At last, Loyola removed all his scruples by an offer which was impossible for any pope to refuse. He proposed, that besides the three vows of poverty, of chastity, and of monastic obedience, which are common to all the orders of regulars, the members of his society should take a fourth vow of obedience to the pope, binding themselves to go whithersoever he should command for the service of religion, and without requiring anything from the holy see for their support. At a time when the papal authority had received such a shock by the revolt of so many nations from the Roman church; at a time when every part of the papal system was attacked with so much violence and success, the acquisition of a body of men, thus peculiarly devoted to the see of Rome, and whom it might set in opposition to all its enemies, was an object of the highest consequence. Paul instantly perceiving this, confirmed the institution of the Jesuits by his bull, granted the most ample privileges to the members of the society, and appointed Loyola to be the first general of the order. The event hath fully justified Paul's discernment, in expecting such beneficial consequences to the see of Rome from this institution. In less than half a century, the society obtained establishments in every country that adhered to the Roman catholic church; its power and wealth increased amazingly; the number of its members became great; their character as well as accomplishments were still greater; and the Jesuits were celebrated by\n\nThe friends and dreaded by the enemies of the Roman faith as the most able and enterprising order in the church.\n\nThe constitution and laws of the society were perfected by Laynez and Aquaviva, the two generals who succeeded Loyola; men far superior to their master in abilities and in the science of government. They framed that system of profound and artful policy which distinguishes the order. The large infusion of fanaticism mingled with its regulation should be imputed to Loyola its founder. Many circumstances concurred in giving a peculiarity of character to the order of Jesuits, and in forming the members of it not only to take greater part in the affairs of the world than any other body of monks, but to acquire superior influence in the conduct of them.\n\nThe primary object of almost all the monastic orders is to separate men from the world, and from any concern in its affairs. In the solitude and silence of the cloister, the monk is called to work out his own salvation by extraordinary acts of mortification and piety. He is dead to the world, and ought not to mingle in its transactions. He can be of no benefit to mankind but by his example and by his prayers. On the contrary, the Jesuits are taught to consider themselves as formed for action. They are chosen soldiers, bound to exert themselves continually in the service of God, and of the pope his vicar on earth. Whatever tends to instruct the ignorant, whatever can be of use to reclaim or to oppose the enemies of the holy see, is their proper object. That they may have full leisure for this active service, they are totally exempted from those functions the performance of which is the chief business of other monks. They appear in no processions; they practise no rigorous austerities; they do not consume one half of their time in the repetition of tedious offices; but they are required to attend to all the transactions of the world, on account of the influence which these may have upon religion; they are directed to study the dispositions of persons in high rank, and to cultivate their friendships; and by the very constitution as well as genius of the order, a spirit of action and intrigue is infused into all its members.\n\nAs the object of the society of Jesuits differed from that of the other monastic orders, the diversity was no less in the form of its government. The other orders are to be considered as voluntary associations, in which whatever affects the whole body is regulated by the common suffrage of all its members. The executive power is vested in the person placed at the head of each convent or of the whole society; the legislative authority resides in the community. Affairs of moment, relating to particular convents, are determined in conventual chapters; such as respect the whole order are considered in general congregations. But Loyola, full of the ideas of implicit obedience, which he had derived from his military profession, appointed that the government of his order should be purely monarchical. A general, chosen for life by deputies from the several provinces, possessed power that was supreme and independent, extending to every person and to every case. He, by his sole authority, nominated provincials, rectors, and every other officer employed in the government of the society, and could remove them\nthem at pleasure. In him was vested the sovereign administration of the revenues and funds of the order. Every member belonging to it was at his disposal; and by his uncontrollable mandate he could impose on them any task, or employ them in what service forever he pleased. To his commands they were required to yield not only outward obedience, but to resign up to him the inclinations of their own wills and the feitiments of their own understandings. They were to listen to his injunctions as if they had been uttered by Christ himself. Under his direction they were to be mere passive instruments, like clay in the hands of the potter, or like dead carcases incapable of resistance. Such a singular form of policy could not fail to impress its character on all the members of the order, and to give a peculiar force to all its operations. There is not in the annals of mankind any example of such a perfect despotism, exercised not over monks shut up in the cells of a convent, but over men dispersed among all the nations of the earth.\n\nAs the constitutions of the order vest in the general such absolute dominion over all its members, they carefully provide for his being perfectly informed with respect to the character and abilities of his subjects. Every novice who offers himself as a candidate for entering into the order is obliged to manifest his con- science to the superior, or a person appointed by him; and is required to confess not only his sins and defects, but to discover the inclinations, the passions, and the bent of his soul. This manifestation must be renewed every six months. The society, not satisfied with penetrating in this manner into the innermost recesses of the heart, directs each member to observe the words and actions of the novices: they are constituted spies upon their conduct, and are bound to disclose everything of importance concerning them to the superior. In order that this scrutiny into their character may be as complete as possible, a long noviciate must expire, during which they pass through the several gradations of ranks in the society; and they must have attained the full age of thirty-three years before they can be admitted to take the final vows, by which they become professed members. By these various methods, the superiors, under whose immediate inspection the novices are placed, acquire a thorough knowledge of their dispositions and talents. In order that the general, who is the soul that animates and moves the whole society, may have under his eye every thing necessary to inform or direct him, the provincials and heads of the several houses are obliged to transmit to him regular and frequent reports concerning the members under their inspection. In these they descend into minute details with respect to the character of each person, his abilities natural or acquired, his temper, his experience in affairs, and the particular department for which he is best fitted. These reports, when digested and arranged, are entered into registers kept for purpose, that the general may, at one comprehensive view, survey the state of the society in every corner of the earth; observe the qualifications and talents of its members; and thus choose, with perfect information, the instruments which his absolute power can employ in any service for which he thinks meet to assign them.\n\nAs it was the professed intention of the order of Jesuits to labour with unwearied zeal in promoting the salvation of men, this engaged them of course in many active functions. From their first institution, they considered the education of youth as their peculiar province; they aimed at being spiritual guides and the power confessors; they preached frequently in order to instruct the people; they set out as missionaries to convert the unbeliefing nations. The novelty of the institution, as well as the singularity of his objects, procured the order many admirers and patrons. The governors of the society had the address to avail themselves of every circumstance in its favour; and in a short time the number as well as influence of its members increased wonderfully. Before the expiration of the sixteenth century, the Jesuits had obtained the chief direction of the education of youth in every catholic country in Europe. They had become the confessors of almost all its monarchs; a function of no small importance in any reign, but, under a weak prince, inferior even to that of minister. They were the spiritual guides of almost every person eminent for rank or power. They possessed the highest degree of confidence and interest with the papal court, as the most zealous and able champions for its authority. The advantages which an active and enterprising body of men might derive from all these circumstances are obvious. They formed the minds of men in their youth. They retained an ascendancy over them in their advanced years. They possessed, at different periods, the direction of the most considerable courts in Europe. They mingled in all affairs. They took part in every intrigue and revolution. The general, by means of the extensive intelligence which he received, could regulate the operations of the order with the most perfect discernment; and, by means of his absolute power, could carry them on with the utmost vigour and effect.\n\nTogether with the power of the order, its wealth continued to increase. Various expedients were devised for evading the obligation of the vow of poverty. The order acquired ample possessions in every catholic country; and by the number as well as magnificence of its public buildings, together with the value of its property, moveable or real, it vied with the most opulent of the monastic fraternities. Besides the sources of wealth common to all the regular clergy, the Jesuits possessed one which was peculiar to themselves. Under pretext of promoting the success of their missions, and of facilitating the support of their missionaries, they obtained a special licence from the court of Rome to trade with the nations which they laboured to convert. In consequence of this, they engaged in an extensive and lucrative commerce both in the East and West Indies. They opened warehouses in different parts of Europe, in which they vend their commodities. Not satisfied with trade alone, they imitated the example of other commercial societies, and aimed at obtaining settlements. They acquired possession accordingly of a large and fertile province in the southern continent of America, and reigned as sovereigns over some hundred thousand subjects.\n\nUnhappily for mankind, the vast influence which permitted the order of Jesuits acquired by all these different effects, has been often exerted with the most pernicious effect. Such was the tendency of that discipline observed by the society in forming its members, and such\nthe fundamental maxims in its constitution, that every Jesuit was taught to regard the interest of the order as the capital object to which every consideration was to be sacrificed. This spirit of attachment to their order, the most ardent perhaps that ever influenced any body of men, is the characteristic principle of the Jesuits, and serves as a key to the genius of their policy as well as the peculiarities in their sentiments and conduct.\n\nAs it was for the honour and advantage of the society that its members should possess an ascendant over persons in high rank or of great power; the desire of acquiring and preserving such a direction of their conduct with greater facility has led the Jesuits to propagate a system of relaxed and plaint morality, which accommodates itself to the passions of men, which justifies their vices, which tolerates their imperfections, which authorizes almost every action that the most audacious or crafty politician would wish to perpetrate.\n\nAs the prosperity of the order was intimately connected with the preservation of the papal authority, the Jesuits, influenced by the same principle of attachment to the interests of their society, have been the most zealous patrons of those doctrines which tend to exalt ecclesiastical power on the ruins of civil government. They have attributed to the court of Rome a jurisdiction as extensive and absolute as was claimed by the most presumptuous pontiffs in the dark ages. They have contended for the entire independence of ecclesiastics on the civil magistrates. They have published such tenets concerning the duty of opposing princes who were enemies of the Catholic faith, as countenanced the most atrocious crimes, and tended to dissolve all the ties which connect subjects with their rulers.\n\nAs the order derived both reputation and authority from the zeal with which it stood forth in defense of the Roman church against the attacks of the reformers, its members, proud of this distinction, have considered it as their peculiar function to combat the opinions and to check the progress of the Protestants. They have made use of every art, and have employed every weapon against them. They have set themselves in opposition to every gentler or tolerating measure in their favour. They have incessantly stirred up against them all the rage of ecclesiastical and civil persecution.\n\nMonks of other denominations have indeed ventured to teach the same pernicious doctrines, and have held opinions equally inconsistent with the order and happiness of civil society. But they, from reasons which are obvious, have either delivered such opinions with greater reserve, or have propagated them with less success. Whoever recollects the events which have happened in Europe during two centuries, will find that the Jesuits may justly be considered as responsible for most of the pernicious effects arising from that corrupt and dangerous causality, from those extravagant tenets concerning ecclesiastical power, and from that intolerant spirit, which have been the disgrace of the church of Rome throughout that period, and which have brought so many calamities upon civil society.\n\nBut, amidst many bad consequences flowing from the institution of this order, mankind, it must be acknowledged, have derived from it some considerable advantages. As the Jesuits made the education of youth one of their capital objects, and as their first attempts to establish colleges for the reception of ill-educated youth were violently opposed by the universities in different countries, it became necessary for them, as the most effectual method of acquiring the public favour, to surpass their rivals in science and industry. This prompted them to cultivate the study of ancient literature with extraordinary ardour. This put them upon various methods for facilitating the instruction of youth; and, by the improvements which they made in it, they have contributed so much towards the progress of polite learning, that on this account they have merited well of society. Nor has the order of Jesuits been successful only in teaching the elements of literature; it has produced likewise eminent matters in many branches of science, and can alone boast of a greater number of ingenious authors than all the other religious fraternities taken together.\n\nBut it is in the new world that the Jesuits have exhibited the most wonderful display of their abilities, and have contributed most effectually to the benefit of the human species. The conquerors of that unfortunate quarter of the globe had nothing in view but to plunder, to enslave, and to exterminate its inhabitants. The Jesuits alone have made humanity the object of their settling there. About the beginning of the 17th century, they obtained admission into the fertile province of Paraguay, which stretches across the southern continent of America, from the bottom of the mountains of Potosi to the confines of the Spanish and Portuguese settlements on the banks of the river De la Plata. They found the inhabitants in a state little different from that which takes place among men when they first begin to unite together; strangers to the arts, subsisting precariously by hunting or fishing, and hardly acquainted with the first principles of labor, ordination, and government. The Jesuits set themselves to instruct and to civilize these savages. They taught them to cultivate the ground, to rear tame animals, and to build houses. They brought them to live together in villages. They trained them to arts and manufactures. They made them taste the sweets of society, and accustomed them to the blessings of security and order. These people became the subjects of their benefactors, who have governed them with a tender attention, resembling that with which a father directs his children. Respected and beloved almost to adoration, a few Jesuits presided over some hundred thousand Indians. They maintained a perfect equality among all the members of the community. Each of them was obliged to labour, not for himself alone, but for the public. The produce of their fields, together with the fruits of their industry of every species, were deposited in common storehouses, from which each individual received everything necessary for the supply of his wants. By this institution, almost all the passions which disturb the peace of society, and render the members of it unhappy, were extinguished. A few magistrates, chosen by the Indians themselves, watched over the public tranquility, and secured obedience to the laws. The languishing punishments frequent under other governments were unknown. An admonition\nadmonition from a Jesuit, a slight mark of infamy, or on some singular occasion, a few lashes with a whip, were sufficient to maintain good order among these innocent and happy people.\n\nBut even in this meritorious effort of the Jesuits for the good of mankind, the genius and spirit of their order have mingled and are discernible. They plainly aimed at establishing in Paraguay an independent empire, subject to the society alone, and which, by the superior excellence of its constitution and police, could scarcely have failed to extend its dominion over all the southern continent of America. With this view, in order to prevent the Spaniards or Portuguese in the adjacent settlements from acquiring any dangerous influence over the people within the limits of the province subject to the society, the Jesuits endeavoured to inspire the Indians with hatred and contempt of these nations. They cut off all intercourse between their subjects and the Spanish or Portuguese settlements. They prohibited any private trader of either nation from entering their territories. When they were obliged to admit any person in a public character from the neighbouring governments, they did not permit him to have any conversation with their subjects; and no Indian was allowed even to enter the house where these strangers resided unless in the presence of a Jesuit. In order to render any communication between them as difficult as possible, they industriously avoided giving the Indians any knowledge of the Spanish or of any other European language; but encouraged the different tribes which they had civilized to acquire a certain dialect of the Indian tongue, and laboured to make that the universal language throughout their dominions. As all these precautions, without military force, would have been insufficient to have rendered their empire secure and permanent, they instructed their subjects in the European arts of war. They formed them into bodies of cavalry and infantry, completely armed and regularly disciplined. They provided a great train of artillery, as well as magazines stored with all the implements of war. Thus they established an army so numerous and well-appointed, as to be formidable in a country where a few sickly and ill-disciplined battalions composed all the military force kept on foot by the Spaniards or Portuguese.\n\nSuch were the laws, the policy, and the genius of this formidable order; of which, however, a perfect knowledge has only been attainable of late. Europe had observed, for two centuries, the ambition and power of the order. But while it felt many fatal effects of these, it could not fully discern the causes to which they were to be imputed. It was unacquainted with many of the singular regulations in the political constitution or government of the Jesuits, which formed the enterprising spirit of intrigue that distinguished its members, and elevated the body itself to such a height of power. It was a fundamental maxim with the Jesuits, from their first institution, not to publish the rules of their order. These they kept concealed as an impenetrable mystery. They never communicated them to strangers, nor even to the greater part of their own members. They refused to produce them when required by courts of justice; and, by a strange solemnity in policy, the civil power in different countries authorized or connived at the establishment of an order of men, whose constitution and laws were concealed with a solicitude which alone was a good reason for having excluded them. During the prosecutions lately carried on against them in Portugal and France, the Jesuits have been so inconsiderate as to produce the mysterious volumes of their institute. By the aid of these authentic records, the principles of their government may be delineated, and the sources of their power investigated, with a degree of certainty and precision, which, previous to that event, it was impossible to attain.\n\nThe pernicious effects, however, of the spirit and constitution of this order, rendered it early obnoxious to some of the principal powers in Europe, and gradually brought on its downfall. The emperor Charles V. saw it expedient to check its progress in his dominions; it was expelled England, by proclamation of James I., in 1604; Venice, in 1626; Portugal, in 1759; France, in 1764; Spain and Sicily, in 1767; and totally suppressed and abolished by Pope Clement XIV. in 1773.\n\nJESUIT'S BARK.

The place of his birth was Bethlehem, a flourishing city of Judah; but the year in which he was born is not precisely ascertained. The most general opinion is that it happened about the year of Rome 748 or 749, and about 18 months before the death of Herod. Four inspired writers have transmitted to us an account of the life of Jesus Christ. They mention particularly his birth, lineage, family, and parents; but say very little concerning his infancy and earlier youth. Herod being informed that the Messiah, or king of the Jews, so much spoken of by the prophets, was now born, being afraid that his kingdom should now be taken away, contrived how to destroy his supposed rival: but Christ, being carried, while very young, into Egypt, escaped the cruelty of the tyrant; who, being determined to make sure work, made a general massacre of the infants about Bethlehem, from the age of two years and under.\n\nAfter the death of Herod, our Saviour was brought back to Jud\u00e6a; but we are totally ignorant of what his employment was during the interval between his return thither and the time of his entering upon the ministry. We know only, that when he was but 12 years of age, he disputed in the temple with the most learned of the Jewish doctors; whom he surprised with his knowledge, and the answers he gave to their questions. After this, as the scripture tells us, he continued...\ncontinued with his parents, and was subject to them, till he entered upon his ministry. It is said, indeed, though upon no sure foundation, that during this period he followed the trade of his father, who was a carpenter. In the 30th year of his age, he began his public ministry; to which, the attention of the people was drawn by the preaching of John, a prophet miraculously inspired of God to proclaim the excellency of the Saviour, as now descended upon earth, and visible to the eyes of all; and by this prophet Christ himself was baptized in the waters of Jordan, that he might not, in any point, neglect to answer the demands of the Jewish law.\n\nIt is not necessary here to enter into a particular detail of the life and actions of Jesus Christ. Every one knows, that his life was one continued scene of the most perfect sanctity, and the purest and most active virtue; not only without spot, but also beyond the reach of suspicion. And it is also well known, that by miracles of the most stupendous kind, and not more stupendous than salutary and beneficent, he displayed to the universe the truth of that religion which he brought with him from above, and demonstrated the reality of his divine commission in the most illustrious manner. For the propagation of his religion through the country of Judea, our Saviour chose 12 apostles; whom, however, he sent out only once, and after their return kept them constantly about his person. But, besides these, he chose other 70, whom he dispersed throughout the country.\n\nThere have been many conjectures concerning the reason why the number of apostles was fixed at 12, and that of the other teachers at 70. The first, however, was, according to our Saviour's own words (Matt. xix. 28), an allusion to the 12 tribes of Israel, thereby intimating that he was the king of these 12 tribes; and as the number of his other messengers answers evidently to that of the senators who composed the Sanhedrim, there is a high degree of probability in the conjecture of those who think that Christ by this number designed to admonish the Jews, that the authority of their Sanhedrim was now at an end, and that all power with respect to religious matters was vested in him alone. His ministry, however, was confined to the Jews; nor, while he remained upon earth, did he permit his apostles or disciples to extend their labours beyond this favoured nation. At the same time, if we consider the illustrious acts of mercy and benevolence that were performed by Christ, it will be natural to conclude, that his fame must soon have spread abroad in other countries. Indeed this seems probable from a passage in scripture, where we are told that some Greeks applied to the apostle Philip in order to see Jesus. We learn also from authors of no small note, that Abgarus* king of Edessa, being seized with a severe and dangerous illness, wrote to our Lord, imploring his affiance; and that Jesus not only sent him a gracious answer, but also accompanied it with his picture, as a mark of his esteem for that pious prince. These letters are still extant; but by the judicious part of mankind are universally looked upon as spurious; and indeed the late Mr Jones, in his treatise entitled A new and full method of settling the canonical authority of the New Testament, hath offered\n\n* See Abgarus.\n\nrelations which seem almost unanswerable against the authenticity of the whole transaction.\n\nThe preaching of our Saviour, and the numberless miracles he performed, made such an impression on the body of the Jewish nation, that the chief priests and leading men, jealous of his authority, and provoked at his reproaching them with their wicked lives, formed a conspiracy against him. For a considerable time their designs proved abortive; but at last Jesus, knowing that he had fulfilled every purpose for which he came into the world, suffered himself to be taken through the treachery of one of his disciples, named Judas Iscariot, and was brought before the Sanhedrim. In this assembly he was accused of blasphemy; and being afterwards brought before Pilate the Roman governor, where he was accused of sedition, Pilate was no sooner set down to judge in this cause, than he received a message from his wife, deliring him to have nothing to do with the affair, having that very day had a frightful dream on account of our Saviour, whom she called that just man. The governor, intimidated by this message, and filled more by the majesty of our Saviour himself, and the evident falsehood of the accusations brought against him, was determined if possible to save him. But the clamours of an enraged populace, who at last threatened to accuse Pilate himself as a traitor to the Roman emperor, got the better of his love of justice, which indeed on other occasions was not very fervent.\n\nOur Saviour was now condemned by his judge, though contrary to the plainest dictates of reason and justice; was executed on a cross between two thieves, and very soon expired. Having continued three days in a state of death, he rose from the dead, and made himself visible to his disciples as formerly. He conversed with them 40 days after his resurrection, and employed himself during that time in instructing them more fully concerning the nature of his kingdom; and having manifested the certainty of his resurrection to as many witnesses as he thought proper, he was, in the presence of many of his disciples, taken up into heaven, there to remain till the end of the world.

In 1540 he proceeded A.B. became a noted tutor, and was soon after chosen rhetoric lecturer in his college. In February 1544, he commenced A.M. He had early imbibed Protestant principles, and inculcated the same to his pupils; but this was carried on privately till the accession of King Edward VI. In 1546, when he made a public declaration of his faith, and entered into a close friendship with Peter Martyr, who was made professor of divinity at Oxford. In 1550, he took the degree of B.D. and frequently preached before the university with great applause. At the same time he preached and catechised every other Sunday at Sunningwell in Berkshire, of which church he was rector. Upon the accession of Queen Mary to the crown in 1553, he was one of the first who felt the rage of the storm then raised against the reformation; for before any law was made, or order given by the queen, he was expelled Corpus Christi college by the fellows, by their own private authority; but he continued in Oxford till he was called upon to subscribe to some of the Popish doctrines, under the severest penalties, which he submitted to. However, this did not procure his safety; for he was obliged to fly, and after encountering many difficulties, arrived at Frankfort, in the 2d year of Queen Mary's reign, where he made a public recantation of his subscription to the Popish doctrines. Thence he went to Strasbourg, and afterwards to Zurich, where he attended Peter Martyr, in whose house he resided. He returned to England in 1558, after Queen Mary's death; and in 1559, was consecrated bishop of Salisbury. This promotion was given him as a reward for his great merit and learning; and another attestation of these was given him by the university of Oxford, who, in 1565, conferred on him in his absence the degree of D.D. In this character he attended the queen to Oxford the following year, and presided at the divinity disputations held before her majesty on that occasion. He had before greatly distinguished himself by a sermon preached at St Paul's cross, presently after he was made a bishop, wherein he gave a public challenge to all the Roman catholics in the world, to produce but one clear and evident testimony out of any father or famous writer, who flourished within 600 years after Christ, for any one of the articles which the Romanists maintain against the church of England; and two years afterwards, he published his famous apology for this church. In the meantime, he gave a particular attention to his diocese; where he began in his first visitation, and perfected in his last, such a reformation, not only in his cathedral and parochial churches, but in all the churches of his jurisdiction, as procured him and the whole order of bishops due reverence and esteem. For he was a careful overseer and strict observer, not only of all the flocks, but also of the pastors, in his diocese; and he watched so narrowly upon the proceedings of his chancellor and archdeacons, and of his stewards and receivers, that they had no opportunities of being guilty of oppression, injustice, or extortion, nor of being a burden to the people, or a scandal to himself. To prevent these and the like abuses, for which the ecclesiastical courts are often too justly censured, he sat often in his consistory-court, and saw that all things were carried rightly there: he also sat often as assitant on the bench of civil justice, being himself a justice of the peace. Amidst these employments, however, the care of his health was too much neglected; to which, indeed, his general course of life was totally unfavourable. He rose at four o'clock in the morning; and, after prayers with his family at five, and in the cathedral about six, he was so fixed to his studies all the morning, that he could not without great violence be drawn from them. After dinner, his doors and ears were open to all suitors; and it was observed of him, as of Titus, that he never sent any fad from him. Suitors being thus disinfected, he heard, with great impartiality and patience, such causes debated before him, as either devolved to him as a judge, or were referred to him as an arbitrator; and if he could spare any time from these, he reckoned it as clear gain to his study. About nine at night he called all his servants to an account how they had spent the day, and he went to prayers with them. From\n\nVol. XI.

This watchful and laborious life, without any recreation at all, except what his necessary refreshment at meals and a very few hours of rest afforded him, wasted his life too fast. He died at Monkton-Farley, in 1571, in the 5th year of his age. He wrote, 1. A view of a seditious bull sent into England by Pope Pius V. in 1569. 2. A treatise on the Holy Scriptures. 3.

It was published, as it came from her pen, in 1564, with the approbation of the queen and the prelates. The same Apology was printed in Greek at Constantinople, under the direction of St Cyril the patriarch.

It seems most proper therefore to commence the history of the Jews from their return to Jerusalem from Babylon, and the rebuilding of their city and temple under Ezra and Nehemiah, when the scripture leaves off any farther accounts, and profane historians begin to take notice of them. We shall, however, premise a chronological list of their judges and kings down to the captivity.\n\nThe Israelites had no king of their nation till Saul. Before him, they were governed, at first by elders, as in Egypt; then by princes of God's appointment, as Mozes and Joshua; then by judges, such as Othniel, Ehud, Shamgar, Gideon, Jephthah, Samson, Eli, Samuel; and last of all by kings, as Saul, David, Solomon, Rehoboam, &c.\n\nA List of the Judges of Israel in a Chronological Order. The Numbers prefixed denote the Years of the World.\n\n2570. The death of Joshua.\n2585. The government of the elders for about 15 years.\n2592. An anarchy of about seven years. The history of Micah, the conquest of the city of Laith by part of the tribe of Dan, and the war undertaken by the 11 tribes against Benjamin, are all referred to this time.\n2591. The first servitude under Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia began in 2591, and lasted eight years to 2599.\n2599. Othniel delivered Israel in the 40th year after peace established in the land by Joshua.\n2662. A peace of about 62 years, from the deliverance procured by Othniel, in 2599, to 2662, when the second servitude under Eglon king of the Moabites happened. It lasted 18 years.\n2679. Ehud delivers Israel. After him Shamgar governed, and the land was in peace till the 80th year after the first deliverance procured by Othniel.\n2699. The third servitude under the Canaanites, which lasted 20 years, from 2699 to 2719.\n2719.

Here the kingdom of Israel had an end after a duration of 253 years.\n\nCyrus the Great, king of Persia, having conquered Cyrus published Babylon and almost all the western parts of Asia, perceiving a de-ceiving the defolate and ruinous condition in which building the province of Palestine lay, formed a design of re- storing the Jews to their native country, and permitting them to rebuild Jerusalem and re-establish their worship. For this purpose he issued out a decree in the first year of his reign, about 536 B.C., by which they were allowed not only to return and rebuild their city, but to carry along with them all the sacred vessels which Nebuchadnezzar had carried off, and engaged to defray the expense of building the temple himself. This offer was gladly embraced by the more zealous Jews of the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Levi; but many more, being no doubt less sanguine about their religion, chose to stay where they were.\n\nIn 534 B.C. the foundations of the temple were laid, and matters seemed to go on prosperously, when the undertaking was suddenly obstructed by the Samaritans. They came at first expressing an earnest desire to assist in the work, as they worshipped the same God with the Jews; but the latter refused their assistance, as they knew they were not true Israelites, but the descendants of those heathens who had been transplanted into the country of the ten tribes after their captivity by Shalmanezer. This refusal proved the source of all that bitter enmity which afterwards took place between the Jews and Samaritans; and the immediate consequence was, that the latter made all the opposition in their power to the going on of the work. At last, however, all obstacles were surmounted, and the temple finished as related in the &c. books of Ezra and Nehemiah. The last of these chiefs died about 429 B.C., after having restored the Jewish worship to its original purity, and reformed a number of abuses which took place immediately on its commencement.\n\nBut though the Jews were now restored to the free exercise of religion, they were neither a free nor a powerful people as they had formerly been. They were few in number, and their country only a province of Syria, subject to the kings of Persia.\nSyrian governors conferred the administration of affairs upon the high-priests; and their accepting this office, and thus deviating from the law of Moses, must be considered as one of the chief causes of the misfortunes which immediately befell the people, because it made room for a set of men, who aspired at this high office merely through ambition or avarice, without either zeal for religion or love for their country.\n\nIt besides made the high-priesthood capable of being disposed of at the pleasure of the governors, whereas the Mosaic institution had fixed it unalienably in the family of Aaron.\u2014Of the bad effects of this practice a fatal instance happened in 373 B.C. Bagofes, governor of Syria, having contracted an intimate friendship with Jehuah the brother of Johanan the high-priest, promised to raise him to the pontifical office a few years after his brother had been invested with it. Jehuah came immediately to Jerusalem, and acquainted his brother with it. Their interview happened in the inner court of the temple; and a scuffle ensuing, Jehuah was killed by his brother, and the temple thus polluted in the most scandalous manner. The consequence to the Jews was, that a heavy fine was laid on the temple, which was not taken off till seven years after.\n\nThe first public calamity which befell the Jewish nation after their restoration from Babylon, happened in the year 351 B.C.: for having some how or other displeased Darius Ochus king of Persia, he besieged and took Jericho, and carried off all the inhabitants captives. From this time they continued faithful to the Persians, infomuch that they had almost drawn upon themselves the displeasure of Alexander the Great. That monarch having resolved upon the siege of Tyre, and being informed that the city was wholly supplied with provisions from Judea, Samaria, and Galilee, sent to Jaddua, then high-priest, to demand of him that supply which he had been accustomed to pay to the Persians. The Jewish pontiff excused himself on account of his oath of fidelity to Darius; which provoked Alexander, that he had no sooner completed the reduction of Tyre than he marched against Jerusalem. The inhabitants, then, being with good reason thrown into the utmost consternation, had recourse to prayers; and Jaddua is said, by a divine revelation, to have been commanded to go and meet Alexander. He obeyed accordingly, and set out on his journey, drest in his pontifical robes, at the head of all his priests in their proper habits, and attended by the rest of the people drest in white garments. Alexander is said to have been seized with such awful respect on seeing this venerable procession, that he embraced the high-priest, and paid a kind of religious adoration to the name of God engraven on the front of his mitre. His followers being surprized at this unexpected behaviour, the Macedonian monarch informed them, that he paid that respect not to the priest, but to his God, as an acknowledgment for a vision which he had been favoured with at Dia; where he had been promised the conquest of Persia, and encouraged in his expedition, by a person of much the same aspect and drest in the same habit with the pontiff before him. He afterwards accompanied Jaddua into Jerusalem, where he offered sacrifices in the temple. The high-priest showed him also the prophecies of Daniel, wherein the destruction of the Persian empire by himself is plainly set forth; in consequence of which the king went away highly satisfied, and at his departure asked the high-priest if there was nothing in which he could gratify himself or his people? Jaddua then told him, that according to the Mosaic law, they neither sowed nor ploughed on the seventh year; therefore would esteem it an high favour if the king would be pleased to remit their tribute in that year. To this request the king readily yielded; and having confirmed them in the enjoyment of all their privileges, particularly that of living under their own laws, he departed.\n\nWhether this story deserves credit or not (for the whole transaction is not without reason called in question by some), it is certain that the Jews were much favoured by Alexander; but with him their good fortune seemed also to expire. The country of Judea, being situated between Syria and Egypt, became subject to the Jews after all the revolutions and wars which the ambitious successors of Alexander waged against each other.\n\nAt first it was given, together with Syria and Phoenicia to Leomedon the Mitlenian, one of Alexander's generals, but he being soon after stripped of the other two by Ptolemy, Judea was next summoned to yield to the conqueror. The Jews scrupled to break their oath of fidelity to Leomedon; and were of consequence invaded by Ptolemy at the head of a powerful army. The open country was easily reduced; but the city being strongly fortified both by art and nature, threatened a strong resistance. A superstitious fear for breaking the Sabbath, however, prevented the besieged from making any defence on that day; of which Ptolemy being informed, he caused an assault to be made on the Sabbath, and easily carried the place. At first he treated them with great severity, and carried 100,000 men of them into captivity; but reflecting soon after on their known fidelity to their conquerors, he restored them to all the privileges they had enjoyed under the Macedonians. Of the captives he put some into garrisons, and others he settled in the countries of Libya and Cyrene. From those who settled in the latter of these countries descended the Cyrenean Jews mentioned by the writers of the New Testament.\n\nFive years after Ptolemy had subdued Judea, he was forced to yield it to Antigonus, referring to himself only the cities of Ace, Samaria, Joppa, and Gaza; and carrying off an immense booty, together with a great number of captives, whom he settled at Alexandria, and endowed with considerable privileges and immunities.\u2014Antigonus behaved in such a tyrannical manner, that great numbers of his Jewish subjects fled into Egypt, and others put themselves under the protection of Seleucus, who also granted them considerable privileges. Hence this nation came gradually to be spread over Syria and Asia Minor; while Judea seemed to be in danger of being depopulated till it was recovered by Ptolemy in 292. The affairs of the Jews then took a more prosperous turn, and continued in a thriving way till the reign of Ptolemy Philopator, when they were grievously oppressed by the incursions of the Samaritans, at the same time that Antiochus Theos king of Syria invaded Galilee. Ptolemy, however, marched against Antiochus, and defeated him;\nhim; after which, having gone to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices, he ventured to profane the temple itself by going into it. He penetrated through the two outer courts; but as he was about to enter the sanctuary, he was struck with such dread and terror that he fell down half dead. A dreadful persecution was then raised against the Jews, who had attempted to hinder him in his impious attempt; but this persecution was stopped by a still more extraordinary accident related under the article EGYPT, No. 30, and the Jews again received into favour.\n\nAbout the year 204 B.C. the country of Judea was subdued by Antiochus the Great; and on this occasion the loyalty of the Jews to the Egyptians failed them, the whole nation readily submitting to the king of Syria. This attachment so pleased the Syrian monarch, that he sent a letter to his general, wherein he acquainted him that he designed to restore Jerusalem to its ancient splendor, and to recall all the Jews that had been driven out of it: that out of his singular respect to the temple of God, he granted them 20,000 pieces of silver, towards the charges of the victims, frankincense, wine, and oil; 1400 measures of fine wheat, and 375 measures of salt, towards their usual oblations: that the temple should be thoroughly repaired at his cost; that they should enjoy the free exercise of their religion; and restore the public service of the temple, and the priests, Levites, singers, &c. to their usual functions: that no stranger, or Jew that was unpurified, should enter farther into the temple than was allowed by their law; and that no flesh of unclean beasts should be brought into Jerusalem; not even their skins: and all these under the penalty of paying 3000 pieces of silver into the treasury of the temple. He further granted an exemption of taxes for three years to all the dispersed Jews that should come within a limited time to settle in the metropolis; and that all who had been sold for slaves within his dominions should be immediately set free.\n\nThis sudden prosperity proved of no long duration. About the year 176, a quarrel happened between Onias, at that time high priest, and one Simon, governor of the temple, which was attended with the most fatal consequences. The causes of this quarrel are unknown. The event, however, was, that Simon finding he could not get the better of Onias, informed Apollonius governor of Coelo-Syria and Palestine, that there was at that time in the temple an immense treasure, which at his pleasure might be seized upon for the use of the king of Syria. Of this the governor instantly sent intelligence to the king, who dispatched one Heliodorus to take possession of the supposed treasure. This person, through a miraculous interposition, as the Jews pretend, failed in his attempt of entering the temple; upon which Simon accused the high-priest to the people, as the person who had invited Heliodorus to Jerusalem. This produced a kind of civil war, in which many fell on both sides. At last Onias having complained to the king, Simon was banished; but soon after, Antiochus Epiphanes having ascended the throne of Syria, Jason, the high-priest's brother, taking advantage of the necessities of Antiochus, purchased from him the high-priesthood at the price of 350 talents, and obtained an order that his brother should be sent to Antioch, there to be confined for life.\n\nJason's next step was to purchase liberty, at the price of 150 talents more, to build a gymnasium at Jerusalem, similar to those which were used in the Grecian cities, and to make as many Jews as he pleased free citizens of Antioch. By means of these powers, he became very soon able to form a strong party in Judea; for his countrymen were exceedingly fond of the Grecian customs, and the freedom of the city of Antioch was a very valuable privilege. From this time forward a general apostasy took place; the service of the temple was neglected, and Jason abandoned himself without remorse to all the impieties and absurdities of paganism.\n\nHe did not, however, long enjoy his ill-acquired dignity. Having sent his brother Menelaus with the usual tribute to Antiochus, the former took the opportunity of supplanting Jason in the same manner that he had supplanted Onias. Having offered for the high-priesthood 300 talents more than his brother had given, he easily obtained it, and returned with his new commission to Jerusalem. He soon got himself a strong party; but Jason proving too powerful, forced Menelaus and his adherents to retire to Antioch. Here, the better to gain their point, they acquainted Antiochus that they were determined to renounce their old religion, and wholly conform themselves to that of the Greeks: which so pleased the tyrant, that he immediately gave them a force sufficient to drive Jason out of Jerusalem; who thereupon took refuge among the Ammonites.\n\nMenelaus being thus freed from his rival, took care to fulfil his promise to the king with regard to the apostasy, but forgot to pay the money he had promised. At last he was summoned to Antioch; and finding nothing but the payment of the promised sum would do, sent orders to his brother Lysimachus to convey to him as many of the sacred utensils belonging to the temple as could be spared. As these were all of gold, the apostate soon raised a sufficient sum from them not only to satisfy the king, but also to bribe the courtiers in his favour. But his brother Onias, who had been all this time confined at Antioch, getting intelligence of the sacrilege, made such bitter complaints, that an insurrection was ready to take place among the Jews at Antioch. Menelaus, in order to avoid the impending danger, bribed Andronicus, governor of the city, to murder Onias. This produced the most vehement complaints as soon as Antiochus returned to the capital (he having been absent for some time in order to quell an insurrection in Cilicia); which at last ended in the death of Andronicus, who was executed by the king's order. By dint of money, however, Menelaus still found means to keep up his credit; but was obliged to draw such large sums from Jerusalem, that the inhabitants at last massacred his brother Lysimachus, whom he had left governor of the city in his absence. Antiochus soon after took a journey to Tyre; upon which the Jews sent deputies to him, both to justify the death of Lysimachus, and to accuse Menelaus of being the author of all the troubles which had happened. The apostate, however, was never at a loss while he could procure money. By means of this powerful argument, he pleaded his cause so effectually, that the deputies were not only cast, but put to death; and this unjust sentence gave the traitor such a complete victory over...\nover all his enemies, that from thenceforth he commenced a downright tyrant. Jerusalem was destitute of protectors; and the sanhedrim, if there were any zealous men left among them, were so much terrified, that they durst not oppose him, though they evidently saw that his design was finally to eradicate the religion and liberties of his country.\n\nIn the mean time, Antiochus was taken up with the conquest of Egypt, and a report was some how or other spread that he had been killed at the siege of Alexandria. At this news the Jews imprudently showed some signs of joy; and Jason thinking this a proper opportunity to regain his lost dignity, appeared before Jerusalem at the head of about 1000 resolute men. The gates were quickly opened to him by some of his friends in the city; upon which Menelaus retired into the citadel, and Jason, minding nothing but his resentment, committed the most horrid butcheries. At last he was obliged to leave both the city and country, on the news that Antiochus was coming with a powerful army against him; for that prince, highly provoked at this rebellion, and especially at the rejoicings the Jews had made on the report of his death, had actually resolved to punish the city in the severest manner. Accordingly, about 170 B.C., having made himself master of the city, he behaved with such cruelty, that within three days they reckoned no fewer than 40,000 killed, and as many sold for slaves. In the midst of this dreadful calamity, the apostate Menelaus found means not only to preserve himself from the general slaughter, but even to regain the good graces of the king, who, having by his means plundered the temple of every thing valuable, returned to Antioch in a kind of triumph. Before he departed, however, he put Judea under the government of one Philip, a barbarous Phrygian; Samaria under that of Andronicus, a person of a similar disposition; and left Menelaus, the most hateful of all the three, in possession of the high-priesthood.\n\nThough the Jews suffered exceedingly under these tyrannical governors, they were still referred for greater calamities. About 168 B.C., Antiochus having been most severely mortified by the Romans, took it into his head to wreak his vengeance on the unhappy Jews. For this purpose he dispatched Apollonius at the head of 22,000 men, with orders to plunder all the cities of Judea, to murder all the men, and sell the women and children for slaves. Apollonius accordingly came with his army, and to outward appearance with a peaceable intention; neither was he suspected by the Jews, as he was superintendent of the tribute in Palestine. He kept himself inactive till the next Sabbath, when they were all in a profound quiet; and then, on a sudden, commanded his men to arms. Some of them he sent to the temple and synagogues, with orders to cut in pieces all whom they found there; whilst the rest going through the streets of the city massacred all that came in their way; the superstitious Jews not attempting to make the least resistance for fear of breaking the Sabbath. He next ordered the city to be plundered and set on fire, pulled down all their stately buildings caused the walls to be demolished, and carried away captive about 10,000 of those who had escaped the slaughter. From that time the service of the temple was totally abandoned; that place having been quite polluted, both with the blood of multitudes who had been killed, and in various other ways. The Syrian troops built a large fortress on an eminence in the city of David; fortified it with a strong wall and stately towers, and put a garrison in it to command the temple, over-against which it was built, so that the soldiers could easily see and fall out upon all those who attempted to come into the temple; so many of whom were continually plundered and murdered by them, that the rest, not daring to stay any longer in Jerusalem, fled for refuge to the neighbouring nations.\n\nAntiochus, not yet satiated with the blood of the Jews, resolved either totally to abolish their religion, or destroy their whole race. He therefore issued out a decree that all nations within his dominions should forsake their old religion and gods, and worship those of the king under the most severe penalties. To make his orders more effectual, he sent overseers into every province to see them strictly put in execution; and as he knew the Jews were the only people who would disobey them, special directions were given to have them treated with the utmost severity. Athens, an old and cruel minister, well versed in all the pagan rites, was sent into Judea. He began by dedicating the temple to Jupiter Olympus, and setting up his statue on the altar of burnt-offerings. Another lesser altar was raised before it, on which they offered sacrifices to that false deity. All who refused to come and worship this idol were either massacred or put to some cruel tortures till they either complied or expired under the hands of the executioners. At the same time, altars, groves, and statues, were raised everywhere throughout the country, and the inhabitants compelled to worship them under the same severe penalties; while it was instant death to observe the Sabbath, circumcision, or any other institution of Moses.\n\nAt last, when vast numbers had been put to cruel deaths, and many more had saved their lives by their Mattathias apostasy, an eminent priest, named Mattathias, began to signalize himself by his bravery and zeal for religion. He had for some time been obliged to retire to Modin his native place, in order to avoid the persecution which raged at Jerusalem. During his recess there, Apelles, one of the king's officers, came to oblige the inhabitants to comply with the above-mentioned orders. By him Mattathias and his sons were addressed in the most earnest manner, and had the most ample promises made them of the king's favour and protection if they would renounce their religion. But Mattathias answered, that though the whole Jewish nation, and the whole world, were to conform to the king's edict, yet both he and his sons would continue faithful to their God to the last minute of their lives. At the same time perceiving one of his countrymen just going to offer sacrifices to an idol, he fell upon him and instantly killed him, agreeable to the law of Moses in such cases. Upon this his sons, fired with the same zeal, killed the officer and his men; overthrew the altar and idol; and running about the city, cried out, that those who were zealous for the law of God should follow them; by which means they quickly saw themselves at the head of a numerous troop, with whom they soon after withdrew into some of the deserts of Judea. They were followed by many others, so that in a short time they found themselves in a condition to resist their enemies;\nand having considered the danger to which they were exposed by their scrupulous observance of the Sabbath, they resolved to defend themselves, in case of an attack, upon that day as well as upon any other.\n\nIn the year 167 B.C., Mattathias finding that his followers daily increased in number, began to try his strength by attacking the Syrians and apostate Jews. As many of these as he took he put to death, but forced a much greater number to fly for refuge into foreign countries; and having soon struck his enemies with terror, he marched from city to city, overturned the idolatrous altars, opened the Jewish synagogues, made a diligent search after all the sacred books, and caused fresh copies of them to be written; he also caused the reading of the Scriptures to be resumed, and all the males born since the persecution to be circumcised. In all this he was attended with such success, that he had extended his reformation through a considerable part of Judea within the space of one year: and would probably have completed it, had he not been prevented by death.\n\nMattathias was succeeded by his son Judas, furnishing the Jews with Macabees, the greatest uninspired hero of whom the Jews can boast. His troops amounted to no more than 6000 men; yet with these he quickly made himself master of some of the strongest fortresses of Judea, and became terrible to the Syrians, Samaritans, and apostate Jews. In one year he defeated the Syrians in five pitched battles, and drove them quite out of the country; after which he purified the temple, and restored the true worship, which had been interrupted for three years and a half. Only one obstacle now remained, viz., the Syrian garrison, above-mentioned, which had been placed over against the temple, and which Judas could not at present reduce. In order to prevent them from interrupting the worship, however, he fortified the mountain on which the temple stood, with a high wall and strong towers round about, leaving a garrison to defend it; making some additional fortifications at the same time to Bethzura, a fortress at about 20 miles distance.\n\nIn the mean time Antiochus being on his return from an unsuccessful expedition into Persia, received the disagreeable news that the Jews had all to a man revolted, defeated his generals, driven their armies out of Judea, and restored their ancient worship. This threw him into such a fury, that he commanded his charioteer to drive with the utmost speed, threatening utterly to extirpate the Jewish race, without leaving a single person alive. These words were scarcely uttered, when he was seized with a violent pain in his bowels, which no remedy could cure or abate. But notwithstanding this violent shock, suffering himself to be hurried away by the transports of his fury, he gave orders for proceeding with the same precipitation in his journey. But while he was thus hastening forward, he fell from his chariot, and was so bruised by the fall, that his attendants were forced to put him into a litter. Not being able to bear even the motion of the litter, he was forced to halt at a town called Tabe on the confines of Persia and Babylonia. Here he kept his bed, suffering inexpressible torments, occasioned chiefly by the vermin which bred in his body, and the stench, which made him intolerable even to himself. But the torments of his mind, caused by his reflecting on the former actions of his life, surpassed by many degrees those of his body. Polybius, who in his account of this prince's death agrees with the Jewish historians, tells us, that the uneasiness of his mind grew at last to a constant delirium or state of madness, by reason of several spectres and apparitions of evil genii or spirits, which he imagined were continually reproaching him with the many wicked actions of which he had been guilty. At last, having languished for some time in this miserable condition, he expired, and by his death freed the Jews from the most intractable enemy they had ever known.\n\nNotwithstanding the death of Antiochus, however, the war was still carried on against the Jews; but through the valour and good conduct of Judas, the Syrians were constantly defeated, and in 163 B.C. a peace was concluded upon terms very advantageous to the Jewish nation. This tranquillity, however, was of no long continuance; the Syrian generals renewed their hostilities, and were attended with the same ill success as before. Judas defeated them in five engagements; but in the sixth was abandoned by all his men except 800, who, together with their chief, were slain in the year 161 B.C.\n\nThe news of the death of Judas threw his countrymen into the utmost consternation, and seemed to give Jonathan new life to all their enemies. He was succeeded, however, by his brother Jonathan; who conducted matters with no less prudence and success than Judas had done, till he was treacherously seized and put to death by Tryphon, a Syrian usurper, who shortly after murdered his own sovereign. The traitor immediately prepared to invade Judea; but found all his projects frustrated by Simon, Jonathan's brother. This pontiff repaired all the fortresses of Judea, and furnished them with fresh garrisons, took Joppa and Gaza, and drove out the Syrian garrison from the fortresses of Jerusalem; but was at last treacherously murdered by a son-in-law named Ptolemy, about 135 B.C.\n\nSimon was succeeded by his son Hyrcan; who not only shook off the yoke of Syria, but conquered the Samaritans, demolished their capital city, and became master of all Palestine, to which he added the provinces of Samaria and Galilee; all which he enjoyed till within a year of his death, without the least disturbance from without, or any internal discord. His reign was no less remarkable on the account of his great wisdom and piety at home than his conquests abroad. He was the first since the captivity who had assumed the royal title; and he raised the Jewish nation to a greater degree of splendor than it had ever enjoyed since that time. The author of the fourth book of the Maccabees also informs us, that in him three dignities were centered which never met in any other person, namely, the royal dignity, the high-priesthood, and the gift of prophecy. But the instances given of this last are very equivocal and suspicious. The last year of his reign, however, was embittered by a quarrel with the Pharisees; and which proceeded such a length as was thought to have shortened his days. Hyrcan had always been a great friend to that sect, and they had hitherto enjoyed the most honourable employments in the state; but at length one of them, named Elazar, took it into his head to question Hyrcan's legitimacy, alleging, that his mother had formerly been a slave,\nslave, and consequently that he was incapable of enjoying the high-priesthood. This report was credited, or pretended to be so, by the whole sect; which irritated the high-priest to such a degree, that he joined the Sadducees, and could never afterwards be reconciled to the Pharisees, who therefore raised all the troubles and seditions they could during the short time he lived.\n\nHyrcan died in 107 B.C. and was succeeded by his eldest son Aristobulus, who conquered Iturea, but proved a most cruel and barbarous tyrant, polluting his hands with the blood even of his mother and one of his brothers, keeping the rest closely confined during his reign, which, however, was but short. He was succeeded in 105 by Alexander Janneus, the greatest conqueror, next to King David, that ever sat on the Jewish throne. He was hated, however, by the Pharisees, and once in danger of being killed in a tumult excited by them; but having caused his guards to fall upon the mutinous mob, they killed 6000 of them, and dispersed the rest. After this, finding it impossible to remain in quiet in his own kingdom, he left Jerusalem, with a design to apply himself wholly to the extending of his conquests; but while he was busied in subduing his foreign enemies, the Pharisees raised a rebellion at home. This was quelled in the year 86 B.C., and the rebels were treated in the most inhuman manner. The faction, however, was by this means so thoroughly quelled, that they never dared to lift up their heads as long as he lived: and Alexander having made several conquests in Syria, died about 79 B.C.\n\nThe king left two sons, Hyrcanus and Aristobulus; but bequeathed the government to his wife Alexandra as long as she lived: but as he saw her greatly afraid, and not without reason, of the resentment of the Pharisees, he desired his queen, just before his death, to send for the principal leaders of that party, and pretend to be entirely devoted to them; in which case, he assured her, that they would support her and her sons after her in the peaceable possession of the government. With this advice the queen complied; but found herself much embarrassed by the turbulent Pharisees, who, after several exorbitant demands, would at last be contented with nothing less than the total extermination of their adversaries the Sadducees. As the queen was unable to resist the strength of the pharisaic faction, a most cruel persecution immediately took place against the Sadducees, which continued for four years; until at last, upon their earnest petition, they were dispersed among the several garrisons of the kingdom, in order to secure them from the violence of their enemies. A few years after this, being seized with a dangerous sickness, her youngest son Aristobulus collected a strong party in order to secure the crown to himself; but the queen being displeased with his conduct, appointed her other son Hyrcanus, whom she had before made high-priest, to succeed her also in the royal dignity. Soon after this he expired, and left her two sons competitors for the crown. The Pharisees raised an army against Aristobulus, which almost instantly deserted to him, so that Hyrcanus found himself obliged to accept of peace upon any terms; which, however, was not granted, till the latter had abandoned all title both to the royal and pontifical dignity, and contented himself with the enjoyment of his peculiar patrimony as a private person.\n\nBut this deposition did not extinguish the party of Hyrcanus. A new cabal was raised by Antipater an Idumean profelyte, and father of Herod the great; who carried off Hyrcanus into Arabia, under pretence that his life was in danger if he remained in Judea. Here he applied to Aretas king of that country, who undertook to restore the deposed monarch; and for that purpose invaded Judea, defeated Aristobulus, and kept him closely besieged in Jerusalem. The latter had recourse to the Romans; and having bribed Sc\u00e6vola, one of their generals, he defeated Aretas with the loss of 7000 of his men, and drove him quite out of the country. The two brothers next sent presents to Pompey, at that time commander in chief of all the Roman forces in the east, and whom they made the arbitrator of their differences. But he, fearing that Aristobulus, against whom he intended to declare, might obstruct his intended expedition against the Nabateans, dismissed them with a promise, that as soon as he had subdued Aretas, he would come into Judea and decide their controversy.\n\nThis delay gave such offence to Aristobulus, that he suddenly departed for Judea without even taking leave of the Roman general, who on his part was no less offended at this want of respect. The consequence was, that Pompey entered Judea with those troops with which he had designed to act against the Nabateans, and summoned Aristobulus to appear before him. The Jewish prince would gladly have been excused; but was forced by his own people to comply with Pompey's summons, to avoid a war with that general. He came accordingly more than once or twice to him, and was dismissed with great promises and marks of friendship. But at last Pompey insisted, that he should deliver into his hands all the fortified places he possessed; which let Aristobulus plainly see that he was in the interest of his brother, and upon this he fled to Jerusalem with a design to oppose the Romans to the utmost of his power. He was quickly followed by Pompey; and to prevent hostilities was at last forced to go and throw himself at the feet of the haughty Roman, and to promise him a considerable sum of money as the reward of his forbearance. This submission was accepted; but Gabinius, being sent with some troops to receive the stipulated sum, was repulsed by the garrison of Jerusalem, who flung the stones against him, and refused to fulfil the agreement. This disappointment so exasperated Pompey, that he immediately marched with his whole army against the city.\n\nThe Roman general first sent proposals of peace; but finding the Jews resolved to stand out to the last, he began the siege in form. As the place was strongly fortified both by nature and art, he might have found it very difficult to accomplish his design, had not the Jews been suddenly seized with a qualm of conscience respecting the observance of the Sabbath-day. From the time of the Maccabees they had made no scruple of taking up arms against an offending enemy on the Sabbath; but now they discovered, that though it was lawful on that day to stand on their defence in case they were actually attacked, yet it was unlawful to do anything towards the preventing of those pre-\nparatives which the enemy made towards such future assaults. As therefore they never moved an hand to hinder the erection of mounds and batteries, or the making of breaches in the walls, on the sabbath, the besiegers at last made such a considerable breach on that day, that the garrison could no longer retake them. The city was therefore taken in the year 63 B.C., 12,000 of the inhabitants were slaughtered, and many more died by their own hands; while the priests, who were offering up the usual prayers and sacrifices in the temple, chose rather to be butchered along with their brethren, than suffer divine service to be one moment interrupted. At last, after the Romans had satiated their cruelty with the death of a vast number of the inhabitants, Hyrcanus was restored to the pontifical dignity with the title of prince; but forbid to assume the title of king, to wear a diadem, or to extend his territories beyond the limits of Judea. To prevent future revolts, the walls were pulled down; and Scaurus was left governor with a sufficient force. But before he departed, the Roman general gave the Jews a still greater offence than almost anything he had hitherto done; and that was by entering into the most sacred recesses of the temple, where he took a view of the golden table, candlestick, censers, lamps, and all the other sacred vessels; but, out of respect to the Deity, forebore to touch any of them, and when he came out commanded the priests immediately to purify the temple according to custom.\n\nPompey having thus subdued the Jewish nation, set out for Rome, carrying along with him Aristobulus and his two sons Alexander and Antigonus, as captives to adorn his future triumph. Aristobulus himself and his son Antigonus were led in triumph; but Alexander found means to escape into Judea, where he raised an army of 10,000 foot and 1500 horse, and began to fortify several strongholds, from whence he made incursions into the neighbouring country. As for Hyrcanus, he had no sooner found himself freed from his rival brother, than he relapsed into his former indolence, leaving the care of all his affairs to Antipater, who, like a true politician, failed not to turn the weaknesses of the prince to his own advantage and the aggrandizing of his family. He foreflew, however, that he could not easily compass his ends, unless he ingratiated himself with the Romans; and therefore spared neither pains nor cost to gain their favour. Scaurus soon after received from him a supply of corn and other provisions, without which his army, which he had led against the metropolis of Arabia, would have been in danger of perishing; and after this, he prevailed on the king to pay 300 talents to the Romans, to prevent them from ravaging his country. Hyrcanus was now in no condition to face his enemy Alexander; and therefore had again recourse to the Romans, Antipater at the same time sending as many troops as he could spare to join them. Alexander ventured a battle; but was defeated with considerable loss, and besieged in a strong fortress named Alexandrian. Here he would have been forced to surrender; but his mother, partly by her address, and partly by the services she found means to do the Roman general, prevailed upon him to grant her son a pardon for what was past. The fortresses were then demolished, that they might not give occasion to fresh revolts; Hyrcanus was again restored to the pontifical dignity; and the province was divided into five several districts, in each of which a separate court of judicature was erected. The first of these was at Jerusalem, the second at Gadara, the third at Amath, the fourth at Jericho, and the fifth at Sephoris in Galilee. Thus was the government changed from a monarchy to an aristocracy, and the Jews now fell under a fet of dominion.\n\nSoon after this, Aristobulus found means to escape from his confinement at Rome, and raised new troubles in Judea, but was again defeated and taken prisoner; his son also renewed his attempts; but was in like manner defeated, with the loss of near 10,000 of his followers; after which Gabinius, having settled the affairs of Judea to Antipater's mind, resigned the government of his province to C\u00e6sar. The only transaction during his government was his plundering the temple of all its money and sacred utensils, amounting in the whole to 10,000 Attic talents, i.e. above two millions of our money. After this sacrilege, C\u00e6sar set out on his expedition against Parthia, where he perished; and his death was by the Jews interpreted as a divine judgment for his impiety.\n\nThe war between C\u00e6sar and Pompey afforded the Jews some respite, and likewise an opportunity of ingratiating themselves with the former, which the artful Antipater readily embraced. His services were rewarded by the emperor. He confirmed Hyrcanus in his priesthood, added to it the principality of Judea, to be entailed on his posterity for ever, and restored the Jewish nation to their ancient rights and privileges; ordering at the same time a pillar to be erected, wherein all these grants, and his own decree, should be engraved, which was accordingly done; and soon after, when C\u00e6sar himself came into Judea, he granted liberty also to fortify the city, and rebuild the wall which had been demolished by Pompey.\n\nDuring the lifetime of C\u00e6sar, the Jews were so highly favoured, that they could scarcely be said to feel the Roman yoke. After his death, however, the nation fell into great disorders; which were not finally quelled till Herod, who was created king of Judea by Marc Antony in 40 B.C. was fully established on the throne by the taking of Jerusalem by his allies the Romans in 37 B.C. The immediate consequence of Herod's accession was another cruel pillage and massacre; then followed the death of Antigonus the son of Aristobulus, the Jew who had for three years maintained his ground against Herod, put to death his brother Phasa\u00ebl, and cut off Hyrcanus's ears, in order the more effectually to incapacitate him for the high-priesthood.\n\nThe Jews gained but little by this change of masters. The new king proved one of the greatest tyrants and cruel persecutors mentioned in history. He began his reign with a cruel persecution of those who had sided with his rival Antigonus; great numbers of whom he put to death, feigning and confiscating their effects for his own use. Nay, such was his jealousy in this last respect, that he caused guards to be placed at the city gates, in order to watch the bodies of those of the Antigonus faction who were carried out to be buried, lest some of their riches should be carried along with them. His jealousy next prompted him to decoy Hyrcanus, the banished pontiff, from Parthia, where he had taken refuge.\nrefuge, that he might put him to death, though contrary to his most solemn promises. His cruelty then fell upon his own family. He had married Mariamne, the daughter of Hyrcanus; whose brother, Aristobulus, a young prince of great hopes, was made high-priest at the intercession of his mother Alexandra. But the tyrant, conscious that Aristobulus had a better right to the kingdom than himself, caused him soon after to be drowned in a bath. The next victim was his beloved queen Mariamne herself. Herod had been summoned to appear first before Marc Antony, and then before Augustus, in order to clear himself from some crimes laid to his charge. As he was, however, doubtful of the event, he left orders, that in case he was condemned, Mariamne should be put to death. This, together with the death of her father and brother, gave her such an aversion for him, that she showed it on all occasions. By this conduct the tyrant's resentment was at last so much inflamed, that having got her falsely accused of infidelity, she was condemned to die, and executed accordingly. She suffered with great resolution; but with her ended all the happiness of her husband. His love for Mariamne increased so much after her death, that for some time he appeared like one quite distracted. His remorse, however, did not get the better of his cruelty. The death of Mariamne was soon followed by that of her mother Alexandra, and this by the execution of several other persons who had joined with her in an attempt to secure the kingdom to the sons of the deceased queen.\n\nHerod, having now freed himself from the greatest part of his supposed enemies, began to show a greater contempt for the Jewish ceremonies than formerly; and introduced a number of heathenish games, which made him odious to his subjects. Ten bold fellows at last took it into their heads to enter the theatre where the tyrant was celebrating some games, with daggers concealed under their clothes, in order to stab him or some of his retinue. In case they should miscarry in the attempt, they had the desperate satisfaction to think, that, if they perished, the tyrant would be rendered still more odious by the punishment inflicted on them. They were not mistaken: for Herod being informed of their design by one of his spies, and causing the assassins to be put to a most excruciating death, the people were so much exasperated against the informer, that they cut and tore him to pieces, and cast his flesh to the dogs. Herod tried in vain to discover the authors of this affront; but at last having caused some women to be put to the rack, he extorted from them the names of the principal persons concerned, whom he caused immediately to be put to death with their families. This produced such disturbances, that, apprehending nothing less than a general revolt, he set about fortifying Jerusalem with several additional works, rebuilding Samaria, and putting garrisons into several fortresses in Judea. Notwithstanding this, however, Herod had shortly after an opportunity of regaining the affections of his subjects in some measure, by his generosity to them during a famine; but as he soon relapsed into his former cruelty, their love was again turned into hatred, which continued till his death.\n\nRebuilds Herod now, about 23 B.C. began to adorn his temple cities with many stately buildings. The most remarkable and magnificent of them all, however, was the temple at Jerusalem, which he is said to have raised to a higher pitch of grandeur than even Solomon himself had done. Ten thousand artificers were immediately set to work, under the direction of 1000 priests, the best skilled in carving, masonry, &c., all of whom were kept in constant pay. A thousand carts were employed in fetching materials; and such a number of other hands were employed, that every thing was got ready within the space of two years. After this, they set about pulling down the old building, and rearing up the new one with the same expedition: so that the holy place, or temple, properly so called, was finished in a year and a half; during which we are told that it never rained in the daytime, but only in the night. The remainder was finished in somewhat more than eight years. The temple, properly so called, or holy place, was but 60 cubits high, and as many in breadth; but in the front he added two wings or shoulders which projected 20 cubits more on each side, and which in all made a front of 120 cubits in length, and as many in height; with a gate 70 cubits high and 20 in breadth, but open and without any doors. The stones were white marble, 25 cubits in length, 12 in height, and 9 in breadth, all wrought and polished with exquisite beauty; the whole resembling a stately palace, whose middle being considerably raised above the extremities of each face, made it afford a beautiful vista at a great distance, to those who came to the metropolis. Instead of doors, the gates closed with very costly veils, enriched with a variety of flowering of gold, silver, purple, and every thing that was rich and curious; and on each side of the gates were planted two stately columns, from whose cornices hung golden festoons and vines, with their clusters of grapes, leaves, &c. curiously wrought. The superstructure, however, which was properly reared on the old foundation without sufficient additions, proved too heavy, and sunk down about 20 cubits; so that its height was reduced to 100. This foundation was of an astonishing strength and height, of which an account is given under the article JERUSALEM. The platform was a regular square of a stadium or furlong on each side. Each front of the square had a spacious gate or entrance, enriched with suitable ornaments; but that on the west had four gates, one of which led to the palace, another to the city, and the two others to the suburbs and fields. This inclosure was surrounded on the outside with a strong and high wall of large stones, well cemented; and on the inside had on each front a stately piazza or gallery, supported by columns of such a bigness, that three men could just embrace them, their circumference being about 27 feet. There were in all 162 of them, which supported a cedar ceiling of excellent workmanship, and formed three galleries, the middlemost of which was the largest and highest, it being 45 feet in breadth and 100 in height, whereas those on each side were but 30 feet wide and 50 in height.\n\nThe piazzas and court were paved with marble of various colours; and, at a small distance from the galleries, was a second inclosure, surrounded with a flight of beautiful marble rails, with stately columns at proper distances, on which were engraven certain admonitions in Greek and Latin, to forbid strangers, and\nJews. those Jews that were not purified, to proceed farther under pain of death. This inclosure had but one gate on the east side; none on the west; but on the north and south it had three, placed at equal distances from each other.\n\nA third inclosure surrounded the temple, properly so called, and the altar of burnt-offerings; and made what they called the court of the Hebrews or Israelites. It was square like the rest; but the wall on the outside was surrounded by a flight of 14 steps, which hid a considerable part of it; and on the top was a terrace, of about 12 cubits in breadth, which went quite round the whole inclosure. The east side had but one gate; the west none; and the north and south four, at equal distances. Each gate was ascended by five steps more before one could reach the level of the inward court; so that the wall which inclosed it appeared within to be but 25 cubits high, though considerably higher on the outside. On the inside of each of these gates were raised a couple of spacious square chambers, in form of a pavilion, 30 cubits wide and 40 in height, each supported by columns of 12 cubits in circumference.\n\nThis inclosure had likewise a double flight of galleries on the inside, supported by a double row of columns; but the western side was only one continued wall, without gates or galleries. The women had likewise their particular courts separate from that of the men, and one of the gates on the north and south leading to it.\n\nThe altar of burnt-offerings was likewise high and spacious, being 40 cubits in breadth, and 15 in height. The ascent to it was, according to the Mosaic law, smooth, and without steps; and the altar of unhewn stones. It was surrounded, at a convenient distance, with a low wall or rail, which divided the court of the priests from that of the lay Israelites; so that the laity were allowed to come thus far to bring their offerings and sacrifices; though none but the priests were allowed to come within that inclosure.\n\nHerod caused a new dedication of this temple to be performed with the utmost magnificence, and presented it to many rich trophies of his former victories, after the custom of the Jewish monarchs.\n\nThis, and many other magnificent works, however, did not divert the king's attention from his usual jealousies and cruelty. His sister Salome, and one of his sons named Antipater, taking advantage of this disposition, prompted him to murder his two sons by Mariamne, named Alexander and Aristobulus, who had been educated at the court of Augustus in Italy, and were justly admired by all who saw them. His cruelty soon after broke out in an impotent attempt to destroy the Saviour of the world, but which was attended with no other consequence than the destruction of 2000 innocent children of his own subjects. His misery was almost brought to its summit by the discovery of Antipater's designs against himself; who was accordingly tried and condemned for treason. Something still more dreadful, however, yet awaited him; he was seized with a most loathsome and incurable disease, in which he was tormented with intolerable pains, so that his life became a burden. At last he died, to the great joy of the Jews, five days after he had put Antipater to death, and after having divided his kingdom among his sons in the following manner.\u2014Archelaus had Judea; Antipas, or Herod, was tetrarch of Galilee and Perea; and Philip had the regions of Trachonitis, Gaulon, Batanea, and Panias, which he erected likewise into a tetrarchy. To his sister Salome he gave 50,000 pieces of money, together with the cities of Jannia, Azotus, and Phasa\u00eblis; besides some considerable legacies to his other relations.\n\nThe cruelty of this monster accompanied him to his grave; nay, he in a manner carried it beyond the grave. Being well apprised that the Jews would rejoice at being freed from such a tyrant, he betook himself of the following infernal stratagem to damp their mirth. A few days before his death, he summoned all the heads of the Jews to repair to Jericho under pain of death; and, on their arrival, ordered them all to be shut up in the circus, giving at the same time strict orders to his sister Salome and her husband to have all the prisoners butchered as soon as his breath was gone out. \"By this means (said he), I shall not only damp the people's joy, but secure a real mourning at my death.\" These cruel orders, however, were not put in execution. Immediately after the king's death, Salome went to the Hippodrome, where the heads of the Jews were detained, caused the gates to be flung open, and declared to them, that now the king had no further occasion for their attendance, and that they might depart to their respective homes; after which, and not till then, the news of the king's death was published. Tumults, seditions, and insurrections, quickly followed. Archelaus was deprived of his brethren, and obliged to appear at Rome, before Augustus, to whom many complaints were brought against him. After hearing both parties, the emperor made the following division of the kingdom: Archelaus had one half, under the title of ethnarch, or governor of a nation; together with a promise that he should have the title of king, as soon as he showed himself worthy of it. This ethnarchy contained Judea Propria, Idumea, and Samaria: but this last was exempted from one-fourth of the taxes paid by the rest, on account of the peaceable behaviour of the inhabitants during the late tumults. The remainder was divided between Philip and Herod; the former of whom had Trachonitis, Batanea, and Auranitis, together with a small part of Galilee; the latter had the rest of Galilee and the countries beyond the Jordan. Salome had half a million of silver, together with the cities of Jannia, Azotus, Phasa\u00eblis, and Acalon.\n\nFor some years Archelaus enjoyed his government in peace; but at last, both Jews and Samaritans, tired out with his tyrannical behaviour, joined in a petition to Augustus against him. The emperor immediately summoned him to Rome, where, having heard his accuser and defence, he banished him to the city of Vienne in Dauphiny, and confiscated all his effects, banished Judea being by this sentence reduced to a Roman and a Roman province, was ordered to be taxed: and Cyrenius the governor of Syria, a man of consular dignity, was pointed thither to see it put in execution: which having over Jud\u00e6a done, and sold the palaces of Archelaus, and seized upon all his treasure, he returned to Antioch, leaving the Jews in no small ferment on account of this new tax.\nThus were the seeds of diffusion sown between the Jews and Romans, which ended in the most lamentable catastrophe of the former. The Jews, always impatient of a foreign yoke, knew from their prophecies, that the time was now come when the Messiah should appear. Of consequence, as they expected him to be a great and powerful warrior, their rebellious and sedulous spirit was heightened to the greatest degree; and they imagined they had nothing to do but take up arms, and victory would immediately declare on their side. From this time, therefore, the country was never quiet; and the infatuated people, while they rejected the true Messiah, gave themselves up to the direction of every impostor who chose to lead them to their own destruction.\n\nThe governors appointed by the Romans were also frequently changed, but seldom for the better. About the 16th year of Christ, Pontius Pilate was appointed governor; the whole of whose administration, according to Josephus, was one continued scene of venality, rapine, tyranny, and every wicked action; of racking and putting innocent men to death, untried and uncondemned; and of every kind of savage cruelty. Such a governor was but ill calculated to appease the ferments occasioned by the late tax. Indeed Pilate was so far from attempting this, that he greatly inflamed them by taking every occasion of introducing his standards with images and pictures, consecrated shields, &c., into their city; and at last attempting to drain the treasuries of the temple, under pretence of bringing an aqueduct into Jerusalem. The most remarkable transaction of his government, however, was his condemnation of Jesus Christ; seven years after which he was removed from Judea; and in a short time Agrippa, the grandson of Herod the Great, was promoted by Caius to the regal dignity. He did not, however, long enjoy this honour; for, on his coming into Judea, having raised a persecution against the Christians, and blasphemously suffering himself to be styled a God by some deputies from Tyre and Sidon, he was miraculously struck with a disease, which soon put an end to his life. The sacred historian tells us, that he was eaten of worms; and Josephus, that he was seized with most violent pains in his heart and bowels; so that he could not but reflect on the baseness of those flatterers, who had but lately complimented him with a kind of divine immortality, that was now about to expire in all the torments and agonies of a miserable mortal.\n\nOn the death of Agrippa, Judea was once more reduced to a province of the Roman empire, and had new governors appointed over it. There were Ventidius, Felix, Festus Albinus, and Gellius Florus.\u2014Under their government the Jewish affairs went on from bad to worse; the country swarmed with robbers and assassins; the latter committing everywhere the most unheard-of cruelties under the pretence of religion; and about 64 A.C. were joined by 18,000 workmen, who had been employed in further repairing and beautifying the temple. About this time also, Gellius Florus, the last and worst governor the Jews ever had, was sent into the country. Josephus seems at a loss for words to describe him by, or a monster to compare him to. His rapines, cruelties, conniving for large sums with the banditti, and in a word, his whole behaviour, was so open and bare-faced, that he was looked upon by the Jews more like a bloody executioner, fain to butcher, than a magistrate to govern, them. In this distracted state of the country, many of the inhabitants forsook it to seek for an asylum somewhere else; while those who remained applied themselves to Cestius Galus, governor of Syria, who was at Jerusalem at the passover; beseeching him to pity their unhappy state, and free them from the tyranny of a man who had totally ruined their country. Florus, who was present when these complaints were brought against him, made a mere jest of them; and Cestius, instead of making a strict inquiry into his conduct, dismissed the Jews with a general promise that the governor should behave better for the future; and set himself about computing the number of Jews at that time in Jerusalem, by the number of lambs offered at that festival, that he might fend an account of the whole to Nero. By his computation, there were at that time in Jerusalem 2,550,000; though Josephus thinks they rather amounted to 3,000,000.\n\nIn the year 67 began the fatal war with the Romans, cause of which was ended only by the destruction of Jerusalem, the last The immediate cause was the decision of a contest war with the Syrians concerning the city of Caesarea. The Romans Jews maintained that this city belonged to them, because it had been built by Herod; and the Syrians pretended that it had always been reckoned a Greek city, since even that monarch had reared temples and statues in it. The contest at last came to such an height, that both parties took up arms against each other. Felix put an end to it for a time, by sending some of the chiefs of each nation to Rome, to plead their cause before the emperor, where it hung in suspense till this time, when Nero decided it against the Jews. No sooner was this decision made public, than the Jews in all parts of the country flew to arms; and though they were everywhere the sufferers, yet, from this fatal period, their rage never abated. Nothing was now to be heard of but robberies, murders, and every kind of cruelty. Cities and villages were filled with dead bodies of all ages, even sucking babes. The Jews, on their part, spared neither Syrians nor Romans, where they got the better of them; and this terribly proved the destruction of great numbers of their peace-maligned, full brethren: 20,000 were massacred at Caesarea, 50,000 at Alexandria, 2000 at Ptolemais, and 3500 at Jerusalem.\n\nA great number of assassins, in the mean time, having joined the factious Jews in Jerusalem, they beat the Romans out of Antonia, a fortress adjoining to the temple, and another called Maffada; and likewise out of the towers called Phasa\u00ebl and Mariamne, killing all who opposed them. The Romans were at last reduced to such straits, that they capitulated on the single condition that their lives should be spared; notwithstanding which, they were all massacred by the furious zealots; and this treachery was soon revenged on the faithful Jews of Scythopolis. These had offered to assist in reducing their factious brethren; but their sincerity being suspected by the townsmen, they obliged them to retire into a neighbouring wood, where, on the third night, they were massacred to the number of 13,000, and all their wealth carried off. The rebels, in the mean time, crossed the Jordan, and took the fortresses of Macharoth and\nand Cyprus; which last they razed to the ground, after having put all the Romans to the sword.\u2014This brought C\u00e6lius Galus, the Syrian governor, into Judea with all his forces; but the Jews, partly by treachery and partly by force, got the better of him, and drove him out of the country with the loss of 5000 men.\n\nAll this time such dreadful dissensions reigned among the Jews, that great numbers of the better sort forefeeling the fatal effects of the resentment of the Romans, left the city as men do a sinking vessel; and the Christians, mindful of their Saviour's prediction, retired to Pella, a city on the other side of Jordan, whither the war did not reach. Miserable was the fate of such as either could not, or would not, leave that devoted city. Vespasian was now ordered to leave Greece, where he was at that time, and to march with all speed into Judea. He did so accordingly at the head of a powerful army, ordering his son Titus in the mean time to bring two more legions from Alexandria; but before he could reach that country, the Jews had twice attempted to take the city of Afulon, and were each time repulsed with the loss of 10,000 of their number. In the beginning of the year 68, Vespasian entered Galilee at the head of an army of 60,000 men, all completely armed and excellently disciplined. He first took and burnt Gadera; then he laid siege to Jotapa, and took it after a stout resistance; at which he was so provoked, that he caused every one of the Jews to be massacred or carried into captivity, not one being left to carry the dreadful news to their brethren. Forty thousand perished on this occasion: only 1200 were made prisoners, among whom was Josephus the Jewish historian. Japha next shared the same fate, after an obstinate siege; all the men being massacred, and the women and children carried into captivity. A week after this, the Samaritans, who had assembled on Mount Gerizim, were almost all put to the sword, or perished. Joppa fell the next victim to the Roman vengeance. It had been formerly laid waste by C\u00e6lius; but was now repeopled and fortified by the sedulous Jews who infested the country. It was taken by storm, and shared the same fate with the rest. Four thousand Jews attempted to escape by taking to their ships; but were driven back by a sudden tempest, and all of them were drowned or put to the sword. Tarichea and Tiberias were next taken, but part of their inhabitants were spared on account of their peaceable dispositions. Then followed the sieges of Gamala, Gischala, and Itabry. The first was taken by storm, with a dreadful slaughter of the Jews; the last by stratagem. The inhabitants of Gischala were inclinable to surrender; but a sedulous Jew of that town, named John, the son of Levi, head of the faction, and a vile fellow, opposed it; and, having the mob at his back, overawed the whole city. On the Sabbath he begged of Titus to forbear hostilities till to-morrow, and then he would accept his offer; but instead of that, he fled to Jerusalem with as many as would follow him. The Romans, as soon as they were informed of his flight, pursued, and killed 6000 of his followers on the road, and brought back near 3000 women and children prisoners. The inhabitants then surrendered to Titus; and only the factious were punished; and this completed the reduction of Galilee.\n\nThe Jewish nation by this time was divided into different very opposite parties: the one foreseeing that factions this war, if continued, must end in the total ruin among the of their country, were for putting an end to it by submitting to the Romans; the other, which was the remains of the faction of Judas Gaulonites, breathed nothing but war and confusion, and opposed all peaceable measures with invincible obstinacy. This last, which was by far the most numerous and powerful, consisted of men of the vilest and most profligate characters that can be paralleled in history. They were proud, ambitious, cruel, rapacious, and committed the most horrid and unnatural crimes under the mask of religion. They affirmed everywhere, that it was offering the greatest dishonour to God to submit to any earthly potentate; much less to Romans and to heathens. This, they said, was the only motive that induced them to take up arms, and to bind themselves under the strictest obligations not to lay them down till they had either totally extirpated all foreign authority, or perished in the attempt.\u2014This dreadful dissension was not confined to Jerusalem, but had infected all the cities, towns, and villages, of Palestine. Even houses and families were so divided against each other, that, as our Saviour had expressly foretold, a man's greatest enemies were often those of his own family and household. In short, if we may believe Josephus, the zealots acted more like incarnate devils than like men who had any sense of humanity left them.\u2014This obliged the contrary party likewise to rise up in arms in their own defence against those miscreants; from whom, however, they suffered much more than they did even from the exasperated Romans.\u2014The zealots began their outrages by murdering all that opposed them in the countries round about. Then they entered Jerusalem; but met with a stout opposition from the other party headed by Ananus, who had lately been high-priest. A fierce engagement ensued between them; and the zealots were driven into the inner cincture of the temple, where they were closely besieged. John of Gischala above-mentioned, who had pretended to side with the peaceable party, was then sent with terms of accommodation; but, instead of advising the besieged to accept of them, he persuaded them still to hold out, and call the Idumeans to their assistance. They did so, and procured 20,000 of them to come to their relief; but these new allies were refused admittance into the city. On that night, however, there happened such a violent storm, accompanied with thunder, lightning, and an earthquake, that the zealots from within the inner court saw the bolts and hinges of the temple-gates without being heard, forced the guards of the besiegers, fell into the city, and led in the Idumeans. The city was instantly filled with butcheries of the most horrid kind. Barely to put any of the opposite party to death was thought too mild a punishment; they must have the pleasure of murdering them by inches: so that they made it now their diversion to put them to the most exquisite tortures that could be invented; nor could they be prevailed upon to dispatch them till the violence of their torments had rendered them quite.\nquite incapable of feeling them. In this manner perished 12,000 persons of noble extraction, and in the flower of their age; till at last the Idumeans complained so much against the putting such numbers to death, that the zealots thought proper to erect a kind of tribunal, which, however, was intended not for judgment but condemnation: for the judges having once acquitted a person who was manifestly innocent, the zealots not only murdered him in the temple, but depoed the new-created judges as persons unfit for their office.\n\nThe zealots, after having exterminated all those of any character or distinction, began next to wreak their vengeance on the common people. This obliged many of the Jews to forsake Jerusalem, and take refuge with the Romans, though the attempt was very hazardous; for the zealots had all the avenues well guarded, and failed not to put to death such as fell into their hands. Vespaian in the mean time stood at C\u00e6sarea an idle spectator of their outrages; well knowing that the zealots were fighting for him, and that the strength of the Jewish nation was gradually wasting away. Everything succeeded to his will. The zealots, after having massacred or driven away the opposite party, turned their arms against each other. A party was formed against John, under one Simon who had his head-quarters at the fortresses of Maffada. This new miscreant plundered, burned, and massacred, wherever he came, carrying the spoil into the fortresses above-mentioned. To increase his party, he caused a proclamation to be published, by which he promised liberty to the slaves, and proportionable encouragement to the freemen who joined him. This stratagem had the desired effect, and he soon saw himself at the head of a considerable army. Not thinking himself, however, as yet master of force sufficient to besiege Jerusalem, he invaded Idumea with 20,000 men. The Idumeans opposed him with 25,000; and a sharp engagement ensued, in which neither party was victorious. But Simon, soon after, having corrupted the Idumean general, got their army delivered up to him. By this means he easily became master of the country; where he committed such cruelties, that the miserable inhabitants abandoned it to seek for shelter in Jerusalem.\n\nIn the city, matters went in the same way. John tyrannized in such a manner, that the Idumeans revolted, killed a great number of his men, plundered his palace, and forced him to retire into the temple. In the mean time the people, having taken a notion that he would fall out in the night and set fire to the city, called a council, in which it was resolved to admit Simon with his troops, in order to oppose John and his zealots. Simon's first attempt against his rival, however, was ineffectual, and he was obliged to content himself with besieging the zealots in the temple. In the mean time, the miseries of the city were increased by the starting up of a third party headed by one Eleazar, who seized on the court of the priests, and kept John confined within that of the Israelites. Eleazar kept the avenues so well guarded, that none were admitted to come into that part of the temple but those who came thither to offer sacrifices; and it was by these offerings chiefly that he maintained himself and his men. John by this means found himself hemmed in between two powerful enemies, Simon below, and Eleazar above. He defended himself, however, against them both with great resolution; and when the city was invested by the Romans, having pretended to come to an agreement with his rivals, he found means totally to cut off or force Eleazar's men to submit to him, so that the factions were again reduced to two.\n\nThe Romans, in the year 72, began to advance towards the capital. In their way they destroyed many thousands, wasting the country as they went along; and in the year 73 arrived before the walls of Jerusalem, under Titus afterwards emperor. As he was a man of an exceedingly merciful disposition, and greatly desired to spare the city, he immediately sent offers of peace; but these were rejected with contempt, and he himself put in great danger of his life, so that he resolved to begin the siege in form. In the mean time, Simon and John renewed their hostilities with greater fury than ever. John now held the whole temple, some of the out-parts of it, and the valley of Cedron. Simon had the whole city to range in; in some parts of which John had made such devastations, that they served them for a field of battle, from which they fell in unanimously against the common enemy whenever occasion served; after which they returned to their usual hostilities, turning their arms against each other, as if they had sworn to make their ruin more easy to the Romans. These drew still nearer to the walls, having with great labour and pains levelled all the ground between Scopas and them, by pulling down all the houses and hedges, cutting down the trees, and even cleaving the rocks that stood in their way, from Scopas to the tomb of Herod, and Bethara or the pool of serpents; in which work so many hands were employed, that they finished it in four days.\n\nWhilst this was doing, Titus sent the besieged some offers of peace; and Josephus was pitched upon to be the messenger of them: but they were rejected with indignation. He sent a second-time Nicanor and Josephus with fresh offers, and the former received a wound in his shoulder; upon which Titus resolved to begin the assault in good earnest, and ordered his men to raze the suburbs, cut down all the trees, and use the materials to raise platforms against the wall. Every thing was now carried on with invincible ardour; the Romans began to play their engines against the city carried on with all their might. The Jews had likewise their machines upon the walls, which they plied with uncommon fury: they had taken them lately from Caesius: but were so ignorant in their use, that they did little execution with them, till they were better instructed by some Roman deserters: till then, their chief success was rather owing to their frequent fallies; but the Roman legions, who had all their towers and machines before them, made terrible havoc. The least stones they threw were near 100 weight; and these they could throw the length of a quarter of a mile against the city, and with such a force, that they could do mischief on those that stood at some distance behind them. Titus had reared three towers 50 cubits high; one of which happening to fall in the middle of the night, greatly alarmed the Roman camp, who immediately ran to arms at the noise of it; but Titus, upon knowing the cause, dismissed them, and caused it\nit to be set up again. These towers, being plated with iron, the Jews tried in vain to set fire to them, but were at length forced to retire out of the reach of their shot; by which the battering-rams were now at full liberty to play against the wall. A breach was soon made in it, at which the Romans entered: and the Jews, abandoning this last inclosure, retired behind the next. This happened about the 28th of April, a fortnight after the beginning of the siege.\n\nJohn defended the temple and the castle of Antonia, and Simon the rest of the city. Titus marched close to the second wall, and plied his battering-rams so furiously, that one of the towers, which looked towards the north, gave a prodigious shake. The men who were in it, made a signal to the Romans, as if they would surrender; and, at the same time, sent Simon word to be ready to give them a warm reception. Titus, having discovered their stratagem, plied his work more furiously, whilst the Jews that were in the tower set it on fire, and flung themselves into the flames. The tower being fallen, gave them an entrance into the second inclosure, five days after gaining the first; and Titus, who was bent on saving the city, would not suffer any part of the wall or streets to be demolished; which left the breach and lanes so narrow, that when his men were furiously repulsed by Simon, they had not room enough to make a quick retreat, so that there was a number of them killed in it. This oversight was quickly rectified; and the attack renewed with such vigour, that the place was carried four days after their first repulse.\n\nThe famine, raging in a terrible manner in the city, was soon followed by a pestilence; and as these two dreadful judgments increased, so did the rage of the factious, who, by their intestine feuds, had destroyed such quantities of provision, that they were forced to prey upon the people with the most unheard-of cruelty. They forced their houses; and, if they found any victuals in them, they butchered them for not appropriating them to it; and, if they found nothing but bare walls, which was almost everywhere the case, they put them to the most severe tortures, under pretence that they had some provision concealed. \"I should (says Josephus) undertake an impossible task, were I to enter into a detail of all the cruelties of those impious wretches; it will be sufficient to say, that I do not think, that since the creation any city every suffered such dreadful calamities, or abounded with men so fertile in all kinds of wickedness.\"\n\nTitus, who knew their miserable condition, and was still willing to spare them, gave them four days to cool; during which he caused his army to be quartered, and provisions to be distributed to them in sight of the Jews, who flocked upon the walls to see it. Josephus was sent to speak to them afresh, and to exhort them not to run themselves into an inevitable ruin by obstinately persisting in the defence of a place which could hold out but a very little while, and which the Romans looked upon already as their own. But this stubborn people, after many bitter invectives, began to dart their arrows at him; at which, not at all discouraged, he went on with greater vehemence: but all the effect it wrought on them was, that it prevailed on great numbers to steal away privately to the Romans, whilst the rest became only the more desperate and resolute to hold out to the last, in spite of Titus's merciful offers.\n\nTo hasten therefore their destined ruin, he caused the city to be surrounded with a strong wall, to prevent either their receiving any succours or provision from abroad, or their escaping his resentment by flight. This wall, which was near 40 stadia or five miles in circuit, was yet carried on with such speed, and by so many hands, that it was finished in three days; by which one may guess at the ardour of the besiegers to make themselves masters of the city.\n\nThere was now nothing to be seen through the streets of Jerusalem but heaps of dead bodies rotting above-ground, walking skeletons, and dying wretches. As many as were caught by the Romans in their sallies, Titus caused to be sacrificed in sight of the town, to strike terror among the rest; but the zealots gave it out, that they were those who fled to him for protection; which when Titus understood, he sent a prisoner with his hands cut off to undeceive, and assure them, that he spared all that voluntarily came over to him; which encouraged great numbers to accept his offers, though the avenues were closely guarded by the factious, who put all to death who were caught going on that errand. A greater mischief than that was, that even those who escaped safe to the Roman camp were miserably butchered by the soldiers, from a notion which these had taken that they had swallowed great quantities of gold; so that two thousand of them were ripped up in one night, to come at their supposed treasure. When Titus was apprised of this barbarity, he would have condemned all those butchering wretches to death; but they proved so numerous, that he was forced to spare them, and contented himself with sending a proclamation through his camp, that as many as should be suspected thenceforward of that horrid villainy, should be put to immediate death: yet did not this deter many of them from it, only they did it more privately than before; so greedy were they of that bewitching metal. All this while the defection increased, fill more through the inhumanity of the faction within, who made the miseries and dying groans of their starving brethren the subject of their cruel mirth, and carried their barbarity even to the sheathing of their swords in those poor wretches, under pretence of trying their sharpnesses.\n\nWhen they found therefore that neither their guards nor severities could prevent the people's flight, they had recourse to another stratagem equally impious and cruel: which was, to hire a pack of vile pretenders to prophecy, to go about and encourage the despairing remains of the people to expect a speedy and miraculous deliverance; and this imposture proved a greater expedient with that infatuated nation than their other precautions.\n\nNothing could be more dreadful than the famished condition to which they were now reduced. The poor, having nothing to trust to but the Roman's mercy or a speedy death, ran all hazards to get out of the city; and if in their flight, and wandering out for herbs or any other sustenance, they fell into the hands of any of Titus's parties sent about to guard the avenues, they were unmercifully scourged, and crucified if they made the least resistance. The rich within the walls were now\nnow forced, though in the most private manner, to give half, or all they were worth, for a measure of wheat, and the middling sort for one of barley. This they were forced to convey into some private place in their houses, and to feed upon it as it was, without daring to pound or grind it, much less to boil or bake it, lest the noisel or smell should draw the rapacious zealots to come and tear it from them. Not that these were reduced to any real want of provisions, but they had a double end in this barbarous plunder; to wit, the starving what they cruelly styled useless useless persons, and the keeping their own stores in reserve. It was upon this sad and pinching juncture, that an unhappy mother was reduced to the extremity of butchering and eating her own child.\n\nWhen this news was spread through the city, the horror and consternation were as universal as they were inexplicable. It was then that they began to think themselves forsaken by the Divine Providence, and to expect the most terrible effects of his anger against the poor remains of their nation; insomuch that they began to envy those that had perished before them, and to wish their turn might come before the sad expected catastrophe. Their fears were but too just; since Titus, at the very first hearing of this inhuman deed, swore the total extirpation of city and people. \"Since (said he) they have so often refused my offers of pardon, and have preferred war to peace, rebellion to obedience, and famine, such a dreadful one especially, to plenty, I am determined to bury that accursed metropolis under its ruins, that the sun may never shoot his beams on a city where the mothers feed on the flesh of their children, and the fathers, no less guilty than they, choose to drive them to such extremities, rather than lay down their arms.\"\n\nThe dreadful action happened about the end of July, by which time the Romans, having pursued their attacks with fresh vigour, made themselves masters of the fortress Antonia; which obliged the Jews to set fire to those lately galleries which joined it to the temple, lest they should afford an easy passage to the besiegers into this last. About the same time Titus, with much difficulty, got materials for raising new mounds and terraces, in order to hasten the siege, and save, if possible, the sad remains of that once glorious structure; but his pity proved still worse and worse bestowed on those obstinate wretches, who only became the more furious and desperate by it. Titus at length caused fire to be set to the gates, after having had a very bloody encounter, in which his men were repulsed with loss. The Jews were so terrified at it, that they suffered themselves to be devoured by the flames, without attempting either to extinguish them or save themselves. All this while Josephus did not cease exhorting the infatuated people to surrender, to represent to them the dreadful consequences of an obstinate resistance, and to assure them that it was out of mere compassion to them that he thus hazarded his own life to save theirs: he received one day such a wound in his head by a stone from the battlements, as laid him for dead on the ground. The Jews fell immediately, to have seized on his body: but the Romans proved too quick and strong for them, and carried him off.\n\nBy this time the two factions within, but especially that of John, having plundered rich and poor of all they had, fell also on the treasury of the temple, whence John took a great quantity of golden utensils, together with those magnificent gifts which had been presented to that sacred place by the Jewish kings, by Augustus, Livia, and many other foreign princes, and melted them all to his own use. The repositories of the sacred oil which was to maintain the lamps, and of the wine which was referred to accompany the usual sacrifices, were likewise seized upon, and turned into common use; and the last of this to such excess, as to make himself and his party drunk with it. All this while, not only the zealots, but many of the people, were still under such an infatuation, that though the fortress Antonia was lost, and nothing left but the temple, which the Romans were preparing to batter down, yet they could not persuade themselves that God would suffer that holy place to be taken by heathens, and were still expecting some sudden and miraculous deliverance. Even that vile minister John, who commanded there, either seemed confident of it, or else endeavoured to make them think him so. For, when Josephus was sent for the last time to upbraid his obstinately exposing that sacred building, and the miserable remains of God's people, to sudden and sure destruction, he only answered him with bitterest invectives; adding, that he was defending the Lord's vineyard, which he was sure could not be taken by any human force. Josephus in vain reminded him of the many ways by which he had polluted both city and temple; and in particular of the seas of blood which he caused to be shed in both those sacred places, and which, he assured him from the old prophecies, were a certain sign and forerunner of their speedy surrender and destruction. John remained as inflexible as if all the prophets had assured him of a deliverance; till at length Titus, foreseeing the inevitable ruin of that stately edifice, which he was still extremely desirous to save, vouchsafed even himself to speak to them, and to persuade them to surrender. But the factious, looking upon this condemnation as the effects of his fear rather than generosity, only grew the more furious upon it, and forced him at last to come to those extremes which he had hitherto endeavoured to avoid. That his army, which was to attack the temple, might have the freer passage towards it through the castle Antonia, he caused a considerable part of the wall to be pulled down and levelled; which proved so very strong, that it took him up seven whole days, by which time they were far advanced in the month of July.\n\nIt was on the 17th day of that month, as all Josephus's copies have it, that the daily sacrifice ceased for sacrifice in the first time since its restoration by the brave Judas Maccabeus, there being no proper person left in the temple to offer it up. Titus caused the factious to be severely upbraided for it; exhorted John to set up whom he would to perform that office, rather than suffer the service of God to be set aside; and then challenged him and his party to come out of the temple, and fight on a more proper ground, and thereby save that sacred edifice from the fury of the Roman troops. When nothing could prevail on them, they began to set fire again to the gallery which formed a communication between the temple and the castle Antonia. The Jews\nJews had already burnt about 20 cubits of it in length; but this second blaze, which was likewise encouraged by the besieged, consumed about 14 more; after which, they beat down what remained standing. On the 27th of July, the Jews, having filled part of the western portico with combustible matter, made a kind of flight; upon which, some of the forwardest of the Romans having scaled up to the top, the Jews set fire to it, which flamed with such sudden fury, that many of the former were consumed in it, and the rest, venturing to jump down from the battlements, were, all but one, crushed to death.\n\nOn the very next day, Titus having set fire to the north gallery, which inclosed the outer court of the temple, from Fort Antonia to the valley of Cedron, got an easy admittance into it, and forced the besieged into that of the priests. He tried in vain five days to batter down one of the galleries of that precinct with an helepolis; he was forced to mount his battering-rams on the terrace, which was raised by this time; and yet the strength of this wall was such, that it eluded the force of these also, though others of his troops were busy in fapping it. When they found that neither rams nor fapping could gain ground, they betook themselves of scaling; but were vigorously repulsed in the attempt, with the loss of some standards, and a number of men. When Titus therefore found that his desire of saving that building was like to cost too many lives, he set fire to the gates, which, being plated with silver, burnt all that night, whilst the metal dropped down in the melting. The flame soon communicated itself to the porticoes and galleries; which the besieged beheld without offering to stop it, but contented themselves with sending whole volleys of impotent curses against the Romans. This was done on the eighth of August; and, on the next day, Titus, having given orders to extinguish the fire, called a council, to determine whether the remainder of the temple should be saved or demolished. That general was still for the former, and most of the rest declared for the latter; alleging, that it was no longer a temple, but a scene of war and slaughter, and that the Jews would never be at rest as long as any part of it was left standing; but when they found Titus stiffly bent on preserving so noble an edifice, against which he told them he could have no quarrel, they all came over to his mind. The next day, August the 10th, was therefore determined for a general assault; and the night before the Jews made two desperate fallies on the Romans; in the last of which, these, being timely succoured by Titus, beat them back into their inclosure.\n\nBut whether this last Jewish effort exasperated the besiegers, or, which is more likely, as Josephus thinks, pushed by the hand of Providence, one of the Roman soldiers, of his own accord, took up a blazing firebrand, and, getting on his comrade's shoulders, threw it into one of the apartments that surrounded the sanctuary, through a window. This immediately let the whole north side in a flame up to the third story, on the same fatal day and month in which it had been formerly burnt by Nebuchadnezzar. Titus, who was gone to rest himself a while in his pavilion, was awaked at the noise, and ran immediately to give orders to have the fire extinguished. He called, prayed, threatened, and even caused his men, but in vain; the confusion was so great, and the soldiers so obstinately bent upon destroying all that was left, that he was neither heard nor minded. Those that flocked thither from the camp, instead of obeying his orders, were busy, either in killing the Jews, or in increasing the flames. When Titus observed that all his endeavours were vain, he entered into the sanctuary and the most holy place, in which he found still such sumptuous utensils and other riches as even exceeded all that had been told him of it. Out of the former he saved the golden candelstick, the table of shew-bread, the altar of perfumes, all of pure gold, and the book or volume of the law, wrapped up in a rich gold tunic: but in the latter he found no utensils, because, in all probability, they had not made a fresh ark since that of Solomon had been lost. Upon his coming out of that sacred place, some other soldiers set fire to it, and obliged those that had stood behind to come out; they all fell foul on the plunder of it, tearing even the gold plating off the gates and timber work, and carried off all the costly utensils, robes, &c. they found, inasmuch that there was not one of them who did not enrich himself by it.\n\nAn horrid massacre followed soon after, in which a dreadful great many thousands perished; some by the flames, massacre, others by the fall from the battlements, and a greater number by the enemy's sword, which destroyed all it met with, without distinction of age, sex, or quality. Among them were upwards of 6000 persons who had been seduced thither by a false prophet, who promised them that they should find a speedy and miraculous relief there on that very day. Some of them remained five whole days on the top of the walls, and afterwards threw themselves on the general's mercy; but were answered that they had outlaid the time, and were led to execution. The Romans carried their fury to the burning of all the treasure-houses of the place, though they were full of the richest furniture, plate, vestments, and other things of value, which had been laid up in those places for security. In a word, they did not cease burning and butchering, till they had destroyed all, except two of the temple-gates, and that part of the court which was destined for the women.\n\nIn the mean time the seditious made such a vigorous push, that they escaped the fury of the Romans, at least for the present, and retired into the city. But here they found all the avenues so well guarded, that there was no possibility left for them to get out; which obliged them to secure themselves as well as they could on the south side of it, from whence Simon, and John of Gischala, sent to desire a parley with Titus. They were answered, that though they had been the cause of all this bloodshed and ruin, yet they should have their lives spared, if they laid down their arms and surrendered themselves prisoners. To this they replied, that they had engaged themselves, by the most solemn oaths, never to surrender; and therefore, only begged leave to retire into the mountains with their wives and children: which insolence so exasperated the Roman general, that he caused a herald to bid them stand to their defence; for that not one of them should be spared, since they had rejected his last offers of pardon. Immediately after this, he abandoned\nJews\n\ndenied the city to the fury of the soldiers, who fell forthwith on plundering, setting fire everywhere, and murdering all that fell into their hands; whilst the factious, who were left, went and fortified themselves in the royal palace, where they killed 8000 Jews who had taken refuge there.\n\nIn the mean time, great preparations were making for a vigorous attack on the upper city, especially on the royal palace; and this took them up from the 26th of August to the 7th of September, during which time great numbers came and made their submission to Titus. The warlike engines then played so furiously on the factious, that they were taken with a sudden panic; and, instead of fleeing to the towers of Hippicus, Phala\u00ebl, or Mariamne, which were yet untaken, and so strong that nothing but famine could have reduced them, they ran like madmen towards Siloah, with a design to have attacked the wall of circumvallation, and to have escaped out of the city; but, being there repulsed, they were forced to go and hide themselves in the public finks and common sewers, some one way and some another. All whom the Romans could find were put to the sword, and the city was set on fire. This was on the eighth of September, when the city was taken and entered by Titus. He would have put an end to the massacre; but his men killed all, except the most vigorous, whom they shut up in the porch of the women just mentioned. Fronto, who had the care of them, referred the youngest and most beautiful for Titus's triumph; and sent all that were above seventeen years of age into Egypt, to be employed in some public works there; and a great number of others were sent into several cities of Syria, and other provinces, to be exposed on the public theatre, to exhibit fights, or be devoured by wild beasts. The number of those prisoners amounted to 97,000, besides about 11,000 more, who were either starved through neglect, or starved themselves through fullness and despair.\u2014The whole number of Jews who perished in this war is computed at upwards of 1,400,000.\n\nBesides these, however, a vast number perished in caves, woods, wildernesses, common-fews, &c. of whom no computation could be made. Whilst the soldiers were still busy in burning the remains of the city, and visiting all the hiding-places, where they killed numbers of poor creatures who had endeavoured to evade their cruelty, the two grand rebels Simon and John were found, and referred for the triumph of the conqueror. John, being pinched with hunger, soon came out; and having begged his life, obtained it; but was condemned to perpetual imprisonment. Simon, whose retreat had been better stored, held out till the end of October. The two chiefs, with 700 of the handsomest Jewish captives, were made to attend the triumphal chariot; after which Simon was dragged through the streets with a rope about his neck, severely scourged, and then put to death; and John was sent into perpetual imprisonment.\u2014Three castles still remained untenanted, namely, Herodion, Macheron, and Massada. The two former capitulated; but Massada held out. The place was exceedingly strong both by nature and art, well stored with all kinds of provisions, and defended by a numerous gar-\n\nrison of zealots, at the head of whom was one Eleazar, the grandson of Judas Gaulonites, formerly mentioned. The Roman general having in vain tried his engines and battering-rams against it, bethought himself of surrounding it with a high and strong wall, and then ordered the gates to be set on fire. The wind pushed the flames so fiercely against the Jews, that Eleazar in despair persuaded them first to kill their wives and children, and then to choose ten men by lot, who should kill all the rest; and lastly one out of the surviving ten to dispatch them and himself; only this last man was ordered to set fire to the place before he put an end to his own life. All this was accordingly done; and on the morrow, when the Romans were preparing to scale the walls, they were greatly surprized neither to see nor hear any thing more. On this they made such an hideous outcry, that two women, who had concealed themselves in an aqueduct, came forth and acquainted them with the desperate catastrophe of the besieged.\n\nThus ended the Jewish nation and worship; nor have they ever since been able to regain the final loss of the destruction in the country of Judea, nor indeed in any nation of other country on earth, though there is scarce any part their city of the globe where they are not to be found. They continue their vain expectations of a Messiah to deliver them from the low estate into which they are fallen; and, notwithstanding their repeated disappointments, there are few who can ever be persuaded to embrace Christianity. Their ceremonies and religious worship ought to be taken from the law of Moses; but they have added a multitude of absurdities not worth the inquiring after. In many countries, and in different ages, they have been terribly massacred, and in general have been better treated by the Mahometans and Pagans than by Christians. Since the revival of arts and learning, however, they have felt the benefit of that increase of humanity which has diffused itself almost over the globe. It is said, that in this country the life of a Jew was formerly at the disposal of the chief lord where he lived, and likewise all his goods. So strong also were popular prejudices and suspicions against them, that in the year 1348, a fatal endemic distemper raging in a great part of Europe, it was said that they had poisoned the springs and wells; in consequence of which a million and a half of them were cruelly massacred. In 1492, half a million of them were driven out of Spain, and 150,000 from Portugal. Edward I. did the same. In short, they were everywhere persecuted, oppressed, and most rigorously treated.\n\nIn this enlightened period a more generous system is followed. France has allowed them the rights of citizens, which induces numbers of the most wealthy Jews to fix their residence in that country. Poland granted them very great privileges and immunities; England, Holland, and Prussia tolerate and protect them; and the emperor has revoked some restrictions, for which an edict was passed: Spain, Portugal, and some of the Italian states, are still, however, it is said, averse to their dwelling among them.","sp":157,"ep":174},{"h":"JEZIDES","t":"among the Mahometans; a term of familiar import with heretics among Christians.\n\nThe Jezides are a numerous sect inhabiting Turkey\nand Persia, so called from their head Jezid, an Arabian prince, who flew the sons of Ali, Mahomet's father in law; for which reason he is reckoned a paricide, and his followers heretics. There are about 20,000 Jezides in Turkey and Perha; who are of two sorts, black and white. The white are clad like Turks; and distinguished only by their shirts, which are not lit at the neck like those of others, but have only a round hole to thrust their heads through. This is in memory of a golden ring, or circle of light, which descended from heaven upon the neck of their chief, the head of their religion, after his undergoing a fast of forty days. The black Jezides, though married, are the monks or religious of the order; and these are called Fakirs.\n\nThe Turks exact excessive taxes from the Jezides, who hate the Turks as their mortal enemies; and when, in their wrath, they curse any creature, they call it mufilman: but they are great lovers of the Christians, being more fond of Jesus Christ than of Mahomet, and are never circumcised but when they are forced to it. They are extremely ignorant, and believe both the bible and the koran without reading either of them: they make vows and pilgrimages, but have no places of religious worship.\n\nAll the adoration they pay to God consists of some songs in honour of Jesus Christ, the virgin, Moses, and sometimes Mahomet; and it is a principal point of their religion never to speak ill of the devil, lest he should resent the injury, if ever he should come to be in favour with God again, which they think possible; whenever they speak of him, they call him the angel Peacock. They bury their dead in the first place they come at, rejoicing as at a festival, and celebrating the entry of the deceased into heaven. They go in companies like the Arabians, and change their habitations every 15 days. When they get wine, they drink it to excess; and it is said, that they sometimes do this with a religious purpose, calling it the blood of Christ. They bury their wives; and the market-price is 200 crowns for all women, handsome or not, without distinction.","sp":174,"ep":175},{"h":"JEZRAEL","t":"or Jezreel, a town in the north of Samaria, towards Mount Carmel, where stood a palace of the kings of Israel, (1 Kings xxi. 18.)

This boom, which is nothing more than a continuation of the bowsprit forward, to which it may be considered as a top-mast, is usually attached to the bowsprit by means of two large boom-irons, or by one boom iron, and a cap on the outer end of the bowsprit; or, finally, by the cap without and a strong lashing within, instead of a boom iron, which is generally the method of securing it in small merchant-ships. It may therefore be drawn in upon the bowsprit as occasion requires; which is usually practised when the ship enters a harbour, where it might very soon be broken or carried away, by the vessels which are moored therein, or passing by under sail.\n\nJIBBEL or Gebbel Aurey, the Mons Auratus of the middle age, an assemblage of many very rocky mountains in Africa, in the kingdom of Algiers.

They are called Neardia; and each of them has a Greek cross in the middle between the eyes, marked with antimony. They are divided into tribes, but, unlike the other Arabs, have huts in the mountains built of mud and straw; and are, by our author, supposed to be a remnant of the Vandals. He even thinks that they may be descended from the remainder of an army of Vandals mentioned by Procopius, which was defeated among these mountains. They live in perpetual war with the Moors, and boast that their ancestors were Christians. They pay no taxes.","sp":177,"ep":178},{"h":"JIDDA","t":"a town of Arabia, situated, according to Mr Bruce, in N. Lat. 28\u00b0 1' E., Long. 39\u00b0 16' 55\", while others make it 21\u00b0 28', and E. Long. 39\u00b0 22'. It is situated in a very unwholesome, barren, and desert part of the country. Immediately without the gate to the eastward is a desert plain filled with the huts of the Bedouins or country Arabs, built of long bundles of spartum or bent-grass put together like fascines. These people supply the town with milk and butter. \"There is no stirring out of the town (says Mr Bruce) even for a walk, unless for about half a mile on the south side by the sea, where there is a number of stinking pools of stagnant water, which contributes to make the town very unwholesome.\"\n\nFrom the disagreeable and inconvenient situation of this port, it is probable, that it would have been long ago abandoned, had it not been for its vicinity to Mecca, and the vast annual influx of wealth occasioned by the India trade; which, however, does not continue, but passes on to Mecca, whence it is dispersed all over the east. The town of Jidda itself receives but little advantage, for all the customs are immediately sent to the needy and rapacious sherif of Mecca and his dependents. \"The gold (says Mr Bruce) is returned in bags and boxes, and passes on as rapidly to the ships as the goods do to the market, and leaves as little profit behind. In the mean time provisions rise to a prodigious price, and this falls upon the townsmen, while all the profit of the traffic is in the hands of strangers; most of whom, after the market is over (which does not last six weeks), retire to Yemen and other neighbouring countries, which abound in every sort of provision.\n\nFrom this scarcity, Mr Bruce supposes it is that polygamy is less common here than in any other part of Arabia. \"Few of the inhabitants of Jidda (says our author) can avail themselves of the privilege granted by Mahomet. He cannot marry more than one wife, because he cannot maintain more; and from this cause arises the want of people and the number of unmarried women.\"\n\nThe trade at Jidda is carried on in a manner which appeared very strange to our traveller. \"Nine ships (says he) were there from India; some of them worth, I suppose 200,000l. One merchant, a Turk, living at Mecca, 30 hours journey off, where no Christian dares go, whilst the continent is open to the Turk for escape, offers to purchase the cargoes of four out of these nine ships himself; another of the same cast comes and says he will buy none unless he has them all. The samples are shown, and the cargoes of the whole nine ships are carried into the wildest parts of Arabia by men with whom one would not wish to trust himself alone in the field. This is not all; two India brokers come into the room to settle the price; one on the part of the India captain, the other on that of the buyer the Turk. They are neither Mahomets nor Christians, but have credit with both. They sit down on the carpet, and take an India shawl which they carry on their shoulder like a napkin, and spread it over their hands. They talk in the mean time indifferent conversation, as if they were employed in no serious business whatever. After about 20 minutes spent in handling each other's fingers below the shawl, the bargain is concluded, say for nine ships, without one word ever having been spoken on the subject, or pen or ink used in any shape whatever. There never was one instance of a dispute happening in these sales. But this is not all; the money is yet to be paid. A private Moor, who has nothing to support him but his character, becomes responsible for the payment of these cargoes. This man delivers a number of coarse hessian bags full of what is supposed to be money. He marks the contents upon the bag, and puts his seal upon the string that ties the mouth of it. This is received for what is marked upon it without any one ever having opened one of the bags; and in India it is current for the value marked upon it as long as the bag lasts.\n\nThe port of Jidda is very extensive, and contains numberless shoals, small islands, and sunk rocks, with deep channels, however, between them; but in the harbour itself ships may ride secure, whatever wind blows. The only danger is in the coming in or going out; but as the pilots are very skilful, accidents are never known to happen. The charts of this harbour, as Mr Bruce informs us, are exceedingly erroneous. While he laid here, he was desired by Captain Thornhill to make a new chart of the harbour; but finding that it had been undertaken by another gentleman, Captain Newland, he dropped it. He argues in the strongest terms against the old maps, which he says can be of no use, but the contrary; and he gives it as a characteristic of the Red Sea, \"scarce to have foundings in any part of the channel, and often on both sides; whilst ashore, foundings are hardly found a boat length from the main. To this, says he, I will add, that there is scarce one island on which I ever was, where the bowspirit was not over the land, while there were no foundings by a line heaved over the stern. Of all the vessels in Jidda, only two had their log-lines properly divided, and yet all were so fond of their supposed accuracy, as to aver they had kept their course within five leagues between India and Babelmandel. Yet they had made no estimation of the currents without the straits, nor the different very strong ones soon after passing Socotra; their half-minute glasses, upon a medium, ran 57 seconds; they had made no observations on the tides or currents in the Red Sea, either in the channel or in the inward passage; yet there is delineated in this map a chart of Captain Newland's, which he kept in the middle of the channel, full of sharp angles and short stretches; you would think every yard was measured and founded!\"\n\nJIG.

They are four in number; of which the following is an account, extracted from Halhed's Preface to the Code of Gentoo Laws, p. xxxvi.\n\n1. The Suttee Jogue (or age of purity) is said to have lasted three million two hundred thousand years; and they hold that the life of man was extended in that age to one hundred thousand years, and that his stature was 21 cubits.\n\n2. The Tirtah Jogue (in which one-third of mankind was corrupted) they suppose to have continued of two million four hundred thousand years, and men lived to the age of ten thousand years.\n\n3. The Dwapaar Jogue (in which half of the human race became depraved) endured one million six hundred thousand years, and the life of man was then reduced to a thousand years.\n\n4. The Collee Jogue (in which all mankind are corrupted, or rather lessened, for that is the true meaning of Collee) is the present era, which they suppose ordained to fulfill four hundred thousand years, of which near five thousand are already past; and the life of man in that period is limited to one hundred years.\n\nConcerning the Indian chronology, we have already had occasion to be pretty copious; see HINDOOS, No. 19, 22. We shall here, however, subjoin Dr Robertson's observations on the above periods, from the Notes to his Historical Disquisition concerning India.\n\n\"If (says he *) we suppose the computation of time * p. 360, in the Indian chronology to be made by solar or even by lunar years, nothing can be more extravagant in itself, or more repugnant to our mode of calculating the duration of the world, founded on sacred and infallible authority. From one circumstance, however, which merits attention, we may conclude, that the informa-\ntion which we have hitherto received concerning the chronology of the Hindoos is very incorrect. We have, as far as I know, only five original accounts of the different Jogue or eras of the Hindoos. The first is given by M. Rogers who received it from the Brahmins on the Coromandel coast. According to it, the Suttee Jogue is a period of one million seven hundred and twenty-eight thousand years; the Tirtah Jogue is one million two hundred and ninety-six thousand years; the Dwapaa Jogue is eight hundred and sixty-four thousand. The duration of the Collee Jogue he does not specify; (Porte Ouverte, p. 179.). The next is that of M. Bernier, who received it from the Brahmins of Benares. According to him, the duration of the Suttee Jogue was two million five hundred thousand years; that of the Tirtah Jogue, one million two hundred thousand years; that of the Dwapaa Jogue is eight hundred and sixty-four thousand years. Concerning the period of the Collee Jogue, he likewise is silent; (Voyager, tom. ii. p. 163.). The third is that of Colonel Dow; according to which the Suttee Jogue is a period of fourteen million of years, the Tirtah Jogue one million eighty thousand, the Dwapaa Jogue seventy-two thousand, and the Collee Jogue thirty-five thousand years; (Hist. of Hindost., vol. i. p. 2.). The fourth account is that of M. le Gentil, who received it from the Brahmins of the Coromandel coast; and as his information was acquired in the same part of India, and derived from the same source with that of M. Roger, it agrees with his in every particular; (Mem. de l'Academ. des Sciences pour 1772, tom. ii. part i. p. 176.). The fifth is the account of Mr Halhed, which has been already given. From this discrepancy, not only of the total numbers, but of many of the articles in the different accounts, it is manifest that our information concerning Indian chronology is hitherto as uncertain as the whole system of it is wild and fabulous. To me it appears highly probable, that when we understand more thoroughly the principles upon which the fictitious eras or jogues of the Hindoos have been formed, that we may be more able to reconcile their chronology to the true mode of computing time, founded on the authority of the Old Testament; and may likewise find reason to conclude, that the account given by their astronomers of the situation of the heavenly bodies at the beginning of the Collee Jogue, is not established by actual observation, but the result of a retrospective calculation.","sp":328,"ep":329},{"h":"JOHN","t":"St, the Baptist, the forerunner of Jesus Christ, was the son of Zacharias and Elizabeth.

Some time after, having reproved Herod Antipas, who had a criminal correspondence with Herodias his brother Philip's wife, he was cast into prison, where he was beheaded.

After the death of Domitian, he returned to Ephesus, where he composed his Gospel, about the year 95; and died there, in the reign of Trajan, about the year 100, aged 94.\n\nGospel of St John, a canonical book of the New Testament, containing a recital of the life, actions, doctrine, and death, of our Saviour Jesus Christ, written by St John the apostle and evangelist.\n\nSt John wrote his Gospel at Ephesus, after his return from the isle of Patmos, at the desire of the Christians of Asia. St Jerome says, he would not undertake it, but on condition that they should appoint a public fast to implore the affluence of God; and that, the fast being ended, St John, filled with the Holy Ghost, broke out into these words: \"In the beginning was the Word,\" &c. The ancients assign two reasons for this undertaking: the first is, because, in the other three Gospels, there was wanting the history of the beginning of Jesus Christ's preaching, till the imprisonment of John the Baptist, which therefore he applied himself particularly to relate. The second reason was, in order to remove the errors of the Cerinthians, Ebionites, and other sects. But Mr Lampe and Dr Lardner have urged several reasons to show that St John did not write against Cerinthus or any other heretics in his Gospel.\n\nRevelation of St John. See Apocalypse.\n\nJohn of Salisbury, bishop of Chartres in France, was born at Salisbury in Wiltshire, in the beginning of the 12th century. Where he imbibed the rudiments of his education, is unknown; but we learn, that in the year 1136, being then a youth, he was sent to Paris, where he studied under several eminent professors, and acquired considerable fame for his application and proficiency in rhetoric, poetry, divinity, and particularly in the learned languages. Thence he travelled to Italy; and, during his residence at Rome, was in high favour with Pope Eugenio III. and his successor Adrian IV. After his return to England, he became the intimate friend and companion of the famous Thomas Becket, archbishop of Canterbury, whom he attended in his exile, and is said to have been present when that haughty prelate was murdered in his cathedral. What preferment he had in the church during this time, does not appear; but in 1176 he was promoted by King Henry II. to the bishopric of Chartres in France, where he died in 1182. This John of Salisbury was really a phenomenon. He was one of the first reformers.\nrefiners of the Greek and Latin languages in Europe; a classical scholar, a philosopher, a learned divine, and an elegant Latin poet. He wrote several books; the principal of which are, his Life of St Thomas of Canterbury, a collection of letters, and Polycraticon.\n\nPope John XXII, a native of Cahors, before called James d'Euze, was well skilled in the civil and canon law; and was elected pope after the death of Clement V. on the 7th of August 1316. He published the constitutions called Clementines, which were made by his predecessor; and drew up the other constitutions called Extravagantes. Lewis of Bavaria being elected emperor, John XXII opposed him in favour of his competitor; which made much noise, and was attended with fatal consequences. That prince, in 1329, caused the antipope Peter de Corbiero, a cordelier, to be elected, who took the name of Nicholas V. and was supported by Michael de Celenne, general of his order; but that antipope was the following year taken and carried to Avignon, where he begged pardon of the pope with a rope about his neck, and died in prison two or three years after. Under this pope arose the famous question among the cordeliers, called the bread of the cordeliers; which was, Whether those monks had the property of the things given them, at the time they were making use of them? for example, Whether the bread belonged to them when they were eating it, or to the pope, or to the Roman church? This frivolous question gave great employment to the pope; as well as those which turned upon the colour, form, and stuff, of their habits, whether they ought to be white, gray, or black; whether the cowl ought to be pointed or round, large or small; whether their robes ought to be full, short, or long; of cloth, or of serge, &c. The disputes on all these minute trifles were carried so far between the minor brothers, that some of them were burned upon the occasion.

He was born at Westminster in 1574, and was educated at the public school there under the great Camden. He was descended from a Scottish family; and his father, who lost his estate under Queen Mary, dying before our poet was born, and his mother marrying a bricklayer for her second husband, Ben was taken from school to work at his father-in-law's trade. Not being captivated with this employment, he went into the Low Countries, and distinguished himself in a military capacity. On his return to England, he entered himself at St John's college, Cambridge; and having killed a person in a duel, was condemned, and narrowly escaped execution. After this he turned actor; and Shakespeare is said to have first introduced him to the world, by recommending a play of his to the stage, after it had been rejected. His Alchymist gained him such reputation, that in 1619 he was, at the death of Mr Daniel, made poet-laureate to King James I. and master of arts at Oxford. As we do not find Johnson's economical virtues anywhere recorded, it is the less to be wondered at, that after this we find him petitioning King Charles, on his accession, to enlarge his father's allowance of 100 merks into pounds; and quickly after we learn that he was very poor and sick, lodging in an obscure alley; on which occasion it was, that Charles, being prevailed on in his favour, sent him ten guineas; which Ben receiving laid, \"His majesty has sent me ten guineas, because I am poor, and live in an alley; go and tell him, that his soul lives in an alley.\" He died in August 1637, aged 63 years, and was buried in Westminster-Abbey. The most complete edition of his works was printed in 1756, in 7 vols 8vo.\n\nJohnson, Dr Samuel, who has been styled the brightest ornament of the 18th century, was born in the city of Litchfield in Staffordshire, on the 18th of September S. S. 1729. His father Michael was a bookseller; and must have had some reputation in the city, as he more than once bore the office of chief magistrate. By what cautious reasoning he reconciled his conscience to the oaths required to be taken by all who occupy such stations, cannot now be known; but it is certain that he was zealously attached to the exiled family, and instilled the same principles into the youthful mind of his son. So much was he in earnest in this work, and at so early a period did he commence it, that when Dr Sacheverel, in his memorable tour through England, came to Litchfield, Mr Johnson carried his son, not then quite three years old, to the cathedral, and placed him on his shoulders, that he might see as well as hear the far-famed preacher.\n\nBut political prejudices were not the only bad things which young Sam inherited from his father: he derived from the same source a morbid melancholy, which, though it neither depraved his imagination, nor clouded his perspicuity, filled him with dreadful apprehensions of infancy, and rendered him wretched through life.\nJohnson's life. From his nurse he contracted the *serofula* or king's evil, which made its appearance at a very early period, disfigured a face naturally well-formed, and deprived him of the sight of one of his eyes.\n\nWhen arrived at a proper age for grammatical instruction, he was placed in the free school of Litchfield, of which one Mr Hunter was then master; a man whom his illustrious pupil thought \"very severe, and wrong-headedly severe,\" because he would beat a boy for not answering questions which he could not expect to be asked. He was, however, a skilful teacher; and Johnson, when he stood in the very front of learning, was sensible how much he owed to him; for upon being asked how he had acquired so accurate a knowledge of the Latin tongue, he replied, \"My master beat me very well; without that, Sir, I should have done nothing.\"\n\nAt the age of 15 Johnson was removed from Litchfield to the school of Stourbridge in Worcestershire, at which he remained little more than a year, and then returned home, where he stood two years without any settled plan of life or any regular course of study. He read, however, a great deal in a deftful manner, as chance threw books in his way, and as inclination directed him through them; so that when in his 19th year he was entered a commoner of Pembroke college, Oxford, his mind was stored with a variety of such knowledge as is not often acquired in universities, where boys seldom read any books but what are put into their hands by their tutors. He had given very early proofs of his poetical genius both in his school exercises and in other occasional compositions: but what is perhaps more remarkable, as it shows that he must have thought much on a subject on which other boys of that age seldom think at all, he had before he was 14 entertained doubts of the truth of revelation. From the melancholy of his temper these would naturally prey upon his spirits, and give him great uneasiness: but they were happily removed by a proper course of reading; for \"his studies being honest, ended in conviction. He found that religion is true; and what he had learned, he ever afterwards endeavoured to teach.\"\n\nConcerning his residence in the university and the means by which he was there supported, his two principal biographers contradict each other; so that these are points of which we cannot write with certainty. According to Sir John Hawkins, the time of his continuance at Oxford is divisible into two periods: Mr Bofwell represents it as only one period, with the usual interval of a long vacation. Sir John says, that he was supported at college by Mr Andrew Corbet in quality of assistant in the studies of his son: Mr Bofwell affirms us, that though he was promised pecuniary aid by Mr Corbet, that promise was not in any degree fulfilled. We should be inclined to adopt the knight's account of this transaction, were it not palpably inconsistent with itself. He says, that the two young men were entered in Pembroke on the same day; that Corbet continued in the college two years; and yet that Johnson was driven home in little more than one year, because by the removal of Corbet he was deprived of his pension. A story, of which one part contradicts the other, cannot wholly be true. Sir John adds, that \"meeting with another source, the bounty, as it is supposed, of some one or more of the members of the cathedral of Lichfield, he returned to college, and made up the whole of his residence in the university about three years.\" Mr Bofwell has told us nothing but that Johnson, though his father was unable to support him, continued three years in college, and was then driven from it by extreme poverty.\n\nThese gentlemen differ likewise in their accounts of Johnson's tutors. Sir John Hawkins says that he had two, Mr Jordan and Dr Adams. Mr Bofwell affirms that Dr Adams could not be his tutor, because Jordan did not quit the college till 1731; the year in the autumn of which Johnson himself was compelled to leave Oxford. Yet the same author represents Dr Adams as saying, \"I was Johnson's nominal tutor, but he was above my mark;\" a speech of which it is not easy to discover the meaning, if it was not Johnson's duty to attend Adams's lectures. In most colleges we believe there are two tutors in different departments of education; and therefore it is not improbable that Jordan and Adams may have been tutors to Johnson at the same time, the one in languages, the other in science. Jordan was a man of such mean abilities, that though his pupil loved him for the goodness of his heart, he would often risk the payment of a small fine, rather than attend his lectures; nor was he studious to conceal the reason of his absence. Upon occasion of one such impossession, he said, \"Sir, you have foisted me twopence for non-attendance at a lecture not worth a penny.\" For some transgression or absence his tutor imposed upon him as a Christmas exercise the task of translating into Latin verse Pope's *Messian*; which being shown to the author of the original, was read and returned with this encomium, \"The writer of this poem will leave it a question for posterity, whether his or mine be the original.\" The particular course of his reading while in college, and during the vacation which he passed at home, cannot be traced. That at this period he read much, we have his own evidence in what he afterwards told the king; but his mode of study was never regular, and at all times he thought more than he read. He informed Mr Bofwell, that what he read *folly* at Oxford was Greek, and that the study of which he was most fond was metaphysics.\n\nIt was in the year 1731 that Johnson left the university without a degree; and as his father, who died in the month of December of that year, had suffered great misfortunes in trade, he was driven out a commoner of nature, and excluded from the regular modes of profit and prosperity. Having therefore no only a profession but the means of subsistence to seek, he accepted, in the month of March 1732, an invitation to the office of under-master of a free school at Market Bosworth in Leicestershire: but not knowing, as he said, whether it was more disagreeable for him to teach or for the boys to learn the grammar-rules, and being likewise disgusted at the treatment which he received from the patron of the school, he relinquished in a few months a situation which he ever afterwards recollected with horror. Being thus again without any fixed employment, and with very little money in his pocket, he translated *Lobo's voyage to Abyssinia*, for the trifling sum, it is said, of five guineas, which he received from a bookeller in Birmingham.\nJohnson. Birmingham. This was the first attempt which it is certain he made to procure pecuniary assistance by means of his pen; and it must have held forth very little encouragement to his commencing author by profession.\n\nIn 1735, being then in his 26th year, he married Mrs Porter, the widow of a mercer in Birmingham; whose age was almost double his; whose external form, according to Garrick and others, had never been captivating; and whose fortune amounted to hardly 800l. That she had a superiority of understanding and talents is extremely probable, both because she certainly inspired him with a more than ordinary passion, and because she was herself so delighted with the charms of his conversation as to overlook his external disadvantages, which were many and great. He now set up a private academy; for which purpose he hired a large house well situated near his native city; but his name having then nothing of that celebrity which afterwards commanded the attention and respect of mankind, this undertaking did not succeed. The only pupils who are known to have been placed under his care, were the celebrated David Garrick, his brother George Garrick, and a young gentleman of fortune whose name was Offely. He kept his academy only a year and a half; and it was during that time that he constructed the plan and wrote a great part of his tragedy of Irene.\n\nThe respectable character of his parents and his own merit had secured him a kind reception in the best families at Litchfield; and he was particularly distinguished by Mr Walmley register of the ecclesiastical court, a man of great worth and of very extensive and various erudition. That gentleman, upon hearing part of Irene read, thought so highly of Johnson's abilities as a dramatic writer, that he advised him by all means to finish the tragedy and produce it on the stage. To men of genius the stage holds forth temptations almost irresistible. The profits arising from a tragedy, including the representation and printing of it, and the connections which it sometimes enables the author to form, were in Johnson's imagination ineffinable. Flattered, it may be supposed, with these hopes, he set out some time in the year 1737 with his pupil David Garrick for London, leaving Mrs Johnson to take care of the house and the wreck of her fortune. The two adventurers carried with them from Mr Walmley an earnest recommendation to the reverend Mr Collon, then master of an academy, and afterwards Lucasian professor of mathematics in the university of Cambridge; but from that gentleman it does not appear that Johnson found either protection or encouragement.\n\nHow he spent his time upon his first going to London is not particularly known. His tragedy was refused by the managers of that day; and for some years the Gentleman's Magazine seems to have been his principal resource for employment and support. To enumerate his various communications to that far-famed miscellany, would extend this article beyond the limits which we can afford. Suffice it to say, that his connection with Cave the proprietor became very close; that he wrote prefaces, essays, reviews of books, and poems; and that he was occasionally employed in correcting the papers written by other correspondents.\n\nWhen the complaints of the nation against the administration of Sir Robert Walpole became loud, and a motion was made, February 13, 1742-3, to remove him from his majesty's councils forever, Johnson was pitched upon by Cave to write what was in the Magazine intitled Debates in the Senate of Lilliput, but was understood to be the speeches of the most eminent members in both houses of parliament. These orations, which induced Voltaire to compare British with ancient eloquence, were hastily sketched by Johnson while he was not yet 32 years old, while he was little acquainted with life, while he was struggling, not for distinction but for existence. Perhaps in none of his writings has he given a more conspicuous proof of a mind prompt and vigorous almost beyond conception: for they were compiled from scanty notes taken by illiterate persons employed to attend in both houses; and sometimes he had nothing communicated to him but the names of the several speakers, and the part which they took in the debate.\n\nHis separate publications which at this time attracted the greatest notice were, \"London, a Poem in imitation of Juvenal's third Satire;\" \"Marmor Norfolcense,\" or an Essay on an ancient prophetical Inscription in Monkfish Rhyme, lately discovered near Lynne in Norfolk;\" and \"A complete Vindication of the Licencers of the Stage from the malicious and scandalous allegations of Mr Brook author of Gutavus Vasa.\" The poem, which was published in 1738 by Doddery, is universally known and admired as the most spirited instance in the English language of ancient sentiments adapted to modern topics. Pope, who then filled the poetical throne without a rival, being informed that the author's name was Johnson, and that he was an obscure person, replied, \"he will soon be dethroned.\" The other two pamphlets, which were published in 1739, are filled with keen satire on the government; and though Sir John Hawkins has thought fit to declare that they display neither learning nor wit, Pope was of a different opinion; for in a note of his preserved by Mr Boswell, he says, that \"the whole of the Norfolk prophecy is very humorous.\"\n\nMrs Johnson, who went to London soon after her husband, now lived sometimes in one place and sometimes in another, sometimes in the city and sometimes at Greenwich: but Johnson himself was oftener to be found at St John's Gate, where the Gentleman's Magazine was published, than in his own lodgings. It was there that he became acquainted with Savage, with whom he was induced, probably by the similarity of their circumstances, to contract a very close friendship; and such were their extreme necessities, that they have often wandered whole nights in the street for want of money to procure them a lodging. In one of these nocturnal rambles, when their distress was almost incredible, so far were they from being depressed by their situation, that in high spirits and brimful of patriotism, they traversed St James's Square for several hours, inveighed against the minister; and, as Johnson said in ridicule of himself, his companion, and all such patriots, \"resolved that they would stand by their country!\" In 1744, he published the life of his unfortunate companion; a work which, had he never written anything else, would have placed him very high.\nhigh in the rank of authors (a). His narrative is remarkably smooth and well disposed; his observations are just, and his reflections disclose the most recesses of the human heart.\n\nIn 1749, when Drury-lane theatre was opened under the management of Garrick, Johnson wrote a prologue for the occasion; which for just dramatic criticism on the whole range of the English stage, as well as for poetical excellence, is confessedly unrivalled. But this year is, in his life, distinguished as the epoch when his arduous and important work, the Dictionary of the English Language, was announced to the world by the publication of its plan or prospectus, addressed to the earl of Chesterfield. From that nobleman Johnson was certainly led to expect patronage and encouragement; and it seems to be equally certain that his lordship expected, when the book should be published, to be honoured with the dedication. The expectations of both were disappointed. Lord Chesterfield, after seeing the lexicographer once or twice, suffered him to be repulsed from his door; but afterwards thinking to conciliate him when the work was upon the eve of publication, he wrote two papers in \"The World,\" warmly recommending it to the public. This artifice was seen through; and Johnson, in very polite language, rejected his lordship's advances, letting him know, that he was unwilling the public should consider him as owing to a patron that which Providence had enabled him to do for himself. This great and laborious work its author expected to complete in three years; but he was certainly employed upon it seven; for we know that it was begun in 1747, and the last sheet was sent to the press in the end of the year 1754. When we consider the nature of the undertaking, it is indeed astonishing that it was finished so soon, since it was written, as he says, \"with little assistance of the learned, and without any patronage of the great; nor in the soft obscurities of retirement, or under the shelter of academic bowers, but amidst inconvenience and distraction, in sickness and in sorrow.\" The sorrow, to which he here alludes, is probably that which he felt for the loss of his wife, who died on the 11th of March O.S. 1752, the loss of whom he continued to lament as long as he lived.\n\nThe Dictionary did not occupy his whole time: for while he was pushing it forward, he fitted his tragedy for the stage; wrote the lives of several eminent men for the Gentleman's Magazine; published an Imitation of the 10th Satire of Juvenal, entitled \"The Vanity of human Wishes;\" and began and finished \"The Rambler.\" This last work is so well-known, that it is hardly necessary to say that it was a periodical paper, published twice a-week, from the 20th of March 1750 to the 14th of March 1752 inclusive: but to give our readers some notion of the vigour and promptitude of the author's mind, it may not be improper to observe, that notwithstanding the severity of his other labours, all the affluence which he received does not amount to five papers; and that many of the most masterly of those unequalled essays were written on the spur of the occasion, and never seen entire by the author till they returned to him from the press.\n\nSoon after the Rambler was concluded, Dr Hawkesworth projected \"The Adventurer\" upon a similar plan; and by the affluence of friends he was enabled to carry it on with almost equal merit. For a short time, indeed, it was the most popular work of the two; and the papers with the signature T, which are confessedly the most splendid in the whole collection, are now known to have been communicated by Johnson, who received for each the sum of two guineas. This was double the price for which he sold sermons to such clergymen as either would not or could not compose their own discourses; and of sermon-writing he seems to have made a kind of trade.\n\nThough he had exhausted, during the time that he was employed on the Dictionary, more than the sum for which the bookellers had bargained for the copy; yet by means of the Rambler, Adventurer, sermons, and other productions of his pen, he now found himself in greater affluence than he had ever been before; and as the powers of his mind, distended by long and severe exercise, required relaxation to restore them to their proper tone, he appears to have done little or nothing from the closing of the Adventurer till the year 1756, when he submitted to the office of reviewer in the Literary Magazine. Of his reviews by far the most valuable is that of Soame Jenyns's \"Free Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Evil.\" Never were wit and metaphysical acuteness more closely united than in that criticism, which exposes the weaknesses and holds up to contempt the reasonings of those vain mortals, who presumptuously attempt to grasp the scale of existence, and to form plans of conduct for the Creator of the universe.\n\nBut the furnishing of magazines, reviews, and even newspapers with literary intelligence, and authors of books with dedications and prefaces, was considered as an employment unworthy of Johnson. It was therefore propounded by the bookellers that he should give a new edition of the dramas of Shakespeare; a work which he had projected many years before, and of which he had published a specimen which was commended by Warburton. When one of his friends expressed a hope that this employment would furnish him with amusement and add to his fame, he replied, \"I look upon it as I did upon the Dictionary; it is all work; and my inducement to it is not love or desire of fame, but the want of money, which is the only motive to writing that I know of.\" He issued proposals, however, of considerable length; in which he showed that he knew perfectly what a variety of research such an undertaking required: but his indolence prevented him from pursuing it with diligence, and it was not published till many years afterwards.\n\nOn the 15th of April 1758 he began a new periodical paper entitled \"The Idler,\" which came out every Saturday.\n\n(a) From the merit of this work Mr Boswell has endeavoured to detract, by insinuating, that the person called Richard Savage was an impostor, and not the son of the earl of Rivers and the countess of Macclesfield. See our account of SAVAGE.\nJohnson. Saturday in a weekly newspaper, called \"the Universal Chronicle, or Weekly Gazette,\" published by Newberry. Of these essays, which were continued till the 5th of April 1760, many were written as hastily as an ordinary letter; and one in particular composed at Oxford was begun only half an hour before the departure of the post which carried it to London. About this time he had the offer of a living, of which he might have rendered himself capable by entering into orders. It was a rectory in a pleasant country, of such yearly value as would have been an object to one in much better circumstances; but sensible, as it is supposed, of the severity of his temper, he declined it, saying, \"I have not the requisites for the office, and I cannot in my conscience shear the flock which I am unable to feed.\"\n\nIn the month of January 1759 his mother died at the great age of 90; an event which deeply affected him, and gave birth to the first Idler, in which he laments, that \"the life which made his own life pleasant was at an end, and that the gate of death was shut upon his prospects.\" Soon afterwards he wrote his \"Rasselas Prince of Abyssinia;\" that with the profits he might defray the expense of his mother's funeral, and pay some debts which he had left. He told a friend, that he received for the copy 100l. and 25l. more when it came to a second edition; that he wrote it in the evenings of one week, sent it to the press in portions as it was written, and had never since read it over.\n\nHitherto, notwithstanding his various publications, he was poor, and obliged to provide by his labour for the wants of the day that was passing over him; but having been early in 1762 represented to the king as a very learned and good man without any certain provision, his majesty was pleased to grant him a pension, which Lord Bute, then first minister, assured him \"was not given for anything which he was to do, but for what he had already done.\" A fixed annuity of three hundred pounds, if it diminished his distress, increased his indolence; for as he constantly avowed that he had no other motive for writing than to gain money, as he had now what was abundantly sufficient for all his purposes, as he delighted in conversation, and was visited and admired by the witty, the elegant, and the learned, very little of his time was past in solitary study. Solitude was indeed his aversion; and that he might avoid it as much as possible, Sir Joshua Reynolds and he, in 1764, instituted a club, which existed long without a name, but was afterwards known by the title of the Literary Club. It consisted of some of the most enlightened men of the age, who met at the Turk's Head in Gerard-street, Soho, one evening in every week at seven, and till a late hour enjoyed \"the feast of reason and the flow of soul.\"\n\nIn 1765, when Johnson was more than usually oppressed with constitutional melancholy, he was fortunately introduced into the family of Mr Thrale, one of the most eminent brewers in England, and member of parliament for the borough of Southwark: and it is but justice to acknowledge, that to the affluence which Mr and Mrs Thrale gave him, to the shelter which their house afforded him for 16 or 17 years, and to the pains which they took to soothe or repel his uneasy fancies, the public is probably indebted for some of the most masterly as well as most popular works which he ever produced. At length, in the October of this year, he gave to the world his edition of Shakespeare, which is chiefly valuable for the preface, where the excellencies and defects of that immortal bard are displayed with such judgement, as must please every man whose taste is not regulated by the standard of fashion or national prejudice. In 1767 he was honoured by a private conversation with the king in the library at the queen's house; and two years afterwards, upon the establishment of the royal academy of painting, sculpture, &c. he was nominated professor of ancient literature; an office merely honorary, and conferred on him, as is supposed, at the recommendation of his friend the president.\n\nIn the variety of subjects on which he had hitherto exercised his pen, he had forborne, since the administration of Sir Robert Walpole, to meddle with the disputes of contending factions; but having seen with indignation the methods which, in the business of Mr Wilkes, were taken to work upon the populace, he published in 1770 a pamphlet, entitled \"The False Alarm;\" in which he alerts, and labours to prove by a variety of arguments founded on precedents, that the expulsion of a member of the house of commons is equivalent to exclusion, and that no such calamity as the subversion of the constitution was to be feared from an act warranted by usage, which is the law of parliament. Whatever may be thought of the principles maintained in this publication, it unquestionably contains much wit and much argument, expressed in the author's best style of composition; and yet it is known to have been written between eight o'clock on Wednesday night and twelve o'clock on the Thursday night, when it was read to Mr Thrale upon his coming from the house of commons. In 1771 he published another political pamphlet, entitled, \"Thoughts on the late transactions respecting Falkland's islands;\" in which he attacked Junius; and he ever afterwards delighted himself with the thought of having destroyed that able writer, whom he certainly surpassed in nervous language and pointed ridicule.\n\nIn 1773 he visited with Mr Botwell some of the most considerable of the Hebrides or Western Islands of Scotland, and published an account of his journey in a volume which abounds in extensive philosophical views of society, ingenious sentiments, and lively description, but which offended many persons by the violent attack which it made on the authenticity of the poems attributed to Ossian. For the degree of offence that was taken, the book can hardly be thought to contain a sufficient reason: if the antiquity of these poems be yet doubted, it is owing more to the conduct of their editor than to the violence of Johnson. In 1774, the parliament being dissolved, he addressed to the electors of Great Britain a pamphlet, entitled \"The Patriot;\" of which the design was to guard them from imposition, and teach them to distinguish true from false patriotism. In 1775 he published \"Taxation no tyranny;\" in answer to the resolutions and address of the American Congress. In this performance his admirer Mr Botwell cannot, he says, perceive that ability of argument or that felicity of expression for which on other occasions Johnson was so eminent. This is a singular criticism. To the alluded principle\nprinciple upon which the reasoning of the pamphlet rests many have objected, and perhaps their objections are well founded; but if it be admitted that \"the supreme power of every community has the right of requiring from all its subjects such contributions as are necessary to the public safety or public prosperity,\" it will be found a very difficult task to break the chain of arguments by which it is proved that the British parliament had a right to tax the Americans. As to the expression of the pamphlet, the reader, who adopts the maxim recorded in the \"Journal of a tour to the Hebrides,\" that a controversialist \"ought not to strike soft in battle,\" must acknowledge that it is uncommonly happy, and that the whole performance is one of the most brilliant as well as most correct pieces of composition that ever fell from the pen of its author. These essays drew upon him numerous attacks, all of which he heartily despised; for though it has been supposed that \"A letter addressed to Dr Samuel Johnson occasioned by his political publications\" gave him great uneasiness, the contrary is manifest, from his having, after the appearance of that letter, collected them into a volume with the title of \"Political Tracts by the author of the Rambler.\" In 1765 Trinity College Dublin had created him LL.D., by diploma, and he now received the same honour from the university of Oxford; an honour with which, though he did not boast of it, he was highly gratified. In 1777 he was induced, by a call of a very extraordinary nature, to exercise that humanity which in him was obedient to every call. Dr William Dodd, a clergyman, under sentence of death for the crime of forgery, found means to interest Johnson in his behalf, and procured from him two of the most energetic compositions of that kind ever seen; the one a petition from himself to the king, the other a like address from his wife to the queen. These petitions failed of success.\n\nThe principal bookellers in London having determined to publish a body of English poetry, Johnson was prevailed upon to write the lives of the poets, and give a character of the works of each. This task he undertook with alacrity, and executed it in such a manner as must convince every competent reader, that as a biographer and a critic, no nation can produce his equal. The work was published in ten small volumes, of which the first four came abroad 1778, and the others in 1781. While the world in general was filled with admiration of the stupendous powers of that man, who at the age of seventy-two, and labouring under a complication of diseases, could produce a work which displays so much genius and so much learning, there were narrow circles in which prejudice and resentment were fostered, and whence attacks of different sorts issued against him. These gave him not the smallest disturbance. When told of the feeble, though shrill, outcry that had been raised, he said\u2014\"Sir, I considered myself as entrusted with a certain portion of truth. I have given my opinion sincerely: let them show where they think me wrong.\"\n\nHe had hardly begun to reap the laurels gained by this performance, when death deprived him of Mr Thrale, in whose house he had enjoyed the most comfortable hours of his life; but it abated not in Johnson that care for the interests of those whom his friend had left behind him, which he thought himself bound to cherish, both in duty as one of the executors of his will, and from the nobler principle of gratitude. On this account, his visits to Streatham, Mr Thrale's villa, were for some time after his death regularly made on Monday and prolonged till Saturday, as they had been during his life; but they soon became less and less frequent, and he studiously avoided the mention of the place or the family. Mrs Thrale, now Piozzi, says indeed, that \"it grew extremely perplexing and difficult to live in the house with him when the matter of it was no more; because his dislikes grew capricious, and he could scarce bear to have any body come to the house whom it was absolutely necessary for her to see.\" The person whom she thought it most necessary for her to see may perhaps be guessed at without any superior share of sagacity; and if these were the visits which Johnson could bear, we are so far from thinking his dislikes capricious, though they may have been perplexing, that if he had acted otherwise, we should have blamed him for want of gratitude to the friend whose \"face for fifteen years had never been turned upon him but with respect or benignity.\"\n\nAbout the middle of June 1783 his constitution sustained a feverish shock than it had ever before felt, by a stroke of the palsy; so sudden and so violent, that it awakened him out of a sound sleep, and rendered him for a short time speechless. As usual, his recourse under this affliction was to piety, which in him was constant, sincere, and fervent. He tried to repeat the Lord's prayer first in English, then in Latin, and afterwards in Greek; but succeeded only in the last attempt; immediately after which he was again deprived of the power of articulation. From this alarming attack he recovered with wonderful quickness, but it left behind it some preludes of an hydropic affection; and he was soon afterwards seized with a spasmodic asthma of such violence that he was confined to the house in great pain, while his dropsy increased, notwithstanding all the efforts of the most eminent physicians in London and Edinburgh. He had, however, such an interval of ease as enabled him, in the summer 1784 to visit his friends at Oxford, Litchfield, and Athbourne in Derbyshire. The Roman religion being introduced one day as the topic of conversation when he was in the house of Dr Adams, Johnson said, \"If you join the Papists externally, they will not interrogate you strictly as to your belief in their tenets. No reasoning Papist believes every article of their faith. There is one side on which a good man might be persuaded to embrace it. A good man of a timorous disposition, in great doubt of his acceptance with God, and pretty credulous, might be glad of a church where there are so many helps to go to heaven. I would be a Papist if I could. I have fear enough; but an obstinate rationality prevents me. I shall never be a Papist unless on the near approach of death, of which I have very great terror.\"\n\nHis constant dread of death was indeed so great, that it astonished all who had access to know the piety of his mind and the virtues of his life. Attempts have been made to account for it in various ways; but doubts that is the true account which is given in the Olla Podrida, by an elegant and pious writer, who now adorns a high station in the church of England. \"That he\nshould not be conscious of the abilities with which Providence had blessed him was impossible. He felt his own powers; he felt what he was capable of having performed; and he saw how little, comparatively speaking, he had performed. Hence his apprehension on the near prospect of the account to be made, viewed through the medium of constitutional and morbid melancholy, which often excluded from his sight the bright beams of divine mercy.\" This, however, was the case only while death was approaching from some distance. From the time that he was certain it was near, all his fears were calmed; and he died on the 13th of December 1784, full of resignation, strengthened by faith, and joyful in hope.\n\nFor a just character of this great man our limits afford not room: we must therefore content ourselves with laying before our readers a very short sketch. His stature was tall, his limbs were large, his strength was more than common, and his activity in early life had been greater than such a form gave reason to expect: but he was subject to an infirmity of the convulsive kind, resembling the distemper called St Vitus's dance; and he had the seeds of many diseases found in his constitution, that a short time before his death he declared that he hardly remembered to have passed one day wholly free from pain. He possessed very extraordinary powers of understanding; which were much cultivated by reading, and still more by meditation and reflection. His memory was remarkably retentive, his imagination uncommonly vigorous, and his judgment keen and penetrating. He read with great rapidity, retained with wonderful exactness what he so easily collected, and possessed the power of reducing to order and system the scattered hints on any subject which he had gathered from different books. It would not perhaps be safe to claim for him the highest place, among his contemporaries, in any single department of literature; but, to use one of his own expressions, he brought more mind to every subject, and had a greater variety of knowledge ready for all occasions, than any other man that could be easily named.\u2014Though prone to superstition, he was in all other respects to remarkably incredulous, that Hogarth said while Johnston firmly believed the Bible, he seemed determined to believe nothing but the Bible. Of the importance of religion he had a strong sense, and his zeal for its interests were always awake, so that profaneness of every kind was abashed in his presence.\u2014The same energy which was displayed in his literary productions, was exhibited also in his conversation, which was various, striking, and instructive: like the sage in Raffelsas, he spoke, and attention watched his lips; he reasoned, and conviction closed his periods: when he pleaded, he could be the greatest sophist that ever contended in the lists of declamation; and perhaps no man ever equalled him in nervous and pointed repartees. His veracity, from the most trivial to the most solemn occasions, was strict even to severity: he scorned to embellish a story with fictitious circumstances; for what is not a representation of reality, he used to say, is not worthy of our attention. As his purse and his house were ever open to the indigent, so was his heart tender to those who wanted relief, and his soul was susceptible of gratitude and every kind impression. He had a roughness in his manner which subdued the fancy and terrified the meek: but it was only in his manner; for no man was more loved than Johnston by those who knew him; and his works will be read with veneration for their author as long as the language in which they are written shall be understood.","sp":329,"ep":336},{"h":"JOHNSTON","t":"Dr ARTHUR, was born at Caskieben, near Aberdeen, the seat of his ancestors, and probably was educated at Aberdeen, as he was afterwards advanced to the highest dignity in that university. The study he chiefly applied himself to was that of physic; and to improve himself in that science, he travelled into foreign parts. He was twice at Rome; but the chief place of his residence was Padua, in which university the degree of M.D. was conferred on him in 1610, as appears by a MS. copy of verses in the advocate's library in Edinburgh. After leaving Padua, he travelled through the rest of Italy, and over Germany, Denmark, England, Holland, and other countries; and at length settled in France; where he met with great applause as a Latin poet. He lived there 20 years, and by two wives had 13 children. After 24 years' absence, he returned into Scotland in 1632. It appears by the council books at Edinburgh, that the doctor had a suit at law before that court about that time. In the year following, it is very well known that Charles I. went into Scotland, and made Bishop Laud, then with him, a member of that council; and by this accident, it is probable, that acquaintance began between the doctor and that prelate, which produced his \"Psalterium Davidis Paraphrastum Poetica;\" for we find that, in the same year, the doctor printed a specimen of his Psalms at London, and dedicated them to his lordship.\n\nHe proceeded to perfect the whole, which took him up four years; and the first edition complete was published at Aberdeen in 1637, and at London the same year. In 1641, Dr Johnston being at Oxford, on a visit to one of his daughters who was married to a divine of the church of England in that place, was seized with a violent diarrhoea, of which he died in a few days, in the 54th year of his age, not without having seen the beginning of those troubles that proved fatal to his patron. He was buried in the place where he died; which gave occasion to the following lines of his learned friend Wedderburn in his Sapphira on the doctor's death:\n\nScotia maga, dole, tanti viduata sepulchro\nVatis: is Angligenis contigit altius honos\n\nIn what year Dr Johnston was made physician to the king does not appear: it is most likely that the archbishop procured him that honour at his coming into England in 1633, at which time he translated Solomon's Song into Latin elegiac verse, and dedicated it to his majesty. His Psalms were reprinted at Middleburgh, 1642; London, 1657; Cambridge, 1661; Amsterdam 1706; Edinburgh, by William Lauder, 1739; and last on the plan of the Delphin classics, at London, 1741, 8vo, at the expense of Auditor Benson, who dedicated them to his late majesty, and prefixed to this edition memoirs of Dr Johnston, with the testimonies of various learned persons. A labouring comparison between the two translations, of Buchanan and Johnston was printed the same year in English, in\nJoigny in 8vo, entitled, A Prefatory Discourse to Dr John-\nson's Psalms, &c. and A Conclusion to it. His transla-\ntions of the Te Deum, Creed, Decalogue, &c. were\nsubjoined to the Psalms.

He was at first put apprentice to a joiner; but early distinguished himself by his inclination to drawing or designing, and was particularly taken notice of for his skill in landscape-painting. This afterwards recommended him to the favour of William earl of Pembroke, who sent him abroad with a handsome allowance in order to perfect himself in that branch. He was no sooner at Rome, than he found himself in his proper sphere: he felt that nature had not formed him to decorate cabinets, but to design palaces. He dropt the pencil and conceived Whitehall. In the state of Venice he saw the works of Palladio, and learned how beautiful taste may be exerted on a less theatre than the capital of an empire. How his abilities distinguished themselves in a spot where they certainly had no opportunity to act, we are not told, though it would not be the least curious part of his history; certain it is, that, on the strength of his reputation at Venice, Christian IV invited him to Denmark, and appointed him his architect; but on what buildings he was employed in that country, we are yet to learn. James I. found him at Copenhagen, and Queen Anne took him in the quality of her architect to Scotland. He served Prince Henry in the same capacity, and the place of surveyor-general of the works was granted to him in reversion. On the death of that prince, with whom at least all his lamented qualities did not die, Jones travelled once more into Italy, and, afflicted by ripeness of judgment, perfected his taste. To the interval between these voyages Mr Walpole is inclined to assign those buildings of Inigo, which are less pure, and border too much upon the bastard style, which one may call King James's Gothic. Inigo's designs of that period are not Gothic, but have a littleness of parts, and a weight of ornaments, with which the revival of the Grecian taste was encumbered, and which he shook off in his grander designs. The surveyor's place fell, and he returned to England; and, as if architecture was not all he had learned at Rome, with an air of Roman disinterestedness he gave up the profits of his office, which he found extremely in debt; and prevailed upon the comptroller and paymaster to imitate his example, till the whole arrears were cleared.\n\nIn 1620, he was employed in a manner very unworthy of his genius: King James set him upon discovering, that is, gulling, who were the founders of Stonehenge. His ideas were all Romanized; consequently, his partiality to his favourite people, which ought rather to have prevented him from charging them with that mass of barbarous clumsiness, made him conclude it a Roman temple.\n\nIn the same year Jones was appointed one of the commissioners for the repair of St Paul's; but which was not commenced till the year 1633, when Laud, then bishop of London, laid the first stone, and Inigo the fourth. In the restoration of that cathedral, he made two capital faults. He first renewed the sides with very bad Gothic; and then added a Roman portico, magnificent and beautiful indeed, but which had no affinity with the ancient parts that remained, and made his own Gothic appear ten times heavier. He committed the same error at Winchester, thrusting a screen in the Roman or Grecian taste into the middle of that cathedral. Jones indeed was by no means successful when he attempted Gothic. The chapel of Lincoln's-Inn has none of the characteristics of that architecture. The cloister beneath seems oppressed by the weight of the building above.\n\nThe authors of the life of Jones place the erecting of the Banqueting-house in the reign of King Charles; but it appears, from the accounts of Nicholas Stone, that it was begun in 1619, and finished in two years\u2014a small part of the pile designed for the palace of our kings; but so complete in itself, that it stands a model of the most pure and beautiful taste. Several plates of the intended palace at Whitehall have been given; but Mr Walpole thinks, from no finished design. The four great sheets are evidently made up from general hints; nor could such a source of invention and taste as the mind of Inigo ever produce so much fancies. The whole fabric, however, was so glorious an idea, that one forgets for a moment (says Mr Walpole), in the regret for its not being executed, the confirmation of our liberties, obtained by a melancholy scene that passed before the windows of that very Banqueting-house.\n\nIn 1623 he was employed at Somerset-house, where a chapel was to be fitted up for the Infanta, the intended bride of the prince. The chapel is still in being. The front to the river, part only of what was designed, and the water-gate, were erected afterwards on the designs of Inigo, as was the gate at York-stairs.\n\nOn the accession of Charles, Jones was continued in\nhis posts under both king and queen. His fee as surveyor was \u00a33. 4d. a day, with an allowance of \u00a361 a-year for house-rent, besides a clerk, and incidental expenses. What greater rewards he had, are not upon record.\n\nDuring the prosperous state of the king's affairs, the pleasures of the court were carried on with much taste and magnificence. Poetry, painting, music, and architecture, were all called in to make them rational amusements. Mr Walpole is of opinion, that the celebrated festivals of Louis XIV. were copied from the shows exhibited at Whitehall, in his time the most polite court in Europe. Ben Johnson was the laureat; Inigo Jones the inventor of the decorations; Lanier and Farnolco composed the symphonies; the king, the queen, and the young nobility, danced in the interludes. We have accounts of many of those entertainments, called masques; they had been introduced by Anne of Denmark. Lord Burlington had a folio of the designs for these solemnities, by Inigo's own hand, consisting of habits, masks, scenes, &c. The harmony of these masks was a little interrupted by a war that broke out between the composers, Inigo and Ben, in which whoever was the aggressor, the turbulent temper of Johnson took care to be most in the wrong.\n\nThe works of Inigo Jones are not scarce; Surgeon's hall is one of his best works. One of the most admired is the arcade of Covent-garden, and the church: \"Two structures (says Mr Walpole), of which I want taste to see the beauties. In the arcade there is nothing remarkable; the pilasters are as arrant and homely stripes as any plasterer would make. The barn-roof over the portico of the church strikes my eyes with as little idea of dignity and beauty, as it could do if it covered nothing but a barn. It must be owned, that the defect is not in the architecture, but in the order.\u2014Whoever saw a beautiful Tuscan building? Would the Romans have chosen that order for a temple?\" The expense of building that church was \u00a3500.\n\nAmbrosebury in Wiltshire was designed by Jones, but executed by his scholar Webb. Jones was one of the first that observed the same diminution of pilasters as in pillars. Lindsey-house in Lincoln's-Inn Fields, which he built, owes its chief grace to this singularity. In 1618, a special commission was issued to the lord-chancellor, the earls of Worcester, Pembroke, Arundel, and others, to plant and reduce to uniformity, Lincoln's-Inn Fields, as it shall be drawn by way of map, or ground-plot, by Inigo Jones, surveyor-general of the works. That square is laid out with a regard to so trifling a singularity, as to be of the exact dimensions of one of the pyramids: this would have been admired in those ages when the keep at Kenilworth Castle was erected in the form of an horse-fetter, and the Escorial in the shape of St Laurence's gridiron.\n\nColehill in Berkshire, the seat of Sir Matthew Pleydell, built in 1650, and Cobham-hall in Kent, were Jones's. He was employed to rebuild Castle Ashby, and finished one front: but the civil war interrupted his progress there and at Stoke-park in Northamptonshire. Shaftesbury-house, now the London Lying-in hospital, on the east side of Aldergate-street, is a\n\nbeautiful front. The Grange, the seat of the lord chancellor Henley in Hampshire, is entirely of this master. It is not a large house, but by far one of the best proofs of his taste. The hall, which opens to a small vestibule with a cupola, and the staircase adjoining, are beautiful models of the purest and most classic antiquity. The gate of Beaufort-garden at Chelsea, designed by Jones, was purchased by Lord Burlington, and transported to Chilwick. He drew a plan for a palace at Newmarket; but not that wretched hovel that stands there at present. One of the most beautiful of his works is the queen's house at Greenwich. The first idea of the hospital is said to have been taken from his papers by his scholar Webb. Heriot's hospital in Edinburgh, and the improvements made in his time on Glamis castle in Forfarshire in Scotland, are specimens of the designs of Inigo Jones.\n\nInigo taunted early the misfortunes of his master. He was not only a favourite, but a Roman Catholic: in 1646 he paid \u00a345. for his delinquency and sequestration. Whether it was before or after this fine, it is uncertain, that he and Stone the mason buried their joint stock in Scotland yard; but an order being published to encourage the informers of such concealments, and four persons being privy to the spot where the money was hid, it was taken up, and reburied in Lambeth-marsh. Grief, misfortunes, and age, put an end to his life at Somerset-house, July 21, 1651. Several of his designs have been published by Mr Kent, Mr Colin Campbell, and Mr Isaac Ware. He left in MS. some curious notes on Palladio's architecture, which are inserted in an edition of Palladio published in 1714.\n\nJones, Sir William, the son of William Jones Esq., an eminent mathematician, contemporary with the great Newton, was born in London on the 28th of September 1746, and received the rudiments of his education at Harrow school, under the tuition of Dr Robert Sumner, whom he has celebrated in a eulogium which will probably be coeval with time. From Harrow school he went to University college, Oxford, where the rapidity of his literary acquisitions excited the admiration of all.\n\nHe travelled through France at the age of 23, taking up his residence for some time at Nice, where man, and the various forms of government, became the favourite objects of his investigation. A wish to relieve his mother from the burden of his education, made him long for a fellowship in his college, but having no immediate prospect of obtaining it, he in 1765 became tutor to young Lord Althorp, afterwards Earl Spencer, in which situation he was introduced to the best of company, and had also leisure to prosecute the acquisition of knowledge, and the farther cultivation of his intellectual powers, which were objects ever dear to him.\n\nHe obtained next year, the fellowship he expected, and was thus raised to a state which he could not help viewing as independent. Being at Spa with his pupil in the year 1767, he employed much of his time in making himself acquainted with the German language; and in the following year he was requested by the duke of Grafton's under-secretary, to undertake a translation of a Persian MS. of the life of Nadir Shah, into the French language, of which the king of Denmark was anxious.\nanxious to have a version. This, his first publication, appeared in 1770, with the addition of a treatise on oriental poetry, which was very much admired, on account of the elegance of the French style and the accuracy of the translation. For this excellent publication it appears that he received nothing more than a diploma from his Danish majesty, constituting him a member of the Royal Society of Copenhagen, with a warm recommendation to the notice of his own sovereign.\n\nThat he might be enabled to gratify his commendable ambition, he now began to think seriously of some profession through life; and, as he had conceived an early predilection for the law, he made that the object of his choice; and in the month of September 1770, he entered at the Temple. Yet the studies of his profession did not prevent him from making those literary advances, in which he took delight, and oriental literature still continued a favourite object. When the life of Zoroaster by Anquetil du Perron made its appearance, in the preliminary discourse to which the university of Oxford had been attacked, our author defended it in a pamphlet written with severity and with elegance. In 1772, he published a small volume of poems, being translations from the Asiatic poets, remarkable for the grace and brilliancy of their style; and in 1774 appeared his work \"De Poesi Afiatica,\" the beauty and purity of the Latin in which it is composed, exciting the admiration of men of literature both at home and abroad. He was called to the bar in the beginning of 1774, but declined to act in that capacity without a previous knowledge of the actual business of the profession. He was appointed a commissioner of bankrupts in 1776, about which period he addressed a letter to Lord Althorpe, in which he beautifully expresses his ardent wish to have constitutional liberty established by constitutional means.\n\nHis translation of the speeches of Iseus, on account of his elegant style, his profound critical and historical knowledge, commanded the admiration of every competent judge. Soon after this his practice at the bar increased with rapidity; but he had little reason to flatter himself with the prospect of advancement in professional rank and dignity, because he was known to be convinced of the injustice of the British cause respecting the American war, which he was at no pains to conceal; and therefore an opponent of the measures of those who had the direction of public affairs, had little pretension to look for. In 1780 he became a candidate to succeed to Sir Roger Newdigate as representative in parliament for the university of Oxford, in which he was respectfully supported; but his political sentiments were ill suited to secure him a majority, which made him decline the contest prior to the election. He soon after published a pamphlet entitled \"An Inquiry into the legal mode of suppressing riots, with a constitutional plan of future defence,\" recommending the propriety of making every citizen a soldier in cases of imminent danger. He next published a translation of seven ancient poems of the highest reputation in Arabia, which, with an ode on the marriage of Lord Althorpe, procured for him the highest reputation. His essay on the laws of bailments was also much admired, as was his speech at the London tavern.\n\nin defence of a parliamentary reform in 1782. At Paris, he drew up a dialogue between a farmer and a country gentleman on the principles of government, published in Wales by the dean of St Asaph, for which a bill of indictment was preferred against that clergyman. In a letter to Lord Kenyon, Mr Jones avowed himself to be the author, and asserted the principles it contained to be perfectly agreeable to the British constitution; but it appears that he afterwards relaxed considerably in his political ardour.\n\nAfter the resignation of Lord North, and appointment of Lord Shelburne, Mr Jones was nominated one of the judges in the British territories of India, an appointment which he had long wished for, as it would afford him an opportunity of prosecuting his favourite researches into oriental literature. He was chosen a judge in March 1783, and on the 20th of that month the honour of knighthood was conferred upon him. He arrived at Calcutta in September, and entered upon his office in December, opening the sessions with a very elegant charge to the grand jury. Here he planned the institution of a society similar to the Royal Society of London, many valuable labours and researches of which are already in the hands of the public. He collected materials for a complete digest of the Hindoo and Mahometan laws, which interesting work he did not live to bring to a conclusion. The publication of the \"Asiatic Researches\" occupied much of his attention.

As his father died in his infancy, he was educated by his eldest brother Benedict Jovius, under whom he became well skilled in classical learning; and then went to Rome, for the sake of enjoying the benefit of the Vatican library. He there wrote his first piece, De pilibus Romanis, which he dedicated to Cardinal Lewis of Bourbon. He received a pension of 500 crowns for many years from Francis I., king of France, whose favour he secured by his flatteries. But, in the following reign, having disgraced the contabale Montmorency, his name was struck out of the list of pensioners. Jovius did not suffer his spirits to sink under his misfortune: he had obtained a high reputation in the learned world by his writings; and having always showed great respect to the house of Medicis, on whose praises he had expatiated in his works, he applied to Clement VII. and obtained the bishopric of Nocera. His principal piece is his history, which is that of his own time throughout the world, beginning with 1494, and extending to the year 1544. This was the chief business of his life. For he formed the plan of it in the year 1515; and continued upon it till his death, which happened at Florence in 1552. It is printed in three volumes folio.

The father, who had provoked the goddess by killing her favourite stag, heard this with the greatest horror and indignation; and rather than to shed the blood of his daughter, he commanded one of his heralds, as chief of the Grecian forces, to order all the assembly to depart each to his respective home. Ulysses and the other generals interfered, and\nAgamemnon consented to imitate his daughter for the common cause of Greece. As Iphigenia was tenderly loved by her mother, the Greeks sent for her on pretence of giving her in marriage to Achilles. Clytemnestra gladly permitted her departure, and Iphigenia came to Aulis. Here she saw the bloody preparations for the sacrifice. She implored the forgiveness and protection of her father; but tears and entreaties were unavailing. Calchas took the knife in his hand; and as he was going to strike the fatal blow, Iphigenia suddenly disappeared, and a goat of uncommon size and beauty was found in her place for the sacrifice.

Lat. 48. 20. and W. Long. 124. The object of this survey was to discover a communication between the North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans; but none of the inlets or channels in this broken coast was found to extend more than 100 miles to the eastward of the entrance into the strait.\n\nThus it appeared, that the land forming the north side of that strait is part of an island, or of an archipelago, extending nearly 100 leagues in length from south-east to north-west; and on the side of this land, most distant from the continent, is situated Nootka sound. The most peculiar circumstance of this navigation is the extreme depth of water, when contrasted with the narrowness of the channels.\n\nThe people of Juan de Fuca are said to be well versed in the principles of trade, which they carry on in a very fair and honourable manner. The commodities most prized by them are copper, fire-arms, and great-coats. Their dress, besides skins, are a kind of woollen garments. According to Vancouver, the dogs belonging to this tribe of Indians are numerous, resembling those of Pomerania, though larger in general. The population even in the greatest towns or villages does not exceed 600, and the smallpox is reckoned to be a disease very fatal among them. Their method of disposing of their dead is singular. \"Baskets (says Vancouver) were found suspended on high trees, each containing the skeleton of a young child, some of which were also small square boxes filled with a kind of white paste, resembling such as I had seen the natives eat, supposed to be made of the same root: some of these boxes were quite full; others were nearly empty, eaten probably by the mice, squirrels, or birds.\"\n\nJuan, St. de la Frontera, a town of South America, in Chili, in the province of Chiquito, near the lake Guancho.

It produces sugar, rum, ginger, corn, and fruits; partly proper to the climate, and partly introduced from Spain. Besides, there are so many cattle, that they often kill them for the sake of the skins alone. Here are a great number of uncommon trees, and there is a little gold in the north part of the island. It is commonly said that the air is healthy; and yet the earl of Cumberland, when he had taken this island, lost most of his men by sickness; and for that reason was forced to abandon it. This happened in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. It is subject to storms and hurricanes, like the rest of these islands. It lies to the east of Hispaniola, at the distance of 30 miles.\n\nJuan de Porto Rico, the capital town of the island of Porto Rico, with a good harbour defended by several forts, and a bishop's see.

It was formerly a place of resort for the buccaneers who annoyed the western coast of the Spanish continent. They were led to resort hither from the multitude of goats which it nourished; to deprive their enemies of which advantage, the Spaniards transported a considerable number of dogs, which increasing greatly, have almost exterminated the goats, who now only find security among the steep mountains in the northern parts, which are inaccessible to their pursuers. There are instances of two men living, at different times, alone on this island for many years; the one a Mafquito Indian; the other Alexander Selkirk, a Scotchman, who was, after five years, taken on board an English ship, which touched here in about 1712, and brought back to Europe. From the history of this recluse, Daniel Defoe is said to have conceived the idea of writing the adventures of Robinson Crusoe. This island was very propitious to the remains of Commodore Anson's squadron in 1741, after having been buffeted with tempests, and debilitated by an inevitable scarcity, during a three months' passage round Cape Horn; they continued here three months; during which time the dying crews, who on their arrival could scarcely with one united effort heave the anchor, were restored to perfect health. Captain Carteret, in the Swallow, in 1767, having met with many difficulties and impediments in his passage into the South sea, by the straits of Magellan, attempted to make this island in order to recruit the health of his men; but he found it fortified by the Spaniards, and therefore chose rather to proceed to the island of Malacca. But M. de Bougainville that same year is said to have touched here for refreshments, although in the narrative of the voyage the fact is cautiously suppressed. This island is not quite 15 miles long and about six broad; its only safe harbour is on the north side. It is said to have plenty of excellent water, and to abound with a great variety of excellent vegetables highly antiscorbutic; besides which, Commodore Anson sowed a variety of garden-seeds, and planted the stones of plums, apricots, and peaches, which he was many years afterwards informed had thriven greatly; and now doubtless form a very valuable addition to the natural productions of this spot. Vast shoals of fish of various\nvarious kinds frequent this coast, particularly cod of a prodigious size. There are but few birds here, and those few are of species well known and common.\n\nJuan Blanco, or White Jack, a Spanish name for platinum. See Platina, Chemistry Index.\n\nJuba, a king of Numidia and Mauritania. He had succeeded his father Hiempal, and he favoured the cause of Pompey against Julius Caesar. He defeated Curio whom Caesar had sent to Africa, and after the battle of Pharsalia he joined his forces to those of Scipio. He was conquered in a battle at Thapsus, and totally abandoned by his subjects. He killed himself with Petreius, who had shared his good fortune and his adversity, in the year of Rome 707. His kingdom became a Roman province, of which Sallust was the first governor.\n\nJuba II, son of the former, was led among the captives to Rome to adorn the triumph of Caesar. His captivity was the source of the greatest honours, and his application to study procured him more glory than he would have obtained from the inheritance of a kingdom. He gained the heart of the Romans by the courteousness of his manners, and Augustus rewarded his fidelity by giving him in marriage Cleopatra the daughter of Antony, and conferring upon him the title of king, and making him master of all the territories which his father once possessed, in the year of Rome 723. His popularity was so great, that the Mauritanians rewarded his benevolence by making him one of their gods. The Athenians raised him a statue, and the Ethiopians worshipped him as a deity. Juba wrote an history of Rome in Greek, which is often quoted and commended by the ancients. Of it only few fragments remain. He also wrote on the history of Arabia, and the antiquities of Assyria, chiefly collected from Berolus. Besides these, he composed some treatises upon the drama, Roman antiquities, the nature of animals, painting, grammar, &c. now lost.\n\nJubilee, among the Jews, denotes every fiftieth year; being that following the revolution of seven weeks of years; at which time all the slaves were made free, and all lands reverted to their ancient owners. The jubilees were not regarded after the Babylonish captivity.\n\nThe word, according to some authors, comes from the Hebrew jobel, which signifies fifty; but this must be a mistake, for the Hebrew \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc, jobel does not signify fifty; neither do its letters, taken as cyphers, or according to their numerical powers, make that number; being 10, 6, 2, and 30, that is, 48.\u2014Others say, that jobel signifies a ram, and that the jubilee was thus called, because proclaimed with a ram's horn, in memory of the ram that appeared to Abraham in the thicket. Maimon chooses to derive the word from jabal, the first inventor of musical instruments, which, for that reason, were called by his name; whence the words jobel and jubilee came to signify the year of deliverance and remission, because proclaimed with the sound of one of those instruments which at first was no more than the horn of a ram. Others derive jobel from \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc, jabal in hiphil \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc, hobal, which signifies to recall or return; because this year restored all slaves to their liberty, &c. The institution of this festival is in Lev. xxv. 8, 17.\n\nThe learned are divided about the year of jubilee; some maintaining that it was every forty-ninth, and others that it was every fiftieth year. The ground of the former opinion is chiefly this, that the forty-ninth year being of course a sabbatical year, if the jubilee had been kept on the fiftieth, the land must have had two sabbaths, or have lain fallow two years, which, without a miracle, would have produced a dearth. On the other hand, it is alleged, that the Scripture expressly declares for the fiftieth year, Lev. xxv. 19, 11. And besides, if the jubilee and sabbatical year had been the same, there would have been no need of a prohibition to sow, reap, &c. because this kind of labour was prohibited by the law of the sabbatical year, Lev. xxv. 4, 5.\n\nThe authors of the Universal History, book i. chap. 7, note R, endeavour to reconcile these opinions, by observing, that as the jubilee began in the fifth month of the civil year, which was the seventh of the ecclesiastical, it might be said to be either the forty-ninth or fiftieth, according as one or other of these computations was followed. The political design of the law of the jubilee was to prevent the too great oppressions of the poor, as well as their being liable to perpetual slavery. By this means a kind of equality was preserved through all the families of Israel, and the distinction of tribes was also preserved, that they might be able, when there was occasion, on the jubilee-year, to prove their right to the inheritance of their ancestors. It served also, like the Olympiads of the Greeks, and the Lustra of the Romans, for the readier computation of time. The jubilee has also been supposed to be typical of the gospel state and dispensation, described by Isaiah, lxi. ver. 1, 2. in reference to this period, as the \"acceptable year of the Lord.\"\n\nJubilee, in a more modern sense, denotes a grand church solemnity or ceremony, celebrated at Rome, wherein the pope grants a plenary indulgence to all sinners; at least to as many as visit the churches of St Peter and St Paul at Rome.\n\nThe jubilee was first established by Boniface VII. in 1300, in favour of those who should go ad limina apostolorum; and it was only to return every hundred years. But the first celebration brought in such store of wealth to Rome, that the Germans called this the golden year; which occasioned Clement VI. in 1343, to reduce the period of the jubilee to fifty years. Urban VI. in 1389, appointed it to be held every thirty-five years, that being the age of our Saviour; and Paul II. and Sixtus IV. in 1475, brought it down to every twenty-five, that every person might have the benefit of it once in his life. Boniface IX. granted the privilege of holding jubilees to several princes and monasteries; for instance, to the monks of Canterbury, who had a jubilee every fifty years; when people flocked from all parts to visit the tomb of Thomas \u00e0 Becket. Jubilees are now become more frequent, and the pope grants them as often as the church or himself have occasion for them. There is usually one at the inauguration of a new pope. To be entitled to the privileges of the jubilee, the bull enjoins fasting, alms, and prayers. It gives the priests a full power to absolve in all cases, even those otherwise referred to the pope; to make commutations of vows, &c. in which it differs from a plenary indulgence. During the time of jubilees, all other indulgences are suspended.\n\nOne of our kings, viz. Edward III., caused his birthday to be observed in manner of a jubilee, when he\nbecame fifty years of age, in 1362, but never before or after. This he did by releasing prisoners, pardoning all offences except treason, making good laws, and granting many privileges to the people.\n\nThere are particular jubilees in certain cities, when several of their feasts fall on the same day: at Puy en Velay, for instance, when the feast of the Annunciation happens on Good-Friday; and at Lyons when the feast of St John Baptist concurs with the feast of Corpus Christi.\n\nIn 1649, the Jesuits celebrated a solemn jubilee at Rome; that being the centenary or hundredth year from their institution; and the same ceremony was observed in all their houses throughout the world.","sp":418,"ep":420},{"h":"JUCATAN","t":"or YUCATAN, a large province of New Spain in North America, which is a peninsula.

Leo of Modena, a rabbi of Venice, tells us, that Rabbi Judah, who was very rich, collected about 26 years after the destruction of the temple, in a book which he called the Mifnia, the constitutions and traditions of the Jewish magistrates who preceded him. But as this book was short and obscure, two Babylonian rabbis, Rabbina and Afe, collected all the interpretations, disputes, and additions, that had been made until their time upon the Mifnia, and formed the book called the Babylonish Talmud or Gemara; which is preferable to the Jerusalem Talmud, composed some years before by Rabbi Johanan of Jerusalem.

They lived without pomp or re-\ntinue, unless their own fortunes enabled them to do it;\nfor the revenues of their office consisted in voluntary\npresents from the people. They continued from the\ndeath of Joshua till the beginning of the reign of Saul,\nbeing a space of about 339 years.\n\nJudges, for ordinary affairs, civil and religious,\nwere appointed by Moses in every city to terminate\ndifferences; in affairs of greater consequence, the dif-\nferences were referred to the priests of Aaron's family,\nand the judge of the people or prince at that time\nestablished. Moses likewise set up two courts in all\nthe cities, one consisting of priests and Levites, to de-\ntermine points concerning the law and religion; the\nother consisting of heads of families, to decide in civil\nmatters.\n\nBook of Judges, a canonical book of the Old Testa-\nment, so called from its relating the state of the Is-\nraelites under the administration of many illustrious\npersons who were called judges, from being both the ci-\nvil and military governors of the people, and who were\nraised up by God upon special occasions, after the death\nof Joshua, till the time of their making a king. In\nthe time of this peculiar polity, there were several remark-\nable occurrences, which are recorded in this book. It\nacquaints us with the gross impiety of a new genera-\ntion which sprung up after the death of Joshua; and\ngives us a short view of the dispensations of heaven to-\nwards this people, sometimes relieving and delivering\nthem, and at others severely chastising them by the\nhands of their enemies.\n\nSelect Judges (Judices selecti), in Antiquity, were\npersons summoned by the praetor to give their verdict\nin criminal matters in the Roman courts, as juries do\nin ours. No person could be regularly admitted into\nthis number till he was 25 years of age. The Sortitio\nJudicum, or impanelling the jury, was the office of\nthe Judex Questionis, and was performed after both\nparties were come into court, for each had a right to\nreject or challenge whom they pleased, others being\nsubstituted in their room. The number of the Judices\nselecti varied, according to the nature of the charge.\nWhen the proper number appeared, they were sworn,\ntook their places in the judicellia, and heard the trial.\n\nJudgement, among logicians, a faculty or ra-\nther act of the human soul, whereby it compares its i-\ndeas, and perceives their agreement or disagreement.\nSee Metaphysics; and Logic, Part II.\n\nJudgement, in Law, is the sentence pronounced by\nthe court upon the matter contained in the record.\nJudgements are of four sorts. First, where the facts are\nconfessed by the parties, and the law determined by\nthe court; as in case of judgement upon demurrer: se-\ncondly, where the law is admitted by the parties, and\nthe facts disputed; as in the case of judgement on ver-\ndict; thirdly, where both the fact and the law arising\nthereon are admitted by the defendant; which is the judgement\ncase of judgements by confession or default: or, lastly,\nwhere the plaintiff is convinced that either fact, or\nlaw, or both, are insufficient to support his action,\nand therefore abandons or withdraws his prosecution;\nwhich is the case in judgements upon a nonuit or re-\ntraxit.\n\nThe judgement, though pronounced or awarded by\nthe judges, is not their determination or sentence, but\nthe determination and sentence of the law. It is the\nconclusion that naturally and regularly follows from\nthe premises of law and fact, which stands thus: A\u2014\ngainst him who hath rode over my corn, I may recover\ndamages by law: but A hath rode over my corn;\ntherefore I shall recover damages against A. If the\nmajor proposition be denied, this is a demurrer in law:\nif the minor, it is then an issue of fact: but if both be\nconfessed or determined to be right, the conclusion\nor judgement of the court cannot but follow. Which\njudgement or conclusion depends not therefore on the\narbitrary caprice of the judge, but on the settled and\ninvariable principles of justice. The judgement, in\nshort, is the remedy prescribed by law for the redress\nof injuries; and the suit or action is the vehicle or\nmeans of administering it. What that remedy may be,\nis indeed the result of deliberation and study to point\nout; and therefore the style of the judgement is, not\nthat it is decreed or resolved by the court, for then the\njudgement might appear to be their own; but, \"it is\nconsidered,\" consideratum est per curiam, that the plain-\ntiff do recover his damages, his debt, his possession,\nand the like; which implies that the judgement is none\nof their own; but the act of law, pronounced and de-\nclared by the court, after due deliberation and inquiry.\nSee Blackft. Comment. iii. 396.\n\nJudgement, in criminal cases, is the next stage of\nprosecution, after Trial, and Conviction are past, in\nsuch crimes and misdemeanors as are either too high\nor too low to be included within the benefit of clergy.\nFor when, upon a capital charge, the Jury have\nbrought in their Verdict guilty in the presence of the\nprisoner; he is either immediately, or at a convenient\ntime soon after, asked by the court, if he has any\nthing to offer why judgement should not be awarded\nagainst him? And in case the defendant be found guil-\nty of a misdemeanor (the trial of which may, and\ndoes usually, happen in his absence, after he has once\nappeared), a capias is awarded and issued, to bring\nhim in to receive his judgement; and if he absconds, he\nmay be prosecuted even to outlawry. But whenever he\nappears in person, upon either a capital or inferior con-\nviction, he may at this period, as well as at his arraign-\nment, offer any exceptions to the indictment, in arrest\nor stay of judgement: as for want of sufficient certainty\nin setting forth either the person, the time, the place,\nor the offence. And if the objections be valid, the\nwhole proceedings shall be set aside; but the party may\nbe indicted again. And we may take notice, 1. That\nnone of the statutes of jeofails, for amendment of er-\nrors, extend to indictments or proceedings in criminal\ncases; and therefore a defective indictment is not aided\nby a verdict, as defective pleadings in civil cases are.\n2. That, in favour of life, great strictness has at all\ntimes been observed, in every point of an indictment. Comment.\nSir Matthew Hale indeed complains, \"that this strict-\nness\nJUDGEMENTS are grown to be a blemish and inconvenience in the law; and the administration thereof: for that more offenders escape by the over-easy ear given to exceptions in indictments, than by their own innocence; and many times gross murders, burglaries, robberies, and other heinous and crying offences, remain unpunished by these unseemly niceties: to the reproach of the law, to the shame of the government, to the encouragement of villany, and to the dishonour of God.\" And yet, notwithstanding this laudable zeal, no man was more tender of life than this truly excellent judge.\n\nA pardon also may be pleaded in arrest of judgement: and it has the same advantage when pleaded here as when pleaded upon ARRAIGNMENT; viz. the saving the ATTAINERD, and, of course, the CORRUPTION OF BLOOD: which nothing can reftore but parliament, when a pardon is not pleaded till after sentence. And certainly, upon all accounts, when a man hath obtained a pardon, he is in the right to plead it as soon as possible. See PARDON.\n\nPraying the benefit of clergy may also be ranked among the motions in arrest of judgement. See Benefit of CLERGY.\n\nIf all these resources fail, the court must pronounce that judgement which the law hath annexed to the crime. Of these some are capital, which extend to the life of the offender, and consist generally in being hanged by the neck till dead; though in very atrocious crimes other circumstances of terror, pain, or disgrace, are superadded: as, in treasons of all kinds, being drawn or dragged to the place of execution; in high treason affecting the king's person or government, disembowelling alive, beheading, and quartering; and in murder, a public dissection. And in case of any treason committed by a female, the judgement is, to be burned alive. But the humanity of the English nation has authorized, by a tacit consent, an almost general mitigation of such parts of these judgements as favour of torture or cruelty: a fledge or hurdle being usually allowed to such traitors as are condemned to be drawn; and there being very few instances (and those accidental or by negligence) of any person's being disembowelled or burned, till previously deprived of sensation by strangling. Some punishments consist in exile or banishment, by abjuration of the realm, or transportation beyond the seas: others, in loss of liberty, by perpetual or temporary imprisonment. Some extend to confiscation, by forfeiture of lands, or moveables, or both, or of the profits of lands for life; others induce a disability of holding offices or employments, being heirs, executors, and the like. Some, though rarely, occasion a mutilation or dismemberment, by cutting off the hand or ears: others fix a lasting stigma on the offender, by slitting the nostrils or branding in the hand or face. Some are merely pecuniary, by stated or discretionary fines: and, lastly, there are others that consist principally in their ignominy, though most of them are mixed with some degree of corporeal pain; and these are inflicted chiefly for such crimes as either arise from indigence, or render even opulence disgraceful. Such as whipping, hard labour in the house of correction, the pillory, the stocks, and the ducking-stool.\n\nDisgusting as this catalogue may seem, it will afford pleasure to a British reader, and do honour to the British laws, to compare it with that shocking apparatus of death and torment to be met with in the criminal codes of almost every other nation in Europe. And it is moreover one of the glories of our law, that the nature, though not always the quantity or degree, of punishment is ascertained for every offence; and that it is not left in the breast of any judge, nor even of a jury, to alter that judgement which the law has beforehand ordained for every subject alike, without respect of persons. For if judgements were to be the private opinions of the judge, men would then be slaves to their magistrates; and would live in society, without knowing exactly the conditions and obligations which it lays them under. And, besides, as this prevents oppression on the one hand; so, on the other, it stifles all hopes of impunity or mitigation, with which an offender might flatter himself if his punishment depended on the humour and discretion of the court. Whereas, where an established penalty is annexed to crimes, the criminal may read their certain consequence in that law, which ought to be the unvaried rule, as it is the inflexible judge, of his actions.\n\nJUDGEMENT OF GOD.

Yet Professor Beckmann defends them, and pleads ably the cause of the practitioners of legerdemain, in the third volume of his History of Inventions, including rope-dancers, and such as exhibit feats of uncommon strength. He places all these under the general denomination of jugglers; and taking it for granted that every useful employment is full, he contends that there would not be room on the earth for all its present inhabitants, did not some of them practise the art of juggling.\n\n\"The arts, he observes, are not unprofitable, for they afford a comfortable subsistence to those who practice them, which they usually spend upon the spot, and this he considers as a good reason why their stay in a place ought to be encouraged. He is also of opinion that if the arts of juggling served no other end than to amuse the most ignorant of our citizens, it is proper that they should be encouraged, for the sake of those who cannot enjoy the more expensive deceptions of an opera. They convey instruction in the most acceptable manner, and serve as an antidote to superstition. We scarcely think, however, that it is innocent to entice the labouring poor, by useless deceptions, to part with their hard-earned pittance to idle vagabonds, whose life cannot be comfortable, which is passed amidst scenes of the most grovelling dissipation.\n\nJuggling is certainly of very great antiquity. The deception of breathing out flames was practised by some of the slaves in Sicily about 150 years before the commencement of the Christian era. It is, however, practised in modern times with much greater dexterity. The ancients made use of naphtha, a liquid mineral oil, which kindles when it only approaches a flame. According to Plutarch, Alexander the Great was astonished and delighted with the secret effects of naphtha, which were exhibited to him at Ecbatana. Wonder has been excited in modern times by persons who could walk over burning coals or red-hot iron, which is easily done by rendering the skin of the feet callous and insensible, so that the nerves under it are secured from injury. We are told by Beckmann, that the Hippi, who dwelt near Rome, jumped through burning coals; that women were accustomed to walk over burning coals at Caetabala, near the temple dedicated to Diana; that the exhibition of balls and cups is often mentioned in the works of the ancients; and that the various feats of horsemanship exhibited in our circuses palled, in the 13th century, from Egypt to the Byzantine court, and thence over all Europe.","sp":423,"ep":423},{"h":"JUGLANS","t":"the walnut, a genus of plants belonging to the polyandria clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 50th order, Amenitaceae.

His hopes were frustrated; Jugurtha showed himself brave and active, and he endeared himself to the Roman general. Micipha appointed him successor to his kingdom with his two sons; but the kindness of the father proved fatal to the children. Jugurtha destroyed Hiempsal, and stripped Adherbal of his possessions, and obliged him to fly to Rome for safety. The Romans listened to the well-grounded complaints of Adherbal; but Jugurtha's gold prevailed among the senators, and the suppliant monarch, forsaken in his distress, perished by the fancies of his enemy.

See ANATOMY, BLOOD, PLANTS, SAP, &c.\n\nThe juices of several plants are expressed to obtain their essential salts, and for several medicinal purposes, with intention either to be used without further preparation, or to be made into syrups and extracts. The general method of extracting their juices is, by pounding the plant in a marble mortar, and then by putting it into a press. Thus is obtained a muddy and green liquor, which generally requires to be clarified, as we shall soon observe. The juices of all plants are not extracted with equal ease. Some plants, even when fresh, contain so little juice, that water must be added while they are pounded, otherwise scarcely any juice would be obtained by expression. Other plants which contain a considerable quantity of juice, furnish by expression but a small quantity of it, because they contain also much mucilage, which renders the juice so viscid that it cannot flow. Water must also be added to these plants to obtain their juice. The juices thus obtained from vegetables by a mechanical method, are not, properly speaking, one of their principles, but rather a collection of all the proximate principles of plants which are soluble in water; such as the faponaceous extractive matter, the mucilage, the odoriferous principle, all the saline and saccharine substances; all which are dissolved in the water of the vegetation of the plants. Besides all these matters, the juice contains some part of the resinous substance, and the green colouring matter, which in almost all vegetables is of a resinous nature. These two latter substances, not being soluble in water, are only interposed between the parts of the other principles which are dissolved in the juice, and consequently disturb its transparency. They nevertheless adhere together in a certain degree, and so strongly in most juices, that they cannot be separated by filtration alone. When therefore these juices are to be clarified, some previous preparations must be used by which the filtration may be facilitated. Juices which are acid, and not very mucilaginous, are spontaneously clarified by rest and gentle heat. The juices of most antiseptic plants abounding in saline volatile principles, may be disposed to filtration merely by immersion in boiling water; and as they may be contained in close bottles, while they are thus heated in a water bath, their saline volatile part, in which their medicinal qualities chiefly consist, may thus be preserved. Fermentation is also an effectual method of clarifying juices which are susceptible of it; for all liquors which have fermented, clarify spontaneously after fermentation. But this method is not used to clarify juices, because many of them are susceptible of only an imperfect fermentation, and because the qualities of most of them are injured by that process. The method of clarification most generally used, and indispensably necessary for those juices which contain much mucilage, is boiling with the white of an egg. This matter, which has the property of coagulating in boiling water, and of uniting with mucilage, does accordingly, when added to the juice of plants, unite with and coagulate their mucilage, and separates it from the juice in form of scum, together with the greatest part of the resinous and earthy matters which disturb its transparency. And as any of these resinous matters which may remain in the liquor, after this boiling with the whites of eggs, are no longer retained by the mucilage, they may easily be separated by filtration.\n\nThe juices, especially before they are clarified, contain almost all the same principles as the plant itself; because in the operation by which they are extracted, no decomposition happens, but every thing remains, as to its nature, in the same state as in the plant. The principles contained in the juice are only separated from the grosser oily, earthy, and resinous parts, which compose the solid matter that remains under the press. These juices, when well prepared, have therefore the same medicinal qualities as the plants from which they are obtained. They must evidently differ from each other as to the nature and proportions of the principles with which they are impregnated, as much as the plants from which they are extracted differ from each other in those respects.\n\nMost vegetable juices coagulate when they are exposed to the air, whether they are drawn out of the plant by wounds, or naturally run out; though what is called naturally running out, is generally the effect of a wound in the plant, from a sort of tumor, or some other internal cause. Different parts of the same plant yield different juices. The same veins in their course through the different parts of the plant yield juices of\nJuice. a different appearance. Thus the juice in the root of the cow-parsnip is of a brimstone colour; but in the stalk it is white.\n\nAmong those juices of vegetables which are clammy and readily coagulate, there are some which readily break with a whey. The great wild lettuce, with the smell of opium, yields the greatest plenty of milky juice of any known British plant. When the stalk is wounded with a knife, the juice flows out readily like a thick cream, and is white and ropy; but if these wounds are made at the top of the stalks, the juice that flows out of them is dished with a purple tinge, as if cream had been sprinkled over with a few drops of red wine. Some little time after letting this out, it becomes much more purple, and thickens; and finally, the thicker part of it separates, and the thin whey sticks at top. The whey or thin part of this separated matter is easily pressed out from the curd by squeezing between the fingers, and the curd will then remain white; and on washing with water it becomes like rags. The purple whey (for in this is contained all the colour) soon dries into a purple cake, and may be crumbled between the fingers into a powder of the same colour. The white curd being dried and kept for some time, becomes hard and brittle. It breaks with a thinning surface like resin, and is inflammable; taking fire at a candle, and burning all away with a strong flame. The same thick part being held over a gentle heat, will draw out into tough long threads, melting like wax. The purple cake made from the whey is quite different from this; and when held to a candle scarce flames at all, but burns to a black coal. The whole virtue of the plant seems also to consist in this thin part of its juice: for the coagulum or curd, though looking like wax or resin, has no taste at all; whereas the purple cake made from the serum is extremely bitter, and of a taste somewhat resembling that of opium.\n\nOf the same kind with the wild lettuce are the throatwort, spurge, and many other plants. These are all replete with a milky juice which separates into curds and whey like that already described. But this, though a common law of nature, is not universal; for there are many plants which yield the like milky juices without any separation ensuing upon their extraction. The white juice of the foxglove never separates, but dries into an uniform cake: the common red wild poppy bleeds freely with a milky juice; and the heads or capitules of feed bleed not less freely than the rest of the plant, even after the flower is fallen. This juice, on being received into a shell or other small vessel, soon changes its white to a deep yellow colour, and dries into a cake which seems resinous and oily, but no whey separates from it. The tragopogon, or goat's-beard, when wounded, bleeds freely a milky juice; it is at first white, but becomes immediately yellow, and then more and more red, till at length it is wholly of a dusky red. It never separates, but dries together into one cake; and is oily and resinous, but of an insipid taste. The great bindweed also bleeds freely a white juice; the flowers, as well as the stalks and leaves, affording this liquor. It is of a sharp taste; and as many of the purging plants are of this class, it would be worth trying whether this milk is not purgative.\n\nThese juices, as well as the generality of others which bleed from plants, are white like milk; but there are some of other colours. The juice of the great celandine is of a fine yellow colour; it flows from the plant of the thickness of cream, and soon dries into a hard cake, without any whey separating from it. Another yellow juice is yielded by the seed-vessels of the yellow centaury in the month of July, when the seeds are full grown. This is very clammy; it soon hardens altogether into a cake without any whey separating from it. It sticks to the fingers like birdlime, is of the colour of pale amber, and will never become harder than soft wax if dried in the shade; but if laid in the sun, it immediately becomes hard like resin. These cakes burn like wax, and emit a very pleasant smell. The great angelica also yields a yellowish juice on being wounded; and this will not harden at all, but if kept several years will still be soft and clammy, drawing out into threads or half melted resin.\n\nAnother kind of juices very different from all these, are those of a gummy nature. Some of these remain liquid a long time, and are not to be dried without the assistance of heat; the others very quickly harden of themselves, and are not inflammable. The gum of the juice of rhubarb leaves soon hardens; and is afterwards soluble in common water, and sparkles when put into the flame of a candle. The clusters of the common honeyuckle are full of a liquid gum. This they frequently throw out, and it falls upon the leaves, where it retains its own form. The red hairs of the ros folis are all terminated by large bladders of a thin watery fluid. This is also a liquid gum; it sticks to the fingers, draws out into long threads, and stands the force of the sun all day. In the centre of each of these dew-drops there is a small red bladder, which stands immediately on the summit of the red hair, and contains a purple juice which may be squeezed out of it. The pinguicula, or butterwort, has also a gummy matter on its leaves in much greater quantity than the ros folis.\n\nSome plants yield juices which are manifestly of an oily nature. These, when rubbed, are not at all of a clammy nature, but make the fingers glip and slippery, and do not all harden on being exposed to the air. If the stalk of eleocharis be wounded, there flows out an oily juice swimming upon a watery one. The stalks of the hemlock also afford a similar oily liquor swimming upon the other; and in like manner the white mullein, the berries of ivy, the bay, juniper, dog-berry tree, and the fruit of the olive, when wounded, show their oil floating on the watery juice. Some of these oily juices, however, harden into a kind of resin. Our ivy yields such a juice very abundantly; and the juice of the small purple-berried juniper is of the same kind, being hard and fat, and not very gummy. If the bark of the common ivy is wounded in March, there will ooze out a tough and greasy matter of a yellowish colour, which, taken up between the fingers, feels not at all gummy or sticking, but melts in handling into a sort of oil, which in process of time hardens and crusts upon the wounds, and looks like brown sugar. It burns with a lasting flame, and smells very strong. The tops of the wild lettuce, and\nthe leaves growing near the tops, if examined with a magnifying glass, show a great number of small bladders or drops of an oily juice of a brownish colour, hardening into a kind of resin; they are easily wiped off when of any size, and are truly an oily juice a little hardened. It is probable also, that the fine blue flour or powder, called the bloom, upon the surface of our common plums, is no other than such an oily juice exuding from their pores in small particles, and hardening into a sort of resin.","sp":424,"ep":426},{"h":"JUJUBE","t":"in the Materia Medica, the name of a fruit of the pulpy kind, produced on a tree which Linnaeus makes a species of rhamnus.

At last, however, when he found that all other methods failed, he gave public employments to the most cruel enemies of the Christians, when the cities in most of the provinces were filled with tumults and seditions, and many of them were put to death:\n\nThough it has been pleaded by Julian's apologists, that the behaviour of the Christians furnished sufficient pretence for most of his proceedings against them, and the animosities among themselves furnished him with the means; that they were continually prone to sedition, and made a merit of insulting the public worship; and, finally, that they made no scruple of declaring, that want of numbers alone prevented them from engaging in an open rebellion. Historians mention, that Julian attempted to prove the falsehood of our Lord's prediction with respect to the temple of Jerusalem; and resolved to have that edifice rebuilt by the Jews, about 350 years after its destruction by Titus; but all their endeavours served only the more perfectly to verify what had been foretold by Jesus Christ; for the Jews, who had assembled from all parts to Jerusalem, digging the foundations, flames of fire burst forth and consumed the workmen*. However, the Jews, who were obstinately bent on accomplishing that work, made several attempts; but it is said, that all who endeavoured to lay the foundation perished by these flames, which at last obliged them entirely to abandon the work. Julian being mortally wounded in a battle with the Persians, it is said, that he then caught in his hand some of the blood which flowed from his wound; and throwing it towards heaven, cried, \"Thou Galilean hast conquered.\" But notwithstanding this popular report, Theodoret relates, that Julian discovered a different disposition; and employed his last moments in conversing with Maximus the philosopher on the dignity of the soul. He died the following night, aged 32. For a particular account of his reign and exploits, see History of Constantinople, No. 7.\n\nNo prince was ever more differently represented by different authors; on which account it is difficult to form a true judgement of his real character. It must, however, be acknowledged, that he was learned, liberal, temperate, brave, vigilant, and a lover of justice; but, on the other hand, he had apostatized to Paganism; was an enemy to the Christian religion; and was, in fact, a persecutor, though not of the most fanatical class. We have several of his discourses or orations; some of his letters; a treatise intitled Misopogon, which is a satire on the inhabitants of Antioch; and some other pieces, all written in an elegant style. They were published in Greek and Latin by Father Petavius in 1632 in quarto; and of which Spanheimius gave a fine edition in folio in 1696. His most famous work was that composed against the Christians, of which there are some fragments in Cyril's refutation of it.\n\nJULIAN Period, in Chronology, a period so called, as being adapted to the Julian year.\n\nIt is made to commence before the creation of the world. Its principal advantage lies here, that the same years of the cycles of the sun, moon, and indiction, of which three cycles it was made to consist by Joseph Scaliger in 1580, belonging to any year of this period, will never fall together again till after the expiration of 7980 years. There is taken for the first year of this period that which hath the first of the cycle of the sun, the first of the cycle of the moon, and the first of the indiction cycle, and so reckoning on.\n\nThe first year of the Christian era is always, in our systems\nJulian systems of chronology, the 4714th of the Julian period.\n\nTo find what year of the Julian period any given year of Christ answers to: To the given year of Christ add 4713, because so many years of the Julian period were expired A.D. 1; and the sum gives the year of the Julian period fought.\n\nOn the contrary, having the year of the Julian period given, to find what year of Christ answers thereto: From the year of the Julian period given subtract 4713, and the remainder will be the year fought.\n\nJulian, St., a harbour on the south of Patagonia, in South America, where ships usually touch that are bound to the South seas.

It is about 60 miles long, and 30 broad; and is a very plentiful country, abounding in cattle, corn, and fine meadows, and is well supplied with wood; but it is most remarkable for a fine breed of horses, and woad for dyeing, which is gathered here in abundance. The chief towns are Juliens, Aix-la-Chapelle, Duren, M\u00fcnster-Eifel, Bedburg, Weselburgh, and Laerlen. It is subject to the elector Palatine, with the consent of the kings of Prussia and Poland.\n\nJuliens, a city, capital of the duchy of Juliens in Westphalia; some think this city was founded by Julius Caesar or Julia Agrippina; but this is much questioned by others, because it is not mentioned before Antoninus's Itinerary and Theodosius's Tables. The town is small but well fortified, and neatly built; the houses are of brick, and the streets broad and regular. The citadel is large and very strong, containing a palace of the ancient dukes, and a spacious piazza. In the suburbs there is a monastery of Carthusians, nobly endowed by several dukes of Juliens. The town is but poorly inhabited, though they have a fine woollen manufacture in this country, and likewise another of linen. It was taken by Prince Maurice of Nassau in 1610, and by the Spaniards in 1622. It is seated on the river Roer, in E. Long. 6. 35. N. Lat. 50. 55.\n\nJulio Romano. See Romano.\n\nJulius C\u00e6sar.

The Venetians having purchased peace by the cession of part Romania, Julius turned his arms against Louis XII., king of France, and appeared in person armed cap-apee, at the siege of Mirandola; which place he took by assault in 1511. But proceeding to excommunicate Louis, the king wisely turned his own weapons against him, by calling a general council at Pifa: at which the pope refusing to appear, was declared to be suspended from the holy see; and Louis, in his turn, excommunicated the pope, who died soon after in 1512.

The word is derived from the Latin Julius, the surname of C. Caesar the dictator, who was born in it. Mark Antony first gave this month the name July, which before was called Quintilis, as being the fifth month of the year in the old Roman calendar established by Romulus, which began in the month of March. For the same reason, August was called Sextilis; and September, October, November, and December, still retain the name of their first rank.\n\nQuae sequitur, numero turba notata suo. Ovid.

Thus the coalition of two vowels, occasioning a hollow and obscure sound, and likewise of some consonants, rendering it harsh and rough, should be avoided; nor should the same syllable be repeated at the beginning and end of words, because the sound becomes hereby harsh and unpleasant.\u2014The following verse in Virgil's \u00c6neid is an example of juncture.\n\nArma virumque cano, Trojae qui primus ab ortu.\n\nJuncus, the rush, a genus of plants belonging to the hexandria class; and in the natural method ranking under the 5th order, Tripetaloidace.

He travelled into all parts of Europe, and practised physic with reputation in England, where, among other works, he composed a Greek and Latin Lexicon, to which he added above 6,000 words; an Epithalamium on the marriage of Queen Mary with King Philip of Spain; and *Animadversa et de Coma Commentarius*, which is the most applauded of all his works. He died in 1575.\n\n**Junius, Francis**, professor of divinity at Leyden, was born at Bourges in 1545, of a noble family, and studied some time at Lyons. Bartholomew Ancau, who was principal of the college in that city, gave him excellent instructions with regard to the right method of studying. He was remarkable for being proof against all temptations to lewdness; but a libertine so far overpowered him by his fondness, that he made him an atheist; however, he soon returned to his first faith; and, adverse as he was to unlawful love, he had no aversion to matrimony, but was married no less than four times. He was employed in public affairs by Henry IV.; and at last was invited to Leyden to be professor of divinity; which employment he discharged with honour, till he was snatched away by the plague in 1602. Du Pin says, he was a learned and judicious critic. He wrote, in conjunction with Emmanuel Tremellius, a Latin version of the Hebrew text of the Bible. He also published Commentaries on a great part of the Holy Scriptures; and many other works, all in Latin.\n\n**Junius, Francis**, or Francis du Jon, the son of the preceding, was born at Heidelberg in 1589. He at first designed to devote himself to a military life; but after the truce concluded in 1639, he applied himself entirely to study. He came to England in 1620, and lived 30 years in the earl of Arundel's family. He was greatly esteemed not only for his profound erudition, but also for the purity of his manners; and was passionately fond of the study of the northern languages, that, being informed there were some villages in Friesland where the ancient language of the Saxons was preserved, he went and lived two years in that country. He returned to England in 1675; and after spending a year at Oxford, retired to Windsor, in order to visit Wolfius, at whose house he died in 1677. The university of Oxford, to which he bequeathed his manuscripts, erected a very handsome monument to his memory. He wrote, 1. *De Pictura Veterum*, which is admired by all the learned; the best edition of it is that of Rotterdam in 1694. He published the same work at London in English. 2. An explication of the old Gothic manuscript, called the Silver one, because the four Gospels are there written in silver Gothic letters; this was published with notes by Thomas Maredchal or Marthal. 3.

She married Jupiter; but was not the most complaisant wife: for according to Homer, that god was sometimes obliged to make use of all his authority to keep her in due subjection; and the same author observes, that on her entering into a conspiracy against him, he punished her by suspending her in the air with two anvils fastened to her feet, and golden manacles on her hands, while all the other deities looked on without a possibility of helping her. However, her jealousy made her frequently find opportunities of interrupting her husband in the course of his amours; and prompted her to punish with unrelenting fury Europa, Semele, Io, Latona, and the rest of his mistresses. Jupiter himself having conceived without any commerce with a female, Juno, in revenge, conceived Vulcan by the wind, Mars by touching a flower pointed out to her by the goddess Flora, and Hebe by eating greedily of lettuces.\n\nJuno, as the queen of heaven, preferred great state: her usual attendants were Terror and Boldness, Calor, Pollux, and 14 nymphs; but her most faithful attendant was the beautiful Iris, or the rainbow. Homer describes her in a chariot adorned with precious stones, the wheels of which were of ebony, and which was drawn by horses with reins of gold. But the is more commonly painted drawn by peacocks. She was represented in her temple at Corinth, seated on a throne, with a crown on her head, a pomegranate in one hand, and in the other a sceptre with a cuckoo on its top.

It lies about 13 miles eastward from the island of Mayo, and abounds with high barren mountains; but the air, in the rainy season, is very unwholesome to strangers. Its produce is sugar, cotton, wine, and some excellent fruits. The animals are black cattle, horses, asses, deer, goats, hogs, civet-cats, and some very pretty green monkeys with black faces.\n\nSir George Staunton, in the account which he gives of this island, observes, that it is liable to long and excessive droughts, for which it is perhaps impossible to assign any philosophical cause. It was in a state of absolute famine at the end of 1792, when visited by the embassy to China, and the waters of the rivers were almost dried up. The surface of the earth was devoid of herbage, the cattle had nearly all perished, as much from the want of food as from drought.\n\n\"What were the uncommon circumstances (says Sir George) that took place in the atmosphere of that part of Africa to which the Cape de Verd islands lie contiguous, or in the vast expanse of continent extending to the east behind it, and from which this direful effect must have proceeded (as they happened where no man of science existed to observe or to record them), will remain unknown, nor is theory bold enough to supply the place of observation. Whatever was the cause which thus arrested the bountiful hand of nature, by drawing away the sources of fertility, it was observable, that some few trees and plants preserved their luxuriance, indicating that they still could extract from the arid earth whatever portion of humidity it was necessary to derive from thence for the purpose of vegetable life, though it was denied to others.\"\n\nBeside palm trees, frequently found verdant amidst burning sands, nothing could be more rich in flavour, or abound more with milky though corrosive juice, than the acacia gigantea, growing plentifully without culture, but undisturbed. The phytic nut tree appeared as if its perpetuity was not to be affected by any drought. Some species of rumoia, or sensitive plant, were most common, and did not appear to languish.\n\nBut the annual produce of agriculture had almost wholly disappeared, and the sugar canes had little resemblance to anything like vegetation. Yet vegetation quickly revived whenever any moisture could be conveyed through the soil.\n\nThe residence of the viceroy is represented by Sir George as a hamlet, consisting of 100 small dwellings, only one story high, scattered nearly a mile in length, and one-third as much in breadth. Not being commanded by any eminence, it was a situation which admitted of defence, yet the fort was nearly in ruins, and the few guns mounted on it were mostly honey-combed.
