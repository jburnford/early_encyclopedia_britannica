[{"h":"CONCERNING HIS RESIDENCE IN THE UNIVERSITY AND THE","t":"g his residence in the university and the means by which he was there supported, his two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> biographers contradict each other; so that these are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of which we cannot write with certainty. According to Sir John Hawkins, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of his continuance at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> is divisible into two periods: Mr Bofwell represents it as only one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, with the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> vacation. Sir John says, that he was supported at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> by Mr Andrew Corbet in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of assistant in the studies of his son: Mr Bofwell affirms us, that though he was promised pecuniary aid by Mr Corbet, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> was not in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> fulfilled. We should be inclined to adopt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a>'s account of this transaction, were it not palpably inconsistent with itself. He says, that the two young men were entered in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEMBROKE\">Pembroke</a> on the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; that Corbet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in the college two years; and yet that Johnson was driven home in little more than one year, because by the removal of Corbet he was deprived of his pension. A story, of which one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> contradicts the other, cannot wholly be true. Sir John adds, that \"meeting with another source, the bounty, as it is supposed, of some one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> more of the members of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> of Lichfield, he returned to college, and made up the whole of his residence in the university about three years.\" Mr Bofwell has told us nothing but that Johnson, though his father was unable to support him, continued three years in college, and was then driven from it by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> poverty.\n\nThese gentlemen differ likewise in their accounts of Johnson's tutors. Sir John Hawkins says that he had two, Mr Jordan and Dr Adams. Mr Bofwell affirms that Dr Adams could not be his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a>, because Jordan did not quit the college till 1731; the year in the autumn of which Johnson himself was compelled to leave Oxford. Yet the same author represents Dr Adams as saying, \"I was Johnson's nominal tutor, but he was above my mark;\" a speech of which it is not easy to discover the meaning, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it was not Johnson's duty to attend Adams's lectures. In most colleges we believe there are two tutors in different departments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>; and therefore it is not improbable that Jordan and Adams may have been tutors to Johnson at the same time, the one in languages, the other in science. Jordan was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> abilities, that though his pupil loved him for the goodness of his heart, he would often risk the payment of a small fine, rather than attend his lectures; nor was he studious to conceal the reason of his absence. Upon occasion of one such impossession, he said, \"Sir, you have foisted me twopence for non-attendance at a lecture not worth a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENNY\">penny</a>.\" For some transgression or absence his tutor imposed upon him as a Christmas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> the task of translating into Latin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a> Pope's *Messian*; which being shown to the author of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>, was read and returned with this encomium, \"The writer of this poem <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> leave it a question for posterity, whether his or mine be the original.\" The particular course of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> while in college, and during the vacation which he passed at home, cannot be traced. That at this period he read much, we have his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> in what he afterwards told the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>; but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> was never regular, and at all times he thought more than he read. He informed Mr Bofwell, that what he read *folly* at Oxford was Greek, and that the study of which he was most fond was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a>.\n\nIt was in the year 1731 that Johnson left the university without a degree; and as his father, who died in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> of that year, had suffered great misfortunes in trade, he was driven out a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONER\">commoner</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and excluded from the regular modes of profit and prosperity. Having therefore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> only a profession but the means of subsistence to seek, he accepted, in the month of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1732, an invitation to the office of under-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of a free school at Market <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOSWORTH\">Bosworth</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEICESTERSHIRE\">Leicestershire</a>: but not knowing, as he said, whether it was more disagreeable for him to teach or for the boys to learn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a>-rules, and being likewise disgusted at the treatment which he received from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of the school, he relinquished in a few months a situation which he ever afterwards recollected with horror. Being thus again without any fixed employment, and with very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> in his pocket, he translated *Lobo's voyage to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABYSSINIA\">Abyssinia</a>*, for the trifling sum, it is said, of five guineas, which he received from a bookeller in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRMINGHAM\">Birmingham</a>.\nJohnson. Birmingham. This was the first attempt which it is certain he made to procure pecuniary assistance by means of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a>; and it must have held forth very little encouragement to his commencing author by profession.\n\nIn 1735, being then in his 26th year, he married Mrs Porter, the widow of a mercer in Birmingham; whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> was almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> his; whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> form, according to Garrick and others, had never been captivating; and whose fortune amounted to hardly 800l. That she had a superiority of understanding and talents is extremely probable, both because she certainly inspired him with a more than ordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, and because she was herself so delighted with the charms of his conversation as to overlook his external disadvantages, which were many and great. He now set up a private academy; for which purpose he hired a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> well situated near his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>; but his name having then nothing of that celebrity which afterwards commanded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> and respect of mankind, this undertaking did not succeed. The only pupils who are known to have been placed under his care, were the celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> Garrick, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> George Garrick, and a young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> of fortune whose name was Offely. He kept his academy only a year and a half; and it was during that time that he constructed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> and wrote a great part of his tragedy of Irene.\n\nThe respectable character of his parents and his own merit had secured him a kind reception in the best families at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LITCHFIELD\">Litchfield</a>; and he was particularly distinguished by Mr Walmley <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, a man of great worth and of very extensive and various erudition. That gentleman, upon hearing part of Irene read, thought so highly of Johnson's abilities as a dramatic writer, that he advised him by all means to finish the tragedy and produce it on the stage. To men of genius the stage holds forth temptations almost irresistible. The profits arising from a tragedy, including the representation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> of it, and the connections which it sometimes enables the author to form, were in Johnson's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> ineffinable. Flattered, it may be supposed, with these hopes, he set out some time in the year 1737 with his pupil David Garrick for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, leaving Mrs Johnson to take care of the house and the wreck of her fortune. The two adventurers carried with them from Mr Walmley an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> recommendation to the reverend Mr Collon, then master of an academy, and afterwards Lucasian professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a> in the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>; but from that gentleman it does not appear that Johnson found either protection or encouragement.\n\nHow he spent his time upon his first going to London is not particularly known. His tragedy was refused by the managers of that day; and for some years the Gentleman's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">Magazine</a> seems to have been his principal resource for employment and support. To enumerate his various communications to that far-famed miscellany, would extend this article beyond the limits which we can afford. Suffice it to say, that his connection with Cave the proprietor became very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>; that he wrote prefaces, essays, reviews of books, and poems; and that he was occasionally employed in correcting the papers written by other correspondents.\n\nWhen the complaints of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> against the administration of Sir Robert Walpole became loud, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> was made, February 13, 1742-3, to remove him from his majesty's councils forever, Johnson was pitched upon by Cave to write what was in the Magazine intitled Debates in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">Senate</a> of Lilliput, but was understood to be the speeches of the most eminent members in both houses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>. These orations, which induced Voltaire to compare British with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> eloquence, were hastily sketched by Johnson while he was not yet 32 years old, while he was little acquainted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, while he was struggling, not for distinction but for existence. Perhaps in none of his writings has he given a more conspicuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of a mind prompt and vigorous almost beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>: for they were compiled from scanty notes taken by illiterate persons employed to attend in both houses; and sometimes he had nothing communicated to him but the names of the several speakers, and the part which they took in the debate.\n\nHis separate publications which at this time attracted the greatest notice were, \"London, a Poem in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of Juvenal's third Satire;\" \"Marmor Norfolcense,\" or an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on an ancient prophetical Inscription in Monkfish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RHYME\">Rhyme</a>, lately discovered near Lynne in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORFOLK\">Norfolk</a>;\" and \"A complete Vindication of the Licencers of the Stage from the malicious and scandalous allegations of Mr Brook author of Gutavus Vasa.\" The poem, which was published in 1738 by Doddery, is universally known and admired as the most spirited instance in the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of ancient sentiments adapted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> topics. Pope, who then filled the poetical throne without a rival, being informed that the author's name was Johnson, and that he was an obscure person, replied, \"he will soon be dethroned.\" The other two pamphlets, which were published in 1739, are filled with keen satire on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>; and though Sir John Hawkins has thought fit to declare that they display neither learning nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>, Pope was of a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>; for in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> of his preserved by Mr Boswell, he says, that \"the whole of the Norfolk prophecy is very humorous.\"\n\nMrs Johnson, who went to London soon after her husband, now lived sometimes in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> and sometimes in another, sometimes in the city and sometimes at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a>: but Johnson himself was oftener to be found at St John's Gate, where the Gentleman's Magazine was published, than in his own lodgings. It was there that he became acquainted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">Savage</a>, with whom he was induced, probably by the similarity of their circumstances, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> a very close friendship; and such were their extreme necessities, that they have often wandered whole nights in the street for want of money to procure them a lodging. In one of these nocturnal rambles, when their distress was almost incredible, so far were they from being depressed by their situation, that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> spirits and brimful of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a>, they traversed St James's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">Square</a> for several hours, inveighed against the minister; and, as Johnson said in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> of himself, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>, and all such patriots, \"resolved that they would stand by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>!\" In 1744, he published the life of his unfortunate companion; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> which, had he never written anything else, would have placed him very high.\nhigh in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of authors (a). His narrative is remarkably smooth and well disposed; his observations are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a>, and his reflections disclose the most recesses of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> heart.\n\nIn 1749, when Drury-lane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a> was opened under the management of Garrick, Johnson wrote a prologue for the occasion; which for just dramatic criticism on the whole range of the English stage, as well as for poetical excellence, is confessedly unrivalled. But this year is, in his life, distinguished as the epoch when his arduous and important work, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DICTIONARY\">Dictionary</a> of the English Language, was announced to the world by the publication of its plan or prospectus, addressed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Chesterfield. From that nobleman Johnson was certainly led to expect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> and encouragement; and it seems to be equally certain that his lordship expected, when the book should be published, to be honoured with the dedication. The expectations of both were disappointed. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Chesterfield, after seeing the lexicographer once or twice, suffered him to be repulsed from his door; but afterwards thinking to conciliate him when the work was upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVE\">eve</a> of publication, he wrote two papers in \"The World,\" warmly recommending it to the public. This artifice was seen through; and Johnson, in very polite language, rejected his lordship's advances, letting him know, that he was unwilling the public should consider him as owing to a patron that which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a> had enabled him to do for himself. This great and laborious work its author expected to complete in three years; but he was certainly employed upon it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a>; for we know that it was begun in 1747, and the last sheet was sent to the press in the end of the year 1754. When we consider the nature of the undertaking, it is indeed astonishing that it was finished so soon, since it was written, as he says, \"with little assistance of the learned, and without any patronage of the great; nor in the soft obscurities of retirement, or under the shelter of academic bowers, but amidst inconvenience and distraction, in sickness and in sorrow.\" The sorrow, to which he here alludes, is probably that which he felt for the loss of his wife, who died on the 11th of March O.S. 1752, the loss of whom he continued to lament as long as he lived.\n\nThe Dictionary did not occupy his whole time: for while he was pushing it forward, he fitted his tragedy for the stage; wrote the lives of several eminent men for the Gentleman's Magazine; published an Imitation of the 10th Satire of Juvenal, entitled \"The Vanity of human Wishes;\" and began and finished \"The Rambler.\" This last work is so well-known, that it is hardly necessary to say that it was a periodical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, published twice a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, from the 20th of March 1750 to the 14th of March 1752 inclusive: but to give our readers some notion of the vigour and promptitude of the author's mind, it may not be improper to observe, that notwithstanding the severity of his other labours, all the affluence which he received does not amount to five papers; and that many of the most masterly of those unequalled essays were written on the spur of the occasion, and never seen entire by the author till they returned to him from the press.\n\nSoon after the Rambler was concluded, Dr Hawkesworth projected \"The Adventurer\" upon a similar plan; and by the affluence of friends he was enabled to carry it on with almost equal merit. For a short time, indeed, it was the most popular work of the two; and the papers with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIGNATURE\">signature</a> T, which are confessedly the most splendid in the whole collection, are now known to have been communicated by Johnson, who received for each the sum of two guineas. This was double the price for which he sold sermons to such clergymen as either would not or could not compose their own discourses; and of sermon-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> he seems to have made a kind of trade.\n\nThough he had exhausted, during the time that he was employed on the Dictionary, more than the sum for which the bookellers had bargained for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a>; yet by means of the Rambler, Adventurer, sermons, and other productions of his pen, he now found himself in greater affluence than he had ever been before; and as the powers of his mind, distended by long and severe exercise, required relaxation to restore them to their proper tone, he appears to have done little or nothing from the closing of the Adventurer till the year 1756, when he submitted to the office of reviewer in the Literary Magazine. Of his reviews by far the most valuable is that of Soame Jenyns's \"Free Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Evil.\" Never were wit and metaphysical acuteness more closely united than in that criticism, which exposes the weaknesses and holds up to contempt the reasonings of those vain mortals, who presumptuously attempt to grasp the scale of existence, and to form plans of conduct for the Creator of the universe.\n\nBut the furnishing of magazines, reviews, and even newspapers with literary intelligence, and authors of books with dedications and prefaces, was considered as an employment unworthy of Johnson. It was therefore propounded by the bookellers that he should give a new edition of the dramas of Shakespeare; a work which he had projected many years before, and of which he had published a specimen which was commended by Warburton. When one of his friends expressed a hope that this employment would furnish him with amusement and add to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, he replied, \"I look upon it as I did upon the Dictionary; it is all work; and my inducement to it is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> or desire of fame, but the want of money, which is the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> to writing that I know of.\" He issued proposals, however, of considerable length; in which he showed that he knew perfectly what a variety of research such an undertaking required: but his indolence prevented him from pursuing it with diligence, and it was not published till many years afterwards.\n\nOn the 15th of April 1758 he began a new periodical paper entitled \"The Idler,\" which came out every Saturday.\n\n(a) From the merit of this work Mr Boswell has endeavoured to detract, by insinuating, that the person called Richard Savage was an impostor, and not the son of the earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">Rivers</a> and the countess of Macclesfield. See our account of SAVAGE.\nJohnson. Saturday in a weekly newspaper, called \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">Universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRONICLE\">Chronicle</a>, or Weekly Gazette,\" published by Newberry. Of these essays, which were continued till the 5th of April 1760, many were written as hastily as an ordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>; and one in particular composed at Oxford was begun only half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> before the departure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> which carried it to London. About this time he had the offer of a living, of which he might have rendered himself capable by entering into orders. It was a rectory in a pleasant country, of such yearly value as would have been an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> to one in much better circumstances; but sensible, as it is supposed, of the severity of his temper, he declined it, saying, \"I have not the requisites for the office, and I cannot in my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> shear the flock which I am unable to feed.\"\n\nIn the month of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1759 his mother died at the great age of 90; an event which deeply affected him, and gave birth to the first Idler, in which he laments, that \"the life which made his own life pleasant was at an end, and that the gate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> was shut upon his prospects.\" Soon afterwards he wrote his \"Rasselas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> of Abyssinia;\" that with the profits he might defray the expense of his mother's funeral, and pay some debts which he had left. He told a friend, that he received for the copy 100l. and 25l. more when it came to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> edition; that he wrote it in the evenings of one week, sent it to the press in portions as it was written, and had never since read it over.\n\nHitherto, notwithstanding his various publications, he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, and obliged to provide by his labour for the wants of the day that was passing over him; but having been early in 1762 represented to the king as a very learned and good man without any certain provision, his majesty was pleased to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> him a pension, which Lord Bute, then first minister, assured him \"was not given for anything which he was to do, but for what he had already done.\" A fixed annuity of three hundred pounds, if it diminished his distress, increased his indolence; for as he constantly avowed that he had no other motive for writing than to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> money, as he had now what was abundantly sufficient for all his purposes, as he delighted in conversation, and was visited and admired by the witty, the elegant, and the learned, very little of his time was past in solitary study. Solitude was indeed his aversion; and that he might avoid it as much as possible, Sir Joshua Reynolds and he, in 1764, instituted a club, which existed long without a name, but was afterwards known by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of the Literary Club. It consisted of some of the most enlightened men of the age, who met at the Turk's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">Head</a> in Gerard-street, Soho, one evening in every week at seven, and till a late hour enjoyed \"the feast of reason and the flow of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>.\"\n\nIn 1765, when Johnson was more than usually oppressed with constitutional melancholy, he was fortunately introduced into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of Mr Thrale, one of the most eminent brewers in England, and member of parliament for the borough of Southwark: and it is but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to acknowledge, that to the affluence which Mr and Mrs Thrale gave him, to the shelter which their house afforded him for 16 or 17 years, and to the pains which they took to soothe or repel his uneasy fancies, the public is probably indebted for some of the most masterly as well as most popular works which he ever produced. At length, in the October of this year, he gave to the world his edition of Shakespeare, which is chiefly valuable for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a>, where the excellencies and defects of that immortal bard are displayed with such judgement, as must please every man whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> is not regulated by the standard of fashion or national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a>. In 1767 he was honoured by a private conversation with the king in the library at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>'s house; and two years afterwards, upon the establishment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> academy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>, &c. he was nominated professor of ancient literature; an office merely honorary, and conferred on him, as is supposed, at the recommendation of his friend the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a>.\n\nIn the variety of subjects on which he had hitherto exercised his pen, he had forborne, since the administration of Sir Robert Walpole, to meddle with the disputes of contending factions; but having seen with indignation the methods which, in the business of Mr Wilkes, were taken to work upon the populace, he published in 1770 a pamphlet, entitled \"The False Alarm;\" in which he alerts, and labours to prove by a variety of arguments founded on precedents, that the expulsion of a member of the house of commons is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a>, and that no such calamity as the subversion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> was to be feared from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> warranted by usage, which is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of parliament. Whatever may be thought of the principles maintained in this publication, it unquestionably contains much wit and much argument, expressed in the author's best style of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>; and yet it is known to have been written between eight o'clock on Wednesday night and twelve o'clock on the Thursday night, when it was read to Mr Thrale upon his coming from the house of commons. In 1771 he published another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> pamphlet, entitled, \"Thoughts on the late transactions respecting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALKLAND\">Falkland</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>;\" in which he attacked Junius; and he ever afterwards delighted himself with the thought of having destroyed that able writer, whom he certainly surpassed in nervous language and pointed ridicule.\n\nIn 1773 he visited with Mr Botwell some of the most considerable of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBRIDES\">Hebrides</a> or Western Islands of Scotland, and published an account of his journey in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> which abounds in extensive philosophical views of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, ingenious sentiments, and lively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, but which offended many persons by the violent attack which it made on the authenticity of the poems attributed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OSSIAN\">Ossian</a>. For the degree of offence that was taken, the book can hardly be thought to contain a sufficient reason: if the antiquity of these poems be yet doubted, it is owing more to the conduct of their editor than to the violence of Johnson. In 1774, the parliament being dissolved, he addressed to the electors of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> a pamphlet, entitled \"The Patriot;\" of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> was to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> them from imposition, and teach them to distinguish true from false patriotism. In 1775 he published \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol6.html#article-TAXATION\">Taxation</a> no tyranny;\" in answer to the resolutions and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> of the American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGRESS\">Congress</a>. In this performance his admirer Mr Botwell cannot, he says, perceive that ability of argument or that felicity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> for which on other occasions Johnson was so eminent. This is a singular criticism. To the alluded principle\nprinciple upon which the reasoning of the pamphlet rests many have objected, and perhaps their objections are well founded; but if it be admitted that \"the supreme power of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of requiring from all its subjects such contributions as are necessary to the public safety or public prosperity,\" it will be found a very difficult task to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the chain of arguments by which it is proved that the British parliament had a right to tax the Americans. As to the expression of the pamphlet, the reader, who adopts the maxim recorded in the \"Journal of a tour to the Hebrides,\" that a controversialist \"ought not to strike soft in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>,\" must acknowledge that it is uncommonly happy, and that the whole performance is one of the most brilliant as well as most correct pieces of composition that ever fell from the pen of its author. These essays drew upon him numerous attacks, all of which he heartily despised; for though it has been supposed that \"A letter addressed to Dr Samuel Johnson occasioned by his political publications\" gave him great uneasiness, the contrary is manifest, from his having, after the appearance of that letter, collected them into a volume with the title of \"Political Tracts by the author of the Rambler.\" In 1765 Trinity College <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a> had created him LL.D., by diploma, and he now received the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> from the university of Oxford; an honour with which, though he did not boast of it, he was highly gratified. In 1777 he was induced, by a call of a very extraordinary nature, to exercise that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> which in him was obedient to every call. Dr William Dodd, a clergyman, under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> of death for the crime of forgery, found means to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> Johnson in his behalf, and procured from him two of the most energetic compositions of that kind ever seen; the one a petition from himself to the king, the other a like address from his wife to the queen. These petitions failed of success.\n\nThe principal bookellers in London having determined to publish a body of English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, Johnson was prevailed upon to write the lives of the poets, and give a character of the works of each. This task he undertook with alacrity, and executed it in such a manner as must convince every competent reader, that as a biographer and a critic, no nation can produce his equal. The work was published in ten small volumes, of which the first four came abroad 1778, and the others in 1781. While the world in general was filled with admiration of the stupendous powers of that man, who at the age of seventy-two, and labouring under a complication of diseases, could produce a work which displays so much genius and so much learning, there were narrow circles in which prejudice and resentment were fostered, and whence attacks of different sorts issued against him. These gave him not the smallest disturbance. When told of the feeble, though shrill, outcry that had been raised, he said\u2014\"Sir, I considered myself as entrusted with a certain portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>. I have given my opinion sincerely: let them show where they think me wrong.\"\n\nHe had hardly begun to reap the laurels gained by this performance, when death deprived him of Mr Thrale, in whose house he had enjoyed the most comfortable hours of his life; but it abated not in Johnson that care for the interests of those whom his friend had left behind him, which he thought himself bound to cherish, both in duty as one of the executors of his will, and from the nobler principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>. On this account, his visits to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STREATHAM\">Streatham</a>, Mr Thrale's villa, were for some time after his death regularly made on Monday and prolonged till Saturday, as they had been during his life; but they soon became less and less frequent, and he studiously avoided the mention of the place or the family. Mrs Thrale, now Piozzi, says indeed, that \"it grew extremely perplexing and difficult to live in the house with him when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of it was no more; because his dislikes grew capricious, and he could scarce bear to have any body come to the house whom it was absolutely necessary for her to see.\" The person whom she thought it most necessary for her to see may perhaps be guessed at without any superior share of sagacity; and if these were the visits which Johnson could bear, we are so far from thinking his dislikes capricious, though they may have been perplexing, that if he had acted otherwise, we should have blamed him for want of gratitude to the friend whose \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> for fifteen years had never been turned upon him but with respect or benignity.\"\n\nAbout the middle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1783 his constitution sustained a feverish shock than it had ever before felt, by a stroke of the palsy; so sudden and so violent, that it awakened him out of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, and rendered him for a short time speechless. As usual, his recourse under this affliction was to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>, which in him was constant, sincere, and fervent. He tried to repeat the Lord's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a> first in English, then in Latin, and afterwards in Greek; but succeeded only in the last attempt; immediately after which he was again deprived of the power of articulation. From this alarming attack he recovered with wonderful quickness, but it left behind it some preludes of an hydropic affection; and he was soon afterwards seized with a spasmodic asthma of such violence that he was confined to the house in great pain, while his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DROPSY\">dropsy</a> increased, notwithstanding all the efforts of the most eminent physicians in London and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>. He had, however, such an interval of ease as enabled him, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> 1784 to visit his friends at Oxford, Litchfield, and Athbourne in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DERBYSHIRE\">Derbyshire</a>. The Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> being introduced one day as the topic of conversation when he was in the house of Dr Adams, Johnson said, \"If you join the Papists externally, they will not interrogate you strictly as to your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> in their tenets. No reasoning Papist believes every article of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>. There is one side on which a good man might be persuaded to embrace it. A good man of a timorous disposition, in great doubt of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCEPTANCE\">acceptance</a> with God, and pretty credulous, might be glad of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> where there are so many helps to go to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>. I would be a Papist if I could. I have fear enough; but an obstinate rationality prevents me. I shall never be a Papist unless on the near approach of death, of which I have very great terror.\"\n\nHis constant dread of death was indeed so great, that it astonished all who had access to know the piety of his mind and the virtues of his life. Attempts have been made to account for it in various ways; but doubts that is the true account which is given in the Olla Podrida, by an elegant and pious writer, who now adorns a high station in the church of England. \"That he\nshould not be conscious of the abilities with which Providence had blessed him was impossible. He felt his own powers; he felt what he was capable of having performed; and he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> how little, comparatively speaking, he had performed. Hence his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> on the near prospect of the account to be made, viewed through the medium of constitutional and morbid melancholy, which often excluded from his sight the bright beams of divine mercy.\" This, however, was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> only while death was approaching from some distance. From the time that he was certain it was near, all his fears were calmed; and he died on the 13th of December 1784, full of resignation, strengthened by faith, and joyful in hope.\n\nFor a just character of this great man our limits afford not room: we must therefore content ourselves with laying before our readers a very short sketch. His stature was tall, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a> were large, his strength was more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> in early life had been greater than such a form gave reason to expect: but he was subject to an infirmity of the convulsive kind, resembling the distemper called St Vitus's dance; and he had the seeds of many diseases found in his constitution, that a short time before his death he declared that he hardly remembered to have passed one day wholly free from pain. He possessed very extraordinary powers of understanding; which were much cultivated by reading, and still more by meditation and reflection. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> was remarkably retentive, his imagination uncommonly vigorous, and his judgment keen and penetrating. He read with great rapidity, retained with wonderful exactness what he so easily collected, and possessed the power of reducing to order and system the scattered hints on any subject which he had gathered from different books. It would not perhaps be safe to claim for him the highest place, among his contemporaries, in any single department of literature; but, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> one of his own expressions, he brought more mind to every subject, and had a greater variety of knowledge ready for all occasions, than any other man that could be easily named.\u2014Though prone to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, he was in all other respects to remarkably incredulous, that Hogarth said while Johnston firmly believed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIBLE\">Bible</a>, he seemed determined to believe nothing but the Bible. Of the importance of religion he had a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, and his zeal for its interests were always awake, so that profaneness of every kind was abashed in his presence.\u2014The same energy which was displayed in his literary productions, was exhibited also in his conversation, which was various, striking, and instructive: like the sage in Raffelsas, he spoke, and attention watched his lips; he reasoned, and conviction closed his periods: when he pleaded, he could be the greatest sophist that ever contended in the lists of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLAMATION\">declamation</a>; and perhaps no man ever equalled him in nervous and pointed repartees. His veracity, from the most trivial to the most solemn occasions, was strict even to severity: he scorned to embellish a story with fictitious circumstances; for what is not a representation of reality, he used to say, is not worthy of our attention. As his purse and his house were ever open to the indigent, so was his heart tender to those who wanted relief, and his soul was susceptible of gratitude and every kind <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>. He had a roughness in his manner which subdued the fancy and terrified the meek: but it was only in his manner; for no man was more loved than Johnston by those who knew him; and his works will be read with veneration for their author as long as the language in which they are written shall be understood.","sp":331,"ep":336},{"h":"EXPLANATION OF PLATES","t":"Plate CCLXXIX.\n\nExplanation of Terms.\u2014a, (fig. 2,) pectoral fins; b, ventral fins; c, c, anal fins; d, caudal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIN\">fin</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> tail; e, e, dorsal fins; f, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONY\">bony</a> plates that cover the gills; g, branchiostegous rays and their membranes; h, lateral or side line.\n\nFig. 1.

attempted to make an accurate and sensible hygrometer by means of a hempen Hygrometer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> of a considerable length, I quickly found, that though it was more than sufficiently susceptible of every change in the humidity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, yet the cord was upon the whole in a continual state of lengthening. Though this change was the greatest at first, yet it did not appear probable that any given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> would bring it to a certainty; and furthermore, it seemed, that as the cord grew more determinate in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> length, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> by certain differences of moisture grew less. Now, as on considering wood, catgut, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, &c., there did not appear to be a likelihood of finding any substance sufficiently sensible of differences of moisture that would be unalterable under the same degrees thereof; this led me to consider of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> which would readily admit of an adjustment; so that, though the cord whereby the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> is actuated may be variable in itself, both as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> length, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of length under given degrees of moisture, yet that, on supposition of a material departure from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> scale, it might be readily restored thereto; and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, that any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of hygrometers, similarly constructed, might, like thermometers, be capable of speaking the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>.\n\nThe two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> the more readily determinable in a thermometer, are the points of freezing and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. In like manner, to construct hygrometers which shall be capable of agreement, it is necessary to establish two different degrees of a moisture which shall be as fixed in themselves, and to which we can have recourse as readily and as often as possible.\n\nOne point is given by making the substance perfectly wet, which seems sufficiently determinable; the other is that of perfect dry, which I do not apprehend to be attainable with the same precision. A readiness to imbibe wet, so that the substance may be soon and fully saturated, and also a facility of parting with its moisture on being exposed to the fire to dry, at the same time, that neither immersion, nor a moderate exposition to the warmth of the fire, shall injure its texture, are properties requisite to the first mover of such an hygrometer, that in a manner exclude all substances that I am acquainted with, besides hempen and flaxen threads and cords, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> substances compounded of them.\n\nUpon these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>, in the year 1758, I constructed two hygrometers as nearly alike as possible, in order that I might have the means of examining their agreement or disagreement on similar or dissimilar treatment. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> or scale between dry and wet I divided into 100 equal parts, which I call the degrees of this hygrometer. The point of 0 denotes perfect dry; and the numbers increase with the degrees of moisture to 100, which denotes perfect wet.\n\nOn comparing them for some time, when hung up together in a passage or staircase, where they would be very little affected by fire, and where they would be exposed to as free an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> as possible in the inside of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, I found that they were generally within one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, and very rarely differed two degrees; but as these comparisons necessarily took up some time, and were frequently interrupted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> avocations from home, it was some years before I could form a tolerable judgment of them. One thing I soon observed, not altogether\naltogether to my liking, which was, that the flaxen cords made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of seemed to make too much resistance to the entry of small degrees of moisture (such as is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> experienced within doors in the situation above-mentioned), that all the changes were comprised within the first 30\u00b0 of the scale; but yet, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> them to the warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a> of a wash-house, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a> quickly mounted to 100. I was therefore desirous of impregnating the cords with something of a saline <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, which should dispose them more forcibly to attract moisture; in order that the index might, with the ordinary changes of the moisture in the atmosphere, travel over a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the scale of 100. How to do this in a regular and fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, was the subject of many experiments and several years interrupted inquiry. At last I tried the one hereafter described, which seemed to answer my intention in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>; and though upon the whole it does not appear probable that ever this instrument <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be made capable of such an accurate agreement as the mercurial thermometers are, yet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we can reduce all the disagreements of an hygrometer within 1/5th part of the whole scale, it will probably be of use in some philosophical inquiries, in lieu of instruments which have not yet been reduced to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> scale at all.\n\n\"Fig. 1. and 2. ABC is an orthographic delineation of the whole instrument seen in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> in its true proportion. DE is that of the profile, or instrument seen edgewise. FG in both represents a flaxen cord about 35 inches long, suspended by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> peg F, and attached to a loop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> wire at A, which goes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> into the box cover H, and defends the index, &c. from injury; and by a glass exposes the scale to view.\n\n\"Fig. 3. shows the instrument to a larger scale, the upright part being shortened, and the box-cover removed; in which the same letters represent the same parts as in the preceding figures; G1 are two loops or long links of brass wire, which lay hold of the index KL, moveable upon a small stud or centre K. The cord FG is kept moderately strained by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> M of about half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> avoirdupois.\u2014It is obvious, that, as the cord lengthens and shortens, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> end of the index rises and falls, and successively passes over N 2 the scale divided in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> of a circle, and containing 100 equal divisions. This scale is attached to the brass sliding ruler QP, which moves upon the directing piece RR, fixed by screws to the board, which makes the frame or base of the whole; and the scale and ruler NOP is retained in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> nearer to or further from the centre K, as may be required by the screw S.\n\n\"Fig. 4. represents in profile the sliding piece and stud I (fig. 3.), which traverses upon that part of the index next the centre K; and which can, by the two screws of the stud, be retained upon any part of the index that is made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a>; and which is done for three or four inches from the centre, for that purpose. The stud is filed to the edges, like the fulcrum of a scale-beam; one being formed on the under side, the other on the upper, and as near as may be to one another. An hook formed at the lower end of the wire-loops CI, retains the index, by the lowermost edge of the stud; while the weight M hangs by a small hook upon the upper edge: by these means the index is kept steady and the cords strained by the weight, with very little friction or burden upon the central stud K.\n\n\"Fig. 5. is a parallelogram of plate-brass, to keep out dust, which is attached to the upper edge of the box-cover H; and serves to shut the part of the box-cover necessarily cut away, to give leave for the wire GI to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a> with the sliding stud nearer to or farther from the centre of the index K; and where, in fig. 5. a is a hole of about an inch diameter, for the wire GI to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through in the rising and falling of the index freely without touching; b is a slit of a lesser size, sufficient to pass the wire, and admit the cover to come off without deranging the cord or index; c c are two small screws applied to two slits, by which the plate slides lengthwise, in order to adapt the hole c to the wire GI, at any place of the stud I upon the index KL.\n\n\"1. In this construction, the index KL being 12 inches long, 4 inches from the extreme end are filed to narrow in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> in which it is seen by the eye, that any part of these four inches lying over the divisions of the scale, becomes an index thereto. The scale itself slides four inches, so as to be brought under any part of the four inches of the index attenuated as above-mentioned.\n\n\"2. The position of the directing piece RR is so determined as to be parallel to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> line drawn through o upon the scale, and the centre K of the index; consequently, as the attenuated part of the index forms a part of a radius or right line from the same centre, it follows, that whenever the index points to o upon the scale, though the scale is moved nearer to or further from the centre of the index, yet it produces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> change in the place to which the index points.\n\n\"When the divided arch of the scale is at 10 inches from the centre (that is, at its mean distance); then the centre of the arch and the centre of the index are coincident. At other distances, the extremes of which are eight or twelve inches, the centre of the divisions, and the centre of the index pointing thereto, not being coincident, the index cannot move over the spaces geometrically <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to one another in all situations of the scale; yet the whole scale not exceeding 30\u00b0 of a circle, it will be found on computation, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> can never be so great as 1/5th part of the scale, or 1\u00b0 of the hygrometer; which in this instrument being considered as indivisible, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> error will not be sensible.\n\n\"The cord here made use of is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>, and between 1/5th and 1/6th of an inch in diameter; which can be readily ascertained by measuring a number of turns made round a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> or small stick. It is a sort of cord used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> for making nets, and is of that particular kind called by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>-makers flaxen three-threads laid. A competent quantity of this cord was boiled in one pound avoirdupois of water, in which was put two pennyweights <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">troy</a> of common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>; the whole was reduced by boiling to fix ounces avoirdupois, which was done in about half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>. As this ascertains a given strength of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRINE\">brine</a>, on taking out the cord, it may be supposed that every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIBRE\">fibre</a> of the cord is equally impregnated with salt. The cord being dried, it will be proper to stretch it; which may be done so as to prevent it from untwisting, by tying...\nHYG\n\nHygrometer.\n\nthree or four yards to two nails against a wall, in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> position, and hanging a weight of a pound or two to the middle, so as to make it form an obtuse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>. This done for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> or more in a room, will lay the fibres of the cord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> together, and prevent its stretching so fast after being applied to the instrument as it would otherwise be apt to do.\n\n\"The hygrometer is to be adjusted in the following manner. The box-cover being taken off to prevent its being spoiled by the fire, and choosing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> naturally dry, set the instrument nearly upright, about a yard from a moderate fire; so that the cord may become dry, and the instrument warm, but not so near as would spoil the finest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> by too much heat, and yet fully evaporate the moisture; there let the instrument stay till the index is got as low as it will go; now and then stroaking the cord betwixt the thumb and finger downwards, in order to lay the fibres thereof close together; and thereby caulking it to lengthen as much as possible. When the index is thus become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a>, which will generally happen in about an hour, more or less as the air is naturally more or less dry, by means of the peg at top, raise or depress the index, till it lies over the point o. This done, remove the instrument from the fire; and having ready some warm water in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>-cup, take a middling camel's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> pencil, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIPPING\">dipping</a> it in the water, gently anoint the cord till it will drink up no more, and till the index becomes stationary and water will have no more effect upon it, which will also generally happen in about an hour. If in this state the index lies over the degree marked 100, all is right; if not, slack the screw S, and slide the scale nearer to or further from the centre, till the point 100 comes under the index, and then the instrument is adjusted for use; but if the compass of the slide is not sufficient to effect this, as may probably happen on the first adjustment, slack the proper screws, and move the sliding stud I nearer to or further from the centre of the index, according as the angle formed by the index between the two points of dry or wet happens to be too small or too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> for the scale.\"\n\nOn this principle, a simple hygrometer has been made by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVENTRY\">Coventry</a> of Southwark, London. It is not upon the most accurate construction, yet will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> very sensibly in the common changes of the air. Fig. 6 represents the hygrometer as applied to a wall or board. A is a string of whip-cord, catgut, &c. of any length at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>: it is suspended on a bracket B, and kept extended by a weight at the bottom C. DD is a slip of wood, which with the bracket is fixed perpendicularly to a wall or side of a room. It has a straight line E drawn down in the middle of the board, serving to point out the divisions upon the edges of the two thin circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDS\">cards</a> F and G. At the centre of the bottom of each of these cards is glued a piece of cork, through which the string A is drawn: These cork pieces serve to preserve the horizontal position of the cards. The upper card F is divided into 10 equal parts or divisions, and the under card G into 100 equal parts; the string A being measured into 10 equal parts, from the point of suspension H to the surface of the lower card J. The card F is hung at the first part, from H, and the card G at the 10th part from the same point; consequently, from the twisting and untwisting of the string A by the different changes of Hygrometer, the lower card G, from the mechanical principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, will describe 10 revolutions for one of the upper card F; or when the lower card G has made one revolution, the upper card F will have described but the 10th part, or one of its divisions. From whence it appears, that by the affluence of the upper card F, an index is thereby obtained of the number of revolutions the lower card G performs, which are reckoned by the line E on the slip of wood.\n\nExample. It must first be observed what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the card F the line E is against, suppose 3; and also what division of the lower card G is cut by the same line, suppose 10: it then appears, that the state of the hygrometer is thus, 3 degrees and 10 hundredths of another. If the whole 10 divisions of the card have passed the line E, the lower card G will have revolved 10 times, or 10 hundred parts, equal to 1000; the accuracy to which the principle of this simple contrivance answers. Before use, the hygrometer should be adjusted; to do which, the cards F and G are first set to the line E at the 0 of each, or commencement of the graduations: whatever direction the cards afterwards take, it must evidently be from the change to greater moisture or dryness in the air; and they will accordingly point it out.\n\nOn this principle, but with a degree of ingenuity and pains perhaps never before employed, an hygrometer has been constructed by M. de Saufure, professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> at Geneva. In his Essais sur l'Hygrometrie, in 4to, 1783, is an important detail on the subject of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HYGROMETRY\">hygrometry</a>; from which the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of his hygrometer is taken. The author found by repeated experiments, that the difference between the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of a hair, properly prepared, and having a weight of about three grains suspended to it, is nearly \u215b of its whole length; that is, 3\u00bd, or 3\u00bd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> in a foot. This circumstance suggested the idea of a new hygrometer: and, in order to render those small variations perceptible and useful, the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> was constructed.\n\nFig. 7. is a representation of the whole instrument, with the hair and other appendages complete. The lower extremity of the hair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">ab</a> is held by the chaps of the screw pincers b. These pincers are represented aside at B: by a screw at its end, it fastens into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> of the bottom plate C. This nut of the plate turns independently of the piece that supports it, and serves to raise or depress the pincers B at pleasure.\n\nThe upper extremity a of the hair is held by the under chaps of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> pincers a, represented aside at A. These pincers fasten the hair below, and above fasten a very fine narrow slip of silver, carefully annealed, which rolls round the arbor or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a> d, a separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of which is shown at DF. This arbor, which carries the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a> or index e e, or E in the separate figure, is cut into the shape of a screw; and the intervals of the threads of this screw have their bases flat, and are cut squarely so as to receive the slip of silver that is fastened to the pincers a, and joined in this manner with the hair. M. Saufure observes, that hair alone fixed immediately to the arbor would not do; for it curled upon it, and acquired a stiffness that the counterpoise was not able to surmount. The arbor was cut in a screw form, in order that the slip of silver in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>-\ning upon it should not increase the diameter of the arbor, and never take a situation too oblique and variable. The slip is fixed to the arbor by a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> F. The other extremity of the arbor D is shaped like a pulley, flat at the bottom so as to receive a fine supple filken string, to which is suspended the counterpoise G in the large figure, and G in the side one. This counterpoise is applied to distend the hair; and acts in a contrary direction to that of the hair, and the moveable pincers to which the hair is fixed. If then the hair should be loaded with the weight of four grains, the counterpoise must weigh four grains more than the pincers. The arbor at one end passes through the centre of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAL\">dial</a>, and turns therein, in a very fine hole, on a pivot made very cylindrical and well polished; at the other end is also a similar pivot, which turns in a hole made in the end of the arm h of the cock h, H. I. This cock is fixed behind the dial by means of the screw I.\n\nThe dial k e e k, divided into 360 degrees, is supported by two arms //; these are foldered to two tubes, which inclose the cylindrical columns m m m m. The setting screws n n move upon these tubes, and serve thereby to fix the dial and arbor to any height required. The two columns which support the dial are firmly fastened to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of the hygrometer, which rests upon the four screws o o o o; by the affixture of these screws, the instrument is adjusted, and placed in a vertical situation.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> pp, which rests upon the base of the hygrometer, carries a box q, to which is fixed a kind of port-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRAYON\">crayon</a> r, the aperture of which is equal to the diameter of the counterpoise g. When the hygrometer is to be moved from one place to another; to prevent a derangement of the instruments from the oscillations of the counterpoise, the box q and the port-crayon r must be raised up so as the counterpoise may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into and be fixed in it, by tightening the screw s and the box and counterpoise together by the screw t. When the hygrometer is intended for use, the counterpoise must be disengaged by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a> the box, as may be conceived from the figure.\n\nLastly, at the top of the instrument is a curved piece of metal x, y, z, which is fastened to the three columns <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> described, and keeps them together. It has a square hole at y, which serves to hang up the hygrometer by when required.\n\nThe variations of which this hygrometer is capable, are (all things besides equal) as much greater as the arbor round which the slip of fluff winds is than a smaller diameter, and as the instrument is capable of receiving a longer hair. M. Saufure has had hygrometers made with hairs 14 inches long, but he finds one foot sufficient. The arbor is three-fourths of a line in diameter at the base between the threads of the screw or the part on which the slip winds. The variations, when a hair properly prepared is applied to it, are more than an entire circumference, the index describing about 400 degrees in moving from extreme dryness to extreme humidity. M. Saufure mentions an inconvenience attending this hygrometer, viz. its not returning to the same point when moved from one place to another; because the weight of three grains that keeps the fluff slip extended, cannot play so exactly as to act always with the same precision against the arbor round which it winds. But this weight cannot be sensibly increased without still greater inconveniences: he therefore observes, that his hygrometer is well calculated for a fixed situation in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">observatory</a>, and for various hygrometrical experiments; since, instead of the hair, there may be substituted any other substance of which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> may be wanted; and it may be kept extended by a counterpoise more or less heavy as they may require: but the instrument will not admit of being moved, nor serve even for experiments which may subject it to agitation.\n\nTo obviate the objection above-mentioned, M. Saufure has contrived another apparatus more portable and convenient, and which, if not so extensive in its variations, is in fact very firm, and not in the least liable to be deranged by carriage and agitation. Fig. 8. is a representation of this hygrometer, which he calls the portable hygrometer, in distinction from the preceding, which he calls the great hygrometer or the hygrometer with the arbor. The material part of this instrument is its index a b c e; an horizontal view of which, and the arm that carries it, is seen in the separate figure G B D E F. This index carries in its centre D a thin tube hollow throughout, and projects out on each side of the needle. The axis which passes through it, and round which the index turns, is made thin in the middle of its length and thick at the ends; so that the cylindrical tube which it passes through touches it only at two points, and acts upon it only at its extremities.\n\nThe part d e DE of the index serves to point out and mark on the dial the degrees of moisture and dryness; the opposite part d b DB serves to fix both the hair and counterpoise. This part, which terminates in a portion of a circle, and is about a line in thickness, is cut on its edge in a double vertical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a>, which makes this part similar to the segment of a pulley with a double neck. These two grooves, which are portions of a circle of two lines radius, and have the same centre with that of the index d, serve in one of them to contain the hair, and in the other the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, to the end of which the counterpoise is suspended. The same index carries vertically above and below its centre two small screw-pincers, situated opposite to the two grooves: that above at a, opposite to the hindmost groove, serves to fix to the silk to which the counterpoise is suspended; and that below at b, opposite to the hitherto most groove, serves to hold one of the ends of the hair. Each of these grooves has its partitions cut, as seen in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> B, and its bottom made flat, in order that the hair and silk may have the greatest freedom possible. The axis of the needle DD goes through the arm g f G F, and it is fixed to this arm by the tightening screw f E. All the parts of the index should be in perfect equilibrium about its centre; so that when it is on its pivot without the counterpoise, it will rest indifferently in any position it may be placed in.\n\nIt must be understood, that when the hair is fixed by one of its extremities in the pincers e, and by the other end on the pincers y at the top of the instrument, it passes in one of the necks of the double pulley b, whilst the counterpoise to which the silk is fixed in a passes in the other neck of the same pulley: the counterpoise serves to keep the hair extended, and acts always in the same direction and with the same force, whatever...\nHygrometer\u2014whatever the situation of the index may be. When therefore the dryness contracts the hair, it overpowers the gravity of the counterpoise, and the index descends; when, on the contrary, the humidity relaxes the hair, it gives way to the counterpoise, and the index ascends. The counterpoise should weigh but three grains; so that the index should be made very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and very easy in its motion, in order that the least possible force may move it and bring it back again to its point when drawn aside.\n\nThe dial \\( h \\) is circular arch, the centre of which is the same with that of the index. This arch is divided into degrees of the same circle, or into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a> of the interval which is found between the limits of extreme dryness and extreme humidity. The interior edge of the dial carries at the distance \\( h \\) a kind of projecting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDLE\">bridle</a> or stay \\( i \\), made of brass wire, curved to the arch, and fixed in the points \\( i \\). This bridle retains and guards the index, at the same time leaving it to play with the requisite freedom. The screw-pincers \\( y \\), in which is fastened the upper extremity of the hair, is carried by a moveable arm, which ascends and descends at pleasure the length of the frame \\( K \\). This frame is cylindrical everywhere else, except its being here flattened at the hinder part to about half its thickness, in order that the piece with the screw which carries the arm should not project out underneath, and that the arm may not turn. The arm may be stopped at any desired height by means of the pressing screw \\( x \\). But as it is of use sometimes to be able to give the instrument a very small and accurate motion, so as to bring the index exactly to the part that may be wanted, the slide piece \\( l \\), which carries the pincers \\( y \\), to which the hair is fixed, is to be moved by the adjusting screw \\( m \\).\n\nAt the base of the instrument is a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVER\">lever</a> \\( n o p q \\), which serves to fix the index and its counterpoise when the hygrometer is to be moved. The lever turns an axis \\( n \\), terminated by a screw which goes into the frame; in tightening this screw, the lever is fixed in the desired position. When the motion of the index is to be stopped, the intended position is given to this lever, as represented in the dotted lines of the figure. The long neck \\( p \\) of the lever lays hold of the double pulley \\( b \\) of the index, and the short neck \\( o \\) of the counterpoise: the tightening screw \\( q \\) fastens the two necks at once. In confining the index, it must be so placed, that the hair be very slack; so that, if whilst it is moved the hair should get dry, it may have room to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> itself. Afterwards, when the instrument is placed for use, the first thing to be done is to relax the screw \\( n \\), and turn back the double lever with great care, taking equal caution at the same time not to strain the hair. It is better to apply one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> to the index near its centre, whilst the other hand is disengaging the pulley and the counterpoise from the lever that holds them steady. The hook \\( r \\) serves to suspend a thermometer upon; it should be a mercurial one, with a very small naked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>, so as to show in the most sensible manner the changes of the air: it should be mounted in metal, and guarded in such a manner as not to vibrate so as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the hair. Lastly a notch is made under the top of the frame \\( s \\), to mark the point of suspension, about which the instrument is in equilibrium, and keeps a vertical situation.\n\nAll the instrument should be made of brass: though Hygrometer\u2014the axis of the index and its tube <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> more pleasantly together if made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>-metal.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of this hygrometer's variations is not more than the fourth or fifth part of the hygrometer with the arbor. It may be augmented by making the segment of the pulley to which the hair is fixed of a smaller diameter; but then the hair, in moving about it, would fret and contract a stiffness, which would cause it to adhere to the bottom of the neck. M. Sauflure is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that the radius of this pulley should not be less than two lines, at least that there should be adapted a plate of silver or some other contrivance; but then the hygrometer would be too difficult to construct, and it would require too much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> and care on the part of those who use it: his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> was, to make an instrument generally useful, and easy and convenient in its use. The hygrometer with the arbor may be used for observations which require an extreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>.\n\nThe variations of this instrument may be augmented by making it higher, because in that case longer hairs might be adapted; but it would be then less portable. Besides, if the hair is too long when observations are made in the open air, the wind has too great an effect upon it, and thus communicates to the index inconvenient vibrations. It is not proper therefore to make it more than a foot in height. When it is of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a>, an hair properly prepared can be applied to it, and its variations from extreme dryness to extreme humidity are 80 or even 100 degrees; which on a circle of 3 inches radius forms an extent sufficient for observations of this kind. M. Sauflure has even made smaller instruments that may be carried conveniently in the pocket, and to make experiments with under small receivers: they were but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> by two inches of breadth; which, notwithstanding their variations, were very sensible.\n\nThus much for the construction of the various parts of the instrument. The limits of this work will not admit of our inserting the whole of M. Sauflure's subsequent account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of the hair, the manner of determining the limits of extreme humidity and of extreme dryness, the pyrometrical variations of the hair, and the graduation of the hygrometer. The following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> must therefore suffice.\n\nIn the preparation of the hair, it was found necessary to free it of a certain unctuousity it always has in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> state, which in a great measure deprives it of its hygrometrical sensibility. A number of hairs are boiled in a ley of vegetable alkali; and among these are to be chosen for use such as are most transparent, bright, and soft: particular precautions are necessary for preventing the straining of the hair, which renders it unfit for the intended purpose.\n\nThe two fixed points of the hygrometer are the extremes both of moisture and dryness. The former is obtained by exposing the instrument to air completely saturated with water; and this is effected by placing it in a glass receiver standing in water, the sides of which are kept continually moistened. The point on the dial, at which the hand after a certain interval remains stationary, is marked 100. The point of extreme dryness, not absolute dryness, for that does not exist,\nexist, but the greatest degree of it that can be obtained, is produced by introducing repeatedly into the same receiver containing the instrument, and standing now upon quicksilver, certain quantities of deliquescent alkaline salts, which absorb the moisture of the air. The highest point to which the hand can be brought by this operation, not only when it will rise no higher, but when it becomes retrograde from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a> occasioned by heat, is called 0; and the arch between these two points is divided into 100 equal parts, being degrees of the hygrometer. The arch PP, upon which the scale is marked in the instrument (represented in fig. 2.) being part of a circle of three inches diameter; hence every degree <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> about one third of a line.\n\nIn the stationary hygrometer, fig. 1., the scale upon the complete circular dial is so much larger, that every degree measures about five lines; but this M. Saufire considers as far from being a perfection, that it is rather an inconvenience; since the instrument becomes thereby so very susceptible of the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>, that there is even no approaching it without a sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a>. The thermometer, adapted as before mentioned, serves to correct the changes of temperature: towards the extreme of dryness, 1\u00b0 of the thermometer produces on the hair an effect of half a degree of the hygrometer, but towards the extreme of moisture, the same difference of temperature causes an effect no less than 3\u00b0 on the hygrometer. He constructed two tables, that gave the intermediate hygrometrical variations for single degrees of the thermometer at different parts of the scale.\n\nThe whole range of the atmospherical variations takes in about 75\u00b0 of this scale; a dryness of more than 25\u00b0 being always the effect of art. The sensibility of this instrument is so very great, that being exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEW\">dew</a>, he mentions that it varies above 45\u00b0 in about 20 minutes of time. Being removed from a very moist into a very dry air, it varied in one instance no less than 35\u00b0 in three minutes. He says that its variations were always found uniform in different instruments suspended in different parts of the same atmosphere. This hygrometer is considered by the author as possessed of all the properties requisite in such an instrument. These are, 1. That the degrees in the scale be sufficiently large, and to point out even the least variation in the dryness or moisture of the atmosphere. 2. That it be quick in its indications. 3. That it be at all times consistent with itself; viz. that in the same state of the hair it always points to the same degree. 4. That several of them agree with one another. 5. That it be affected only by the aqueous vapours. 6. That its variations be ever proportionate to the changes in the air.\n\nBut after all it must be observed, that a considerable degree of trouble and delicacy is requisite in the preparation of the hair, and it is very fragile; circumstances which may prevent it from coming into general use among common observers, although probably it may be the best in principle of any yet made.\n\nInstead of hairs or cat-gut, of which hygrometers of the first kind are commonly made, Caffebois, a Benedictine monk at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENTZ\">Mentz</a>, proposed to make such hygrometers of the gut of a silk-worm. When that insect is ready to spin, there are found in it two vessels proceeding from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> to the stomach, to which they adhere, and then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> towards the back, where they form a great many folds. The part of these vessels next the stomach is of a cylindric form, and about a line in diameter. These vessels contain a gummy sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> from which the worm spins its silk; and, though they are exceedingly tender, means have been devised to extract them from the insect, and to prepare them for the above purpose. When the worm is about to spin, it is thrown into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a>, and suffered to remain there twenty-four hours; during which time the vinegar is absorbed into the body of the insect, and coagulates its juices. The worm being then opened, both the vessels, which have now acquired strength, are extracted; and, on account of their pliability, are capable of considerable extension. That they may not, however, become too weak, they are stretched only to the length of about fifteen or twenty inches. It is obvious that they must be kept sufficiently extended till they are completely dry. Before they attain to that state, they must be freed, by means of the nail of the finger, from a slimy substance which adheres to them. Such a thread will sustain a weight of six pounds without breaking, and may be used for an hygrometer in the same manner as cat-gut; but we confess that we do not clearly perceive its superiority.\n\nII. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> general principle, namely, that De Luc's, of the swelling of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> bodies by moisture, and their contraction by dryness, M. de Luc's instrument is the best. He makes choice of ivory for the construction of his hygrometer, because he finds that, being once wetted, ivory regularly swells by moisture, and returns exactly to the same dimensions when the moisture is evaporated, which other bodies do not. This hygrometer is represented in fig. 9., where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AA\">aa</a> b is an ivory tube, open at the end aa, and close at b. It is made of a piece of ivory taken at the distance of some inches from the top, of a pretty large elephant's tooth, and likewise at the same distance from its surface and from the canal which reaches to that point. (This particular direction is given, that the texture of the ivory in all different hygrometers may be the same, which is of great importance.) This piece is to be bored exactly in the direction of its fibres; the hole must be very straight, its dimensions 2\u00bd lines in diameter, and 2 inches 8 lines in depth from aa to c. Its bore is then to be exactly filled with a brass cylinder, which, however, must project somewhat beyond the ivory tube; and thus it is to be turned on a proper machine, till the thickness of the ivory is exactly \u00bc of a line, except at the two extremities. At the bottom b the tube ends in a point; and at the top aa it must for about two lines be left a little thicker, to enable it to bear the pressure of another piece put upon it. Thus the thin or hygrometrical part of the tube will be reduced to 2\u00bc French inches, including the concavity of the bottom. Before this piece is used, it must be put into water, so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> part alone may be wetted by it; and here it is to remain till the water penetrates to the inside, and appears in the form of dew, which will happen in a few hours. The reason of this is, that the ivory tube remains somewhat larger ever after it is wetted the first time.\n\nFor this hygrometer, a glass tube must be provided, about 14 inches long, the lower end of which is shown in ddee. Its internal diameter is about \u00bc of a line.\nIf now the ivory tube is exactly filled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>, and the glass one affixed to it, as the capacity of the former decreases by being dried, the mercury will be forced up into the glass one.\n\nThe piece \\( ffg \\) is intended to join the ivory with the glass tube. It is of brafs, shaped as in the figure. A cylindrical hole is bored through it, which holds the glass tube as tight as possible without danger of breaking it; and its lower part is to enter with some degree of difficulty into the ivory pipe. To hinder that part of the tube which incloses the brafs piece from being affected by the variations of the moisture, it is covered with a brafs vellor represented in \\( hhi \\).\n\nThe pieces must be united together with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>-lac or mastic.\n\nThe introduction of the mercury is the next operation. For this purpose, a slip of paper three inches wide is first to be rolled over the glass tube, and tied fast to the extremity nearest the ivory pipe. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>-hair is then to be introduced into the tube, long enough to enter the ivory pipe by an inch, and to reach three or four inches beyond the extremity of the glass one. The paper which has been shaped round the tube must now be raised, and used as a funnel to pour the mercury into the instrument, which is held upright. The purest quicksilver is to be used for this purpose, and it will therefore be proper to use that riveted from cinna- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>. It easily runs into the tube; and the air escapes by means of the horse-hair, assisted with some gentle shakes. Fresh mercury must from time to time be supplied, to prevent the mercurial tube from being totally emptied; in which case, the mercurial pellicle which always forms by the contact of the air, would run in along with it.\n\nSome air-bubbles generally remain in the tube; they may be seen through the ivory pipe, which is thin enough to have some transparency. These being collected together by shaking, must be brought to the top of the tube, and expelled by means of the horse-hair. To facilitate this operation, some part of the mercury must be taken out of the tube, in order that the air may be less obstructed in getting out, and the horse-hair have a free motion to assist it. Air, however, cannot be entirely driven out in this manner. It is the weight of the mercury with which the tube is for that reason to be filled, which in time completes its expulsion, by making it pass through the pores of the ivory. To hasten this, the hygrometers are put into a proper box. This is fixed nearly in a vertical direction to the saddle of a horse, which is set a trotting for a few hours. The shakes sometimes divide the column of mercury in the glass tube, but it is easily re-united with the horse-hair. When upon shaking the hygrometer vertically, no small tremulous motion is any longer perceived in the upper part of the column, one may be sure that all the air is gone out.\n\nThe scale of this hygrometer may be adjusted, as soon as the air is gone out, in the following manner. The instrument is to be suspended in a vessel of water cooled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>, fresh quantities of which are to be added as the former melts. Here it is to remain till it has sunk as low as it will sink by the enlargement of the capacity of the ivory tube, owing to the moisture it has imbibed. This usually happens in seven or eight hours, and is to be carefully noted. In two or three hours the mercury begins to ascend, because the moisture passes into the cavity, and forces it up. The lowest station of the mercury is then to be marked; and for the more accurate marking the degrees on the scale, M. de Luc always chose to have his hygrometric tube made of one which had formerly belonged to a thermometer. The reason of this is, that in the thermometer the expansion of the mercury by heat had been already determined. The distance between the thermometrical points of melting ice and boiling water at 27 French inches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a> was found to be 1937 parts. The bulb of this preparatory thermometer was broke in a basin, in order to receive carefully all the mercury that it contained. This being weighed in nice scales amounted to 1428 grains. The hygrometer contained 460 grains of the same mercury. Now it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, that the extent of the degrees on the hygrometer, ought to be to that of the degrees on the preparatory thermometer as the different weights of the mercury contained in each; consequently 1428 : 460 :: 1937 : 624 nearly; and therefore the corresponding intervals ought to follow the same proportion: and thus the length of a scale was obtained, which might be divided into as many parts as he pleased.\n\nFig. 10. is a representation of De Luc's hygrometer when fully constructed. In elegance it far exceeds Smeaton's or any other, and probably also in accuracy; for by means of a small thermometer fixed on the board along with it, the expansion of the mercury by heat may be known with great accuracy, and of consequence how much of the height of the mercury in the hygrometer is owing to that cause, and how much to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> moisture of the atmosphere.\n\nM. de Luc having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> his inquiries further into the modifications of the atmosphere, mentions in his Id\u00e9e sur la M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie another hygrometer, which he finds to be the best adapted to the measure of local humidity. Of all the hygroscopic substances which he tried for this purpose, that which answers the best is a slip of whalebone cut transversely to the direction of the fibres, and made extremely thin; for on this depends its sensibility. A slip of 12 inches in length and a line in breadth, he has made so thin as to weigh only half a grain; and it may be made still thinner, but is then of too great sensibility, being affected even by the approach of the observer. This slip is kept extended by a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, and the variations in its length are measured by a vernier division, or by, which is perhaps better, an index on a dial plate: the whole variation from extreme dryness to extreme moisture is about \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of its length.\n\nIn these hygrometers, which are made by the instrument-makers in London, the slip of whalebone is mounted in a frame very similar to that belonging to M. Sauflure's hygrometer before described (see fig. 7.) The only material difference is, that a small concentric wire spring is used, instead of a counterpoise, to keep the slip of whalebone extended. M. Sauflure had tried such a spring applied to his hairs; but the weakest spring he found too strong for the hair; and he was further apprehensive, that the variations which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, heat, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> infallibly make, would suffer from the force of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>.\n\nM. de Luc, in the hygrometers he formerly made, as before described (made of ivory), had graduated them from\nHygrometers from one fixed point only, that of extreme moisture, which is obtained by soaking them in water. He has now very ingeniously contrived to fix the other extreme, that of dryness; but this being producible only by means of strong fires, such as hygrometers cannot support, he uses an intermediate body, quicklime; which after having been deprived, by force of fire, of all its own humidity, has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of slowly imbibing humidity again from the bodies in its neighbourhood; and whose capacity is such that all the vapour that can be contained in a quantity of air equal to its own bulk, can give it no sensible humidity. These hygrometers, inclosed with a large quantity of fresh burnt lime in lumps, acquire in three weeks the same degree of dryness with the lime, which cannot differ sensibly from extreme dryness.\n\nM. de Sauffure makes choice of hairs, prepared by maceration in alkaline lye. M. de Luc shows that hairs, and all other animal or vegetable substances, taken lengthwise, or in the direction of their fibres, undergo contrary changes from different variations of humidity; that, when immersed in water, they lengthen at first, and afterwards shorten; that when they are near the greatest degree of humidity, if the moisture is increased, they shorten themselves; if it is diminished, they lengthen themselves first before they contract again. These irregularities, which obviously render them incapable of being true measures of humidity, he shows to be the necessary consequence of their organic reticular structure.\n\nM. de Sauffure takes his point of extreme moisture from the vapours of water under a glass bell, keeping the sides of the bell continually moistened; and affirms, that the humidity is there constantly the same in all temperatures; the vapours even of boiling water having no more effect than those of cold. M. de Luc shows, on the contrary, that the differences of humidity under the bell are very great, though M. Sauffure's hygrometer was incapable of discovering them; and that the real undecomposed vapour of boiling water has the directly opposite effect to that of cold, the effect of extreme dryness; and on this point he mentions an interesting fact, communicated to him by Mr Watt, viz., that wood cannot be employed in the steam engine for any of those parts where the vapour of the boiling water is confined, because it dries so as to crack, just as if exposed to the fire. In M. de Luc's work above mentioned there are striking instances related, in which the imperfection of M. Sauffure's hygrometer led him into false conclusions respecting phenomena, and into erroneous theories to account for them.\n\nIII. On the third principle, namely, the alteration of the weight of certain substances by their attracting the moisture of the air, few attempts have been made, nor do they seem to have been attended with much success. Sponges dipped in a solution of alkaline salts, and some kinds of paper, have been tried. These are suspended to one end of a very accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a>, and counterpoised by weights at the other, and show the degrees of moisture or dryness by the ascent or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> of one of the ends. But, besides that such kinds of hygrometers are destitute of any fixed point from whence to begin their scale, they have another inconvenience (from which indeed Smeaton's is not free, and which has been found to render it erroneous), namely, that all saline substances are destroyed by long continued exposure to the air in very small quantities, and therefore can only imbibe the moisture for a certain time. Sulphuric acid has therefore been recommended in preference to the alkaline or neutral salts, and, indeed, for such as do not choose to be at the trouble of constructing a hygrometer on the principles of Mr Smeaton or De Luc, this will probably be found the most easy and accurate. Fig. 11 represents an hygrometer of this kind. A is a small glass cup containing a small quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> of vitriol, B an index counterpoising it, and C the scale; where it is plain, that as the oil of vitriol attracts the moisture of the air, the scale will descend, which will raise the index, and vice versa. This liquor is exceedingly sensible of the increase or decrease of moisture. A single grain, after its full increase, has varied its equilibrium so sensibly that the tongue of a balance, only an inch and a half long, has described an arch, one-third of an inch in compass (which arch would have been almost three inches if the tongue had been one foot), even with so small a quantity of liquor; consequently, if more liquor, expanded under a large surface, were used, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of scales might afford as nice an hygrometer as any kind yet invented. A great inconvenience, however, is, that as the air must have full access to the liquid, it is impossible to keep out the dust, which, by continually adding its weight, must render the hygrometer false; add to this, that even oil of vitriol itself is by time destroyed, and changes its nature, if a small quantity of it is continually exposed to the air.\n\nThe best hygrometer upon this principle, and for ascertaining the quantity as well as the degree of moisture in the variation of the hygrometer, is of the contrivance of Mr Coventry, Southwark, London. The account he has favoured us with is as follows.\n\n\"Take two sheets of fine tissue paper, such as is used by haters; dry them carefully at about two feet distance from a tolerably good fire, till after repeatedly weighing them in a good pair of scales no moisture remains. When the sheets are in this perfectly dry state, reduce them to exactly 50 grains; the hygrometer is then fit for use. The sheets must be kept free from dust, and exposed a few minutes in the open air; after which it may be always known by weighing them the exact quantity of moisture they have imbibed.\n\n\"For many years the hygrometer has (says Mr Coventry) engrossed a considerable share of my attention; and every advantage proposed by others, either as it respected the substances of which the instrument was composed, or the manner in which its operations were to be discerned, has been impartially examined. But (adds he) I have never seen an hygrometer so simple in itself, or that would act with such certainty or so equally alike, as the one I have now described. The materials of which it is composed being thin, are easily deprived wholly of their moisture; which is a circumstance efficiently necessary in fixing a datum from which to reckon, and which, I think, cannot be said of any substance hitherto employed in the construction of hygrometers; with equal facility they imbibe or impart the humidity of the atmosphere, and show with the greatest exactness when the least alteration takes place.\"\nWhen the paper is prepared, as already described, it will serve, without the trouble of drying, as a standard for any number of sheets intended for the same purpose. But then the sheets must be kept together in the open air for a few hours; because whatever alteration may take place by this exposure, the paper already weighed must have undergone the same; being consequently in the same state, they must be cut to the same weight.\n\nFor easier weighing the paper, take a piece of round tin or brass the size of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>-piece, through the centre of which drill a hole, and also three others round it at equal distances; then cut about one hundred papers; and after putting them under the tin or brass, drive through each hole a strong pin into a board, in order to round them to the shape of the plate: the papers must be then separated and exposed to the air a few hours with that already weighed, and so many of them taken as are equal to the weight already specified. This done, threadle them together through those holes made by the pins, putting between every paper on each thread a small bead, in order to prevent the papers from touching each other, and also that the air may be more readily admitted. The top of the hygrometer is covered with a card cut to the same size; and which, by reason of its stiffness, supports all the papers, and keeps them in proper shape. Before the papers are threaded, the beads, silk, card, and a thin piece of brass about the size of a sixpence, which must be placed at the bottom, and through which the centre string passes, must be weighed with the greatest exactness, in order to bring them to a certain weight, suppose 50 grains; now the paper in its driest state being of equal weight, they will weigh together 100 grains, consequently what they weigh more at any time is moisture.\n\nTo obviate the trouble and difficulty of making experiments with weights and scales, Mr Coventry contrived a machine or scale by which to determine at one view the humidity or dryness of the atmosphere. This, with its case, is represented by fig. 12. The front and back of the case are glass; the sides fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAUZE\">gauze</a>, which excludes the dust and admits the air; the case is about ten inches high, 8 inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and 4 inches deep. A, a brass bracket in front, behind which, at about 3\u00bd inches distance, is another; these support the axis of the index E, also of the beam D, and another which supports the item B, to which the ivory scale of divisions C is fixed. G, a brass scale suspended in the usual manner to the end of a beam D, and weighing exactly 100 grains. This scale is an exact counterpoise to the papers I and the different apparatus. The particular manner of suspension in this balance is, from the construction, as follows: The axis of the beam G, which is made of brass, instead of hanging on pivots, as in common scales, turns with two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> edges k k, fixed in the extremities of the brass axis; these edges are shaped like the edge of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, and act on two steel concave edges l l, in order to render the friction as small as possible. D, is a fine scale beam fixed at right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> with the axis G. E, the steel index fixed to the under side of the same axis. F, a brass sliding weight: h is the axis that holds the item B to which the scale of divisions C is fixed. AA, the brass brackets which support the whole by four screws, two of which are seen at i i, that screw the Hygrometer brackets to the top of the case. The axis of the scale of divisions is hung on pivots, one of which is seen at m, that, should the case not stand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>, the item B may always be in a perpendicular situation.\n\nThe hygrometer, before use, should be adjusted as follows: To the end of the beam where the hygrometer is suspended, hang a weight of 100 grains, which is equal to the weight of the scale; then move the sliding weight F up or down the index E, till one grain will cause the index to traverse neither more nor less than the whole scale of divisions; then add half a grain to the scale, in order to bring the index to 0; and the instrument, after taking off the 100 grain weight and hanging on the papers, is fit for use; then put grain weights in the scale till the index is brought within compass of the scale of divisions. Example: H is 3 grains on the brass scale, and the index points at 10; consequently there is 3 grains and 10 hundredths of a grain of moisture in the papers. If four grain weights are kept, viz. 1, 2, 4, and 5, they will make any number from 1 to 9, which are as many as will be wanted. Sometimes the index will continue traversing within the scale of divisions for many days without shifting the weights; but if otherwise, they must be changed as occasion may require.\n\n\"One great advantage of this hygrometer above all others that have attracted my notice is (says Mr Coventry), that it acts from a certain datum, namely, the dry extreme; from which all the variations towards moist are calculated with certainty: and if constructed with that precision represented by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a>, it will afford pleasure to the curious in observing the almost perpetual alteration of the atmosphere, even in the most settled weather. In winter it will be constantly traversing from about eight in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> till four or five in the afternoon, towards dry; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, from about four in the morning till six or seven in the evening, when the weather is hot and gloomy, the hygrometer discovers a very great change towards moisture; and when clear and frosty, that it contains a much greater quantity of moisture than is generally imagined.\"\n\nAn improvement has been proposed of this kind of hygrometer, of which the following circumstance, it is said, suggested the first hint. While Mr Lowitz was at Dmitriewsk in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRACAN\">Astracan</a>, he found on banks of the Wolga, a thin bluish kind of slate which attracted moisture remarkably soon, but again suffered it as soon to escape. A plate of this slate weighed, when brought to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> heat, 175 grains, and, when saturated with water, 247: it had therefore imbibed, between complete dryness and the point of complete moisture, 72 grains of water. Lowitz suspended a round thin plate of this slate at the end of a very delicate balance, fastened within a wooden frame, and suspended at the other arm a chain of silver wire, the end of which was made fast to a sliding nut that moved up and down in a small groove on the edge of one side of the frame. He determined, by trial, the position of the nut when the balance was in equilibrium and when it had ten degrees of over-weight, and divided the space between these two points into ten equal parts, adding such a number more of these parts as might be necessary. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> was suspended from the one arm\nof the balance, and at the other a weight equal to 175 grains, or the weight of the stone when perfectly dry, the nut in the groove shewed the excess of weight in grains when it and the chain were so adjusted that the balance stood in equilibrium. A particular apparatus on the same principles as a vernier, applied to the nut, shewed the excess of weight to ten parts of a grain.\n\nLowitz remarked that this hygrometer in continued wet weather gave a moisture of more than 1.5 grains, and in a continued heat of 113 degrees of Fahrenheit only 1\u00bd degree of moisture.\n\nThe hygrometer thus invented by Lowitz was, however, attended with this fault, that it never threw off the moisture in the same degree as the atmosphere became drier. It was also sometimes very deceitful, and announced moisture when it ought to have indicated that dryness had again begun to take place in the atmosphere. To avoid these inconveniences, M. Hochheimer proposes the following method:\n\n1. Take a square bar of steel about two lines in thickness, and from ten to twelve inches in length, and form it into a kind of balance, one arm of which ends in a screw. On this screw let there be screwed a leaden bullet of proper weight, instead of the common weights that are suspended.\n\n2. Take a glass plate about ten inches long, and seven inches in breadth; destroy its polish on both sides, free it from all moisture by rubbing it over with warm ashes, suspend it at the other end of the balance, and bring the balance into equilibrium by screwing up or down the leaden bullet.\n\n3. Mark now the place to which the leaden bullet is brought by the screw, as accurately as possible, for the point of the greatest dryness.\n\n4. Then take away the glass plate from the balance, dip it completely in water, give it a shake that the drops may run off from it, and wipe them carefully from the edge.\n\n5. Apply the glass plate thus moistened again to the balance, and bring the latter into equilibrium by screwing the leaden bullet. Mark then the place at which the bullet stands as the highest degree of moisture.\n\n6. This apparatus is to be suspended in a small box of well dried wood, sufficiently large to suffer the glass plate to move up and down. An opening must be made in the lid, exactly of such a size as to allow the tongue of the balance to move freely. Parallel to the tongue apply a graduated circle, divided into a number of degrees at pleasure, from the highest point of dryness to the highest degree of moisture. The box must be pierced with small holes on all the four sides, to give a free passage to the air; and to prevent moisture from penetrating into the wood by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, when it may be requisite to expose it at a window, it must either be lacquered or painted. To <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> it at all times from rain, it may be furnished with a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a>.\n\nFor a description of Mr Leflie's Hygrometer, fig. 13, and in a more portable form, fig. 14.

This membrane is supposed to be stretched in the neck of the womb of virgins, below the nymphae, leaving in some subjects a very small opening,\nin others larger, and in all rendering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> orifice narrower than the rest of the cavity, and to be broke when they are deflowered; an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of blood following the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a>.\n\nThe membranous circle may likewise suffer some disorder by too great a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a> of the menes, by imprudence, levity, and other particular accidents.\n\nThe hymen is generally looked upon as the test of virginity; and when broke, or withdrawn, shows that the person is not in a state of innocence. This notion is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a>. Among the Hebrews, it was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> for the parents to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the blood shed on this occasion as a token of the virginity of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a>, and to send the sheets next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> to the husband's relations. And the like is said to be still practised in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, and some other countries.\n\nAnd yet authors are not agreed as to the existence of such a membrane. Nothing, Dr Drake observes, has employed the curiosity of anatomists, in dissecting the organs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> in women, more than this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a>: they have differed not only as to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, substance, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and perforation, but even its reality; some positively affirming, and others flatly denying it.\n\nDe Graaf himself, the most accurate inquirer into the structure of these organs, confesses he always sought it in vain, though in the most unsuspected subjects and ages: all he could find was, a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of straitness or wideness, and different corrugations, which were greater or less according to the respective ages; the aperture being still the least, and the rugosities the greatest, as the subject was younger and more untouched.\n\nDr Drake, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, declares, that in all the subjects he had opportunity to examine, he does not remember to have missed the hymen so much as once, where he had reason to depend on finding it. The fairest view he ever had of it was in a maid who died at thirty years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>; in this he found it a membrane of some strength, furnished with flabby fibres, in figure round, and perforated in the middle with a small hole, capable of admitting the end of a woman's little finger, and situated a little above the orifice of the urinary passage, at the entrance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VAGINA\">vagina</a> of the womb.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> it is a fine thin membrane, not very conspicuous, because of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> straitness of the passage itself, which does not admit of any great expansion in so little room; which might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> De Graaf into a notion of its being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more than a corrugation.\n\nThis membrane, like most others, does probably grow more distinct, as well as firm, by age. That it not only exists, but is sometimes very strong and impervious, may be collected from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> reported by Mr Cowper. In a married woman, twenty years of age, whose hymen was found altogether impervious, so as to detain the menes, and to be driven out by the prelude thereof beyond the labia of the pudendum, not unlike a prolapsus of the uterus; on dividing it, at least a gallon of grumous blood came forth. It seems the husband, being denied a passage that way, had found another through the meatus urinarius; which was found very open, and its sides extended like the anus of a cock.\n\nUpon a rupture of the hymen, after the consummation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, and especially delivery, its parts shrinking up, are supposed to form those little fleshy Hymen\u00e6a knots, called Carunculae myrtiformes.\n\nHymen\u00e6a, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASTARD\">bastard</a> locust tree; a genus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, belonging to the decandria clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 33rd order, Lomentaceae.

Her father, encouraged by her extraordinary genius, had her not only educated in all the ordinary qualifications of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, but instructed in the most abstruse sciences. She made such great progress in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, that she passed for the most learned person of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. At length she was thought worthy to succeed her father in that distinguished and important employment, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the school of Alexandria; and to teach out of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMONIUS\">Ammonius</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIEROCLES\">Hierocles</a>, and many other great men, had taught before; and this at a time too when men of great learning abounded both at Alexandria and in many other parts of the Roman empire. Her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> was so extensive, and her worth so universally acknowledged, that we cannot wonder <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> she had a crowded auditory.\n\nShe explained to her hearers (says <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a>) the several sciences that go under the general name of philosophy; for which reason there was a confluence to her from all parts of those who made philosophy their delight and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>. One cannot represent to himself, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, the flower of all the youth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, sitting at the feet of a very beautiful lady (for such we are assured Hypatia was), all greedily swallowing instruction from her mouth, and many of them, doubtless, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> from her eyes; though we are not sure that she ever listened to any solicitations, since Suidas, who talks of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> with Isidorus, yet relates at the same time that she died a maid.\n\nHer scholars were as eminent as they were numerous; one of whom was the celebrated Synesius, who was afterwards bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMAIS\">Ptolemais</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Christian Platonist everywhere bears the strongest, as well as the most grateful, testimony of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of his tutors; and never mentions her without the most profound respect, and sometimes in terms of affection coming little short of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a>. But it was not Synesius only, and the disciples of the Alexandrian school, who admired Hypatia for her virtue and learning: never was woman more cared for by the public, and yet never woman had a more unspotted character. She was held as an oracle for her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, which made her consulted by the magistrates in all important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>; and this frequently drew her among the greatest concourse of men, without the least censure of her manners. In a word, when Nicephorus intended to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> the highest compliment on the princess Eudocia, he thought he could not do it better than by calling her another Hypatia.\n\nWhile Hypatia thus reigned the brightest ornament of Alexandria, Orestes was governor of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Theodosius, and Cyril was bishop <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a>. Orestes having had a liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, could not but admire Hypatia; and as a wise governor frequently consulted her. This, together with an aversion which Cyril had against Orestes, proved fatal to the lady. About 500 monks assembling, attacked the governor one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and would have killed him, had he not been rescued by the townsmen; and the respect which Orestes had for Hypatia causing her to be traduced among the Christian multitude, they dragged her from her chair, tore her to pieces, and burned her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a>. Cyril is not clear from a suspicion of fomenting this tragedy. Cave indeed endeavours to remove the imputation of such an horrible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> from the patriarch; and lays it upon the Alexandrian mob in general, whom he calls levissimum hominum genus, \"a very trifling discontented people.\" But though Cyril should be allowed neither to have been the perpetrator, nor even the contriver of it, yet it is much to be suspected that he did not discontinue it in the manner he ought to have done; which suspicion must needs be greatly confirmed by reflecting, that he was so far from blaming the outrage committed by the monks upon Orestes, that he afterwards received the dead body of Ammonius, one of the most forward in that outrage, who had grievously wounded the governor, and who was justly punished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. Upon this riotous ruffian Cyril made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PANEGYRIC\">panegyric</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> where he was laid, in which he extolled his courage and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a>, as one that had contended for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>; and changing his name to Thaumaturgus, or the \"Admirable,\" ordered him to be considered as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARTYR\">martyr</a>. \"However, (continues Socrates), the wisest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> did not approve the zeal which Cyril showed on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>'s behalf, being convinced that Ammonius had justly suffered for his desperate attempt.\"","sp":21,"ep":21},{"h":"HYPECOM","t":"WILD CUMIN, a genus of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> belonging to the tetrandria clas; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> method ranking under the 24th order, Corydalis.

The reason is, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> object contracts the mind, and fetters its powers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>; but that the mind, dilated and inflamed with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> object, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDS\">moulds</a> objects for its gratification with great facility. Longinus, with respect to a diminishing hyperbole, cites the following ludicrous thought from a comic poet: \"He was owner of a bit of ground not larger than a Lacedemonian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>.\" But, for the reason now given, the hyperbole has by far the greater force in magnifying objects; of which take the following example:\n\nFor all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> which thou seekest, to thee <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> I give it, and to thy seed for ever.

In the name of wonder, why this flight and childish reasoning, when immediately before he had observed, that the hyperbole is founded on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> nature? We could not resist this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> stroke of criticism; intended not against our author, for no human creature is exempt from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>; but against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> veneration that is paid to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> classic writers, without distinguishing their blemishes from their beauties.\n\nHaving examined the nature of this figure, and the principle on which it is erected, let us proceed to the rules by which it ought to be governed. And, in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> fault to introduce an hyperbole in the description of an ordinary object or event; for in such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, it is altogether unnatural, being destitute of surprize, its only foundation. Take the following instance, where the subject is extremely familiar, viz. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> the shore after a shipwreck.\n\nI <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> the surges under him,\nAnd ride upon their backs: he trode the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>;\nWhose enmity he flung aside, and breasted\nThe surge most swollen that met him: his bold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>\nAbove the contentious waves he kept, and o'er'd\nHimself with his good arms, in lusty strokes\nTo th' shore, that o'er his wave-born bows bow'd,\nAs stooping to relieve him.\n\nTempest, act ii. sc. 1.\n\nIn the next place, it may be gathered from what is said, that an hyperbole can never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> the tone of any dispiriting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>: sorrow in particular will never prompt such a figure; and for that reason the following hyperboles must be condemned as unnatural:\n\nK. Kich. Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a>!\nWe'll make foul <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> with distil'd tears:\nOur sighs, and they, shall lodge the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>-corn,\nAnd make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> in this revolving land.\n\nRichard II. act. iii. sc. 6.\n\nDraw them to Tyber's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a>, and weep your tears\nInto the channel, till the lowest stream\nDo kiss the most exalted shore of all.\n\nJulius C\u00e6sar, act i. sc. 1.\n\nThirdly,\nThirdly, A writer, if he wish to succeed, ought always to have the reader in his eye: he ought, in particular, never to venture a bold thought or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, till the reader be warned and prepared. For this reason, an hyperbole in the beginning of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> can never be in its place. Example:\n\n*Jam pauc\u00e2 aratro jugera regio*\n*Moles relinquunt.*\nHorat. Carm. lib. ii. ode 15.\n\nIn the fourth place, The nicest point of all is, to ascertain the natural limits of an hyperbole, beyond which being overstrained, it has a bad effect. Longinus (chap. iii.), with great propriety of thought, enters a caveat against an hyperbole of this kind: he compares it to a bow-string, which relaxes by overstraining, and produces an effect directly opposite to what is intended. To ascertain any precise boundary, would be difficult, if not impracticable. We shall therefore only give a specimen of what may be reckoned overstrained hyperboles. No fault is more common among writers of inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>; and instances are found even among those of the finest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>; witness the following hyperbole, too bold even for an Hotspur.\n\nHotspur talking of Mortimer:\n*In single opposition <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> to hand,\nHe did confound the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>\nIn changing hardiment with great Glendower.*\nThree times they breath'd, and three times did they drink,\nUpon agreement, of swift <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVERN\">Severn</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>;\nWho then affrighted with their bloody looks,\nRan fearfully among the trembling reeds,\nAnd hid his crimp'd head in the hollow bank,\nBlood-stained with these valiant combatants.*\n\nFirst Part Henry IV. act i. sc. 4.\n\nSpeaking of Henry V.\n*England ne'er had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> until this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">Virtue</a> he had, delivering to command:\nHis brandish'd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> did blind men with its beams:\nHis arms spread wider than a dragon's wings:\nHis sparkling eyes, replete with awful fire,\nMore dazzled, and drove back his enemies,\nThan mid-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> fierce bent against their faces.\nWhat should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:\nHe never lifted up his hand, but conquer'd.*\nFirst Part Henry VI. act i. sc. 1.\n\nLastly, An hyperbole, after it is introduced with all advantages, ought to be comprehended within the fewest words possible: as it cannot be relished but in the hurry and dwelling of the mind, a leisurely view dissolves the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARM\">charm</a>, and discovers the description to be extravagant at least, and perhaps also ridiculous. This fault is palpable in a sonnet which passeth for one of the most complete in the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>: Phillis, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and florid description, is made as far to outshine the sun as he outlines the stars:\n\n*Le silence regnoit sur la terre et sur l'onde,\nL'air devenoit ferra\u00efn et l'Olimp vermeil,\nEt l'amoureux Zephyr affranchi du sommel,\nRefusait les fleurs d'une haline feconde.*\n\n*L'Aurore deploiait l'on de sa tresse blonde,\nEt fenoit de rubis le chemin du soleil;\nEnfin ce Dieu venoit au plus grand appareil\nQu'il soit jamais venu pour eclaire le monde:\nQuand la jeune Phillis au visage riant,\nSortant de son palais plus clair que l'orient,\nFit voir une lumiere et plus vive et plus belle.*\nSacre <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAMBEAU\">Flambeau</a> du jour, n'en soyez point jaloux,\nVous parutes alors aussi peu devant elle,\nQue les feux de la nuit avoient fait devant vous.*\nMalleville.\n\nThere is in Chaucer a thought expressed in a single line, which sets a young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> in a more advantageous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> than the whole of this much laboured poem:\n\n*Up rose the sun, and up rose Emelie.*","sp":22,"ep":23},{"h":"HYPERBOREAN","t":"in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">Ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">Geography</a>.

Diodorus Siculus says, the Hyperboreans were thus called by reason they dwelt beyond the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> Boreas; \u1f51\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1 signifying, \"above, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> beyond,\" and \u0392\u03bf\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2, Borean, the \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> wind.\" This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">etymology</a> is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> and plausible; notwithstanding all that Rudbeck has said against it, who would have the word to be Gothic, and to signify <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a> doubts whether or not there were any such nations as the Hyperborean.

It was found more easy and commodious to engage an estate by a civil covenant than by an actual delivery: accordingly the expedient was first practised among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>; and from them the Romans borrowed both the name and the thing; only the Greeks, the better to prevent frauds, used to fix some visible mark on the thing, that the public might know it was hypothecate or mortgaged by the proprietor; but the Romans, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> on such advertisements as injurious to the debtor, forbade the use of them.\n\nThe Roman lawyers distinguished four kinds of hypothecas: the conventional, which was with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> and consent of both parties; the legal, which was appointed by law, and for that reason called tacit; the praetor's pledge, when by the flight or non-appearing of the debtor, the creditor was put in possession of his effects; and the judiciary, when the creditor was put in possession by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>.\n\nThe conventional hypotheca is subdivided into general and special. The hypotheca is general, when all the debtor's effects, both present and future, are engaged to the creditor. It is special, when limited to one or more particular things.\n\nFor the tacit hypotheca, the civilians reckon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less than twenty-five different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> thereof.","sp":25,"ep":25},{"h":"HYPOTHENUSE","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">Geometry</a>, the longest side of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>-angled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> that which subtends the right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>.","sp":25,"ep":25},{"h":"HYPOTHESIS","t":"in Physics, &c., denotes a kind of system laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> from our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, whereby to account for some phenomenon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>.

How the repositories for keeping it were constructed, we are not expressly told; but it is probable that the snow was preserved in pits or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENCHES\">trenches</a>.\n\n\"When Alexander the Great besieged the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Petra, he caused 30 trenches to be dug, and filled with snow, which was covered with oak branches; and which kept in that manner for a long time. Plutarch says, that a covering of chaff and coarse cloth is sufficient; and at present a like method is pursued in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>. Where the snow has been collected in a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a>, some grats or green sods, covered with dung from the sheep\nICE\n\nsheep pens, is thrown over it; and under these it is so well preserved, that the whole summer through it is sent the distance of 60 Spanish (nearly 180 English) miles to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a>.\n\n\"When the ancients, therefore, wished to have cooling liquors, they either drank the melted snow, or put some of it in their wine; or they placed jars filled with wine in the snow, and suffered it to cool there as long as they thought proper. That ice was also preserved for the like purpose, is probable from the testimony of various authors; but it appears not to have been used to much in warm countries as in the northern. Even at present snow is employed in Italy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, and Portugal; but in Perfin ice. I have never anywhere found an account of Grecian or Roman ice-houses. By the writers on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> they are not mentioned.\"\n\nIce-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">Island</a>, a name given by sailors to a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of ice collected into one huge <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, and floating about upon the seas near or within the Polar circles.\n\n\u2014Many of these fluctuating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> are met with on the coasts of Spitzbergen, to the great danger of the shipping employed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENLAND\">Greenland</a> fishery. In the midst of those tremendous masses navigators have been arrested and frozen to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. In this manner the brave Sir Hugh Willoughby perished with all his crew in 1553; and in the year 1773, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Mulgrave, after every effort which the most finished seaman could make to accomplish the end of his voyage, was caught in the ice, and was near experiencing the same unhappy fate. See the account at large in Phipps's Voyage to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> Pole.\n\nAs there described, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>, divested of the horror from the eventful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of change, was the most beautiful and picturesque.\u2014Two large ships becalmed in a vast basin, surrounded on all sides by islands of various forms: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> clear: the sun gliding the circumambient ice, which was low, smooth, and even; covered with snow, excepting where the pools of water on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the surface appeared crystaline with the young ice: the small space of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> they were confined in perfectly smooth. After fruitless attempts to force a way through the fields of ice, their limits were perpetually contracted by its closing; till at length it belet each vessel till they became immovably fixed. The smooth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of surface was soon lost: the pressure of the pieces of ice, by the violence of the swell, caused them to pack: fragment rose upon fragment, till they were in many places higher than the main-yard. The movements of the ships were tremendous and involuntary, in conjunction with the surrounding ice, actuated by the currents. The water shoaled to 14 fathoms. The grounding of the ice or of the ships would have been equally fatal: The force of the ice might have crushed them to atoms, or have lifted them out of the water and overflown them, or have left them suspended on the summits of the pieces of ice at a tremendous height, exposed to the fury of the winds; or to the risk of being dashed to pieces by the failure of their frozen deck. An attempt was made to cut a passage through the ice; after a perseverance worthy of Britons, it proved fruitless. The commander, at all times <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of himself, directed the boats to be made ready to be hauled over the ice, till they arrived at navigable water (a task alone of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> days), and in them to make their voyage to England. The boats were drawn progressively three whole days. At length a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> sprung up, the ice separated sufficiently to yield to the pressure of the full-laded ships, which, after labouring against the resisting fields of ice, arrived on the 10th of August in the harbour of Smeeringberg, at the west end of Spitzbergen, between it and Hackluyt's Headland.\n\nThe forms assumed by the ice in this chilling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> are extremely pleasing to even the most incurious eye. The surface of that which is congealed from the sea water (for we must allow it two origins) is flat and even, hard, opake, resembling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, and incapable of being slid on, like the British ice. The greater pieces, or fields, are many leagues in length: the lesser are the meadows of the seas, on which these animals at times frolic by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the lesser pieces is as rapid as the currents: the greater, which are sometimes 200 leagues long, and 60 or 80 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, move slow and majestically; often fix for a time, immoveable by the power of the ocean, and then produce near the horizon that bright white appearance called the blink. The approximation of two great fields produces a most singular phenomenon: it forces the lesser (if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> can be applied to pieces of several acres <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>) out of the water, and adds them to their surface; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> and often a third succeeds; so that the whole forms an aggregate of a tremendous height. These float in the sea like so many rugged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, and are sometimes 500 or 600 yards thick; but the far greater part is concealed beneath the water. These are continually increased in height by the freezing of the spray of the sea, or of the melting of the snow, which falls on them. Those which remain in this frozen climate receive continual growth; others are gradually wafted by the northern winds into southern latitudes, and melt by degrees, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the sun, till they waft away, or disappear in the boundless element.\n\nThe collision of the great fields of ice, in high latitudes, is often attended with a noise that for a time takes away the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of hearing anything else; and the lesser with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> of unpealable horror. The water which dashes against the mountainous ice freezes into an infinite variety of forms; and gives the voyager ideal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, streets, churches, steeples, and every shape which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> can frame.\n\nICE-PLANT.

It is exceedingly subject to earthquakes; and so full of volcanoes, that the little part of it which appears fit for the habitation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> seems almost totally laid waste by them. The best account that hath yet appeared of the island of Iceland is in a late publication, intitled \"Letters on Iceland, &c. written by Uno Von Troil, D.D. first chaplain to his Swedish majesty.\" This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> sailed from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> on the 12th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 1772, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> with Mr Banks, Dr Solander, and Dr James Lind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, in a ship for which 100l. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a> was paid every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>. After visiting the Western isles of Scotland, they arrived on the 28th of August at Iceland; where they call <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCHOR\">anchor</a> at Bessafelladr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Bessafelladr, lying in about 64\u00b0 6' N. Lat. in the western part of the island. The country had to them the most dismal appearance that can be conceived. \"Imagine to yourself (says Dr Troil) a country, which from one end to the other presents to your view only barren <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, whose summits are covered with eternal snow, and between them fields divided by vitrified cliffs, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> and sharp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> seem to vie with each other to deprive you of the sight of a little grass which scantily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> up among them. These same dreary rocks likewise conceal the few scattered habitations of the natives, and nowhere a single tree appears which might afford shelter to friendship and innocence. The prospect before us, though not pleasing, was uncommon and surprising. Whatever presented itself to our view bore the marks of devastation; and our eyes, accustomed to behold the pleasing coasts of England, now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> nothing but the vestiges of the operation of a fire, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">Heaven</a> knows how <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a>!\"\n\nThe climate of Iceland, however, is not unwholesome, or naturally subject to excessive colds, notwithstanding its northerly situation. There have been instances indeed of Fahrenheit's thermometer sinking to 24\u00b0 below the freezing point in winter, and rising to 102\u00b0 in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>. Since the year 1749, observations have been made on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>; and the result of these observations hath been unfavourable, as the coldness of the climate is thought to be on the increase, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> the country is in danger of becoming unfit for the habitation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>. Wood, which formerly grew in great quantities all over the island, cannot now be raised. Even the hardy firs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a> cannot be reared in this island. They seemed indeed to thrive till they were about two feet high; but then their tops withered, and they ceased to grow. This is owing chiefly to the storms and hurricanes which frequently happen in the months of May and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, and which are very unfavourable to vegetation of every kind. In 1772, Governor Thodal sowed a little barley, which grew very briskly; but a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> before it was to be reaped, a violent storm so effectually destroyed it, that only a few grains were found scattered about. Besides these violent winds, this island lies under another disadvantage, owing to the floating ice already mentioned, with which the coasts are often beset. This ice comes on by degrees, always with an easterly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, and frequently in such quantities as to fill up all the gulfs on the north-west side of the island, and even covers the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> as far as the eye can reach; it also sometimes drives to other shores. It generally comes in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a>, and goes away in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>. Sometimes it only reaches the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> in April; and, remaining there for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time, does an incredible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of mischief. It consists partly of mountains of ice, said to be sometimes 60 fathoms in height; and partly of field ice, which is neither so thick nor so much dreaded. Sometimes these enormous masses are grounded in shoal-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; and in these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> they remain for many months, nay years, undisturbed, chilling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> for a great way round. When many such bulky and lofty ice-masses are floating together, the wood which is often found drifting between them, is so much chafed, and pressed with such violence together, that it sometimes takes fire; which circumstance has occasioned fabulous accounts of the ice being in flames.\n\nIn 1753 and 1754, this ice occasioned such a violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, that horses and sheep dropped <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> dead by reason of it, as well as for want of food; horses were observed to feed upon dead cattle, and the sheep ate off each other's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>. In 1755, towards the end of the month of May, the waters were frozen over in one night to the thickness of an inch and five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>. In 1756, on the 26th of June, snow fell to the depth of a yard, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> falling through the months of July and August. In the year following it froze very hard towards the end of May and beginning of June, in the south part of the island, which occasioned a great scarcity of grass. These frosts are generally followed by a famine, many examples of which are to be found in the Icelandic chronicles. Besides these calamities, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of bears annually arrive with the ice, which commit great ravages among the sheep. The Icelanders attempt to destroy these intruders as soon as they get sight of them. Sometimes they assemble together, and drive them back to the ice, with which they often float off again. For want of firearms, they are obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> spears on these occasions. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> also encourages the destruction of these animals,\nIceland. by paying a premium of 10 dollars for every bear that is killed, and purchasing the skin of him who killed it.\n\nNotwithstanding this dismal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>, however, taken from Von Troil's letters, some tracts of ground, in high cultivation, are mentioned as being covered by the great eruption of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAVA\">lava</a> in 1783. It is possible, therefore, that the above may have been somewhat exaggerated.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">Thunder</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a> are seldom heard in Iceland, except in the neighbourhood of volcanoes. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-AURORA_BOREALIS\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol3.html#article-AURORA\">Aurora</a> Borealis is very frequent and strong. It most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> appears in dry weather; though there are not wanting instances of its being seen before or after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, or even during the time of it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> halo, which prognosticates bad weather, is likewise very frequent here; as are also parhelions, which appear from one to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> in number at a time. These parhelions are observed chiefly at the approach of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENLAND\">Greenland</a> ice, which an intense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROST\">frost</a> has produced, and the frozen vapours fill the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FIRE_BALLS\">Fire-balls</a>, sometimes round and sometimes oval, are observed, and a kind of ignis fatuus which attaches itself to men and beasts; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMETS\">comets</a> are also frequently mentioned in their chronicles. This last circumstance deserves the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of astronomers.\n\nIceland, besides all the inconveniences already mentioned, has two very terrible ones, called by the natives ferida and finafloki: the name of the first imports large pieces of a mountain tumbling down and destroying the lands and houses which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> at the foot of it: this happened in 1554, when a whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> was ruined, and thirteen people buried alive. The other word signifies the effects of a prodigious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of snow, which covers the top of the mountains, rolling down in immense masses, and doing a great deal of damage: of this there was an instance in 1669, during the night, when two farms were buried, with all their inhabitants and cattle. This last accident Iceland has in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> with all very mountainous countries, particularly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>.\n\n\"Iceland abounds with hot and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> springs, some of which spout up into the air to a surprising height. All the jets d'eau which have been contrived with so much art, and at such an enormous expense, cannot by any means be compared with these wonders of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> in Iceland. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WATER_WORKS\">water-works</a> at Herrenhausen throw up a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of water of half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of a yard in circumference to a height of about 70 feet; those at the Winterkette at Cassel throw it up, but in a much thinner column, 130 feet; and the jet d'eau at St Cloud, which is thought the greatest of all the French water-works, casts up a thin column 80 feet into the air; but some springs in Iceland pour forth columns of water several feet in thickness to the height of many fathoms; and many affirm of several hundred feet.\n\n\"These springs are unequal in their degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>; but we have observed none under 188 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer; in some it is 192, 193, 212, and in one small vein of water 213 degrees. From some the water flows gently, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> is then called laug, \"a bath;\" from others it spouts with a great noise, and is then called Huer, or kitter. It is very common for some of these spouting springs to\n\nIceland. cole up, and others to appear in their stead. All Iceland. these hot waters have an incrusting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, so that we very commonly find the exterior surface from whence it bursts forth covered with a kind of rind, which almost resembles chafed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, and which we at first took for lime, but which was afterwards found by Mr Bergman to be of a filaceous or flinty nature. In some places the water tastes of sulphur, in others not; but when drank as soon as it is cold, tastes like common boiled water. The inhabitants use it at particular times for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYEING\">dyeing</a>; and were they to adopt proper regulations, it might be of still greater use. Victuals may also be boiled in it, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> held over its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a> becomes sweet; owing, most probably, to the excessive heat of the water, as the same effect is produced by boiling it a long time over the fire. They have begun to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> by boiling sea water over it, which when it is refined, is very pure and good. The cows which drink this hot water yield a great deal of milk. Egbert Olafsen relates, that the water does not become turbid when alkali is thrown into it, nor does it change the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of syrup of violets. Horrebow affirms, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> you fill a bottle at one of the spouting springs, the water <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> boil over two or three times while the spring throws forth its water; and if corked too soon, the bottle will burst.\n\n\"Among the many hot springs to be met with in Iceland, several bear the name of geyser: the following is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the most remarkable of that name, named from Hecla, near a farm called Haukadul. Here a poet would have an opportunity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> whatever nature has of beautiful and terrible, united in one picture, by delineating this surprising phenomenon. Refuse to yourself a large field, where you see on one side, at a great distance, high mountains covered with ice, whose summits are generally wrapped in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a>, so that their sharp and unequal points become invisible. This loss, however, is compensated by a certain wind, which causes the clouds to sink, and cover the mountain itself, when its summit appears as it were to rest on the clouds. On the other side Hecla is seen, with its three points covered with ice, rising above the clouds, and, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> which ascends from it, forming other clouds at some distance from the real ones: and on another side is a ridge of high rocks, at the foot of which boiling water from time to time issues forth; and further on extends a marsh of about three English miles in circumference, where are 40 or 50 boiling springs, from which a vapour ascends to a prodigious height.\u2014In the midst of these is the greatest spring geyser, which deserves a more exact and particular account. In travelling to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, about an English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> and a half from the river, from which the ridge of rocks still divided us, we hear a loud roaring noise, like the rushing of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a> precipitating itself from stupendous rocks. We asked our guide what it meant; he answered, it was geyser roaring; and we soon saw with our naked eyes what before seemed almost incredible.\n\n\"The depth of the opening or pipe from which the water gushes cannot well be determined; for sometimes the water sunk down several fathoms, and some seconds passed before a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> which was thrown into the aperture reached the surface of the water. The opening itself was perfectly round, and 19 feet in diameter,\nmeter, and terminated in a basin 59 feet in diameter. Both the pipe and the basin were covered with a rough halastic rind, which had been formed by the force of the water; the outermost border of the basin is nine feet and an inch higher than the pipe itself. The water here spouted several times a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, but always by fits, and after certain intervals. The people who lived in the neighbourhood told us, that they rose higher in cold and bad weather than at other times; and Egbert Olafsen and several others affirm, that it has spouted to the height of 60 fathoms. Most probably they guessed only by the eye, and on that account their calculation may be a little extravagant; and indeed it is to be doubted whether the water was ever thrown up so high, though probably it sometimes mounts higher than when we observed it. The method we took to observe the height was as follows. Every one in company wrote down, at each time that the water spouted, how high it appeared to him to be thrown, and we afterwards chose the medium. The first column marks the spoutings of the water, in the order in which they followed one another; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, the time when these effusions happened; the third, the height to which the water rose; and the last, how long each spouting of water contained.\n\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> | Time   | Height | <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">Duration</a> |\n|----|--------|--------|----------|\n| 1  | At VI 42 m. | 30 feet | 0 20 seconds |\n| 2  | 51     | 6      | 0 20     |\n| 3  | VII 16 | 6      | 0 10     |\n| 4  | 31     | 12     | 0 15     |\n| 5  | 51     | 60     | 0 6      |\n| 6  | VIII 17 | 24    | 0 30     |\n| 7  | 29     | 18     | 0 40     |\n| 8  | 36     | 12     | 0 40     |\n\nThe pipe was now for the first time full of water, which ran slowly into the basin.\n\n| No | Time   | Height | Duration |\n|----|--------|--------|----------|\n| 9  | IX 25  | 48     | 1 10     |\n| 10 | X 16   | 24     | 1 00     |\n\n\"At 35 minutes after twelve we heard, as it were, three discharges of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUN\">gun</a> under ground, which made it shake: the water flowed over immediately, but instantly sunk again. At eight minutes after two, the water flowed over the border of the basin. At 15 minutes after three, we again heard several subterranean noises, though not so strong as before. At 43 minutes after four, the water flowed over very strongly during the space of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>. In five minutes after, we heard many loud subterranean discharges, not only near the spring, but also from the neighbouring ridge of rocks, where the water spouted. At 51 minutes after six, the fountain spouted up to the height of 92 feet, and continued to do so for four minutes. After this great effort, it sunk down very low into the pipe, and was entirely quiet during several minutes; but soon began to bubble again: it was not, however, thrown up into the air, but only to the top of the pipe.\n\n\"The force of the vapours which throw up these waters is excessive: it not only prevents the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> which are thrown into the opening from sinking, but even throws them up to a very great height, together with the water. When the basin was full, we placed ourselves before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> in such a manner that we could see our shadows in the water; when every one observed round the shadow of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> (though not round that of the heads of others), a circle of almost the same colours which compose the rainbow, and round this another bright circle. This most probably proceeded from the vapours exhaling from the water.\n\n\"Not far from this place, another spring at the foot of the neighbouring ridge of rocks spouted water to the height of one or two yards each time. The opening through which this water issued was not so wide as the other: we imagined it possible to stop up the hole entirely by throwing large stones into it, and even flattered ourselves that our attempts had succeeded: but, to our astonishment, the water gushed forth in a very violent manner. We hastened to the pipe, and found all the stones thrown aside, and the water playing freely through its former channel. In these large springs the waters were hot in the highest degree, and tasted a little of sulphur; but in other respects it was pure and clear. In the smaller springs of the neighbourhood the water was tainted: in some, it was as muddy as that of a clay-pit: in others, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> as milk; and in some few, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> as blood.\n\n\"Iceland abounds with pillars of basaltic Account of the lower sort of people imagine have been piled upon the basaltic each other by the giants, who made use of supernatural force to effect it. They have generally from three to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> sides; and are from four to six feet in thickness, and from 12 to 16 yards in length, without any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> divisions. But sometimes they are only from six inches to one foot in height, and they are then very regular, inasmuch that they are sometimes made use of for windows and door-panes. In some places they only peep out here and there among the lava, or more frequently among the tufa; in other places they are quite overthrown, and pieces of broken pillars only make their appearance. Sometimes they extend without interruption for two or three miles in length. In one mountain they have a singular appearance: on the top the pillars lie horizontally, in the middle they are sloping; the lowest are perfectly perpendicular; and in some parts they are bent into a semicircular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of the Iceland basaltic seems to be the same with that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFFA\">Staffa</a>; though in some it is more porous, and inclines to a gray. Some we observed which were of a blackish gray, and composed of several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>. Another time we observed a kind of porous glassy stone, consequently a lava, which was so indistinctly divided, that we were for some time at a loss to determine whether it was basaltic or not, though at last we all agreed that it was.\n\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">Iron</a> ore is found in some parts of the island, and that beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> ore called malachites. Horrebows speaks of native silver. A stratum of sulphur is found near Myvatu from nine inches to two feet in thickness; partly of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> colour, and partly of a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a>. Immediately over the sulphur is a blue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; above that a vitriolic and aluminoous one; and beneath the sulphur a reddish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOLE\">bole</a>.\n\n\"At what time the island of Iceland was first peopled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of is uncertain. An English colony indeed is said to the island have been settled there in the beginning of the fifth century.\"\nIceland. century; but of this there are not sufficient proofs. There is, however, reason to suppose that the English and Irish were acquainted with this country under another name, long before the arrival of the Norwegians; for the celebrated Bede gives a pretty accurate description of the island. But of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> inhabitants we cannot pretend to say anything, as the Iceland chronicles go no farther back than the arrival of the Norwegians. What they relate is to the following purpose.\n\nNaddodd, a famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIRATE\">pirate</a>, was driven on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Iceland in 861, and named the country Snio-land, \"Snow-land,\" on account of the great quantities of snow with which he perceived the mountains covered. He did not remain there long; but on his return extolled the country to such a degree, that one Gardar Suaforson, an enterprising Swede, was encouraged by his account to go in search of it in 864. He failed quite round the island, and gave it the name of Garda\u00f0holmur, or Gardar's island. Having remained in Iceland during the winter, he returned in the spring to Norway, where he described the newly-discovered island as a pleasant well-wooded country. This excited a desire in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOKE\">Floke</a>, another Swede, reputed the greatest navigator of his time, to undertake a voyage thither. As the compass was then unknown, he took three ravens on board to employ them on the discovery. By the way he visited his friends at Ferro; and having failed farther to the northward, he let fly one of his ravens, which returned to Ferro. Some time after, he dispatched the second, which returned to the ship again, as he could find no land. The last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> proved more successful; the third raven took his flight to Iceland, where the ship arrived a few days after. Floke stayed here the whole winter with his company; and, because he found a great deal of floating ice on the north side, he gave the country the name of Iceland, which it has ever since retained.\n\nWhen they returned to Norway in the following spring, Floke, and those that had been with him, made a very different description of the country. Floke described it as a wretched place; while one of his companions, named Thorulfr, praised it so highly, that he affirmed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a> dropped from every plant; which extravagant commendation procured him the name of Thorulfr-sj\u00f3r, or Butter-Thorulfr.\n\nFrom this time there are no accounts of any voyages to Iceland, till Ingolfur and his friend Leifr undertook one in 874. They spent the winter on the island, and determined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> there for the future. Ingolfur returned to Norway, to provide whatever might be necessary for the comfortable establishment of a colony, and Leifr in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time went to assist in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> in England. After an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of four years, they again met in Iceland, the one bringing with him a considerable number of people, with the necessary tools and instruments for making the country habitable; and the other imported his acquired treasures. After this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> many people went there to settle; and, in the space of 60 years, the whole island was inhabited. The tyranny of Harold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Norway contributed not a little to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of Iceland; and so great was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMIGRATION\">emigration</a> of his subjects, that he was at last obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> an order, that no one should sail from Norway to Iceland without paying four ounces of fine silver to the king.\n\nBesides the Norwegians, new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> arrived from different nations, between whom wars soon commenced; and the Icelandic histories are full of the accounts of their battles. To prevent these conflicts for the future, a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> was chosen in 928, upon whom great powers were conferred. This man was the speaker in all their public deliberations; pronounced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> in difficult and intricate cases; decided all disputes; and published new laws, after they had been received and approved of by the people at large; but he had no power to make laws without the approbation and consent of the rest. He therefore assembled the chiefs whenever the circumstances seemed to require it; and after they had deliberated among themselves, he represented the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of the majority to the people, whose silent assent was necessary before it could be considered as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>. His authority among the chiefs and leaders, however, was inconsiderable, as he was chosen by them and retained his place no longer than while he preserved their confidence.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> did not prove sufficient to restrain the turbulent spirit of the Icelanders. They openly waged war with each other; and, by their intestine conflicts, so weakened all parties, that the whole became at last a prey to a few arbitrary and enterprising men; who, as is too generally the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, wantonly abused their power to the oppression of their countrymen, and the disgrace of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>. Notwithstanding these troubles, however, the Icelanders remained free from a foreign yoke till 1261; when the greatest part of them put themselves under the protection of Hakon, king of Norway, promising to pay him tribute upon certain conditions agreed on between them; and the rest followed their example in 1264. Afterwards, Iceland, together with Norway, became subject to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>. For a long time the care of the island was committed to a governor, who commonly went there once a year; though, according to his instructions, he ought to have resided in Iceland. As the country suffered incredibly through the absence of its governors, it was resolved a few years ago that they should reside there, and have their seat at Belfeldi\u00f0, one of the old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> domains. He has under him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-BAILIFF\">bailiff</a>, two laymen, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a>, and 21 fylkemenn, or magistrates who superintend small districts; and almost everything is decided according to the laws of Denmark.\n\nAt the first settlement of the Norwegians in Iceland, they lived in the same manner as they had done in their own country, namely, by war and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIRACY\">piracy</a>. Their situation with regard to the kings of Norway, however, soon obliged them to apply to other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, in order to learn as much of the knowledge of government and politics as was necessary to preserve their colony from subjugation to a foreign yoke. For this purpose they often sailed to Norway, Denmark, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>, England, and Scotland. The travellers, at their return, were obliged to give an account to their chiefs of the state of those kingdoms through which they passed. For this reason, history, and what related to science, was held in high repute as long as the republican form of government lasted; and the great number of histories\nto be met with in the country, show at least the desire of the Icelanders to be instructed. To secure themselves, therefore, against their powerful neighbours, they were obliged to enlarge their historical knowledge. They likewise took great pains in studying perfectly their own laws, for the maintenance and protection of their internal security. Thus Iceland, at a time when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> and obduracy overwhelmed the rest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, was enabled to produce a considerable number of poets and historians. When the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> was introduced, about the end of the 10th century, more were found conversant in the law than could have been expected, considering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the country, and the number of its inhabitants. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">Fishing</a> was followed among them; but they devoted their attention considerably more to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, which has since entirely ceased.\n\nTwo things have principally contributed towards producing a great change both in their character and way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, viz., the progress of the Christian religion, and their subjection first to Norway, and afterwards to Denmark. For if religion, on one side, commanded them to desist from their ravages and warlike expeditions; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> power, on the other, deprived them of the necessary forces for the execution of them; and, since this time, we find no farther traces of their heroic deeds, except those which are preserved in their hillories.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> Icelanders apply themselves to fishing and breeding of cattle. They are middle-sized and well made, though not very strong; and the women are in general ill-featured. Vices are much less common among them, than in other parts where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> have corrupted the morals of the people. Though their poverty disables them from imitating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> in all respects, yet they continue to show their inclination to it: they cheerfully give away the little they have to spare, and express the utmost joy and satisfaction if you are pleased with their gift. They are uncommonly obliging and faithful, and extremely attached to government. They are very zealous in their religion. An Icelander never passes a river or any other dangerous place, without previously taking off his hat, and imploring the divine protection; and he is always thankful for the protection of the Deity when he has passed the danger in safety. They have an inexplicable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to their native country, and are nowhere so happy. An Icelander therefore rarely settles in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPENHAGEN\">Copenhagen</a>, though ever such advantageous terms should be offered him. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, we cannot ascribe any great indolence or ingenuity to these people. They work on in the way to which they have all along been accustomed, without thinking of improvements. They are not cheerful in conversation, but simple and credulous; and have no aversion against a bottle, if they can find an opportunity. When they meet together, their chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASTIME\">pastime</a> consists in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> their history. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> makes the beginning, and the rest continue in their turns when he is tired. Some of them know these stories by heart; others have them in print, and others in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>. Besides this, they are great players at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHESS\">chess</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDS\">cards</a>, but only for their amusement, since they never play for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>; which, however, seems to have been formerly in use among them; since by one of their old laws, a fine is imposed upon those who play for money.\n\nThe modern Icelanders have made very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in their dress from what was formerly in use. Their dress is as follows:\n\nThe men all wear a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> shirt next to the skin, with a short jacket, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of wide breeches over it. When they travel, another short coat is put over all. The whole is made of coarse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> cloth, called wadmal; but some wear clothes of a white colour. On their head they wear large three-cornered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HATS\">hats</a>, and on the feet Iceland shoes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-WORSTED\">worsted</a> stockings. Some of them indeed have shoes from Copenhagen; but, as they are rather too dear for them, they generally make their own shoes, sometimes of the hide of oxen, but more frequently of sheep's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>. They make them by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> piece of leather, rather wider than the length of the foot; this they sew up at the toes and behind at the heel, and tie it on with leather thongs. These shoes are convenient enough where the country is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>; but it would be very difficult for us who are not accustomed to walk with them amongst the rocks and stones, though the Icelanders do it with great ease.\n\nThe women are likewise dressed in black wadmal. They wear a bodice over their shifts, which are sewed up at the bottom; and above this a jacket laced before with long narrow sleeves reaching down to the wrists. In the opening on the side of the sleeve, they have buttons of chased silver, with a plate fixed to each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTON\">button</a>; on which the lover, when he buys them in order to present them to his mistress, takes care to have his name engraved along with hers. At the top of the jacket a little black collar is fixed, of about three inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, of velvet or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, and frequently trimmed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a>. The petticoat is likewise of wadmal, and reaches down to the ankles. Round the top of it is a girdle of silver or some other metal, to which they fasten the apron, which is also of wadmal, and ornamented at top with buttons of chased silver. Over all this they wear an upper dress nearly resembling that of the Swedish peasants; with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>, that it is wider at bottom: this is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> at the neck and wrists, and a hand's-breadth shorter than the petticoat. It is adorned with a facing down to the bottom, which looks like cut velvet, and is generally woven by the Icelandic women. On their fingers they wear gold, silver, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> rings. Their head-dress consists of several cloths wrapped round the head almost as high again as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>. It is tied fast with a handkerchief, and serves more for warmth than ornament. Girls are not allowed to wear this head-dress till they are marriageable. At their weddings they are adorned in a very particular manner; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDE\">bride</a> wears, close to the face, round her head-dress, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of silver gilt. She has two chains round her neck, one of which hangs down very low before, and the other rests on her shoulders. Besides these, she wears a lesser chain, from whence generally hangs a little heart, which may be opened to put some kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERFUME\">perfume</a> in it. This dress is worn by all the Icelandic women without exception: only with this difference, that the poorer sort have it of coarse wadmal, with ornaments of brass; and those that are in easier circumstances have it of broad cloth, with silver ornaments gilt.\nThe houses of the Icelanders are very indifferent, but the worst are said to be on the south side of the island. In some parts they are built of drift-wood, in others of lava, almost in the same manner as the stone-walls we make for inclosures, with moss stuffed between the pieces of lava. In some parts the walls are wainscotted on the inside. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> is covered with sods, laid over rafting, or sometimes over the ribs of whales; the walls are about three yards high, and the entrance somewhat lower. Instead of glass, the windows are made of the chorion and amnios of sheep, or the membranes which surround the womb of the ewe. These are stretched on a hoop, and laid over a hole in the roof. In the poorer sort of houses they employ for the windows the inner membrane of the stomach of animals, which is less transparent than the others.\n\nAs the island of Iceland produces no kind of grain, the inhabitants of consequence have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> but what is imported; and which being too dear for common use, is reserved for weddings and other entertainments. The following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of their viands is taken from Troil's Letters.\n\n1. Flour of fjalgras, (lichen flandicus), or rock-grass. The plant is first washed, and then cut into small pieces by some; though the greater number dry it by fire or in the sun, then put it into a bag in which it is well beaten, and lastly work it into flour by stamping.\n\n2. Flour of komfygr, (polygonum biflorum), is prepared in the same manner, as well as the two other sorts of wild corn melur (arundo arenaria, and arundo foliolum latericium convolutus), by separating it from the chaff, pounding, and lastly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> it.\n\n3. Surt finoer, (four butter). The Icelanders seldom make use of fresh or salt butter, but let it grow four before they eat it. In this manner it may be kept for 20 years, or even longer; and the Icelanders look upon it as more wholesome and palatable than the butter used among other nations. It is reckoned better the older it grows; and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of it then is valued as much as two of fresh butter.\n\n4. String, or whey boiled to the consistence of sour milk, and preserved for the winter.\n\n5. Fish of all kinds, both dried in the sun and in the air, and either salted or frozen. Those prepared in the last manner are preferred by many.\n\n6. Mj\u00f6lk, or whey boiled to cheese, which is very good. But the art of making other kinds of good cheese is lost, though some tolerably palatable is sold in the east quarter of Iceland.\n\n7. Beina flriug, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> and cartilages of beef and mutton, and likewise bones of cod, boiled in whey till they are quite dissolved; they are then left to ferment, and are eaten with milk.\n\n8. Skyr. The curds from which the whey is squeezed are preserved in casks or other vessels; they are sometimes mixed with black crow-berries or juniper-berries, and are likewise eaten with new milk.\n\n9. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYRA\">Syra</a>. is four whey kept in casks, and left to ferment; which, however, is not reckoned fit for use till a year old.\n\n10. Blunda, is a liquor made of water, to which a twelfth part of syra is added. In winter, it is mixed with the juice of thyme and of the black crow-berries.\n\n11. They likewise eat many vegetables, some of which grow wild, and some are cultivated; also shell-fish and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MUSHROOMS\">mushrooms</a>.\n\nThe Icelanders in general eat three meals a-day, at seven in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, two in the afternoon, and nine at night. In the morning and evening they commonly eat curds mixed with new milk, and sometimes with juniper or crow-berries. In some parts, they also have porridge made of rock-grass, which is very palatable, or curdled milk boiled till it becomes of a red colour, or new milk boiled a long time. At dinner, the food consists of dried fish, with plenty of sour butter; they also sometimes eat fresh fish, and, when possible, a little bread and cheese with them. It is reported by some, that they do not eat any fish till it is quite rotten; this report perhaps proceeds from their being fond of it when a little tainted: they however frequently eat fish which is quite fresh, though, in the same manner as the rest of their food, often without salt.\n\nThe common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEVERAGE\">beverage</a> is milk, either warm from the cow or cold, and sometimes boiled: they likewise use butter-milk with or without water. On the coasts they generally drink blanda and sour milk; which is sold after it is skimmed at two fifths of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIXDOLLAR\">rixdollar</a> per cask: some likewise send for beer from Copenhagen, and some brew their own. A few of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> inhabitants also have claret and coffee. The common people sometimes drink a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a>, which they make from the leaves of the dryas octopetala, and the veronica officinalis.\n\nOn the coasts the men employ themselves in fishing, both summer and winter. On their return home, many, when they have drawn and cleaned their fish, they give them to their wives, whose care it is to dry them. In the winter, when the inclemency of the weather prevents them from fishing, they are obliged to take care of their cattle, and spin wool. In summer, they mow the grass, dig turf, provide <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>, go in search of sheep and goats that were gone astray, and kill cattle. They prepare leather with the spiraea ulmaria instead of bark. Some few work in gold and silver; and others are instructed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, in which they are tolerable proficient. The women prepare the fish, take care of the cattle, manage the milk and wool, sew, spin, and gather eggs and down. When they work in the evening, they use, instead of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>-glass, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a> with a wick made of epilobium dipt in train <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, which is contrived to burn four, six, or eight hours.\n\nAmong the common people of Iceland, time is not reckoned by the course of the sun, but by the work they have done, and which is prescribed by law. According to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESCRIPTION\">prescription</a>, a man is to mow as much hay in one day as grows on 30 fathoms of manured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, or 40 fathoms of land which has not been manured; or he is to dig 700 pieces of turf eight feet long and three broad. If as much snow falls as reaches to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>'s bellies, a man is required daily to clear a piece of ground sufficient for 100 sheep. A woman is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RAKE\">rake</a> together as much hay as three men can mow, or to weave three yards of wadmal a-day.\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> of a man are fixed at four dollars and 12 yards of wadmal; and those of a woman at two dollars and five yards of wadmal. When men are sent a-fishing out of the country, there is allowed to each man, by law, from the 25th of September to the 14th of May, six pounds of butter, and 18 pounds of dried fish every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>. This may seem to be too great an allowance; but it must be remembered that they have nothing else to live upon. When they are at home, and can get milk, &c., every man receives only five pounds of dried fish and three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of a pound of butter a-week.","sp":63,"ep":69},{"h":"ICHOR","t":"properly signifies a thin watery <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> like serum; but is sometimes used for a thicker kind flowing from ulcers, called also f\u00e6cer.","sp":72,"ep":73},{"h":"ICHTHYOCOLLA","t":"Isinglass, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> from the fish known by the name of h\u00e6so. See Aceti-\n\nPENSER. The word is Greek, formed of \u1f30\u03c7\u03b8\u03cd\u03c2 fish, and \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLUE\">glue</a>.\u2014The method of making isinglass was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> a secret in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the Ruffians; but hath lately been discovered, and the following account of it published by Humphrey Jackson, Esq., in the 63d <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Philo-\n\nlophical Transactions.\n\n\"All authors who have hitherto delivered pro-\n\ncesses for making ichthyocolla, fish-glue, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> isinglass, have greatly mistaken both its constituent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> and preparation.\n\n\"To prove this assertion, it may not be improper to recite what Pomet says upon the subject, as he appears to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> author whom the rest have copied. After describing the fish, and referring to a cut engrav-\n\ned from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> in his custody, he says: 'As to the manner of making the isinglass, the finev parts of the fish are boiled in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> till all of them be dissolved that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> dissolve; then the gluey liquor is strained, and set to cool. Being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, the fat is carefully taken off, and the liquor itself boiled to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> consistence, then cut to pieces, and made into a twist, bent in form of a cres-\n\ncent, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> fold; then hung upon a string, and carefully dried.'\n\n\"From this account, it might be rationally con-\n\ncluded, that every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of fish which contained gelatinous principles would yield isinglass; and this parity of reasoning seems to have given rise to the halting con-\n\nclusions of those who strenuously vouch for the extrac-\n\ntion of isinglass from sturgeon; but as that fish is easily procurable, the negligence of ascertaining the fact by ex-\n\nperiment seems inexcusable.\n\n\"In my first attempt to discover the constituent parts and manufacture of isinglass, relying too much up-\n\non the authority of some chemical authors whose veraci-\n\nty I had experienced in many other instances, I found myself constantly disappointed. Glue, not isinglass, was the result of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>; and although, in the same view, a journey to Russia proved fruitless, yet a steady perseverance in the research proved not only successful as to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, but, in the pursuit, to discover a resi-\n\nnous matter plentifully procurable in the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">fisheries</a>, which has been found by ample <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> to answer fis-\n\nhur purposes. It is now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> longer a secret, that our (a) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> are stocked with immense quantities of fish, said to be the same species with those in Muscovy, and yielding the finest isin-\n\nglasses; the fisheries whereof, under due encouragement would doubtless supply all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> with this valuable article.\n\n\"No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> is necessary to the production of isinglass, neither is the matter dissolved for this purpose;\n\nfor,\n\n(a) As the lakes of North America <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> nearly in the same latitude with the Caspian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, particularly Lake Su-\n\nperior, which is said to be of greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, it was conjectured they might abound with the same sorts of fish; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of public advertisements distributed in various parts of North America, offering premiums for the sounds of sturgeon and other fish, for the purpose of making isinglass, several specimens of fine isinglass, the produce of fish taken in these parts, have been lately sent to England, with proper attestations as to the unlimited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> which may be procured.\nfor, as the continuity of its fibres would be destroyed by solution, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> would become brittle in drying, and snap short asunder, which is always the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> with glue, but never with isinglass. The latter, indeed, may be resolved into glue with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> water; but its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FIBROUS\">fibrous</a> re-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> would be found impracticable afterwards, and a fibrous texture is one of the most distinguishing characteristics of genuine isinglass.\n\n\"A due consideration that an imperfect solution of isinglass, called fining by the brewers, possessed a peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of clarifying malt-liquors, induced me to attempt its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> in cold subacid menstruums. One ounce and a half of good isinglass, steeped a few days in a gallon of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STALE\">stale</a> beer, was converted into good fining, of a remarkably thick consistence: the same quantity of glue, under similar treatment, yielded only a mucilaginous liquor, resembling diluted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>-water, which, instead of clarifying beer, increased both its tenacity and turbidity, and communicated other properties in no respect corresponding with those of genuine fining. On commixing three spoonfuls of the solution of isinglass with a gallon of malt liquor, in a tall cylindrical glass, a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of curdly masses became presently formed, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of the particles of isinglass and the feculencies of the beer, which, increasing in magnitude and specific gravity, arranged themselves accordingly and fell in a combined state to the bottom, through the well-known laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>; for, in this case, there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELECTIVE\">elective</a> attraction, as some have imagined, which bears the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> with what frequently occurs in chemical decompositions.\n\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> what is commercially termed long or short flaked isinglass be steeped a few hours in fair cold water, the entwisted membranes will expand, and reassume their original beautiful (b) hue, and, by a dexterous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, may be perfectly unfolded. By this simple operation, we find that isinglass is nothing more than certain membranous parts of fishes, divested of their native mucosity, rolled and twisted into the forms above-mentioned, and dried in open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>.\n\n\"The founds, or air-bladders, of fresh water fish in general, are preferred for this purpose, as being the most transparent, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a>, delicate substances. These constitute the finest sorts of isinglass; those called book and ordinary flake are made of the intestines, and probably of the peritoneum of the fish. The belluga yields the greatest quantity, as being the largest and most plentiful fish in the Mucovoy rivers; but the founds of all fresh-water fish yield, more or less, fine isinglass, particularly the smaller sorts, found in prodigious quantities in the Caspian sea, and several hundred miles beyond Afracan, in the Wolga, Yaik, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DON\">Don</a>, and even as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>, where it is called kle or klo by the natives, which implies a glutinous matter; it is the basis of the Russian glue, which is preferred to all other kinds for its strength.\n\n\"The founds, which yield the finer isinglass, consist of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> fibres, and are easily rent longitudinally; but the ordinary sorts are found composed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> membranes, whose fibres <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> each other obliquely, resembling the coats of a bladder: hence the former are more readily pervaded and divided with subacid liquors; but the latter, through a peculiar kind of interwoven texture, are with great difficulty torn asunder, and long resist the power of the same menstruum; yet, when duly resolved, are found to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> with equal energy in clarifying liquors.\n\n\"Izinglass receives its different shapes in the following manner:\n\n\"The parts of which it is composed, particularly the founds, are taken from the fish while sweet and fresh, slit open, washed from their slimy folder, deprived of every thin membrane which envelopes the found, and then exposed to stiffen a little in the air. In this state, they are formed into rolls about the thickness of a finger, and in length according to the intended size of the staple: a thin membrane is generally selected for the centre of the roll, round which the rest are folded alternately, and about half an inch of each extremity of the roll is turned inwards. The due dimensions being thus obtained, the two ends of what is called florit flake are pinned together with a small wooden peg; the middle of the roll is then pressed a little downwards, which gives it the resemblance of a heart-shape; and thus it is laid on boards, or hung up in the air to dry. The founds, which compose the long-flake, are longer than the former; but the operator lengthens this sort at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, by interfolding the ends of one or more pieces of the found with each other. The extremities are fastened with a peg, like the former; but the middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the roll is bent more considerably downwards, and, in order to preserve the shape of the three obtuse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> thus formed, a piece of round stick, about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an inch diameter, is fastened in each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> with small wooden pegs, in the same manner as the ends. In this state, it is permitted to dry long enough to retain its form, when the pegs and sticks are taken out, and the drying completed; lastly, the pieces of isinglass are colligated in rows, by running pack-thread through the peg-holes, for convenience of package and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a>.\n\n\"The membranes of the book fort, being thick and refractory, will not admit a similar formation with the preceding; the pieces, therefore, after their sides are folded inwardly, are bent in the centre, in such manner that the opposite sides resemble the cover of a book, from whence its name; a peg being run across the middle, fastens the sides together, and thus it is dried like the former. This fort is interleaved, and the pegs run across the ends, the better to prevent its unfolding.\n\n\"That called cake-isinglass is formed of the bits and fragments of the staple sorts, put into a flat metallic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAN\">pan</a>, with a very little water, and heated just enough to make the parts cohere like a pancake when it is dried; but frequently it is overheated, and such pieces, as before observed, are useless in the business of fining. Experience has taught the consumers to reject them.\n\n(b) If the transparent isinglass be held in certain positions to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, it frequently exhibits beautiful prismatic colours.\n\"Ifinglaf is best made in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROTH\">froth</a> gives it a disagreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, deprives it of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, and impairs its gelatinous principles; its fashionable forms are unnecessary, and frequently injurious to its native qualities. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to find oily putrid matter, and exuviae of insects, between the implicated membranes, which, through the inattention of the cellarman, often contaminate wines and malt-liquors in the act of clarification. These peculiar shapes might probably be introduced originally with a view to conceal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISGUISE\">disguise</a> the real substance of ifinglaf, and preserve the monopoly; but, as the mark is now taken off, it cannot be doubted to answer every purpose more effectually in its native state, without any subsequent manufacture whatever, especially to the principal consumers, who hence will be enabled to procure sufficient supply from the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>. Until this laudable end can be fully accomplished, and as a species of ifinglaf, more easily producible from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> fisheries, may probably be more immediately encouraged, it may be manufactured as follows:\n\n\"The founds of cod and ling bear great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> with those of the acipenser genus of Linnaeus and Arvedi; and are in general so well known as to require no particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. The Newfoundland and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ICELAND\">Iceland</a> fishermen split open the fish as soon as taken, and throw the back-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> with the founds annexed, in a heap; but previous to incipient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a>, the founds are cut out, washed from their flimes, and salted for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> out the founds, the intercostal parts are left behind, which are much the best; the Iceland fishermen are so sensible of this, that they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> the bone upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> with a thick stick, till the pockets, as they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> them, come out easily, and thus preserve the found entire. If the founds have been cured with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, that must be dissolved by steeping them in water before they are prepared for ifinglaf; the fresh found must then be laid upon a block of wood, whose surface is a little elliptical, to the end of which a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a> is nailed, and with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a> the membranes on each side of the found must be scraped off. The knife is rubbed upon the brush occasionally, to clear its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>; the pockets are cut open with scissors, and perfectly cleansed of the mucous matter with a coarse cloth; the founds are afterwards washed a few minutes in lime-water in order to absorb their oily principle, and finally in clear water. They are then laid upon nets to dry in the air; but if intended to resemble the foreign ifinglaf, the founds of cod will only admit of that called book, but those of ling both shapes. The thicker the founds are, the better the ifinglaf, colour excepted; but that is immaterial to the brewer, who is its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> consumer.\n\n\"This ifinglaf resolves into fining, like the other sorts, in subacid liquors, as stale beer, cyder, old hock, &c., and in equal quantities produces similar effects upon turbid liquors, except that it falls speedier and closer to the bottom of the vessel, as may be demonstrated in tall cylindrical glasses; but foreign ifinglaf retains the consistency of fining preferably in warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, owing to the greater tenacity of its native mucilage.\n\n\"Vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a> are, in every respect, best adapted to fining: the mineral acids are too corrosive, and even infalubrious, in common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEVERAGE\">beverage</a>.\n\n\"It is remarkable, that, during the conversion of ifinglaf into fining, the acidity of the menstruum seems greatly diminished, at least to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>; not on account of any alkaline property in the ifinglaf, probably, but by its enveloping the acid particles. It is likewise reducible into jelly with alkaline liquors, which indeed are solvents of all animal matters; even cold lime-water dissolves it into a pulpy mass. Notwithstanding this is inadmissible as fining, on account of the menstruum, it produces admirable effects in other respects: for, on commixture with compositions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a>, lime, &c., for ornamenting walls exposed to vicissitudes of weather, it adds firmness and permanency to the cement; and if common brick-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a> be worked up with this jelly, it soon becomes almost as hard as the brick itself; but, for this purpose, it is more commodiously prepared, by dissolving it in cold water, acidulated with vitriolic acid; in which case, the acid quits the jelly, and forms with the lime a felicitous mass, while, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, the jelly being deprived in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of its moisture, through the formation of an indissoluble concrete amongst its parts, soon dries, and hardens into a firm body; whence its superior strength and durability are easily comprehended.\n\n\"It has long been a prevalent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that sturgeon, on account of its cartilaginous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, would yield great quantities of ifinglaf; but, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, no part of this fish, except the inner coat of the found, promised the least success. This being full of rugae, adheres so firmly to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> membrane, which is useless, that the labour of separating them supercedes the advantage. The intestines, however, which in the larger fish extend several yards in length, being cleansed from their mucus, and dried, were found surprisingly strong and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a>, resembling cords made with the intestines of other animals, commonly called catgut, and, from some trials, promised superior advantages when applied to mechanic operations.\"\n\nIfinglaf is sometimes used in medicine; and may be given in a thin acrimonious state of the juices, after the same manner as the vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a> and mucilages, regard being had to their different disposition to putrefaction.","sp":73,"ep":75},{"h":"ICHTHYOLOGY","t":"Gen.

Though generally a sluggish fish, it sometimes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> with great force. It feeds on fishes, particularly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERRING\">herring</a>, salmon, mackerel, and coal-fish. It spawns in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, and is amazingly prolific, Lewinbock having found in the roe of one of them 150,000,000,000 ova! It inhabits the ocean, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a>, and Caspian seas, especially such parts of them as are not remote from the estuaries of large rivers, which they occasionally ascend in great multitudes. In some of the rivers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a> they are so numerous that six hundred have been taken in two days merely by a pole, with a strong hook fixed to the end of it. The flesh is very delicate, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, and firm, and when roasted, is said to resemble veal. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> it is usually served in a pickled state, being imported from America and the Baltic. It is sometimes, however, taken in our rivers in the salmon-nets. The sturgeon was a fish in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> repute with the Greeks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, and according to Pliny, was brought to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> with much pomp, and ornamented with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, the slaves who carried it being also ornamented with garlands, and accompanied by music. Caviar is made of the dried and salted roe. The skin makes a good covering for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a>.\n\nSterlet sturgeon.\u2014Brownish, with the sides spotted rufus, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> red, and the body shielded above by a triple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of tubercles. The smallest and most delicate species of the genus. Native of the Caspian sea, found also in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOLGA\">Volga</a> and Ural, and occasionally in the Baltic. In feasts when this fish happened to be unusually dear, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> Potemkin paid three hundred rubles for a single tureen of sterlet soup, which formed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> prelude to his repast.\n\nIlinglas sturgeon, or beluga.\u2014Snout very obtuse, bufo. Transverse diameter of the mouth less than the longitudinal; beards near the mouth; lips not cleft. Larger than the common species, and sometimes measuring 25 feet in length. The tubercles are smaller than those of the sturio, and seem to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> off with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. Inhabits the northern, Caspian, and Mediterranean seas. Ilinglas is prepared from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>-bladder, and an inferior sort from the skin, tail, stomach, and intestines. See Ichthyocolla.\n\nTo these may be added schupa, and fellatus; the first perhaps only a smaller variety of sturio, and the latter distinguished by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a>-like marks on its head.\n\nGen. 12. Chim\u00e6ra.\n\nHead sharp-pointed; spiracles solitary, in four divisions under the neck; mouth under the head; upper lip with five divisions; fore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a> like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a>-teeth, two in each jaw; body long, with a single spine on the back; the tail ending in a brittle, and longer than the rest of the body.\n\nSea-monster, northern chim\u00e6ra.\u2014Punctured folds below the finout. A singularly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROTESQUE\">grotesque</a> species, inhabiting the northern and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATLANTIC_OCEAN\">Atlantic ocean</a>; frequenting the deepest recesses, preying on smaller fishes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOLLUSCA\">mollusca</a> and telesaces; and rarely approaching the shore, except during the breeding season. It is from three to four feet long, of a lengthened and compressed form, tapering to the tail, which is produced into a long and slender filament. The head and eyes are very large; and at the base of each ventral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIN\">fin</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a>, is a lengthened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, rough with numerous sharp prominences in a reversed direction. The whole body is of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> above the lateral line, and of a bright filvery colour beneath it, variegated with numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> deep brown or blackish spots and patches. Its flesh is considered as coarse and unpalatable.\n\nElephant fish, or southern chim\u00e6ra.\u2014Snout produced beneath into an inflected lip. Native of the southern seas.\n\nGen. 13. Squalus.\n\nHead obtuse, from four to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> semilunar spiracles on the sides of the neck; eyes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a>, half covered, placed before the temporal opening; mouth in the under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the head, armed with several rows of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERRATED\">serrated</a>\nferrated sharp-pointed teeth, some of which are moveable, some fixed, and of different forms; body oblong, round, rough, with slender prickles; ventral fins, for the most part, less than the pectoral, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> placed about the vent, and in the males about the organs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>.\n\nThe animals which compose this tribe are entirely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a>, and more frequent in the hot than in the temperate climates. In general they are solitary, and often wander to great distances, devouring almost everything that comes in their way, and that they are capable of swallowing. Some of them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> follow vessels several hundred leagues for the carcasses and offals. They sometimes attain to an enormous size, as they often weigh from one to four thousand pounds each. Some few species are gregarious, and live on the mollusca and other marine worms. They are all viviparous, and like the rays, protrude their young in pellucid horny <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, terminated at the four corners by long, slender filaments, and which are generally found twisted round corallines, sea-weed, and other fixed substances. Their flesh is so tough, coarse, and unsavoury, that even the young are hardly eatable. Their bodies emit a phosphoric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> in the dark.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANICULA\">Canicula</a>.**\n\n*<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-PANTHER\">Panther</a> shark*, greater or *spotted dog-fish*.\u2014Nostrils surrounded by a small lobe, and a vermiform appendage; ventral fins separated. Three or four feet long; brownish, with red or black spots; body cylindrical, but compressed at both extremities; skin rough, and when dried, used for polishing and other purposes. Inhabits the sea almost everywhere. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> breeds frequently, and brings about nineteen young at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>.\n\n**Catulus.**\n\n*Spotted shark*, or *lesser spotted dog-fish*.\u2014Nostrils surrounded by a small lobe and a vermiform appendage; ventral fins united. Length from two to three feet. Colour pale brick-red, with very numerous, small dusky spots. Very common in the European seas, very voracious, and a great annoyance to the fishermen. According to Pennant, it breeds from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> to thirteen at a time. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a> is said to be highly noxious, inducing long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> stupor, succeeded by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> itching and loss of the cuticle.\n\n**Galeus.**\n\n*Tope*.\u2014Teeth nearly triangular, and denticulated on the upper margin. Grows to five feet or more, is round and elongated, and often weighs upwards of 27 pounds. It is of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> or darker cinereous hue above, and whitish below. It smells very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, and is so bold as to pursue its prey to the very edge of the shore. It inhabits the European ocean, and is frequently seen about the British coasts.\n\n**Mygalea.**\n\n*Hammer-headed shark*, or *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a>-fish*.\u2014Head very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> and transverse, somewhat in the shape of a hammer. This deformed species <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> from five to fifteen or seventeen feet. The body is rather slender, and somewhat cylindrical; the head dilated on each side to a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, with the eyes which are very large, placed at each extremity. It is brown above; and paler, or whitish beneath. Native of the Mediterranean and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> seas, where it attacks such as are accidentally exposed to its fury, or are inadvertently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a> in its neighbourhood. The natives of Otaheite, trifling to their dexterity in swimming, appear to hold it in contempt.\n\n**Heart-headed shark.**\u2014Head very broad and heart-shaped. In other respects greatly allied to the preceding, but is much more rare, and chiefly inhabits the South American seas.\n\n**Blue shark.**\u2014Sides of the tail smooth, a cavity on the back of the tail. Of a more slender and elegant shape than the other species, measures from ten to fourteen feet, is of a blue-green above and white beneath. It is very bold and voracious; inhabits the European seas, and frequents several of the British coasts, especially those of Cornwall, during the pilchard season.\n\n**Porbeagle shark**\u2014A longitudinal fold on each side cornubi of the tail. Length from three to eight feet; shape cus round, except near the tail, where it is depressed; colour deep on the back, and white or silvery beneath. Inhabits the sea about Cornwall. The *monensis*, or *Beaman's shark* of Pennant, is now regarded only as a variety of *carnubius*.\n\n**Basking shark.**\u2014With conical teeth, not serrated. *maximus*. Body slender, and from three to twelve yards in length, of a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> colour above, and white below. The upper jaw is blunt at the end, and much longer than the lower. The mouth is furnished with a great multitude of small teeth, of which those in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> are much bent, and the remote ones conical and sharp pointed. It has two dorsal, two pectoral, two ventral fins, and one small anal fin. This species inhabits the northern seas, and derives its name from its propensity to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> on the surface of the water, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> to bask in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, generally on its belly, and sometimes on its back. It feeds on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-SEA_PLANTS\">sea-<a cla</a>ss=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> and medusae, and betrays none of that ferocity of disposition which characterizes most of the shark tribe; on the contrary, it seems so little afraid of mankind, as often to suffer itself to be patted and stroked. These animals frequent our seas during the warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> months, and appear in shoals on the Welsh and Scottish coasts, after intervals of a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of years. They are observed in the frith of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLYDE\">Clyde</a> and among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBRIDES\">Hebrides</a> in small troops of seven or eight, or more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> in pairs, about midsummer, and disappear about the latter end of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>. They swim very deliberately, and generally with their upper fins above water. Sometimes they may be seen sporting among the waves, and springing several feet above the surface. They are pursued and taken by the fishermen for the sake of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> contained in the liver; that viscus sometimes weighing a thousand pounds, and yielding eight barrels of oil, and two of useless sediment. When pursued, they do not quicken their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> is almost in contact with them, when the harpooner strikes his weapon into the body, as near the gills as he can. Sometimes they remain in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> till the united strength of two men is exerted to force the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> deeper. Then they plunge headlong to the bottom, and frequently coil the rope round their bodies, and endeavour to get rid of the harpoon by rolling on the ground. Discovering that these efforts are vain, they swim with such strength and rapidity, that one instance has occurred of a basking shark towing to some distance a vessel of 70 tons burthen, against a fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALE\">gale</a>. They sometimes run off with 200 fathoms of line, and two harpoons in them, and will employ the men from 12 to 24 hours before they are subdued. A large fish has afforded the captors a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a>.\nA male of this species (says Dr Shaw) was taken in the year 1821, at Abbotsbury in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DORSETSHIRE\">Dorsetshire</a> entangled in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEINE\">seine</a>, and after a violent resistance, was dragged ashore. It is said to have received 17 musket-balls before it expired; its length was 28 feet, and its circumference in the thickest part about 20 feet; its tail, from point to point, near eight feet; the teeth, according to its proprietor, who took pains to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> them, amounted to the number of four thousand.\" The skin make excellent flaggreen.\n\nWhite shark.\u2014Triangular serrated teeth. This species, so remarkable for its powers of destruction, is a native of most seas, but occurs more frequently in the warm than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> latitudes. It arrives at the length of more than 30 feet, and is rather thicker and broader than most of its congeners. The mouth is very wide, and furnished on the margin of each jaw with from three to six rows of strong, flat, triangular, sharp-pointed, and finely serrated teeth, which can be raised or depressed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. The general colour of the animal is a pale ash, darker or browner on the upper parts. So great is the strength of the tail, that a young shark of six feet in length, is able by a stroke of this part to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>'s leg; hence it is usual for sailors to cut off the tail the instant they drag a shark on board. Gillius quotes a specimen which weighed four thousand pounds, and another in whose belly was found an entire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> body; and M\u00fcller affirms, that in one taken at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of St Margaret, there was found a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> which had probably been thrown overboard from some ship. The size of the fossil teeth of this species, so often found in the isle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MALTA\">Malta</a>, &c., affords a convincing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the enormous specimens which have once existed. Sharks are the dread of sailors in all hot climates, where they constantly attend the ships in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of what may drop overboard; and a man who has that misfortune is almost instantly devoured. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEARL\">pearl</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">fisheries</a> of South America, every negro, to defend himself against these animals, carries with him into the water a sharp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, which, if the fish offers to assault him, he endeavours to strike into its belly, on which it generally swims off. The officers who are in the vessels keep a watchful eye on these voracious creatures, and on discovering them, shake the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a> fastened to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a>, to put them on their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a>. Many, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> have been in danger, have thrown themselves into the water, with knives in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, and fastened to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>; but too often all their dexterity and precaution have been of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> avail.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">Saw</a>-snouted shark, or saw-fish.\u2014With a long flat snout, let with teeth on both sides through its whole length. Inhabits the southern and northern oceans, grows to fifteen feet in length, and is readily distinguished by its produced and saw-like snout, which is often preserved in museums.\n\nPicked shark, or picked dog-fish.\u2014Dorsal fin spinous; body somewhat round. Length from three to four feet; colour brownish ash above and white beneath; rough, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> prickles, hooked backwards. Common in the European seas, especially about the coasts of Scotland and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a>. When split and dried, it is eaten by the common people.\n\nAngel shark, or angel-fish.\u2014Pectoral fins very large and emarginated before. A deformed species, with cartilaginous large head and pectoral fins, and depressed body, attaining to five or eight feet in length. It is a native of the European seas, and is extremely voracious, fierce, and dangerous. It produces twelve or thirteen young at a birth.\n\nThe other known species of this genus are vulpes, stellaris, mystelus, spinax, centrina, philippinus, cinereus, spinofus, jabella, cirrhatus, barbatus, africanus, ocellatus, griseus, americanus, squamosus, denticulatus, punctulatus, zebra, gronovianus, tentaculatus, and semi-guttatus.\n\nGen. 14. Spatularia.\n\nSpiracles single on each side of the neck, concealed by a large gill-cover; stout produced, and shaped like a spatula; mouth beneath the head, large, and furnished with sharp serrated teeth.\n\nReticulated spatularia.\u2014In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> and appearance this remarkable species is allied to the sharks, but distinguished by its thin snout, of the form of a spatula, and nearly equal in length to the whole remainder of the animal. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> and manners are very imperfectly known.\n\nGen. 15. Raja.\n\nSpiracles on the under part of the neck, ten on each side, oblique; mouth under the head, small, acuminate, as if continuous with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, transverse and dentated; body thin, depressed, and of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RHOMBOID\">rhomboid</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>.\n\nThe species of this genus are entirely confined to the sea, and, being destitute of an air-bladder, live chiefly at the bottom, generally in deep water, covering themselves in winter in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> or mud. They live on shell-fish, or other animal substances that fall in their way. Some of them become of a size so large as to weigh two hundred pounds and upwards. They seldom produce more than one young at a time, which, as in the sharks, is inclosed in a four-cornered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPSULE\">capsule</a>, ending in slender <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, but not, as in the former, produced into long filaments. The liver is large, and often produces a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of oil. They are mostly edible.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TORPEDO\">Torpedo</a>, torpedo ray, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRAMP\">cramp</a> ray, cramp fish, &c.\u2014torpedo. Wholly smooth. The body of this species is of a somewhat circular form, slightly convex above, marked along each side of the spine by several small pores, about eighteen inches, or two feet in length, and for the most part of a pale reddish brown on the upper surface, sometimes marked by five large circular and dusky spots, and whitish or flesh-coloured beneath. It inhabits most seas, but seems to thrive best in the Mediterranean, usually lying in water of about forty fathoms depth, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> with some of its congeners. It preys on smaller fish, which it is supposed to stupefy by its electric or galvanic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, which has been so much exaggerated both by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> writers, is nevertheless, sufficiently remarkable. From some experiments which were made by Mr Walh on a very stout and healthy fish, it appears that no spark could be discovered to proceed from it, and that pith-balls were never found to be affected by it. When insulated, it gave a shock to persons who were likewise insulated.\nChap IV.\n\n**Ichthyology**\n\nCartilaginous Fishes\n\n**Batis.**\n\nSkate.\u2014Back smooth in the middle, with one row of spines. Common in the European seas. The general colour on the upper parts is a pale ash-brown, varied with several dusky undulations, and of the under parts white, marked with numerous distant black spines. In the male, the pectoral fins are bent towards their tips or edges with numerous small spines. In October, the skate is usually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> and thin, but begins to improve in November, and is reckoned to be in the highest perfection in May. Willoughby makes mention of a single skate of two hundred pounds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, which was sold in the fish market at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a> to the cook of St John's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> in that university, and was found sufficient to dine the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, consisting of more than 120 persons.\n\n**Exyrianchus.**\n\nSharp-nosed ray.\u2014Ten aculeated tubercles along the middle of the back. In shape resembles the preceding, but has a longer and sharper snout in the form of a pontoon. Native of the Mediterranean and northern seas.\n\n**Miraletus.**\n\nMirror ray.\u2014Back and belly smooth; spines at the region of the eyes, and a triple row of them at the tail. Each of the pectoral fins is marked about the middle, or near the body, with a large circular, eye-shaped spot, consisting of a purplish or dusky circle, with a whitish or yellowish centre. Inhabits the Mediterranean.\n\n**Rubus.**\n\nRough ray.\u2014One row of prickles on the back, and three on the tail. Greatly allied to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THORN\">thorn</a>-back; and rough, with many spines. Inhabits the Mediterranean and other seas.\n\n**Pastinaca.**\n\nSting ray.\u2014Body smooth; long serrated spine on the fore part of the tail; no dorsal fin. Shape somewhat rhomboidal; snout pointed; colour of the body yellowish olive above, and whitish beneath. With its long flattened spine, which is finely serrated in a reverse direction on both sides, it is capable of inflicting very severe wounds. As it is annually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>, the new spine sometimes arrives at a considerable size before the old one drops off, in which state the animal has been occasionally described as a distinct species. Though formerly supposed to contain a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a>, this weapon is found to be wholly destitute of any venomous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. Inhabits the European, Red, and Indian seas, and is ranked among the edible rays.\n\n**Clavata.**\n\nThorn-back.\u2014Prickly; teeth tuberculated; a transverse cartilage on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a>. Resembles the common skate, but is somewhat broader in proportion, and is easily distinguished from it by the very strong curved spines with which its upper surface is covered. It is an inhabitant of the Mediterranean and other seas, and esteemed as a food. The thorn-back begins to be in season in November, and continues so later than the skate; but the young of both are good at all times of the year.\n\nTo complete the specific catalogue of this genus, we have to add *fullonica*, *eglantaria*, *acuta*, *nigra*, *picta*, *un*., *Cartilaginosa*, *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBA\">alba</a>*, *margarina*, *chagrinea*, *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AQUILA\">aquila</a>*, *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUIANA\">guiana</a>*, *far*., *ious filies*, *ciata*, *lymna*, *cuculatus*, *fesben*, *tuberculata*, *pocillina*, *diadema*, *bolus*, *manatia*, *girma*, *fabroniana*, *bankiana*, *bimbrata*, *maculata*, *bicolor*, *sinensis*, *rhinobatos*, *thouimiana*, *djidendenis*, and *curvata*.\n\n**Gen. 16. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETROMYZON\">Petromyzon</a>.**\n\nPetromyzon.\n\nHead more slender than the body; mouth larger above than below; teeth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a>-coloured, hollow within, surrounded with a fleshy rim, curved above, broad below; seven spiracles at the sides of the neck; a filiform opening at the back part of the head; no pectoral or ventral fins.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMPREY\">Lamprey</a>, great lamprey, or sea lamprey.\u2014Mouth minute, within covered with papillae; the hinder dorsal fin separate from the tail. In general appearance, approaches nearly to the eel tribe, especially to the murenae. Though it sometimes exceeds three feet in length, the British specimens are usually of inferior size. Its general colour is a dull brownish olive, clouded with yellowish white variegations; the fins are tinged with dull orange, and the tail with blue. On the top of the head is a small orifice for the discharge of the superfluous water taken in at the mouth and gills. Among the cartilaginous fishes, none is so destitute of all appearance of real bone as the lamprey, in which, the spine itself is no other than a mere soft cartilage, without any processes or protuberances. The heart, instead of being inclosed in a soft pericardium, as in other animals, is guarded by a strong cartilaginous one; and the liver is of a fine grass-green colour. It inhabits the ocean, and ascends rivers chiefly during the latter end of winter and the early months of spring. It is viviparous; and the young are of slow growth. Though capable of swimming with rapidity, it is more commonly seen attached by the mouth to some large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> or other substance, and that with such power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADHESION\">adhesion</a>, that a weight of more than twelve pounds may be raised without forcing the fish to forego its hold. It is supposed to live principally on worms and young fish. Like the eel, it is remarkably tenacious of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, the several parts, when cut in pieces, continuing to move, and the head strongly attaching itself for several hours to a stone, though by far the greater part of the body be cut away from it.\n\n\"As an article of food,\" (observes Dr Shaw) \"the lamprey has for many ages maintained its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> as on exquisite dainty; and has uniformly made its appearance at the most splendid of our ancient entertainments. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> Henry I. it is well known, is attributed to a too luxurious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> in this his favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISH\">dish</a>. It still continues to be in high esteem; and we are told by Mr Pennant, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLOUCESTER\">Gloucester</a> continues to fend yearly, at Christmas, a present of a rich lamprey pie to the king. It sometimes happens that the lampreys at that season are so rare, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUINEA\">guinea</a> is demanded for the price of a single fish. They are most in season during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, April, and May, and are observed to be much more firm when fresh arrived from sea than when they have been a considerable time in fresh water. They are found in several of the British rivers, but that which is most celebrated for them is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVERN\">Severn</a>.\"\n\nLesser lamprey or lampern.\u2014The hinder dorsal fin fluvialitis angulated.\nCartilaginous fish. From 10 to 15 inches long; the back brown or dusky, sometimes clouded, or mixed with blue; the upper part of the body marked by numerous annular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>, and the whole under-sides silvery. Inhabits the sea, and ascends, in spring, most of the European rivers, in which it is found much more frequently and plentifully than the great lamprey. It is often potted with the latter, and by some preferred to it, on account of its milder <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. The Dutch purchase vast quantities of this species as bait for their cod and turbot fisheries. In the river Bauter, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURLAND\">Courland</a>, great quantities are taken from beneath the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>, with nets; they are much larger than those found elsewhere, and are packed in snow, and sent to any distance; and, when put into cold water, recover themselves. This species is so tenacious of life, that it will live many days out of the water.\n\nMinute lamprey or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a>.\u2014The hinder dorsal fin linear; the lips behind lobated. Has a worm-like appearance; measures from four to seven inches in length; is not observed to adhere to other bodies; inhabits the European rivers, and is more frequent in the Iffs than elsewhere, in England.\n\nThe remaining species are planteri, ruber, sanguifuga, argenteus, plumbeus, and bicolor.\n\nGen. 17. GASTROBRANCHUS.\n\nBody eel-shaped; mouth beneath, with numerous pectinate teeth; two spiracles beneath the abdomen.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">Blind</a> gastrobranchus. Myxine glutinosa, Lin.\u2014Livid, paler beneath; with eight beards at the mouth. Removed to the class of fishes, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of Dr Bloch's accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> and internal structure. In general appearance, in the situation of the mouth, and in the orange colour of the teeth, it approaches very near to the lamprey. But it is remarkable for the total want of eyes, no vestige of any such organ being discoverable by the most attentive examination. The body is destitute of scales, lateral line, and fins, except that shallow one which forms the tail. Beneath the body, from head to tail, runs a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> row of equitant pores. The spiracles, which are a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of oval apertures, are situated beneath the body, at some distance from the head. This singular species is said to enter into the bodies of such fishes as it happens to find on the fisherman's hooks, and which consequently have not the power of escaping its attack, and by gnawing its way through the skin, to devour all the internal parts, leaving only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> and the skin remaining. Such is its uncommon glutinous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, that, if put into a large vessel of sea water, it soon renders the whole so viscid, as easily to be drawn out into the form of threads. It inhabits the northern seas, and seems also to occur in those of the southern hemisphere.\n\nDombeyan gastrobranchus.\u2014Head tumid. Much larger than the European species; the head rounded, and larger than the body; four beards on the upper lip, the number of those on the lower uncertain, the specimen being described in a dried state. Eyes and nostrils imperceptible. Native of the South American seas. Observed by M. Dombey, and described by La C\u00e9p\u00e9de from the dried skin in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">museum</a>.\n\nBefore we conclude this article, it may be proper to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the reader's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to M. Nouel's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> relative to two methods of multiplying fishes. The first consists in conveying from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a> to the rivers, and from the rivers to the lakes, fish found only in one of them; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, in introducing into fresh water, as it were infinitely, and by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> ponds, fish produced in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> water, giving the preference to those species, which by their habits and manner of living, might be most adapted to this kind of naturalization.\n\nThe first of these methods has been successfully practiced in Germany, with regard to the thad, in ponds and clear flagrant waters, with a bottom of sand or gravel. Perch and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TROUT\">trout</a> have, in like manner, been conveyed into lakes and rivers in Scotland, and have thriven remarkably well. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARP\">carp</a>, which affects a warm temperature, has been successively introduced into the rivers and ponds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>, and England. M. Poivre first brought the gourami of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a> into the isle of France, where it has greatly multiplied.\n\n\"Our rivers,\" says this judicious writer, \"do not contain more than about twenty indigenous species, and some migratory fishes, which at certain periods of the year ascend to a certain distance from their mouths, or, like the salmon, swim towards their sources as far as they can. The small rivers possess still fewer species; the greatest part even are confined to the tench, the trout, eels, and some smaller fish of little value. How advantageous would it be to introduce into these rivers a multitude of foreign fish, which, in these waters could find aliment more agreeable to their taste, and which would enjoy a temperature as analogous to their wants, as favourable to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-REPRODUCTION\">reproduction</a>!\n\n\"The Seine, which I shall take as an example, nourishes many species of salmo and cyprinus: but how many other fish of the same kind might be propagated in it! If the Seine possesses the salmon, it wants the thymallus, the umber of Auvergne, the lavaretus, the murcena of Germany, the grilfe of Scotland, the pala of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a>, the ferra of the lake of Geneva, &c. Why should not the carp of the lago di <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARDA\">Guarda</a>, and the schwarz-ritter of the lakes of Berchtoldgaden, an excellent kind of salmon, highly praised by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> de Moll, a naturalist of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALZBURG\">Salzburg</a>, succeed in France, if that bottom, to which they are most attached, were procured for them, at the foot of the Cevennes or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VOSGES\">Vosges</a>? Why might they not be afterwards gradually introduced into our small rivers? Can it be believed, that the numerous tribe of the trout kind, which swarm in the rivers of Scotland, would refuse to supply our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> with their species? No. There can be no doubt that they would bring thither that fecundity, abundance, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a>, which render them so valuable to their native streams. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> would be the same with the boulldes and higlings presented to us by the lakes of Switzerland, and with the gudgeon, the cyprinus ballerus, and the salmo umbra, bred in the rivers of Lower Germany. Let us open, then, with these countries a philosophical and liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> of the best fish of France for those of which we wish to be possessed.\"\n\nNature herself seems to point to the success of the second method. In many instances, salmon and sturgeon have habituated themselves to a fresh-water residence.\nNaturalization of Fishes.\n\nPallas discovered the sea-dog in the lake <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAIKAL\">Baikal</a>; and Liancourt found the herring in several of the rivers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> America. It likewise deserves to be remarked that the large plaice, transported from the North sea to the ponds of East Friesland, have increased by myriads, and imparted great value to water which was formerly unproductive.\n\n\"In the year 1799, (continues M. Nouel), I had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a>, in one of the fittings of the National Institute, a memoir on the means and advantages of naturalizing the herring, a salt-water fish, in the waters of the Seine, near its mouth, &c. The account of the processes for accomplishing this end, which I there pointed out, are not susceptible of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a>, and cannot, therefore, be introduced into this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a>; it will be sufficient for me to say, that the report of Lac\u00e9p\u00e9de, Cuvier, and T\u00e9ssier, was entirely in their favour. At present, I am still more convinced of the efficacy of the means which I then proposed; and I have no doubt that, if artificial ponds were formed on the edges of rivers, the experiment would be attended with complete success. 'Every man,' (says Dr Franklin), who catches a fish, draws from the water a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>.' Let not the maxims and example of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> be lost to posterity; let them rather produce fruit, like strong and vigorous seed sown in a fertile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>. Having observed in New England, that the herrings ascended from the sea into one river of that country, while a single individual was never seen in another river, separated from the former by a narrow tongue of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, and which communicated also with the sea, this philosopher took the leaves of some plants on which the herrings had deposited their ova, already fecundated, and conveyed them to the river which was deprived of the annual visit of these fish. The success of this experiment surpassed his expectations; the ova were completely productive; and the following year the river was peopled with a numerous shoal of herrings, which, since that time, have continued to frequent it.\n\n\"This fish is not the only one which I which to see naturalized in fresh water; to the herring I would add several species of pleuronectes\u2014also the mullet, goby, whitling, gar-fish, and perhaps, one or two species of the gurnard. I would pay the greatest attention possible to the nature of the water proper for each species. This happy choice is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> condition, and that which could ensure success; but I would select in particular for this colonization, the fish found in lakes, which, though little known, are more numerous than is commonly supposed, and ought to be so.\"\n\nBy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADOPTION\">adoption</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, which is susceptible of more ample development, society would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> an increased quantity of provision, and the naturalist would multiply his opportunities of observation.\n\nFor the modes of preserving fish in cabinets, see Preserving Fish, means of.","sp":115,"ep":121},{"h":"ICHTHYOPHAGI","t":"FISH-EATERS, a name given to a people, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> rather to several different people, who lived wholly on fishes; the word is Greek, compounded of \u1f30\u03c7\u03b8\u03cd\u03c2, \u03c0\u1fd6\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2, \"fish,\" and \u1f10\u03b4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5, \"to eat.\"\n\nThe Ichthyophagi spoken of by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a> are placed by Sanfon in the provinces of Nanquin and Xantong.

See IMAGE. But the tumults occasioned by it were quelled by a revolution, which, in 713, deprived Bardanes of the imperial throne. The dispute, however, broke out with redoubled fury under Leo the Isaurian, who issued out an edict in the year 726, abrogating, as some say, the worship of images, and ordering all the images, except that of Christ's crucifixion, to be removed out of the churches; but according to others, this edict only prohibited the paying to them any kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a> or worship. This edict occasioned a civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, which broke out in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> of the Archipelago, and by the suggestions of the priests and monks, ravaged a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, and afterwards reached <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>. The civil commotions and insurrections in Italy were chiefly promoted by the Roman pontiffs, Gregory I. and II. Leo was excommunicated, and his subjects in the Italian provinces violated their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a>, and rising in arms either massacred or banished all the emperor's deputies and officers. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of these proceedings, Leo assembled a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> at Constantinople in 730, which degraded Germanus, the bishop of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, who was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> of images; and he ordered all the images to be publicly burnt, and inflicted a variety of severe punishments upon such as were attached to that idolatrous worship. Hence arose two factions; one of which adopted the adoration and worship of images, and on that account were called ICONODULI or ICONOLATRES; and the other maintained that such worship was unlawful, and that nothing was more worthy the zeal of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> than to demolish and destroy those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a> and pictures which were the occasions of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> idolatry; and hence they were distinguished by the titles of ICONOMACHI (from \u03b5\u1f30\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd image, and \u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 I contend,) and ICONOCLASTAE. The zeal of Gregory II. in favour of image worship, was not only imitated, but even surpassed by his successor Gregory III., in consequence of which the Italian provinces were torn from the Grecian empire.\n\nConstantine, called Copronymus, from \u03bf\u1f34\u03ba\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>,\" and \u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1 \"name,\" because he was said to have defiled the sacred font at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a>, succeeded his father Leo in 741, and in 754 convened a council at Constantinople, regarded by the Greeks as the seventh ecumenical council, which solemnly condemned the worship and use of images. Those who, notwithstanding this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> of the council, raised commotions in the state, were severely punished; and new laws were enacted, to fet bounds to the violence of monastic rage. Leo IV. who was declared emperor in 775, pursued the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, and had recourse to the coercive influence of penal laws, in order to extirpate idolatry out of the Christian church. Irene, the wife of Leo, poisoned her husband in 780; assumed the reins of empire during the minority of her son Constantine, and in 786 summoned a council at Nice in Bithynia, known by the name of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> Nicene council, which abrogated the laws and decrees against the new idolatry, restored the worship of images and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>, and denounced severe punishments against those who maintained that God was the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of religious adoration. In this contest, the Britons, Germans, and Gauls, were of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that images might be lawfully <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in churches, but they considered the worship of them as highly injurious and offensive to the Supreme Being. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLEMAGNE\">Charlemagne</a> distinguished himself as a mediator in this controversy: he ordered four books concerning images to be composed, refuting the reasons urged by the Nicene <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> to justify the worship of images, which he sent to Adrian the Roman pontiff in 790, in order to engage him to withdraw his approbation of the decrees of the last council of Nice. Adrian wrote an answer; and in 794, a council of 300 bishops, assembled by Charlemagne at Francfort on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAINE\">Maine</a>, confirmed the opinion contained in the four books, and solemnly condemned the worship of images. In the Greek church, after the banishment of Irene, the controversy concerning images broke out anew, and was carried on by the contending parties, during the half of the ninth century, with various and uncertain success. The emperor Nicephorus appears upon the whole to have been an enemy to this idolatrous worship. His successor, Michael Curapolates, named Rhangabe, patronized and encouraged it. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> changed on the accession of Leo the Armenian to the empire; who assembled a council at Constantinople in 814, that abolished the decrees of the Nicene council. His successor Michael, named Balbus, disapproved the worship of images, and his son Theophilus treated them with great severity. However, the empress Theodora, after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, and during the minority of her son, assembled a council at Constantinople in 842, which reinstated the decrees of the second Nicene council, and encouraged image worship by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>. The council held at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> under Photius, in 879, and reckoned by the Greeks the eighth general council, confirmed and renewed the Nicene decrees. In commemoration of this council, a festival was instituted by the superstitious Greeks, called the feast of orthodoxy. The Latins were generally of opinion, that images might be suffered as the means of aiding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of the faithful, and of calling to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> the pious exploits and virtuous actions of the persons whom they represented; but they detested all thoughts of paying them the least\nIconoclast marks of religious homage or adoration. The council of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, assembled in 824 by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> the Meek, resolved to allow the use of images in the churches, but severely prohibited rendering them religious worship. Nevertheless, towards the conclusion of this century, the Gallican clergy began to pay a kind of religious homage to the images of saints, and their example was followed by the Germans and other nations. However, the Iconoclasts still had their adherents among the Latins; the most eminent of whom was Claudius bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURIN\">Turin</a>, who, in 823, ordered all images, and even the crosses, to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> out of the churches, and committed to the flames; and he wrote a treatise, in which he declared both against the use and worship of them. He condemned relics, pilgrimages to the Holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">Land</a>, and all voyages to the tombs of saints; and to his writings and labours it was owing, that the city of Turin, and the adjacent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, was, for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> after his death, much less infected with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> than the other parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. The controversy concerning the sanctity of images was again revived by Leo bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHALCEDON\">Chalcedon</a>, in the 11th century, on occasion of the emperor Alexius's converting the figures of silver that adorned the portals of the churches into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> in order to supply the exigencies of the state. The bishop obstinately maintained that he had been guilty of sacrilege; and published a treatise, in which he affirmed, that in these images there resided an inherent sanctity, and that the adoration of Christians ought not to be confined to the persons represented by these images, but extended to the images themselves. The emperor assembled a council at Constantinople, which determined, that the images of Christ and of the saints were to be honoured only with a relative worship; and that invocations and worship were to be addressed to the saints only as the servants of Christ, and on account of their relation to him as their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>. Leo, dissatisfied even with these absurd and superstitious decisions, was sent into banishment. In the western church, the worship of images was disapproved and opposed by several considerable parties, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETROBRUSIANS\">Petrobrusians</a>, Albigenses, Waldenses, &c. till at length this idolatrous practice was entirely abolished in many parts of the Christian world by the Reformation.

In criminal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, therefore, idiots and lunatics are not chargeable for their own acts, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> committed when under these incapacities: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a>, not even for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a> itself.

And if, after he has pleaded, the prisoner becomes mad, he shall not be tried: for how can he make his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>? If, after he has been tried and found guilty, he loses his senses before judgment, judgment shall not be pronounced; and if, after judgment, he becomes of non-fane memory, execution shall be stayed: for peradventure, says the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> of the English law, had the prisoner been of sound memory, he might have alleged something in stay of judgment <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> execution. Indeed, in the bloody reign of Henry VIII., a statute was made, which enacted, that if a person, being compos mentis, should commit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> treason, and after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into madness, he might be tried in his absence, and should suffer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, as if he were of perfect memory. But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> and inhuman law was repealed by the statute 1 & 2 Ph. & M. c. 10. For, as is observed by Sir Edward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COKE\">Coke</a>, \"the execution of an offender is for example, ut pena <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a> paucos, metus ad omnes perveniat:\" but so it is not when a madman is executed; but should be a miserable spectacle, both against law, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> inhumanity and cruelty, and can be no example to others.\" But if there be any doubt whether the party be compos or not, this shall be tried by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a>. And if he be found, a total idiocy, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> insanity, excuses from the guilt, and of course from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>, of any criminal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> committed under such deprivation of the senses; but if a lunatic hath lucid intervals of understanding, he shall answer for what he does in those intervals, as if he had no deficiency. Yet, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of absolute madness, as they are not answerable for their actions, they should not be permitted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of acting unless under proper control; and, in particular, they ought not to be suffered to go loose, to the terror of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s subjects. It was the doctrine of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> law, that persons deprived of their reason might be confined till they recovered their senses, without waiting for the forms of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> or other special authority from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>; and now, by the vagrant acts, a method is chalked out for imprisoning, chaining, and sending them to their proper homes.\n\nThe matrimonial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> likewise cannot take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in a state of idiocy. It was formerly adjudged, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDIOT\">idiot</a> was legitimate, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> valid. A strange determination! since consent is absolutely requisite to matrimony, and neither idiots nor lunatics are capable of consenting to anything. And therefore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CIVIL_LAW\">civil law</a> judged much more feebly, when it made such deprivations of reason a previous impediment, though not a cause of divorce if they happened after marriage. And <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> regulations have adhered to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of the civil law, by determining that the marriage of a lunatic, not being in a lucid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, was absolutely void. But as it might be difficult to prove the exact state of the party's mind at the actual celebration of the nuptials, upon this account (concurring with some private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> reasons *), *See Priz. the statute 15 Geo. II. c. 30. has provided, that the vate alis, marriage of lunatics and persons under phrenises (if 23 Geo. II. found lunatics under a commission, or committed to c. 6. the care of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TRUSTEES\">trustees</a> under any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>) before they are declared of sound mind by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a>, or the majority of such trustees, shall be totally void.\n\nIdiots and persons of non-fane memory, as well as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> and persons under dures, are not totally disabled either to convey or purchase, but sub modo only. For their conveyances and purchases are voidable, but not actually void. The king indeed, on behalf of an idiot, may avoid his grants or other acts. But it hath been said, that a non compos himself, though he be afterwards brought to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> mind, shall not be permitted to allege his own insanity in order to avoid such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a>; for that no man shall be allowed to flatter himself, or plead his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISABILITY\">disability</a>. The progress of this notion is somewhat curious. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of Edward I., non compos was a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLEA\">plea</a> to void a man's own bond; and there is a writ in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> for the alienor himself to recover lands aliened by him during his insanity; dum fuit non compos mentis fuerit, ut dictum, &c. But under Edward III., a scruple began to arise, whether a man should be permitted to blemish himself, by pleading his own insanity; and, afterwards, a defendant in affrege having pleaded a release by the plaintiff since the last continuance, to which the plaintiff replied (are tenuis, as the manner then was) that he was out of his mind when he gave it, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> adjourned the affrege; doubting, whether as the plaintiff was sane\u2014both then and at the commencement of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a>, he should be permitted to plead an intermediate deprivation of reason; and the question was asked, how he came to remember to release, if out of his senses when he gave it? Under Henry VI., this way of reasoning, (that a man shall not be allowed to disfigure himself, by pleading his own incapacity, because he cannot know what he did under such a situation) was seriously adopted by the judges in argument; upon a question whether the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> was barred of his right of entry by the seisinment of his insane ancestor? And from these loose authorities, which Fitzherbert does not scruple to reject as being contrary to reason, the maxim that a man shall not flatter himself, hath been handed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> as settled law; though later opinions, feeling the inconvenience of the rule, have in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> endeavoured to restrain it. And, clearly, the next heir or other person interested, may, after the death of the idiot or non compos, take advantage of his incapacity and avoid the...\nthe grant. And so, too, if he purchases under this disability, and does not afterwards upon recovering his senses agree to the purchase, his heir may either waive or accept the estate at his option. In like manner, an infant may waive such purchase or conveyance, when he comes to full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>; or, if he does not then actually agree to it, his heir may waive it after him. Persons, also, who purchase or convey under duress, may affirm or avoid such transaction, whenever the duress is ceased. For all these are under the protection of the law; which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not suffer them to be imposed upon through the imbecility of their present condition; so that their acts are only binding in case they are afterwards agreed to when such imbecility ceases. Yet the guardians or committees of a lunatic, by the statute 11 Geo. III. c. 23, are empowered to renew in his right, under the directions of the court of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHANCERY\">chancery</a>, any lease for lives or years, and apply the profits of such renewal for the benefit of such lunatic, his heirs, or executors.

This indeed may have been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> with respect to each of the above kinds of idolatry; and thus the Israelites adored God under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of a calf.\n\nThe stars were the first objects of idolatrous worship, on account of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, their influence on the productions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and the regularity of their motions, particularly the sun and moon, which are considered as the most glorious and refulgent images of the Deity: afterwards, as their sentiments became more\nIdolatry, more corrupted, they began to form images, and to entertain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of consecration, the gods were called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to inhabit or dwell in their statues. Hence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARNOBIUS\">Arnobius</a> takes occasion to rally the Pagans for guarding so carefully the statues of their gods, who, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they were really present in their images, might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> their worshippers the trouble of securing them from thieves and robbers.\n\nAs to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a> which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Pagans paid to the statues of their gods, it is certain, that the wiser and more sensible heathens considered them only as simple representations or figures designed to recall to their minds the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of their gods. This was the opinion of Varro and Seneca; and the same sentiment is clearly laid down in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>, who maintains, that images are inanimate, and that all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> paid to them has respect to the gods whom they represent. But as to the vulgar, they were stupid enough to believe the statues themselves to be gods, and to pay divine worship to stocks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>.\n\nSoon after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>, idolatry seems to have been the prevailing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> of all the world: for wherever we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> our eyes at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a>, we scarcely see anything but false worship and idolatry. And it appears from Scripture, that Abraham's forefathers, and even Abraham himself, were for a time idolaters.\n\nThe Hebrews were indeed expressly forbidden to make any representation of God: they were not to much as to look upon an idol: and from the time of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACCABEES\">Maccabees</a> to the destruction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, the Jews extended this precept to the making the figure of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>: by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of Moses, they were obliged to destroy all the images they found, and were forbidden to apply any of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> or silver to their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> one might receive the least profit from anything belonging to an idol. Of this the Jews, after they had imitated for their idolatry, were so sensible, that they thought it unlawful to use any vessel that had been employed in sacrificing to a false god, to warm themselves with the wood of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROVE\">grove</a> after it was cut down, or to shelter themselves under its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>.\n\nBut the preaching of the Christian religion, wherever it prevailed, entirely rooted out idolatry; as did also that of Mahomet, which is built on the worship of one God. It must not, however, be forgotten, that the Protestant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Rome, with paying an idolatrous kind of worship to the pictures or images of saints and martyrs: before these they burn lamps and wax candles; before these, they burn incense, and, kneeling, offer up their vows and petitions; they, like the Pagans, believe that the saint to whom the image is dedicated, resides in a particular manner about its shrine, and works <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a> by the intervention of its image; and that if the image was destroyed or taken away, the saint would no longer perform any miracle in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>.","sp":138,"ep":139},{"h":"IDOMENEUS","t":"in fabulous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, succeeded his father <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEUCALION\">Deucalion</a> on the throne of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRETE\">Crete</a>.

Idomeneus performed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> to the god; and the inhumanity and ruthlessness of this sacrifice rendered him so odious in the eyes of his subjects, that he left Crete, and migrated in quest of a settlement.

According to the Greek scholiast of Lycophron, v. 1217, Idomeneus, during his absence in the Trojan war, intrusted the management of his kingdom to Leucos, to whom he promised his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> Clitihere in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> at his return.

Arriving at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMYRNA\">Smyrna</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IONIA\">Ionia</a>, he went to visit Polycarp bishop of that place, and was himself visited by the clergy of the Asian churches round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. In return for that kindness, he wrote letters to several churches, as the Ephesians, Magnesians, and Trallians, besides the Romans, for their instruction and establishment in the faith; one of these was addressed to the Christians at Rome, to acquaint them with his present state, and passionate desire not to be hindered in the course of martyrdom which he was now hastening to accomplish.\n\nHis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a>, a little impatient of their stay, set sail with him for Troas, a noted city of the lesser <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHRYGIA\">Phrygia</a>, not far from the ruins of old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">Troy</a>; where, at his arrival, he was much refreshed with the news he received of the persecution ceasing in the church of Antioch: hither also several churches sent their messengers to pay their respects to him; and hence too he dispatched two epistles, one to the church of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILADELPHIA\">Philadelphia</a>, and the other to that of Smyrna; and, together with this last, as Eusebius relates, he wrote privately to Polycarp, recommending to him the care and instruction of the church of Antioch.\n\nFrom Troas they sailed to Neapolis, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> town in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACEDONIA\">Macedonia</a>; thence to Philippi, a Roman colony, where they were entertained with all imaginable kindness and courtesy, and conducted forwards on their journey, passing on foot through Macedonia and Epirus, till they came to Epidamnum, a city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DALMATIA\">Dalmatia</a>; where again taking shipping, they sailed through the Adriatic, and arrived at Rhegium, a port-town in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>; directing their course thence through the Tyrrhenian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> to Puteoli, whence Ignatius desired to proceed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, ambitious to trace the same way by which St Paul went to Rome: but this wish was not complied with; and, after a stay of 24 hours, a prosperous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> quickly carried them to the Roman port, the great harbour and station for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>, built near Oria, at the mouth of the Tyber, about 16 miles from Rome; whither the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARTYR\">martyr</a> longed to come, as much desirous to be at the end of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, as his keepers, weary of their voyage, were to be at the end of their journey.\n\nThe Christians at Rome, daily expecting his arrival, were come out to meet and entertain him, and accordingly received him with a mixture of joy and sorrow; but when some of them intimated, that possibly the populace might be taken off from desiring his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, he expressed a pious indignation, intreating them to cast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> rubs in his way, nor do anything that might hinder him; now he was hastening to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>. There are many such expressions as this in his epistle to the Romans, which plainly show that he was highly ambitious of the crown of martyrdom. Yet it does not appear that he rashly sought <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> provoked danger. Among other expressions of his ardour for suffering, he said, that the wild beasts had feared and refused to touch some that had been thrown to them, which he hoped would not happen to him. Being conducted to Rome, he was presented to the prefect, and the emperor's letters probably delivered concerning him. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> before his martyrdom was spent in prayers for the peace and prosperity of the church. That his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> might be the more pompous and public, one of their solemn festivals, the time of their Saturnalia, and that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of it when they celebrated their Sigillaria, was pitched on for his execution; at which time it was their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> to entertain the people with the bloody conflicts of gladiators, and the hunting and fighting with wild beasts. Accordingly, on the 13th kal. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a>, i.e. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 20, he was brought out into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMPHITHEATRE\">amphitheatre</a>, and the lions being let loose upon him, quickly dispatched their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>, leaving nothing but a few of the hardest of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a>. These remains were gathered up by two deacons who had been the companions of his journey; and being transported to Antioch, were interred in the cemetery, without the gate that leads to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAPHNE\">Daphne</a>; whence, by the command of the emperor Theodore, they were removed with great pomp and solemnity to the Tycheon, a temple within the city, dedicated to the public genius of it, but now consecrated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of the martyr.\n\nSt Ignatius stands at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of those Antinicene fathers, who have occasionally delivered their opinions in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> of Christ, whom he calls the Son of God, and his eternal world.

In the centre is Loch Finlagan, about three miles in circuit, with the little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of that name in the middle. Here the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> of the isles once resided in all the pomp of royalty; but his palaces and offices are now in ruins.

This stone still exists. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> (after the new lord had collected his kindred and vassals) was truly patriarchal. After putting on his armour, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELMET\">helmet</a>, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, he took an oath to rule as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> had done; that is, to govern as a father would his children; his people in return swore that they would pay the same obedience to him as children would to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a>. The dominions of this potentate, about the year 1586, consisted only of Ilay, Jura, Knapdale, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTYRE\">Cantyre</a>; so reduced were they from what they had been before the deprivation of the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Rothes in the reign of James III. Near this is another little isle, where he assembled his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, \"Ilan na Corlie,\" or \"the isle of council;\" where 13 judges constantly sat to decide differences among his subjects; and received for their trouble the 11th part of the value of the affair tried before them. In the first isle were buried the wives and children of the lords of the isles; but their own persons were deposited in the more sacred ground of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IONA\">Iona</a>. On the shores of the lake are some marks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of his Carnauch and Gilli-glashees, \"the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> of the isles;\" the first signifying a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, the last a grim-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> fellow.

These are the troops that Shakespeare alludes to, when he speaks of a Donald, who\n\nFrom the Western isles\nOf Kerns and Gallow-glashees was supplied.\n\nBesides those already mentioned, the lords had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> and chapel at Laggan, on the south side of Lochindaal: a strong castle on a rock in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, at Dunowall, at the south-east end of the country; for they made this isle their residence after their expulsion from that of Man in 1304.\u2014There is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>, that while the isle of Man was part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of the isles, the rents were for a time paid in this country: those in silver were paid on a rock, still called Creig-a-nisne, or \"the rock of the silver rent;\" the other, Creig-a-nairrid, or \"the rock of rents in kind.\" These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> opposite to each other, at the mouth of a harbour on the south side of this isle. There are several forts built on the isles in fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> lakes, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVERS\">divers</a> caverns in different parts of the isle, which have been used occasionally as places of strength. The isle is divided into four parishes, viz. Kildalton, Killarow, Kilchoman, and Kilmenie. The produce is corn of different kinds; such as bear, which sometimes yields eleven fold; and oats six fold. Much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a> is raised here, and about \u00a32000. worth sold out of the isle in yarn, which might better be manufactured on the spot, to give employ to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> natives. Notwithstanding the excellency of the land, above \u00a31000. worth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a> is annually imported (a). Ale is frequently made in this isle of the young tops of heath, mixing two-thirds of that plant with one of malt, sometimes adding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-HOPS\">hops</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOETHIUS\">Boethius</a> relates, that this liquor was much used among the Piets; but when that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> was extirpated by the Scots, the secret of making it perished with them.

Il\u00e0 indeed enjoys the peculiar advantages of being not only a grazing but a corn country, and can thus afford a very considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a> of both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of produce. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of cattle now exported far exceeds that stated above by Pennant.\nthe price of 50 shillings each. The island is often overcrowded, and numbers die in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> for want of fodder. None but milch-cows are housed; cattle of all other kinds, except the fiddle-horses, run out during winter.\n\nThe number of inhabitants, when Ilay was visited by Pennant, is computed to have been between seven and eight thousand. About 700, says he, are employed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> and in the fishery; the rest are gentlemen-farmers, and subtenants or servants. The women spin. The servants are paid in kind; the sixth part of the crop. They have houses gratis; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> gives them the seed for the first year, and lends them horses to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a> annually the land annexed.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a> of this island, as enumerated by Mr Pennant*, are dogs, weasels, otters, and hares: the last small, dark-coloured, and bad runners. The birds are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EAGLES\">eagles</a>, peregrine falcons, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAME\">game</a>, and a very few ptarmigans. Red-breasted goosanders breed on the shore among the loofe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, wild geese in the moors, and herons in the island in Loch-guirm. The fish are plaice, fineardab, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> dabs, mullets, balan, lump-fish, black goby, greater dragonet, and that rare fish the lepadogaiter of M. Gouan. Vipers swarm in the heath; the natives retain the vulgar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of their stinging with their forked tongues (b); that a sword on which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> has fallen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol11.html#article-HIT\">hit</a> in water like a red-hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>; and that a poultice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> ordure is an infallible cure for the bite.\n\nIn this island, Mr Pennant informs us, several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> diversions and superstitions are still preserved: the last indeed are almost extinct, or at most lurk only amongst the very meanest of the people. The late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAKES\">wakes</a> or funerals, like those of the Romans, were attended with sports, and dramatic entertainments composed of many parts, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTORS\">actors</a> often changed their dresses suitably to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>. The subject of the drama was historical, and preserved by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>.\u2014The power of fascination is as strongly believed here as it was by the shepherds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> in times of old.\n\nNescio quis teneros oculis milii fascinat agnos?\n\nBut here the power of the evil eye affects more the milch-cows than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMBS\">lambs</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the good housewife perceives the effect of the malicious on any of her kine, she takes as much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> as she can drain from the enchanted herd (for the witch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> leaves very little). She then boils it with certain herbs, and adds to them flints and untempered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a>; after that she secures the door, and invokes the three sacred persons. This puts the witch into such an agony, that she comes willing-willing to the house, begs to be admitted, to obtain relief by touching the powerful pot: the good woman then makes her terms; the witch restores the milk to the cattle, and in return is freed from her pains. But sometimes, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the trouble of those charms (for it may happen that the disorder may arise from other causes than an evil-eye), the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> is made by immersing in milk a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERB\">herb</a>, and if the cows are supernaturally affected, it instantly distils blood. The unsuccessful lover revenges himself on his happy rival by charms potent as those of the shepherd Alpheibaeus, and exactly similar:\n\nNettle tribus nodis ternor, Amarylli, colorer:\nNette, Amarylli, modo.\n\nDonald takes three threads of different hues, and ties three knots on each, three times imprecating the most cruel disappointments on the nuptial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>: but the bridegroom, to avert the harm, stands at the altar with an untied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOE\">shoe</a>, and puts a sixpence beneath his foot.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> furnishes very few materials for the great events or revolutions of Ilay. It seems to have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> a seat of empire, probably jointly with the Isle of Man, as being most conveniently situated for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the rest of the Hebrides; for Crovan the Norwegian, after his conquest of that island in 1066, retired and finished his days in Ilay. There are more Danish or Norwegian names of places in this island than any other; almost all the present farms derive their titles from them; such as Peribus, Torridale, Torribolfe, and the like. On the retreat of the Danes it became the seat of their successors the lords of the illes; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, after their power was broken, in the reign of James III. in their descendants the Macdonalds, who held or ought to have held it from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>. It was in the possession of a Sir James Macdonald, in the year 1598, the same who won the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of Traill-dhruinard. His power gave umbrage to James VI. who directed the lord of Macleod, Cameron of Lochiel, and the Macneiles of Barra, to support the Macleans in another invasion. The rival parties met near the hill of Benbigger, east of Kilbarrow; a fierce engagement ensued, and the Macdonalds were defeated and almost entirely cut off. Sir James escaped to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>; but returned in 1620, was pardoned, received a pension, and died the same year at Glasgow; and in him expired the last of the great Macdonalds. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, irritated by the disturbances raised by private wars waged between these and other clans, refused the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> made by his predecessor, and transferred it to Sir John Campbell of Calder, who held it on paying an annual feu-duty of five hundred pounds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>, which is paid to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. The island was granted to Sir John as a reward for his undertaking the conquest; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> considered it as a dear acquisition, by the loss of many gallant followers, and by the expenses incurred in support of it.","sp":179,"ep":180},{"h":"ILCHESTER","t":"a town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOMERSETSHIRE\">Somersetshire</a> in England, situated on the river Yeo, 129 miles from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, is so called, because it once had a castle, and stands on the river Ivel.

It was erected by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> V. in the midst of a solitary wood, and in the bosom of steep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>. It is chiefly remarkable for its gardens. There is nothing magnificent in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, particularly in its exterior appearance. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> on the side of the garden is of the Corinthian order, and not destitute of elegance. Here are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s apartments, which look upon a parterre surrounded with vases and marble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a>, and a cascade which, for the richness of its decorations, may be compared with the finest of the kind.\n\nThe purity and clearness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> is indeed incomparable. Philip V. could not, in this respect, be better served by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. From the mountains which thine the palace descend several rivulets, which supply the reservoirs. These waters answer the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> purpose of supplying numerous fountains, and of diffusing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> and verdure through the magnificent gardens, the sight of which alone is a sufficient recompense for a journey into Spain. They are on the inside a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> in circumference. The inequality of the ground affords every moment new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of view. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> alleys answer to different summits of neighbouring mountains; and one in particular produces the most agreeable effect. It is terminated at one end by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> front of the palace. From this point are seen, at one view, five fountains, ornamented with elegant groups, rising into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMPHITHEATRE\">amphitheatre</a>, above which appear the summits of lofty mountains. The most elevated of these groups is that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANDROMEDA\">Andromeda</a> fastened to a rock. When seen at a little distance it is perhaps defective, because the rock appears too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTIVE\">diminutive</a> by the side of the monster which threatens Andromeda; and of Perseus, by whom it is attacked; but the whole contributes to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of the view. The most remarkable of the five groups is that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEPTUNE\">Neptune</a>.\n\n\"Genius (says M.

Often have I seated myself, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a> in my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, by the side of this silent water, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a> of the verdant foliage, nor ever did I fail to recollect the famous Quos Ego?\n\n\"There are other fountains worthy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the curious; such as that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LATONA\">Latona</a>, where the limpid heaves, some perpendicularly, and others in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> from the horde throats of the Lycian peasants, half transformed into frogs, and spouting them forth in such abundance, that the statue of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GODDESS\">goddess</a> disappears under the wide mantle of liquid crystal; that also of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIANA\">Diana</a> in the bath, fur-\n\nVol. XI. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">Part</a> I.\nIldelfonso, fenced by thick shades. Some hollows, overshadowed by arching trees, seem to be the abodes of the Naiades. Disturb them not by indireet loquacity, but silently admire and meditate.\n\n\"It is impossible, however, not to go to the source of these waters; let us follow the meandering of their course, and observe the winding paths which there terminate, after appearing and disappearing at intervals through the copse. Let us listen to the bubbling of the rivulets which from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to time escape from our sight, and hasten to the rendezvous assigned them by the descendants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIV. They formerly lost themselves in the valleys, where they quenched the thirst of their humble inhabitants, but are now consecrated to the pleasures of kings. Ascending the back of the pyramidal mountain, behind which their source is concealed, we arrive at the wall which confines a part of them in the garden, and which was hidden by the trees; nothing, however, ought here to recall to mind exclusive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>. Woods, waters, and the majestic solitude of mountains, which are at a distance from the tumult of courts and cities, are the property of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>.\u2014Beyond this wall, which forms the exterior enclosure of the gardens, is an empty and flat ground, where the infant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DON\">Don</a> Louis, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> to the king, chose a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> which he consecrated to cultivation. Farther on, the mountain becomes more steep, and is covered with trees to its summit. Let us now return; as we seek amusement and not fatigue. We <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> follow the course of the waters, they descend in bubbling streams from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the gardens to the other. In their course, in one place they water the feet of the trees, in others they crook an alley to nourish more slowly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> of a parterre. From the basin of Andromeda they run between two rows of trees in the form of a canal, the too sudden inclination of which is taken off by cascades and windings. They receive and carry with them from the gardens the rivulets; which after having played amongst the gods and nymphs, and moistened the throats of the swans, tritons, and lions, humbly descend under ground, and run on into the bosom of the neighbouring meadows, where they fulfill purposes less brilliant but more useful.\n\n\"We must not quit these magnificent gardens without stopping at a place which appears to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> much, but produces not any very great effect. This is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the eight alleys, Plaza de las ocho calles. In the centre is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> of Pandora, the only one which is of whitened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, all the others are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> marble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> painted of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRONZE\">bronze</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. Eight alleys answer to this centre, and each is terminated by a fountain. Plots of verdure fill up the intervals between the alleys, and each has an altar under a portico of white marble by the side of a basin sacred to some god or goddess. These eight altars, placed at equal distances, and decorated among other jets-d'eau, have two which rise in the form of tapers on each side of their divinities. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> regularity displeased Philip V., who a little before his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, when visiting the gardens, made some severe reproaches to the inventor upon the subject. Philip had not the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of completely enjoying what he had created; death surprized him when the works he had begun were but half finished. The undertaking was however the most expensive one of his reign. The finances of Spain, so deranged under the princes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a>, (thanks to the wife calculations of Orry, to the subsidies of France, and still more to the courageous efforts of the faithful Castilians) would have been sufficient for three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and ruinous wars, and for all the operations of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a> which Philip V. had conquered and formed anew, as well as to have resettled the flocks of ambition and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> intrigue; but they sunk beneath the expensive efforts of magnificence.\"\n\nIt is singular that the castle and gardens of St Ildefonso should have cost about 45,000,000 of piastras, precisely the sum in which Philip died indebted. This enormous expense will appear credible, when it is known that the situation of the royal palace was at the beginning of this century the sloping top of a pile of rocks; that it was necessary to dig and hew out the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, and in several places to level the rock; to cut out of its sides a paillage for a hundred different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>, to carry vegetative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> to every place in which it was intended to facilitate cultivation for fertility, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> a mine to clear a paillage to the roots of the numerous trees which are there planted. All these efforts were crowned with success. In the orchards, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a>-gardens, and parterres, there are but few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, espaliers, or plants, which do not thrive; but the trees, naturally of a lofty growth, and which consequently must strike their roots deep into the earth, already prove the insufficiency of art when it attempts to struggle against nature. Many of them languish with withered trunks, and with difficulty keep life in their almost naked branches. Every year it is necessary to call in the aid of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a> to make new beds for those which are to supply their place; and none of them are covered with that tufted foliage which belongs only to those that grow in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>. In a word, there are in the groves of St Ildefonso, marble statues, basins, cascades, limpid waters, verdure, and delightful prospects, everything but that which would be more charming than all the rest, thick shades.\n\nThe court of Spain comes hither annually during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the dog-days. It arrives towards the end of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>, and returns at the beginning of October. The situation of St Ildefonso, upon the declivity of the mountains which separate the two Castiles, and fronting a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> where there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> obstacle to the paillage of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> wind, renders this abode delightful in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>.

We frequently find blanks left in manuscripts for the illuminators, which were never filled up. Some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> manuscripts are gilt and burnished in a style superior to later times. Their colours were excellent, and their skill in preparing them must have been very great.\n\nThe practice of introducing ornaments, drawings, emblematical figures, and even portraits, into manuscripts, is of great antiquity. Varro wrote the lives of 700 illustrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, which he enriched with their portraits, as Pliny attests in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">Natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> (lib. xxxv. chap. 2.). Pomponius Atticus, the friend of Cicero, was the author of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> on the actions of the great men amongst the Romans, which he ornamented with their portraits, as appears in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> by Cornelius Nepos (chap. 18.). But these works have not been transmitted to posterity. There are, however, many precious documents remaining, which exhibit the advancement and decline of the arts in different ages and countries. These ineffable paintings and illuminations display the manners, customs, habits <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a>, civil, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a>, weapons and instruments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, utensils and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>; they are of the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> in illustrating many important facts relative\nIlluminative to the history of the times in which they were executed. In these treasures of antiquity are preserved a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of specimens of Grecian and Roman art, which were executed before the arts and sciences fell into neglect and contempt. The manuscripts containing these specimens form a valuable part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> preserved in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LIBRARIES\">libraries</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>.

Twenty-one fragments, which escaped the fire, are engraved by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of antiquarians of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. Several specimens of curious paintings also appear in Lambecius's catalogue of the imperial library at Vienna, particularly in vol. iii., where 48 drawings of nearly equal antiquity with those in the Cottonian library are engraved; and several others may be found in various catalogues of the Italian libraries. The drawings in the Vatican <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a> made in the fourth century, before the arts were entirely neglected, illustrate the different subjects treated of by the Roman poet. A miniature <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> is prefixed to each of the gospels brought over to England by St Augustin in the 6th century, which is preserved in the library of Corpus Christi <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>; in the compartments of those drawings are depicted representations of several transactions in each gospel. The curious drawings, and elaborate ornaments in St Cuthbert's gospels made by St Ethelwald, and now in the Cottonian library, exhibit a striking specimen of the state of the arts in England in the 7th century. The same may be observed with respect to the drawings in the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of the four gospels preserved in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LITCHFIELD\">Litchfield</a>, and those in the Codex Ruthwonthianus in the Bodleian library at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>. The life of St Paul the hermit, now remaining in Corpus Christi college, Cambridge, (G. 2.), affords an example of the style of drawing and ornamenting letters in England in the 8th century; and the copy of Prudentius's Physiognomia in the Cottonian library (Cleop. c. 8.) exhibits the style of drawing in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> in the 9th century. Of the 10th century there are Roman drawings of a singular kind in the Harleian library (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a>. 2820). Nos. 2820, 1802, and 432, in the same library, contain specimens of ornamented letters, which are to be found in Irish MSS. from the 12th to the 14th century. Cadmon's Poetical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAPHRASE\">Paraphrase</a> of the book of Genesis, written in the 11th century, which is preserved amongst F. Junius's MSS. in the Bodleian library, exhibits many specimens of utensils, weapons, instruments of music, and implements of husbandry used by the Anglo-Saxons. The like may be seen in extracts from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENTATEUCH\">Pentateuch</a> of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> in the Cottonian library (Claud.

The manuscript copy of Terence in the Bodleian library (D. 17.) displays the dresses, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASKS\">masks</a>, &c. worn by comedians in the 12th century, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> not earlier. The very elegant Psalter in the library of Trinity college, Cambridge, exhibits specimens of the art of drawing in England in the same century. The Virgil in the Lambeth library of the 13th century (No. 471.), written in Italy, shows both by the drawings and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, that the Italians produced works much inferior to ours at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>. The copy of the Apocalypse in the same library (No. 259.), contains a curious example of the manner of painting in the 14th century.\u2014The beautiful paintings in the history of the latter part of the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> Richard II. in the Harleian library (No. 1349.), afford curious specimens of manners and customs, both civil and military, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the 14th and in the beginning of the 15th century; as does No. 2278. in the same library.\u2014Many other instances might be produced; but those who desire farther information may consult Strutt's Regal and Ecclesiastical Antiquities, 4to, and his Horda-Angel-cymyn lately published in 3 vols.\n\nThis art was much practised by the clergy, and even by some in the highest stations in the church. \"The famous Osmond (says Bromton), who was consecrated bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALISBURY\">Salisbury</a>, A.D. 1076, did not disdain to spend some part of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> in writing, binding, and illuminating books.\" Mr Strutt, as already noticed, has given the public an opportunity of forming some judgment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of delicacy and art with which these illuminations were executed, by publishing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a> of a prodigious number of them, in his \"Regal and Ecclesiastical Antiquities of England,\" and \"View of the Customs, &c. of England.\" In the first of these works we are presented with the genuine portraits, in miniature, of all the kings, and several of the queens of England, from Edward the Confessor to Henry VII., mostly in their crowns and royal robes, together with the portraits of many other eminent persons of both sexes.\n\nThe illuminators and painters of this period seem to have been in possession of a considerable number of colouring materials, and to have known the arts of preparing and mixing them, so as to form a great variety of colours: for in the specimens of their miniature-paintings, that are still extant, we perceive not only the five primary colours, but also various <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATIONS\">combinations</a> of them. Though Strutt's prints do not exhibit the bright and vivid colours of the originals, they give us equally a view, not only of the persons and dresses of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, but also of their customs, manners, arts, and employments, their arms, ships, houses, furniture, &c., and enable us to judge of their skill in drawing. The figures in these paintings are often stiff and formal; but the ornaments are in general fine and delicate, and the colours clear and bright, particularly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> and azure. In some of these illuminations the passions are strongly painted. How strongly, for example, is terror painted in the faces of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARWICK\">Warwick</a>'s sailors, when they were threatened with a shipwreck, and grief in the countenances of those who were present at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a>? After the introduction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a>, this elegant art of illuminating gradually declined, vol ii. and at length was quite neglected.\n\nBefore concluding, it may not be improper to observe, that from the 5th to the 10th century, the miniature paintings which we meet with in Greek manuscripts are generally good, as are some which we find among those of Italy, England, and France. From the 10th to the middle of the 14th century they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> very bad, and may be considered as so many monuments of the barbarity of those ages; towards the latter end of the 14th, the paintings in manuscripts were much improved; and in the two succeeding centuries,\nIlluminators, many excellent performances were produced, especially after the happy period of the restoration of the arts, when great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> was paid to the works of the ancients, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of antiquity became fashionable.\n\nILLUMINATORS.

See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNOBILES\">IGNOBILES</a> and Jus.\n\nThe Jews absolutely condemn all images, and do not so much as suffer any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a> or figures in their houses, much less in their synagogues or places of worship.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> and adoration of images are things that have been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> controverted in the world.\n\nIt is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, from the practice of the primitive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, recorded by the earlier fathers, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, for the first three centuries after Christ, and the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the fourth, neither worshipped images nor used them in their worship. However, the greater part of the Popish divines maintain, that the use and worship of images were as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> as the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> itself; to prove this, they allege a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a>, said to have been made in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> held by the Apostles at Antioch, commanding the faithful, that they may not err about the object of their worship, to make images of Christ and worship them. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANN\">ann</a>. 102. But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> notice is taken of this decree, till 700 years after the Apostolic times, after the dispute about images had commenced. The first instance that occurs in any credible author of images among Christians, is that recorded by Tertullian de Pudicit. c. 10. of certain cups, or chalices, as Bellarmine pretends, on which was represented the parable of the good shepherd carrying the lost sheep on his shoulders: but this instance only proves, that the church, at that time did not think emblematical figures unlawful ornaments of cups or chalices. Another instance is taken from Eusebius, Hist. Eccel. lib. vii. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 18. who says, that in his time there were to be seen two brass statues in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Paneas or Cesarea Philippi; the one of a woman on her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a>, with her arms stretched out, the other of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> over against her, with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> extended to receive her; these statues were said to be the images of our Saviour\nand the woman whom he cured of an illifie of blood. From the foot of the statue representing our Saviour, says the historian, sprung up an exotic plant, which, as soon as it grew to touch the border of his garment, was said to cure all sorts of distempers. Eusebius, however, vouches none of these things; nay, he supposes that the woman who erected this statue of our Saviour was a pagan, and ascribes it to a pagan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>. Farther, Philostorgius, Eccl. Hist. lib. vii. c. 3, expressly says, that this statue was carefully preserved by the Christians, but that they paid no kind of worship to it, because it is not lawful for Christians to worship bras, or any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>. The primitive Christians abstained from the worship of images, not, as the Papists pretend, from tenderness to heathen idolaters, but because they thought it unlawful in itself to make any images of the Deity. Justin Mart. Apol. ii. p. 44. Clem. Alex. Strom. i. Strom. i. and Protr. p. 46. Aug. de Civit. Dei. lib. vii. c. 5. and lib. iv. c. 32. Id. de Fide et Symbol. c. 7. Lactant. lib. ii. c. 3. Tertull. Apol. c. 12. Arnob. lib. vi. p. 202. Some of the fathers, as Tertullian, Clemens Alexandrinus, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGEN\">Origen</a>, were of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> commandment, the arts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> and engraving were rendered unlawful to a Christian, flinging them evil and wicked arts. Tert. de Idol. cap. 3. Clem. Alex. Admon. ad. Gent. p. 41. Orig. contra Celsum. lib. vi. p. 182. The use of images in churches as ornaments, was first introduced by some Christians in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, in the beginning of the fourth century; but the practice was condemned as a dangerous innovation, in a council held at Eliberis in 325. Epiphanius, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> preserved by Jerome, tom. iii. ep. 6. bears strong testimony against images, and may be considered as one of the first Iconoclasts. The custom of admitting pictures of saints and martyrs into the churches (for this was the first source of image-worship) was rare in the latter end of the fourth century; but became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in the fifth; however, they were still considered only as ornaments; and even in this view, they met with very considerable opposition. In the following century the custom of thus adorning churches became almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>, both in the east and west. Petavius expressly says (de Incar. lib. xv. cap. 14.), that no statues were yet allowed in the churches; because they bore too near a resemblance to the idols of the Gentiles. Towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the fourth or beginning of the fifth century, images, which were introduced by way of ornament, and then used as an aid to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>, began to be actually worshipped. However, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be the doctrine of the church in the sixth and in the beginning of the seventh century, that images were to be used only as helps to devotion, and not as objects of worship. The worship of them was condemned in the strongest terms by Pope Gregory the Great; as appears by two letters of his written in 601. From this time to the beginning of the eighth century, there occurs no single instance of any worship given or allowed to be given to images by any council or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> whatever. But they were commonly worshipped by the monks and populace in the beginning of the eighth century; insomuch, that in the year 726, when Leo published his famous edict, it had already spread into all the provinces subject to the empire.\n\nThe Lutherans condemn the Calvinists for breaking the images in the churches of the Catholics, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> on it as a kind of sacrilege; and yet they condemn the Romanists (who are professed image-worshippers) as idolaters; nor can the last keep pace with the Greeks, who go far beyond them in this point; which has occasioned abundance of disputes among them. See Iconoclasts.\n\nThe Mahometans have a perfect aversion to images; which was what led them to destroy most of the beautiful monuments of antiquity, both sacred and profane, at Constantinople.\n\nImage, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">Rhetoric</a>, also signifies a lively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of any thing in discourse.\n\nImages in discourse are defined by Longinus, to be, in general, any thoughts proper to produce expressions, and which present a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> to the mind.\n\nBut, in the more limited sense, he says, images are such discourses as come from us, when, by a kind of enthusiasm, or an extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMOTION\">emotion</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>, we seem to see the things whereof we speak, and present them before the eyes of those who hear us.\n\nImages, in rhetoric, have a very different use from what they have among the poets: the end principally proposed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a> is, astonishment and surprize; whereas the thing chiefly aimed at in prose, is to paint things naturally, and to show them clearly. They have this, however, in common, that they both tend to move, each in its kind.\n\nThe images, or pictures, are of vast use, to give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, magnificence, and strength, to a discourse. They warm and animate it; and when managed with art, according to Longinus, seem, as it were, to tame and subdue the hearer, and put him in the power of the speaker.\n\nImage, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPTICS\">Optics</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> in the form of any object, made by the rays of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> issuing from the several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of it, and meeting in so many other points, either at the bottom of the eye, or on any other ground, or on any transparent medium, where there is no surface to reflect them. Thus we are said to see all objects by means of their images formed in the eye.\n\nImaginary Quantities, or Impossible Quantities, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALGEBRA\">Algebra</a>, are the even roots of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> quantities; which expressions are imaginary, or impossible, or opposed to real quantities; as $\\sqrt{-a}$, or $4\\sqrt{-a}$, &c. For as every even power of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> whatever, whether positive or negative, is necessarily positive, or having the sign $+$, because $+$ by $+$, or $-$ by $-$, gives equally $+$; hence it follows that every even power, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> for instance, which is negative, or having the sign $-$, has no possible root; and therefore the even roots of such powers or quantities are said to be impossible or imaginary. The mixt expressions arising from imaginary quantities joined to real ones, are also imaginary; as $a - \\sqrt{-a}$, or $b + \\sqrt{-a}$.\n\nImaginary Roots of an equation, are those roots or values of the unknown quantity, which contain some imaginary quantity. Thus, the roots of the equation $xx + a = 0$, are the two imaginary quantities $+\\sqrt{-a}$ and $-\\sqrt{-a}$, or $+\\sqrt{-a}$ and $-\\sqrt{-a}$.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">Imagination</a>, a power or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of the mind, whereby it conceives and forms <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of things communicated to it by the outward organs of sense.

The word properly signifies what we call a prelate, antistes, one who presides over others; but the Mussulmans frequently apply it to a person who has the care and tendency of a mosque, who is always there at first, and reads prayers to the people, which they repeat after him.\n\nIMAM is also applied, by way of excellence, to the four chiefs or founders of the four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> sects in the Mahometan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. Thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALI\">Ali</a> is the imam of the Perisan, or of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> of the Schiites; Abu-beker the imam of the Sunnites, which is the sect followed by the Turks; Saphii, or Safi-y, the imam of another sect, &c.\n\nThe Mahometans do not agree among themselves about this imamate or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of the imams. Some think it of divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and attached to a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, as the pontificate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AARON\">Aaron</a>.\u2014Others hold, that it is indeed of divine right, but deny it to be so attached to any single family, as that it may not be transferred to another. They add, that the imam is to be clear of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> sins; and that otherwise he may be deposed, and his dignity may be conferred on another. However this be, it is certain, that after an imam has once been owned as such by the Mussulmans, he who denies that his authority comes immediately from God is accounted impious; he who does not obey him is a rebel; and he who pretends to contradict what he says is esteemed a fool, among the orthodox of that religion. The imams have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> outward mark of distinction; their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> is the same with that of the Turks in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>, except that the turban is a little larger, and folded somewhat differently.","sp":187,"ep":187},{"h":"IMAUS","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">Ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">Geography</a>, the largest mountain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> (Strabo); and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of Taurus (Pliny); from which the whole of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> runs off into a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, resembling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>.

These people have fewer strangers among them, and they are more engaging in their appearance, than the Georgians.

The extraordinary revenues for the most part arise from confiscations of every kind; but notwithstanding this, the finances of the prince are so limited, that he is often under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of going from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> to house, to live at the expense of his vassals, never quitting their habitations until the pressing wants of his hosts absolutely compel him.

His principal dishes consist of a certain food called gom, which is a kind of millet boiled, and a piece of roast meat, with some highly-seasoned sauce. He never eats but with his fingers, for forks and spoons are unknown in Imeretta. At table he generally gives audiences respecting affairs of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, which he determines as he thinks proper; for in every country subject to his dominions there is no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>.\n\nOn Friday, which is the market <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, all his new edicts are published by a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HERALD\">herald</a>, who climbs up into some tree, in order to proclaim the will of his sovereign.

Impotence with respect to men is the same as sterility in women; that is, an inability of propagating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>. There are many causes of impotence; as, a natural defect in the organs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>, which seldom admits of a cure; accidents or diseases; and in such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> the impotence may or may not be remedied, according as these are curable or otherwise.\u2014The most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> causes are, early and immoderate venery, or the venereal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>. We have instances, however, of untimely generation in men by an impediment to the ejection of the semen in coition, from a wrong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> which the orifice at the verumontanum got, whereby the seed was thrown up into the bladder.

He considers impotence as depending upon two causes. One he refers to the mind; the other to the organs.\n\n1. As to impotence depending upon the mind, he observes, that as the parts of generation are not necessary for the existence or support of the individual, but have a reference to something else in which the mind has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> concern; so a complete action in those parts cannot take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> without a perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> of body and of mind: that is, there must be both a power of body and disposition of mind; for the mind is subject to a thousand caprices, which affect the actions of those parts.\n\n2. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPULATION\">Copulation</a> is an act of the body, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> of which is in the mind; but it is not volition: and according to the state of the mind, so is the act performed. To perform this act well, the body should be in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, and the mind should be perfectly confident of the powers of the body; the mind should be in a state entirely disengaged from every thing else: it should have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> difficulties, no fears, no apprehensions, not even an anxiety to perform the act well; for even this anxiety is a state of mind different from what should prevail; there should not be even a fear that the mind itself may find a difficulty at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the act should be performed. Perhaps no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of\n\n---\n\n* P. 207. &c. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a> edit.\nImpotency, the machine depends so much upon the state of the mind as this.\n\n\"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> and reasoning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> have nothing to do with this power; they are only employed in the act, so far as voluntary parts are made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they ever interfere, which they sometimes do, it often produces another state of mind which destroys that which is proper for the performance of the act; it produces a desire, a wish, a hope, which are all only diffidence and uncertainty, and create in the mind the idea of a possibility of the want of success, which destroys the proper state of mind or necessary confidence.\n\n\"There is perhaps no act in which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> feels himself more interested, or is more anxious to perform well; his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> being engaged in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, which if within certain bounds would produce a degree of perfection in an act depending upon the will, or an act in voluntary parts; but when it produces a state of mind contrary to that state on which the perfection of the act depends, a failure must be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>.\n\n\"The body is not only rendered incapable of performing this act by the mind being under the above influence, but also by the mind being, though perfectly confident of its power, yet conscious of an impropriety in performing it; this, in many cases, produces a state of mind which shall take away all power. The state of a man's mind respecting his filter takes away all power. A conscientious man has been known to lose his powers on finding the woman he was going to be connected with unexpectedly a virgin.\n\n\"Shedding tears arises entirely from the state of the mind, although not so much a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> action as the act in question; for none are so weak in body that they cannot shed tears; it is not so much a compound action of the mind and strength of body joined, as the other act is; yet if we are afraid of shedding tears, or are desirous of doing it, and that anxiety is kept up through the whole of an affecting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>, we certainly shall not shed tears, or at least not so freely as would have happened from our natural feelings.\n\n\"From this account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of having the mind independent respecting the act, we must see that it may very often happen that the state of mind will be such as not to allow the animal to exert its natural powers; and every failure increases the evil. We must also see from this state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, that this act must be often interrupted; and the true cause of this interruption not being known, it will be laid to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of the body or want of powers. As these cases do not arise from real inability, they are to be carefully distinguished from such as do; and perhaps the only way to distinguish them is, to examine into the state of mind respecting this act. So trifling often is the circumstance which shall produce this inability depending on the mind, that the very desire to please shall have that effect, as in making the woman the sole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> to be gratified.\n\n\"Cases of this kind we see every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; one of which I shall relate as an illustration of this subject, and also of the method of cure.\u2014A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> told me, that he had lost his virility. After above an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of the case, I made out the following facts: that he had at unnecessary times strong erections, which showed that he had naturally this power; that the erections were accompanied with desire, which are all the natural powers wanted; but that there was still a defect somewhere, which I supposed to be from the mind. I inquired if all women were alike to him? his answer was, No; some women he could have connection with as well as ever. This brought the defect, whatever it was, into a smaller compass; and it appeared that there was but one woman that produced this inability, and that it arose from a desire to perform the act with this woman well; which desire produced in the mind a doubt or fear of the want of success, which was the cause of the inability of performing the act. As this arose entirely from the state of the mind produced by a particular circumstance, the mind was to be applied to for the cure; and I told him that he might be cured, if he could perfectly rely on his own power of self-denial. When I explained what I meant, he told me that he could depend upon every act of his will or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>. I then told him, that, if he had a perfect confidence in himself in that respect, he was to go to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> with this woman, but first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> to himself that he would not have any connection with her for six nights, let his inclinations and powers be what they would; which he engaged to do, and also to let me know the result. About a fortnight after, he told me, that this resolution had produced such a total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in the state of his mind, that the power soon took place; for instead of going to bed with the fear of inability, he went with fears that he should be possessed with too much desire, too much power, so as to become uneasy to him; which really happened; for he would have been happy to have shortened the time; and when he had once broke the spell, the mind and powers went on together, and his mind never returned to its former state.\"\n\n2. Of impotency from a want of proper correspondence between the actions of the different organs. Our author, in a former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his Treatise, when considering the diseases of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URETHRA\">urethra</a> and bladder, had remarked, that every organ in an animal body, without exception, was made of different parts, whose functions or actions were totally different from one another, although all tending to produce one ultimate effect. In all such organs, when perfect (he observes), there is a succession of motions, one naturally arising out of the other, which in the end produces the ultimate effect; and an irregularity alone in these actions will constitute disease, at least will produce very disagreeable effects, and often totally frustrate the intention of the organ. This principle Mr Hunter, on the present occasion, applies to the \"actions of the testicles and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENIS\">penis</a>: for we find that an irregularity in the actions of these parts sometimes happens in men, producing impotence; and something similar probably may be one cause of barrenness in women.\n\n\"In men, the parts subservient to generation may be divided into two; the essential and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCESSORY\">accessory</a>. The testicles are the essential; the penis, &c., the accessory. As this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> arises from their uses or actions in health, which exactly correspond with one another, a want of exactness in the correspondence or susceptibility of those actions may also be divided into two: where the actions are reversed, the accessory taking place without the first or essential, as in erections of the penis, where neither the mind nor the testicles are stimulated to action; and the second is where the testicles perform\nImpotence, the action of secretion too readily for the penis, which has not a corresponding erection. The first is called priapism; and the second is what ought to be called seminal weakness.\n\n\"The mind has considerable effect on the correspondence of the actions of these two parts: but it would appear in many instances, that erections of the penis depend more on the state of the mind than the secretion of the semen does; for many have the secretion, but not the erection; but in such, the want of erection appears to be owing to the mind only.\n\n\"Priapism often arises spontaneously; and often from visible irritation of the penis, as in the venereal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GONORRHEA\">gonorrhea</a>, especially when violent. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> of such erections is rather uneasy than pleasant; nor is the sensation of the glans at the time similar to that arising from the erections of desire, but more like to the sensation of the parts immediately after coition. Such as arise spontaneously are of more serious consequence than those from inflammation, as they proceed probably from causes not curable in themselves or by any known methods. The priapism arising from inflammation of the parts, as in a gonorrhea, is attended with nearly the same symptoms; but generally the sensation is that of pain, proceeding from the inflammation of the parts.\n\n\"It may be observed, that what is said of priapism is only applicable to it when a disease in itself, and not when a symptom of other diseases, which is frequently the case.\n\n\"The common practice in the cure of this complaint is to order all the nervous and strengthening medicines; such as bark, valerian, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULE\">mule</a>, camphor, and also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> bath. I have seen good effects from the cold bath; but sometimes it does not agree with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, in which case I have found the warm bath of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. Opium appears to be a specific in many cases; from which circumstance I should be apt, upon the whole, to try a soothing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>.\n\n\"Seminal weakness, or a secretion and emission of the semen without erections, is the reverse of a priapism, and is by much the worse disease of the two. There is great variety in the degrees of this disease, there being all the gradations from the exact correspondence of the actions of all the parts to the testicles acting alone; in every case of the disease, there is too quick a secretion and evacuation of the semen. Like to the priapism, it does not arise from desires and abilities; although when mild it is attended with both, but not in a due proportion; a very slight desire often producing the full effect. The secretion of the semen shall be so quick, that simple thought, or even toying, shall make it flow.\n\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DREAMS\">Dreams</a> have produced this evacuation repeatedly in the same night; and even when the dreams have been so slight, that there has been no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of them when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> has been broken by the act of emission. I have known cases where the testicles have been so ready to secrete, that the least friction on the glans has produced an emission: I have known the simple action of walking or riding produce this effect, and that repeatedly, in a very short space of time.\n\n\"A young man, about four or five and twenty years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, not so much given to venery as most young men, had these last mentioned complaints upon him. Three or four times in the night he would emit; and if he walked fast, or rode on horseback, the same thing would happen. He could scarcely have connection with a woman before he emitted, and in the emission there was hardly any spasm. He tried every supposed strengthening medicine, as also the cold bath and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a>, but with no effect. By taking 20 drops of laudanum on going to bed, he prevented the night emissions; and by taking the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, he could walk or ride without the before-mentioned inconvenience. I directed this practice to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for some time, although the disease did not return, that the parts might be accustomed to this healthy state of action; and I have reason to believe the gentleman is now well. It was found necessary, as the constitution became more habituated to the opiate, to increase the dose of it.\n\n\"The spasms, upon the evacuation of the semen in such cases, are extremely slight, and a repetition of them soon takes place; the first emission not preventing a second; the constitution being all the time but little affected (A). When the testicles act alone, without the accessory parts taking up the necessary and natural consequent action, it is still a more melancholy disease; for the secretion arises from no visible or sensible cause, and does not give any visible or sensible effect, but runs off similar to involuntary stools or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>. It has been observed that the semen is more fluid than natural in some of these cases.\n\n\"There is great variety in the diseased actions of these parts; of which the following case may be considered as an example. A gentleman has had a stricture in the urethra for many years, for which he has frequently used a bougie, but of late has neglected it. He has had no connection with women for a considerable time, being afraid of the consequences. He has often in his sleep involuntary emissions, which generally awake him at the paroxysm; but what surprizes him most is, that often he has such without any semen passing forwards through the penis, which makes him think that at those times it goes backwards into the bladder. This is not always the case, for at other times the semen passes forwards. At the time the semen seems to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> into the bladder, he has the erection, the dream; and is awakened with the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of action, the same sensation, and the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, as when it passes through the urethra, whether dreaming or waking. My <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> is, that the same irritation takes place in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a> of the urethra without the semen that takes place there when the semen enters, in consequence of all the natural preparatory steps, whereby the very same actions are excited as if it came into\n\n(A) \"It is to be considered, that the constitution is commonly affected by the spasms only, and in proportion to their violence, independent of the secretion and evacuation of the semen. But in some cases even the erection going off without the spasms on the emission, shall produce the same debility as if they had taken place.\"\nImpotency the pungency: from which one would suppose, that either semen is not fecrated; or if it be, that a retrograde <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> takes place in the actions of the accelerates urine. But if the first be the case, then we may suppose, that in the natural state the actions of those muscles do not arise simply from the stimulus of the semen in the part, but from their action being a termination of a preceding one making part of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of actions. Thus they may depend upon the friction, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> of a friction, on the penis; the testicles not doing their part, and the sperm in such cases arising from the friction and not from the fecration. In many of those cases of irregularity, when the erection is not strong, it shall go off without the emission; and at other times an emission shall happen almost without an erection; but these arise not from debility, but affections of the mind.\n\n\"In many of the preceding cases, washing the penis, scrotum, and perineum, with cold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, is often of service; and to render it colder than it is in some seasons of the year, common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> may be added to it, and the parts washed when the salt is almost dissolved.\"\n\n**Impotency** is a canonical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISABILITY\">disability</a>, to avoid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> in the spiritual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>. The marriage is not void *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">ab</a> initio*, but voidable only by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> of separation during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of the parties.\n\n**Imprecation**, (derived from *in*, and *precor*, \"I pray?\") a curse or wish that some evil may befall any one.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> had their goddesses called **imprecatrices**, in Latin *Dire*, i.e. *Deorum irae*, who were supposed to be the executioners of evil consciences. They were called *Dire* in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, *Furies* on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUMENIDES\">Eumenides</a>* in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HELL\">hell</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> owned but three of these **imprecatrices**, and the Greeks only two. They invoked them with prayers and pieces of verses to destroy their enemies.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPREGNATION\">Impregnation</a>**, the getting a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> with child. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">Conception</a>.\n\nThe term **impregnation** is also used, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARMACY\">pharmacy</a>, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> the virtues of one medicine to another, whether by mixture, coction, digestion, &c.\n\n**Impressing seamen**. The power of impressing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-faring men for the sea-service by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>, has been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of some dispute, and submitted to with great reluctance; though it hath very clearly and learnedly been shown by Sir Michael Forster, that the practice of impressing, and granting powers to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRALTY\">admiralty</a> for that purpose, is of very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a>, and hath been uniformly continued by a regular series of precedents to the present time: whence he concludes it to be part of the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>. The difficulty arises from hence, that no statute has expressly declared this power to be in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, though many of them very strongly imply it. The statute 2 Rich. II. c. 4, speaks of mariners being arrested and retained for the king's service, as of a thing well known, and practised without dispute; and provides a remedy against their running away. By a later statute, if any waterman, who uses the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a>, shall hide himself during the execution of any commission of pressing for the king's service, he is liable to heavy penalties. By another (5 Eliz. c. 5.) no fisherman shall be taken by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>'s commission to serve as a mariner; but the commission shall be first brought to two justices of the peace, inhabiting near the sea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> where the mariners are to be taken, to the intent that the justices may choose out and return such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of able-bodied men, as in the commission are contained, to serve her majesty. And by others, especially protections are allowed to seamen in particular circumstances, to prevent them from being impressed. Ferrymen are also said to be privileged from being impressed, at common law. All which do most evidently imply a power of impressing to reside somewhere; and if anywhere, it must, from the spirit of our constitution, as well as from the frequent mention of the king's commission, reside in the crown alone.\n\n\u2014After all, however, this method of manning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a> is to be considered as only defensible from public necessity, to which all private considerations must give way.\n\nThe following persons are exempted from being impressed: Apprentices for three years; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATE\">mate</a>, and carpenter, and one man for every 100 tons, of vessels employed in the coal trade; all under 18 years of age, and above 55; foreigners in merchant-ships and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIVATEERS\">privateers</a>; landmen betaking themselves to sea for two years; seamen in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENLAND\">Greenland</a> fishery, and harpooners, employed, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> season, in the coal-trade, and giving security to go to the fishing next season.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">Impression</a>** is applied to the species of objects which are supposed to make some mark or impression on the senses, the mind, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIPATETICS\">Peripatetics</a> assert, that bodies emit species resembling them, which are conveyed to the common *sensorium*, and they are rendered intelligible by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> intellect; and, when thus spiritualized, are called *expressions*, or *express species*, as being expressed from the others.\n\n**Impression** also denotes the edition of a book, regarding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> part only; whereas *edition*, besides this, takes in the care of the editor, who corrected or augmented the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a>, adding notes, &c., to render the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> more useful.\n\n**Imprisonment**, the state of a person restrained of his liberty, and detained under the custody of another.\n\nNo person is to be imprisoned but as the law directs, either by the command or order of a court of record, or by lawful warrant; or the king's procefs, on which one may be lawfully detained. And at common law, a person could not be imprisoned unless he were guilty of some force and violence, for which his body was subject to imprisonment, as one of the highest executions. Where the law gives power to imprison, in such case it is justifiable, provided he that does it in pursuance of a statute exactly pursues the statute in the manner of doing it; for otherwise it will be deemed false imprisonment, and of consequence it is unjustifiable. Every warrant of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMITMENT\">commitment</a> for imprisoning a person, ought to run, \"till delivered by due course of law,\" and \"not until farther order;\" which has been held ill; and thus it also is, where one is imprisoned on a warrant not mentioning any cause for which he is committed. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARREST\">Arrest</a> and Commitment.\n\n**False Imprisonment**. Every confinement of the person is an imprisonment, whether it be in a common prison, or in a private <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, or in the stocks, or even by\nby forcibly detaining one in the public streets. Unlawful or false imprisonment consists in such confinement or detention without sufficient authority; which authority may arise either from some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> from the courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>; or from some warrant from a legal power to commit, under his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>, and expelling the cause of such commitment; or from some other special cause warranted, for the necessity of the thing, either by common law or act of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>; such as the arresting of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FELON\">felon</a> by a private person without warrant, the impressing of mariners for the public service, or the apprehending of waggoners for misbehaviour in the public highways. False imprisonment also may arise by executing a lawful warrant or process at an unlawful time, as on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUNDAY\">Sunday</a>; or in a place privileged from arrest, as in the verge of the king's court. This is the injury. The remedy is of two sorts; the one removing the injury, the other making satisfaction for it.\n\nThe means of removing the actual injury of false imprisonment are fourfold: 1. By writ of MAINPRIZE. 2. By writ De ODIO et ATIA. 3. By writ De HOMINE REPUGNANDO. 4. By writ of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABEAS_CORPUS\">HABEAS CORPUS</a>.

III., in his Scotch expedition, bestowed half of those lands on the monks of this island, for the privilege of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURIAL\">burial</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>. The buildings made in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> of Alexander were very considerable. There are still to be seen a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> tower belonging to the church, the ruins of the church, and of several other buildings. The wealth of this place in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of Edward III. proved so strong a temptation to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a>, then lying in the Forth, as to suppress all the horror of sacrilege and respect to the sanctity of the inhabitants. The English landed, and spared not even the furniture more immediately consecrated to divine worship. But due vengeance overtook them; for in a storm which instantly followed, many of them perished; those who escaped, struck with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> of the judgment, vowed to make ample recompense to the injured saint. The tempest ceased; and they made the promised atonement.\u2014The Danish monument, figured by Sir Robert Sibbald, lies on the south-east side of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, on a rising ground. It is of a rigid form, and the surface ornamented with scale-like figures. At each end is the representation of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>.\n\nInch Keith, a small island situated in the same frith, midway between the port of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEITH\">Leith</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGHORN\">Kinghorn</a> on the opposite shore. See FORTH.\n\nThis island is said to derive its name from the gallant Keith who so greatly signalized himself by his valour in 1016, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRY\">Barry</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGUS\">Angus</a>, against the Danes; after which he received in reward the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARONY\">barony</a> of Keith, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOTHIAN\">Lothian</a>, and this little isle. In 1549 the English fleet, sent by Edward VI., to assist the lords of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGREGATION\">congregation</a> against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>-dowager, landed, and began to fortify this island, of the importance of which they grew sensible after their neglect of securing the port of Leith, so lately in their power. They left here five companies to cover the workmen under the command of Cotterel; but their operations were soon interrupted by M. Deffe, general of the French auxiliaries, who took the place, after a gallant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the English. The Scots kept possession for some years; but at last the fortifications were destroyed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, to prevent it from being of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> to the former.

Those men thought that the church of England resembled, in too many particulars, the antichristian church of Rome; and they called perpetually for a more thorough reformation and a purer worship.

These small societies he pronounced independent jure divino, and entirely exempt from the jurisdiction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>, in whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> had placed the reins of spiritual government; and also from that of presbyteries.\n\n(A) The followers of Novatian were called Puritans, because they would not communicate with the Catholic church, under pretence that her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a> was polluted by admitting those to the sacred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> who through infirmity had sacrificed to idols in times of persecution. These unhappy men were not received by the church till after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENANCE\">penance</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVATIANS\">Novatians</a> would not receive them at all, however long their penance, or however sincere their sorrow, for their sin. In other respects, the ancient Puritans were, like the English, orthodox in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, and of irreproachable morals.\nand synods, which the Puritans regarded as the supreme visible sources of ecclesiastical authority. He also maintained, that the power of governing each congregation resided in the people; and that each member had an equal share in this government, and an equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to order matters for the good of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>. Hence all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> both of doctrine and discipline were submitted to the discussion of the whole congregation; and whatever was supported by a majority of voices passed into a law. It was the congregation also that elected certain of the brethren to the office of pastors, to perform the duty of public instruction, and the several branches of divine worship; reserving, however, to themselves the power of dismissing these ministers, and reducing them to the condition of private members, whenever they should think such a change conducive to the spiritual advantage of the community. It is likewise to be observed, that the right of the pastors to preach was by no means of an exclusive nature, or peculiar to them alone; since any member that thought proper to exhort or instruct the brethren, was abundantly indulged in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of prophesying to the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>. Accordingly, when the ordinary teacher or pastor had finished his discourse, all the other brethren were permitted to communicate in public their sentiments and illustrations upon any useful or edifying subject.\n\nThe zeal with which Brown and his associates maintained and propagated these notions was in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> intemperate and extravagant. He affirmed, that all communion was to be broken off with those religious societies that were founded upon a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> from his; and treated, more especially the church of England, as a spurious church, whose ministers were unlawfully ordained, whose discipline was popish and antichristian, and whose sacraments and institutions were destitute of all efficacy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>. The sect of this hot-headed innovator, not being able to endure the severe treatment which their own violence had brought upon them from an administration that was not distinguished by its mildness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a>, retired into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NETHERLANDS\">Netherlands</a>, and founded churches at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIDDLEBURG\">Middleburg</a> in Zeeland, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>; but their establishments were neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> nor lasting. Their founder returned into England; and having renounced his principles of separation, took orders in the established church, and obtained a benefice. The Puritan exiles, whom he thus abandoned, disagreed among themselves, were split into parties, and their affairs declined from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> to day. This engaged the wiser <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of them to mitigate the severity of their founder's plan, and to soften the rigour of his uncharitable decisions.\n\nThe persons who had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> merit of bringing about this reformation was one of their pastors called John Robinson, a man who had much of the solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> of the times, and no inconsiderable portion of learning. This well-meaning reformer, perceiving the defects that reigned in the discipline of Brown, and in the spirit and temper of his followers, employed his zeal and diligence in correcting them, and in new-modelling the society in such a manner as to render it less odious to its adversaries, and less liable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> censure of those true Christians, who looked upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> as the end of the commandments. Hitherto the sect had been called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWNISTS\">Brownists</a>; but Robinson having, in his Apology, affirmed, C\u00e6tum quemlibet particularis, effe totam, integram, et perfectam ecclesiam ex suis partibus constatentium immediat\u00e8 et independenter (quod alias ecclesias) sub ipso Christo,\u2014the sect was henceforth called Independents, of which the apologist was considered as the founder.\n\nThe Independents were much more commendable than the Brownists. They surpassed them both in the moderation of their sentiments, and in the order of their discipline. They did not, like Brown, pour forth bitter and uncharitable invectives against the churches which were governed by rules entirely different from theirs, nor pronounce them on that account unworthy of the Christian name. On the contrary, though they considered their own form of ecclesiastical government as of divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a>, and as originally introduced by the authority of the apostles, nay by the apostles themselves; they yet had candour and charity enough to acknowledge, that true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and solid piety might flourish in those communities which were under the jurisdiction of bishops or the government of synods and presbyteries. This is put beyond all doubt by Robinson himself, who expresses his own private sentiments and those of his community in the following clear and precise words: \"Profitemur <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORAM\">coram</a> Deo et hominibus, adeo nosl consenire cum ecclesiis reformatis Belgicis in re religiosis, ut omnibus et singulis earumdem ecclesiarum fidei articulis, praet habentur in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONIA\">harmonia</a> confessionalium fidei, parati simus subfervire. Ecclesias reformatas pro veris et genuinis habemus, cum ipsidem in sacris Dei communione profitemur, et quantum in nobis est, colimus.\" They were also much more attentive than the Brownists, in keeping on foot a regular ministry in their communities; for while the latter allowed promiscuously all ranks and orders of men to teach in public, the Independents had, and still have, a certain number of ministers, chosen respectively by the congregations where they are fixed; nor is any person among them permitted to speak in public, before he has submitted to a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of his capacity and talents, and been approved of by the heads of the congregation.\n\nThis religious society still subsists, and has produced divines as eminent for learning, piety, and virtue, as any church in Christendom. It is now distinguished from the other Protestant communities chiefly by the two following circumstances.\n\n1. The Independents reject the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of all creeds and confessions drawn up by fallible men, requiring of their teachers no other test of orthodoxy than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> in the gospel of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a>, and their adherence to the Scriptures as the sole standard of faith and practice.\n\n2. They <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> no virtue whatsoever to the rite of ordination, upon which some other churches lay so much stress; for the Independents declare, that the qualifications which constitute a regular minister of the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, are, a firm belief in the gospel, a principle of sincere and unaffected piety, a competent stock of knowledge, a capacity for leading <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> instruction, a serious inclination to engage in the important employment of promoting the everlasting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a> of mankind, and ordinarily an invitation to the pastoral office from some particular society.\nWhere these things concur, they consider a person as fitted and authorized for the discharge of every duty which belongs to the ministerial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a>; and they believe that the imposition of the hands of bishops or presbyters would convey to him no powers or prerogatives of which he was not before possessed.\n\nWhen the reformers separated from the church of Rome, they drew up public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONFESSIONS_OF_FAITH\">confessions of faith</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of religion, to which they demanded subscription from their respective followers. Their purpose in this was to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against dangerous heresies, to ascertain the meaning of Scripture-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, and, we doubt not, to promote the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. These were laudable ends; but of the means chosen for attaining them, the late Dr Taylor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWICH\">Norwich</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of the Independent churches, and whose learning would have done <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to any church, expresses his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> in the following indignant language: \"How much soever the Christian world vaunteth these creeds and confessions, I confess, for my own part, that I have no opinion of them. But we are told that they were generally drawn up by the ablest divines. But what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> is there of this? Are divines in vogue and power <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> the most knowing and upright? But granting that the reformers were in those days the ablest divines; the ablest divines educated in populous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>, notwithstanding any pretended learning, might comparatively be very weak and defective in scripture knowledge, which was a thing in a manner new to them. In times of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> they might be men of eminence; and yet far short of being qualified to draw up and decide the true and precise rules of faith for all Christians. Yea, their very attempting to draw up, decide, and establish such rules of faith, is an incontestable evidence of their surprising ignorance and weakness. How could they be able divines, when they imposed upon the consciences of Christians their own decisions concerning gospel-faith and doctrine? Was not this in fact to teach and constrain Christians to depart from the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> principle of their religion, subjection and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> to Christ, the only teacher and lawgiver? But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they were able men, were they infallible? No: they publicly affirmed their own fallibility; and yet they acted as if they had been infallible, and could not be mistaken in prescribing faith and doctrine.\n\nBut even if they were infallible, who gave them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> to do what the Spirit of God had done already? Could the first reformers hope to deliver the truths of religion more fully and more clearly than the Spirit of God? Had they found out more apt expressions than had occurred to the Holy Spirit? The Son of God 'spake not of himself; but as the Father said unto him, so he spake,' (John xii. 50.). 'The Spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> spake not of himself; but whatsoever he heard, that he spake,' (John xvi. 13.). 'The things of God the apostles spake, not in the words which man's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth,' (1 Cor. ii. 13.). If the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a> was thus handed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to us from the Fountain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">Light</a> with so much care and exactness, both as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> and words, by the Son of God, by the Spirit, and by the apostles, who were the ancient doctors and bishops? or who were the first reformers? or who were any synods or assemblies of divines, that they dared to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> Christian faith into their own invented forms, and impose it upon the minds of men in their own devised terms and expressions?\n\nHath Christ given authority to all his ministers to the end of the world, to new-mould his doctrines by the rules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> learning whenever they think fit? or hath he delegated his power to any particular persons? Neither the one nor the other. His doctrines are not of such a ductile nature; but stand fixed, both as to matter and words, in the Scripture. And it is at any man's peril, who pretends to put them, as they are rules of faith, into any new dress or shape. I conclude, therefore, that the first reformers, and all councils, synods, and assemblies, who have met together to collect, determine, and decide, to prescribe and impose matters pertaining to Christian faith, have acted without any warrant from Christ, and therefore have invaded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a> of him who is the sole Prophet and Lawgiver to the church. Peace and unity, I know, is the pretended good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of those creeds and confessions. But as God never sanctified them for those ends, to all the world knows they have produced the contrary effects; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCORD\">discord</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, and the spilling of whole seas of Christian blood for 1400 years together.\"\n\nSuch sentiments as these are now maintained by Christians of various denominations; but they were first avowed by the Independents, to whom therefore the merit or demerit of bringing them to light properly belongs. Our readers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> think differently of them according to their preconceived opinions; but it is not our province either to confirm or to confute them. They rise almost necessarily out of the independent scheme of congregational churches; and we could not suppress them without deviating from our fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of doing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> to all religious parties, as well those from whom we differ as those with whom we agree. It ought not, however, to be rashly concluded, that the Independents of the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, merely because they reject the use of all creeds of human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, doubt or disbelieve the doctrines deemed orthodox in other churches. Their predecessors in the last century were thought to be more rigid Calvinists than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESBYTERIANS\">Presbyterians</a> themselves; as many of those may likewise be who in the present century admit not the confessions and formulas of the Calvinistic churches. They acknowledge as divine truth every doctrine contained in the Scriptures; but they think more necessary that scripture-doctrines are most properly expressed in simple scripture-language; and the same spirit of religious liberty, which makes them reject the authority of bishops and synods in matters of discipline, makes them reject the same authority in matters of faith. In either case, to call any man or body of men their masters, would, in their opinion, be a violation of the divine law, since \"one is their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, even Christ, and they are all brethren.\"\n\nIn support of their scheme of congregational churches, their arguments observe, that the word \u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1, which we translate church, is always used in Scripture to signify either a single congregation, or the place where a single congregation meets. Thus that unlawful assembly at Ephesus gathered together against Paul by the craftsmen, is called \u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1, a church, (Acts xix. 32, 39, 41.). The word, however, is generally applied to a more sacred rule;\nIndependence, but still it signifies either the body assembling, or the place in which it assembles. The whole body of the disciples at Corinth is called the church, and spoken of as coming together into one place, (1 Cor. xiv. 23.) The place into which they came together we find likewise called a church; \u201cwhere ye come together in the church\u2014when ye come together into one place,\u201d (1 Cor. xi. 18, 20.). Wherever there were more congregations than one, there were likewise more churches than one: Thus, \u201cLet your women keep silence in the churches,\u201d (1 Cor. xvi. 41.) The whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> of Israel is indeed called a church, but it was no more than a single congregation; for it had but one place of public worship, viz., the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABERNACLE\">tabernacle</a>, and afterwards the temple. The Catholic church of Christ, his holy nation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, is likewise a single congregation, having one place of worship, viz., <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, where all the members assemble by faith and hold communion; and in which, when they shall all be fully gathered together, they will in fact be one glorious assembly. We find it called \u201cthe general assembly and church of the first-born, whose names are written in heaven.\u201d\n\nBesides these, the Independent can find no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of a church in the New Testament; not a trace of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a> or presbytery consisting of several congregations all subject to one jurisdiction. The number of disciples in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a> was certainly great before they were dispersed by the persecution in which Paul bore so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> a part; yet they are never mentioned as forming distinct assemblies, but as one assembly meeting with its elders in one place; sometimes in the temple, sometimes in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a>\u2019s porch, and sometimes in an upper room. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISPERSION\">dispersion</a>, the disciples who fled from Jerusalem, as they could no longer assemble in one place, are never called a church by themselves, or one church, but the churches of Judea, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAMARIA\">Samaria</a>, and Galilee, (Acts ix. 31. Gal. i. 22.)\n\nWhence the Independent concludes, that in Jerusalem the words church and congregation were of the same import; and if such was the case there, where the gospel was first preached, he thinks we may reasonably expect to find it so in other places. Thus when Paul on his journey calls the elders of the church of Ephesus to Mileto, he speaks to them as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> overseers of a single congregation: \u201cTake heed to yourselves, and to all the flock, over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers,\u201d (Acts xx. 28.) Had the church at Ephesus consisted of different congregations united under such a jurisdiction as that of a modern presbytery, it would have been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to say, \u201cTake heed to yourselves, and to the flocks over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers;\u201d but this is a way of speaking of which the Independent finds not an instance in the whole New Testament. The sacred writers, when speaking of all the Christians in a nation or province, never call them the church of such a nation or province, but the churches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALATIA\">Galatia</a> (Gal. i. 2.), the churches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACEDONIA\">Macedonia</a> (2 Cor. viii. 1), the churches of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> (1 Cor. xvi. 10.) On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, when speaking of the disciples in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> or town, who might ordinarily assemble in one place, they uniformly call them a church; saying, the church of Antioch, the church at Corinth, the church of Ephesus, and the like.\n\nIn each of these churches or congregations there were elders or presbyters and deacons; and in every church congregation there seems to have been more than one elder, in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> more than one. Thus we read (Acts xiv. 23.) of Paul and Barnabas ordaining elders in every church; and (Acts xix. 17) of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of elders in the church of Ephesus, who were exhorted to \u201cfeed the flock, and take heed to themselves and to the flock over which the Holy Ghost had made them overseers;\u201d but of such elders as are to be found in modern presbyterian churches, who neither teach nor are apt to teach, the Independent finds no vestige in the Scriptures, nor in the earliest uninspired writers of the Christian church. The rule or government of this presbytery or eldership in a church is not their own, but Christ\u2019s. They are not lords over God\u2019s heritage, nor can they pretend to more power over the disciples than the apostles had. But when the administration of the apostles in the church of Jerusalem, and other churches where they acted as elders, is inquired into by an Independent, it does not appear to him that they did any thing of common concern to the church without the consent of the multitude; nay, it seems they thought it necessary to judge and determine in discipline in presence of the whole church (Acts vi. 6\u2014xv. 29. 1 Cor. v. 1, 4, 5.) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCOMMUNICATION\">Excommunication</a> and abjuration were in the power of the church at Corinth, and not of the elders as distinct excommunicated from the congregation (1 Cor. v. 2 Cor. ii.) and abjurant. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a> indeed speaks of his delivering form unto Satan (1 Tim. i. 20.); but it is by no means clear the power of he did it by himself, and not after the manner pointed at each congregation, that the gift was given unto Timothy by putting on of his hands, that this was not done in the presbytery of a church, as in the other epistle we find it actually was. The trying and judging of false apostles was a matter of the first importance; but it was done by the elders with the flock at Ephesus (Rev. ii. 2. Acts xx. 28.) and that whole flock did in the days of Ignatius all partake of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>\u2019s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>, and pray together in one place. Even the power of binding and loosing, or the power of the keys, as\n\n(b) The evidence upon which this is said by Mr. Graf (for the whole of this reasoning is extracted from his works) is probably the following passage in the epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians: \u0395\u03ba \u03b3\u03b5\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03b5\u1f50\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f08\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd, \u201cFor if the prayer of one or two be of such force as we are told, how much more prevalent must that be which is made by the bishop and the whole church? He then that does not come together into the same place with it, is proud, and hath condemned himself; for it is written, God refuseth the proud. Let us therefore respect the bishop, that we may be the servants of God.\u201d\nas it has been called, was by our Saviour conferred not upon a particular order of disciples, but upon the church: \"If thy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of one or two witnesses every word may be established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. Verily I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, shall be bound,\" &c. (St Mat. xviii. 15, 16, 17, 18.). It is not said, if he shall neglect to hear the one or two, tell it to the elders of the church; far less can it be meant that the offended person should tell the cause of his offence to all the disciples in a presbytery or diocese consisting of many congregations: but he is required to tell it to that particular church or congregation to which they both belong; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> of that assembly, pronounced by its elders, is in a very solemn manner declared to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a>, from which there lies no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to any jurisdiction on earth.\n\nWith respect to the constituting of elders in any church or congregation, the Independent reasons in the following manner: The officers of Christ's appointment are either ordinary and permanent in the church, or they were extraordinary and peculiar to the planting of Christianity. The extraordinary were those who were employed in laying the plan of the gospel churches, and in publishing the New Testament revelation. Such were the apostles, the chosen witnesses of our Saviour's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESURRECTION\">resurrection</a>; such were the prophets inspired by the Holy Ghost for explaining infallibly the Old Testament by the things written in the New; and such were the evangelists, the apostles ministers. These can be succeeded by none in that which was peculiar to them, because their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> was completed by themselves. But they are succeeded in all that was not peculiar to them by elders and deacons, the only two ordinary and permanent orders of ministers in the church. We have already seen, that it belongs to the office of the elder to feed the flock of Christ: and the only question to be settled is, how men are ordinarily called to that office? for about the office of the deacon there is little or no dispute. No man now can pretend to be so called of God to the ministry of the word as the apostles and other inspired elders were, whom he chose to be the publishers of his revealed truth, and to whose mission he bore witness in an extraordinary manner. But what the apostles were to those who had the divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORACLES\">oracles</a> from their mouths, that their writings are to us; and therefore no man can lawfully pretend a call from God to make any addition to those writings, so neither can any man pretend to be lawfully called to the ministry of the word already written but in the manner which that word directs. Now there is nothing of which the New Testament speaks more clearly than of the characters of those who should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> the office of elders in the church, and of the actual exercise of that office. The former are graphically drawn in the epistles to Timothy and Titus; and the latter is minutely described in Paul's discourse to the Ephesian elders, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>'s exhortation to elders, and our Lord's commission to those ministers, with whom he promised to be always present even unto the end of the world. It is not competent for any man or body of men to add to, or diminish from, the description of a gospel minister given in these places, so as to insist upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of any qualification which is not there mentioned, or to dispense with any qualification as needless which is there required. Neither has Jesus Christ, Arguments the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a> to the church, given to any mind against the elders or people any power or right whatsoever to call, ordain, elect, or ordain, to that office any person who is not qualified according to the description given in his law; nor has he given any power or right to reject the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of them who are so qualified, and who desire the office of a bishop or elder. Let a man have hands laid upon him by such as could prove an uninterrupted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> by imposition of hands from the apostles; let him be set apart to that office by a company of ministers themselves, the most conformable to the scripture character, and let him be chosen by the most holy people on earth; yet if he answer not the New Testament description of a minister, he is not called of God to that office, and is no minister of Christ, but is indeed running unclean. No form of ordination can pretend to such a clear foundation in the New Testament as the description of the persons who should be elders of the church; and the laying on of hands, whether by bishops or presbyters, is of no more importance in the mission of a minister of Christ, than the waving of one's hand in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> or the putting of it into his bosom; for now when the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a> has ceased, it is obvious that such a rite, by whomsoever performed, can convey no powers, whether ordinary or extraordinary. Indeed it appears to have been sometimes used, even in the apostolic age, without any such intention. When Paul and Barnabas were separated to the particular employment of going out to the Gentiles, the prophets and teachers at Antioch \"prayed and laid their hands on them:\" But did this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> confer upon the two apostles any new power or authority to act as ministers of Christ? Did the imposition of hands make those shining lights of the gospel one whit better qualified than they were before to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> and baptize the nations, to feed the flock of God, to teach, rebuke, or exhort, with all long-suffering and doctrine. It cannot be pretended. Paul and Barnabas had undoubtedly received the Holy Ghost before they came to Antioch; and as they were apostles, they were of course authorized to discharge all the functions of the inferior and ordinary ministers of the gospel. In a word, whoever in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> and conversation is conformable to the character which the inspired writers give of a bishop or elder, and is likewise qualified by his \"mightiness in the scripture\" to discharge the duties of that office, is fully authorized to administer the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's supper, to teach, and even exhort, and rebuke, with all long-suffering and docility; and has all the call and mission which the Lord now gives to any man; whilst he who wants the qualifications mentioned, has not God's call, whatever he may have, nor any authority to preach the gospel of Christ, or to dispense the ordinances of his religion.\n\nFrom this view of the Independent principles, which is faithfully taken from their own writers, it appears, that, according to them, even the election of a congregation...\nThe first catalogues of this kind were made by the inquisitors; and these were afterwards approved by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENT\">Trent</a>, after some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> was made in them by way of retrenchment or addition. Thus an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">index</a> of heretical books being formed, it was confirmed by a bull of Clement VIII. in 1593, and printed with several introductory rules; by the fourth of which, the use of the Scriptures in the vulgar tongue is forbidden to all persons without a particular licence; and by the tenth rule it is ordained, that no book shall be printed at Rome without the approbation of the Pope's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VICAR\">vicar</a>, or some person delegated by the Pope; nor in any other places, unless allowed by the bishop of the diocese, or some person deputed by him, or by the inquisitor of heretical pravity.\n\nThe Trent index being thus published, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> II. of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> ordered another to be printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTWERP\">Antwerp</a>, in 1571, with considerable enlargements. Another index was published in Spain 1584; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of which was snatched out of the fire when the English plundered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CADIZ\">Cadiz</a>. Afterwards there were several expurgatory indexes printed at Rome and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a>, and particularly in Spain.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">INDIA</a>. See Hindostan.\u2014By the name of India the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> understood only the western <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a>, on this side the Ganges, and the peninsula beyond it, having little or no knowledge of the countries which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> farther to the eastward; though by the moderns all those vast tracts from the eastern parts of the Persian empire to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAPAN\">Japan</a>, are confounded under the general name of East Indies. Even the ancients, though originally they were acquainted only with the western parts of Hindoostan, gradually extended the name of India over the other countries they discovered to the eastward; so that probably they would have involved all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> in the same general designation, had they been as well acquainted with them as the moderns are. By whom these countries were originally peopled, is a question which in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> will never be resolved. Certain it is, that some works in these parts display marks of astonishing skill and power in the inhabitants, such as the images in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Elephanta; the rocking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> of immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, yet so nicely balanced that a man can move them with his hand; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">observatory</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENARES\">Benares</a>, &c. These stupendous works are by Mr Bryant attributed to the Cuthites or Babylonians, the first distinct nation in the world, and who of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> must for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> have possessed in a manner the sovereignty of the whole earth; and it can by no means appear improbable, that the subjects of Nimrod, the beginning of whose kingdom was in Shinar, might extend themselves eastward, and thus fill the fertile regions of the east with inhabitants, without thinking it worth while for a long time to meddle with the less mild and rich countries to the westward. Thus why the would be formed that great and for some time influential Indians and other countries; so that the western nations knew not ignorant of even of the existence of the Indians but by obscure one another report; while the latter, ignorant of their own origin, invented a thousand idle tales concerning the antiquity of their nation, which some of the moderns have been credulous enough to believe and regard as facts.\n\nThe first among the western nations who distinguished\ned themselves by their application to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, and who were of consequence likely to discover these distant nations, were the Egyptians and Phenicians. The former, however, soon lost their inclination for naval affairs, and held all seafaring people in detestation as profane persons; though the extensive conquests of Scelotris, if we can believe them, must have in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> supplied this defect.\n\nWithout regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> of his people against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> affairs, he is said to have fitted out a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> of 400 sail in the Arabian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RED_SEA\">Red <a </a>class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, which conquered all the countries lying along the Erythrean sea (a) to India; while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> led by himself marched through Asia, and subdued all the countries to the Ganges; after which he crossed that river, and advanced to the eastern ocean.\n\nGreat disputes have been carried on with respect to this conqueror, and the famous expedition just now related; but the learned Dr Robertson, in his Disquisition concerning ancient India, declares himself in doubt whether any such expedition ever was made, for the following reasons. 1. Few historical facts seem to be better established than that of the aversion the Egyptians entertained to seafaring people and naval affairs; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> considers it as impossible even for the most powerful monarch to change in a few years a national <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> confirmed by time and sanctified by religion. The very magnitude of the armaments is an argument against their existence; for besides the 400 ships of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, he had another fleet in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>; and such a mighty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a> could not have been constructed in any nation unaccustomed to maritime affairs, in a few years. 2. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a> makes no mention of the conquests of India by Scelotris, though he relates his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> at some length. Our author is of opinion that the story was fabricated betwixt the time of Herodotus and that of Diodorus Siculus, from whom we have the first account of this expedition. Diodorus himself informs us that he had it from the Egyptian priests; and gives it as his opinion, that \"many things they related flowed rather from a desire to promote the honour of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> than from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to truth;\" and he takes notice that both the Egyptian priests and Greek writers differ widely from one another in the accounts which they give of the actions of Scelotris. 3. Though Diodorus declares that he has selected the most probable parts of the Egyptian narrative, yet there are still so many improbabilities, or rather impossibilities, contained in his relation, that we cannot by any means give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to it. 4. For the reason just mentioned, the judicious geographer Strabo rejected the account altogether, and ranks the exploits of Scelotris in India with the fabulous ones of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACCHUS\">Bacchus</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERCULES\">Hercules</a>.\n\nBut whatever may be determined with regard to the Egyptians, it is certain that the Tyrians kept up a constant intercourse with some parts of India by navigating the Arabian gulf, now the Red sea. Of this navigation they became masters by taking from the Idumeans some maritime places on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of the Red sea: but as the distance betwixt the nearest place of that sea and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRE\">Tyre</a> was still considerable, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>-carriage would have been very tedious and expensive; for which reason it was necessary to become masters of a port on the eastern part of the Mediterranean, nearer to the Red sea than Tyre, so that the goods might be shipped from thence to Tyre itself. With this view they took possession of Rhinvelura, the nearest port on the Mediterranean to the Arabian gulf; and to that port all the goods from India were conveyed by a much shorter and less expensive route than over land.\u2014This is the first authentic account of any intercourse betwixt India and the western part of the world; and to this we are without doubt in a great measure to ascribe the vast wealth and power for which the city of Tyre was anciently renowned; for in other respects the whole territory of Phenicia was but of little consequence. Notwithstanding the frequency of these voyages, however, the ancients are able to give little or no account of them. The most particular description we have of the wealth, power, and commerce of ancient Tyre, is in the prophecies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EZEKIEL\">Ezekiel</a>; so that if the Tyrians themselves kept any journals of their voyages, it is probable that they were entirely lost when the city was destroyed by Alexander the Great.\n\nThough the Jews, under the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> and Solomon, carried on an extensive and lucrative commerce with India, there are only two places mentioned to which their ships sailed, viz. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-OPHIR\">Ophir</a> and Tarshish; both of which are now supposed to have been situated on the eastern coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>: the ancient Tarshish, according to Mr Bruce, was the present Mocha; and Ophir the kingdom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOFALA\">Sofala</a>, so remarkable in former times for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>, that it was called by Oriental writers the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> Sofala*.\n\nThus the Indians <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for a long time unknown to the western nations, and undisturbed by them; probably in subjection to the mighty empire of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLON\">Babylon</a>, from which the country was originally peopled, or in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> with it; and the possession of this vast region will easily account for the immense and otherwise almost incredible wealth and power of the ancient Babylonian monarchs. Soon after the destruction of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a> by the Persians, however, we find their monarch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DARIUS\">Darius</a> Hystaspes undertaking an expedition in India against the Indians*. His conquests were not extensive, as they did not reach beyond the territory watered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDUS\">Indus</a>; nevertheless, such as they were, the acquisition seems to have been very important, as the revenue derived from the conquered territory, according to Herodotus, was near a third of that of the whole Persian empire. According to his account, however, we must form a much more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIMINUTIVE\">diminutive</a> opinion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> of the Persian monarch than has commonly been done; since Herodotus tells us, that the empire was divided into 20 satrapies or governments; all of which yielded\n\n(a) This must not be confounded with the Red sea, notwithstanding the similarity of names. The Erythrean sea was that part of the ocean which is interposed betwixt the straits of Babelmandel and the Malabar coast, now called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> sea or ocean.\nyielded a revenue of 14,560 Euboic talents, amounting in the whole to 2,857,437l. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>. The amount of the revenue from the conquered provinces of India therefore must have been considerably short of a million. Very little knowledge of the country was diffused by the expedition of Darius, or the voyage of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCYLAX\">Scylax</a> whom he employed to explore the coast; for the Greeks paid no regard to the transactions of those whom they called Barbarians; and as for Scylax himself, he told so many incredible stories in the account he gave of his voyage, that he had the misfortune to be disbelieved in almost everything, whether true or false.\n\nThe expedition of Alexander is so fully taken notice of under the article Hindostan, that nothing more remains to be said upon it in this place, than that he went no farther into the country than the present territory of the Panjab, all of which he did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a>. Its south-west boundary is formed by a river anciently called the Hydriates, now the Sutlej. The breadth of the district from Ludhiana on the Sutlej, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTOCK\">Attock</a> on the Indus, is computed to be 259 geographical miles in a straight line; and Alexander's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a>, computed in the same manner, did not exceed 200; nevertheless, by the spreading of his numerous army over the country, and the exact measurement and delineation of all his movements by men of science whom he employed, a very extensive knowledge of the western part of India was obtained. It is, however, surprising, that having marched through so many countries in the neighbourhood of India, where the people must have been well acquainted with the nature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>, the Macedonian conqueror did not receive any information concerning the difficulties he would meet with from the rains which fell periodically at a certain season of the year. It was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> difficulties occasioned by them which made his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> finally resolve to proceed no farther; and no wonder indeed that they did adopt this resolution, since Diodorus informs us, that it had rained incessantly for 70 days before their departure. These rains, however, according to the testimony both of ancient and modern writers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> only in the mountainous parts, little or none being ever seen in the plains. Arrian informs us, that in the country through which Alexander marched, though heavy rains fell among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, not a shower was seen in the plains below. The district is now seldom visited by Europeans; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> Rennell was informed by a person of credit, who had resided in the Panjab, that during great part of the S.W. monsoon, or at least in the months <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>, August, and part of September, which is the rainy season in most other parts of India, very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> falls in the Delta of the Indus, except very near the sea, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> is generally clouded, and very few showers fall throughout the whole season. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a> relates, that when he visited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TATTA\">Tatta</a>, no rain had fallen there for three years before. We may have some idea of what the Macedonians suffered by what happened afterwards to Nadir Shah, who, though possessed of vast wealth and power, as well as great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> affairs, yet lost a great part of his army in crossing the mountains and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> of the Panjab, and in battles with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> inhabitants who inhabit the countries between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-OXUS\">Oxus</a> and the frontiers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>. He marched through the same countries, and nearly in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, that Alexander did.\n\nBy his voyage down the river Indus, Alexander contributed much more to enlarge our geographical knowledge of India than by all his marches and conquests by land. According to Major Rennell, the space of country through which he sailed on the Indus, from the Hyphasis to the ocean, was not less than 1000 miles; and as, during the whole of that navigation, he obliged the nations on both sides the river to submit to him, we may be very certain that the country on each side was explored to some distance. An exact account not only of his military operations, but of every thing worthy of notice relating to the countries through which he passed, was preserved in the journals of his three officers, Lagus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEARCHUS\">Nearchus</a> and Arrianobulus; and these journals, Arrian informs us, he followed in the composition of his history. From these authors we learn, that in the time of Alexander, the western part of that vast tract named India was possessed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> very powerful monarchs. The territory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> Porus, which Alexander first conquered, and then restored to him, is said to have contained no fewer than 2000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>; and the king of the Pashai had assembled an army of 20,000 cavalry, 2000 armed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARIOTS\">chariots</a>, and a great number of elephants, to oppose the Macedonian monarch on the banks of the Ganges. The navigable rivers with which the Panjab country abounds, afforded them, and still continue to afford, an intercourse from one part to another by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; and as at that time these rivers had probably many ships on them for the purposes of commerce, Alexander might easily collect all the number he is said to have had, viz. 2000; since it is reported that Semiramis was opposed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> the number on the Indus when she invaded India. When Mahmud Gazni also invaded this country, a fleet was collected upon the Indus to oppose him, consisting of the same number of vessels. From the Ayeen Akbery, also, we learn that the inhabitants of this part of India still continue to carry on all their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with each other by water; and the inhabitants of the circular of Tatta alone have 40,000 vessels of various contrivances.\n\nUnder the article Hindostan we have mentioned Why Alexander's historians take Dr Robertson accounts for it in another manner. It is remarkable (says he), that neither Nearchus, nor Arrian, once mention the voyage of Scylax. This could not proceed from their being unacquainted with it, for Herodotus was a favourite author in the hands of every Greek who had any pretensions to literature. It was probably occasioned by the reasons they had to distrust the veracity of Scylax, of which I have already taken notice. Accordingly, in a speech which Arrian puts in the mouth of Alexander, he affirms, that, except Bacchus, he was the first who had passed the Indus; which implies that he disbelieved what is related concerning Scylax, and was not acquainted with what Darius Hyphasis is said to have done in order to subject that part of India to the Persian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>. This opinion is confirmed by Megasthenes, who resided a considerable time in India. He affirms that, except Bacchus and Hercules (to whose fabulous expeditions Strabo is astonished\nastonished that he should have given any credit), Alexander was the first who had invaded India. Arrian informs us that the Achaemeni, and other people who inhabited the country now called Candahar, had been tributary first to the Assyrians and then to the Medes and Persians. As all the fertile provinces on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-west of the Indus were anciently reckoned to be part of India, it is probable that what was levied from them is the sum mentioned in the tribute-roll from which Herodotus drew his account of the annual revenue of the Persian empire, and that none of the provinces to the south of the Indus were ever subject to the kings of Persia.\"\u2014The Doctor differs from Mr Rennell with respect to the surprize which Alexander and his army expressed when they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> at the mouth of the Indus. This he thinks might very naturally have been the case, notwithstanding what Herodotus had written concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a> and reflux observable in the Red sea. All that has been mentioned by Herodotus concerning this phenomenon is, that \"in the Red sea there is a regular ebb and flow of the tide every day.\" No wonder therefore that the Macedonians should be surprised and terrified at the very high tides which presented themselves in the Indian ocean, which the few words of Herodotus above-mentioned had by no means led them to expect. In the like manner, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> were surprised at the tides in the Atlantic, when they had conquered some of the countries bordering upon that ocean. Caesar describes the astonishment of his soldiers at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> tide in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> which greatly damaged his fleet; and indeed, considering the very little rise of the tide in the Mediterranean, to which alone the Greeks and Romans had access, we may reckon the account given us by Arrian highly probable.\n\nThe country on each side the Indus was found, in the time of Alexander, to be in no degree inferior in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> to the kingdom of Porsus already mentioned. The climate, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, and productions of India, as well as the manners and customs of the inhabitants, are exactly described, and the descriptions found to correspond in a surprising manner with modern accounts. The stated change of seasons now known by the name of monsoon, the periodical rains, the swellings and inundations of the rivers, with the appearance of the country during the time they continue, are particularly described. The descriptions of the inhabitants are equally particular; their living entirely upon vegetable food, their division into tribes or castes, with many of the particularities related under the article Hindoo, are to be met with in the accounts of Alexander's expedition. His military operations, however, extended but a very little way into India properly so called; no farther indeed than the modern province of Lahor, and the countries on the banks of the Indus from Moutan to the sea; though, had he lived to undertake another expedition as he intended, it is very probable that he would have subdued a vastly greater tract of country; nor indeed could anything probably have set bounds to his conquests but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> or revolts in distant provinces of his empire. In order to secure the obedience of those countries he subdued, Alexander found it necessary to build a number of fortified cities; and the farther eastward he extended his conquests, the more necessary did he find this task. Three he built in India itself; two on the banks of the Hydaspes, and a third on the Acesines, both navigable rivers, falling into the Indus after they have united their streams. By means of these cities he intended not only to keep the adjacent countries in awe, but to promote a commercial intercourse betwixt different parts both by land and water. With this view also, on his return to Suse, he surveyed in person the course of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUPHRATES\">Euphrates</a> and Tigris, causing the cataracts or dams to be removed which the Persian monarchs had built to obstruct the navigation of these rivers, in conformity to a maxim of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, that it was unlawful to defile any of the elements, which they imagined was done by navigators. After the navigation was opened in this manner, he proposed that the valuable commodities of India should be imported into the other parts of his dominions by means of the Persian gulf; while through the Red sea they were conveyed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, and thence dispersed all over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>.\n\nThe death of Alexander having put an end to all his great schemes, the eastern part of his dominions devolved first on Pytho the son of Agenor, and afterwards on Seleucus. The latter was very sensible of the advantages to be derived from keeping India in subjection. With this view he undertook an expedition into that country, partly to establish his authority more perfectly, and partly to defend the Macedonian territories against Sandracottus king of the Pafrii, who threatened to attack them. The particulars of his expedition are very little known; Julian being the only author that mentions them, and his authority is but of little weight, unless corroborated by the testimony of other historians. Plutarch, who tells us that Seleucus carried his arms farther into India than Alexander, is subject to an imputation of the same kind; but Pliny, whose authority is of considerably greater weight, corroborates the testimony of Plutarch in this instance, though his words are too obscure, that learned men differ in opinion concerning their meaning. Bayer thinks they imply that Seleucus marched from the Hyphasis, the boundary of Alexander's conquests, to the Hydaspes, from thence to Palibothra, and then to the mouth of the Ganges; the distances of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> stations being marked, and amounting in all to 2244 Roman miles. Notwithstanding this authority, however, Dr Robertson thinks it very improbable that the expedition of Seleucus should have continued so long, as in that case \"the ancients would have had a more accurate knowledge of that part of the country than they seem ever to have possessed.\"\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> of Seleucus in the east was stopped by Antigonus, who prepared to invade the western part of his dominions. The former was therefore obliged to conclude a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> with Sandracottus, whom he allowed to remain in quiet possession of his territories; but Dr Robertson is of opinion, that during the lifetime of Seleucus, which continued 42 years after the death of Alexander, no diminution of the Macedonian territories took place. With a view of keeping up a friendly intercourse with the Indian prince, Seleucus sent Megalathenes, one of Alexander's satraps, to Palibothra, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of the kingdom of the Pafrii, situated on the banks of the Ganges. This city is by Dr Robertson supposed to be the modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLAHABAD\">Allahabad</a>, seated at the confluence of the Jumna and Ganges, contrary...\ntrary to the opinion of Major Rennel, who supposes it to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATNA\">Patna</a>. As Megasthenes resided in this city for a considerable space of time, he had an opportunity of making many observations on the country of India in general; and these observations he was induced afterwards to publish. Unhappily, however, he mingled with his relations the most extravagant fables. To him may be traced the ridiculous accounts of men with ears so large that they could wrap themselves up in them; of tribes with one eye, without mouths or noses, &c., whence the extracts from his book given by Arrian, Diodorus, and other ancient writers, can scarcely be credited, unless confirmed by other evidence.\n\nAfter the embassy of Megasthenes to Sandracottus, and that of his son Damacus to Allitrochidas, the successor of Sandracottus, we hear no more of the affairs of India with regard to the Macedonians, until the time of Antiochus the Great, who made a short incursion into India about 197 years after the death of Seleucus. All that we know of this expedition is, that the Syrian monarch, after finishing a war he carried on against the two revolted provinces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTHIA\">Parthia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACTRIA\">Bactria</a>, entered India, where he obliged Sophagenus, king of the country which he invaded, to pay a sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, and give him a number of elephants. It is probable that the successors of Seleucus were obliged soon after his death to abandon all their Indian territories.\n\nAfter the loss of India by the Syrians, an intercourse was kept up for some time between it and the Greek kingdom of Bactria. This last became an independent state about 69 years after the death of Alexander; and, according to the few hints we have concerning it in ancient authors, carried on a great traffic with India. Nay, the Bactrian monarchs are said to have conquered more extensive tracts in that region than Alexander himself had done. Six princes reigned over this new kingdom in succession; some of whom, elated with the conquests they had made and the power they had acquired, assumed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Great King, by which the Persian monarchs were distinguished in their highest splendour. Strabo informs us, that the Bactrian princes were deprived of their territories by the Scythian Nomades, who came from the country beyond the Jaxartes, and were known by the names of Affi, Pafani, Tachari, and Scarauli. This is confirmed by the testimony of some Chinese historians quoted by M. de Guignes. According to them, about 126 years before the Christian era, a powerful horde of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARS\">Tartars</a> rushed from their native seats on the confines of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a>, and obliged to move farther to the west, passed the Jaxartes, and, pouring in upon Bactria like an irresistible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a>, overwhelmed that kingdom, and put an end to the dominion of the Greeks after it had lasted near 130 years.\n\nFrom this time to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> of the 1st century, all thoughts of establishing any dominion in India were totally abandoned by the Europeans. The only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> now was to promote a commercial intercourse with that country; and Egypt was the medium by which that intercourse was to be promoted. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a> the son of Lagus, and first king of Egypt, first raised the power and splendour of Alexandria, which he knew had been built by Alexander with a view to carry on a trade to India; and in order to make the navigation more secure, he built the celebrated light-house at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHAROS\">Pharos</a>; a work so magnificent as to be reckoned one of the wonders of the world. His son Ptolemy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILADELPHUS\">Philadelphus</a> prosecuted the same plan very vigorously. In his time the Indian commerce once more began to centre in Tyre; but to remove it effectually from thence, he formed a canal between Arinoe on the Red sea, not far from the place where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUEZ\">Suez</a> now stands, and the Pelusiac or eastern branch of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a>. This canal was 100 cubits <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> and 30 deep; so that by means of it the productions of India might have been conveyed to Alexandria entirely by water. We know not whether this work was ever finished, or whether it was found useless on account of the dangerous navigation towards the northern extremity of the Red sea; but whatever was the cause, it is certain that no use was made of it, and a new city named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERENICE\">Berenice</a>, situated almost under the tropic, upon the western shore of the Red sea, became the staple of Indian commerce. From thence the goods were transported by land to Coptos, a city distant only three miles from the Nile, to which it was joined by a navigable canal. Thus, however, there was a very tedious land carriage of no less than 258 Roman miles through the barren <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> of Theba\u00efs; but Ptolemy caused diligent search to be made everywhere for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>, and wherever they were found, he built inns or caravanserais for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> of travellers; and thus the commerce with India was carried on till Egypt became subject to the Romans. The ships during this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> set sail from Berenice, and coaling along the Arabian shore to the promontory of Syagrus, now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> Raselgate, held their course along the coast of Persia till they arrived at the mouth of the western branch of the river Indus. They either failed up this branch till they came to Pattala, now Tatta, situated at the upper part of the Delta, or continued their course to some other emporium on the western part of the Indian coast. A more convenient course was afterwards found by sailing directly to Zenis, a place concerning which there is now some dispute. Montfiquet will have it to be the kingdom of Sigertis, on the coast adjacent to the Indus, and which was conquered by the Bactrian monarchs; but Major Rennel is of opinion that it was a port on the Malabar coast. Dr Robertson does not pretend to decide this dispute; but is of opinion, that during the time of the Ptolemies very little progress was made in the discovery of India. He contests the opinion of Major Rennel, that \"under the Ptolemies the Egyptians extended their navigation to the extreme point of the Indian continent, and even sailed up the Ganges to Palibothra, now Patna.\" In this case he thinks that the interior parts of India must have been much better known to the ancients than we have any reason to believe they were. He owns indeed that Strabo mentions the sailing up the Ganges, but then it is only cursorily and in a single sentence; \"whereas if such a considerable inland voyage of above 400 miles, through a populous and rich country, had been customary, or even if it had been ever performed by the Roman, Greek, or Egyptian traders, it must have merited a particular description, and must have been mentioned by Pliny, and other writers, as there was nothing similar to it in the practice of navigation among the ancients.\"\u2014The extreme danger of navigating\ngating the Red sea in ancient times (which even in the present improved state of navigation is not entirely got over) seems to have been the principal reason which induced Ptolemy to remove the communication with India from Arinoe to Berenice, as there were other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a> on the same coast considerably nearer to the Nile. After the ruin of Coptos by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Diocletian, the Indian commodities were conveyed from the Red sea to the Nile from Caffir, supposed by Dr Robertson to be the Philoteras Portus of Ptolemy, to Cous, the Vicus Apollinis, a journey of four days. Hence Cous from a small village became an opulent city; but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time, the trade from India removed from Cous to Ken\u00e9, farther down the river.\n\nIn modern times such Indian goods as are brought by the Red sea come from Gidda to Suez, and are carried across the Isthmus on camels, or brought by the caravan returning from the pilgrimage to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECCA\">Mecca</a>.\n\nIt was to this monopoly of Indian commerce that Egypt owed its vast wealth and power during the time of its Macedonian monarchs; but it appears surprising that no attempt was made by the Syrian monarchs to rival them in it, especially as the latter were in possession of the Persian gulf, from whence they might have imported the Indian commodities by a much shorter navigation than could be done by the Egyptians. For this neglect several reasons are assigned by our learned author. 1. The Egyptians, under their Greek monarchs, applied themselves to maritime affairs; and were in possession of such a powerful fleet as gave them a decided superiority in it. 2. No intercourse by sea was ever kept up between Persia and India, on account of the aversion which the Persians had to maritime affairs. All the Indian commodities were then conveyed in the most tedious and difficult manner over land, and dispersed throughout the various provinces, partly by means of navigable rivers and partly by means of the Caspian sea. 3. Many of the ancients, by an unaccountable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a>, imagined the Caspian sea to be a part of the great northern ocean; and thus the kings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a> might hope to convey the Indian commodities to the European countries without attempting to navigate those seas which the Egyptian monarchs deemed their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>. Seleucus Nicator, the first and greatest of the Syro-Macedonian monarchs, formed a project of joining the Euxine and Caspian seas by a navigable canal, which would have effectually answered the purpose, but was abandoned before he could put it in execution, and none of his successors had abilities to execute such an undertaking. Alexander the Great had given orders, a little before his death, to fit out a squadron on the Caspian sea, in order to discover whether it had any communication with the northern ocean, the Euxine sea, or Indian ocean; but Dr Robertson justly thinks it surprising that such errors concerning this sea should have existed among the ancients, as Herodotus had long before described it properly in the following words: \"The Caspian is a sea by itself, unconnected with any other. Its length is as much as a vessel with oars can sail in fifteen days; and its greatest breadth as much as it can sail in eight days.\" <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> describes it in like manner, and insists that it ought to be called a great lake, and not a sea.\n\nOn the conquest of Egypt by the Romans, the Indian commodities continued as usual to be imported to Alexandria in Egypt, and from thence to Rome; but besides this, the most ancient communication betwixt the eastern and western parts of Asia seems never to have been entirely given up. Syria and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a> are separated from Mesopotamia by a desert; but the passage through it was much facilitated by its affording a station which abounded in water. Hence the possession of this station became an object of such consequence, that Solomon built upon it the city called in Syria Tadmor, and in Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALMYRA\">Palmyra</a>. Both these names are expressive of its situation in a spot adorned with palm-trees. Though its situation for trade may to us seem very unfavourable (being 60 miles from the Euphrates, by which alone it could receive the Indian commodities, and 203 from the nearest coast of the Mediterranean), yet the value and small bulk of the goods in question rendered the conveyance of them by a long carriage over land not only practicable but lucrative and advantageous. Hence the inhabitants became opulent and powerful, and long maintained its independence even after the Syrian empire became subject to Rome. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of Palmyra by the emperor Aurelian, however, it did not any more recover its splendor; the trade gradually turned into other channels, and the city was reduced to ruins, which still exist, and manifest its former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>. See PALMYRA.\n\nThe excessive eagerness of the Romans for Asiatic luxuries of all kinds kept up an unceasing intercourse with India during the whole time that the empire continued in its power; and even after the destruction of the western part, it was kept up betwixt Constantinople and those parts of India which had been visited formerly by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> from the western empire. Long before this period, however, a much better method of navigating to India had been discovered by one Hippalus, the commander of an Indian ship, who lived about 80 years after Egypt had been annexed to the Roman empire. This man having observed the periodical shifting of the monsoons, and how steadily they blew from the east or west during some months, ventured to leave the coast, and sail boldly across the Indian ocean from the mouth of the Arabian gulf to Mafiris, a port on the Malabar coast; which discovery was reckoned a matter of such importance, that the name of Hippalus was given to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> by which he performed the voyage. Pliny gives a very particular account of the manner in which the Indian traffic was now carried on, mentioning the particular stages, and the distances between them, which are as follow. From Alexandria to Joppa was two miles; and there the cargo destined for India was shipped on the Nile, and carried to Coptos, distant 303 miles, the voyage being usually performed in twelve days. From Coptos they were conveyed by land to Berenice, distant 258 miles, and halting at different stations as occasion required. The journey was finished on the 12th day; but by reason of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> the caravan travelled only in the night. The ships left Berenice about midsummer, and in 30 days reached Ocelis, now Galla, at the mouth of the Arabian gulf, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANE\">Cane</a> (now Cape Faroague) on the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a> Felix; from whence they sailed in 40 days to Mafiris already mentioned. Their homeward voyage began early in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>; when setting sail with...\nwith a north-east wind, and meeting with a south or south-west one when they entered the Arabian gulf, the voyage was completed in less than a year. With regard to the situation of Mufiris, as well as of Barace, another Indian port to which the ancients traded, Major Rennel is of opinion, and Dr Robertson agrees with him, that they stood somewhere between Goa and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TELLICHERRY\">Tellicherry</a>; and that probably the modern Meerzaw or Merjee is the Mufiris, and Barcelore the Barace of the ancients.\n\nPtolemy, who flourished about 200 years after the commencement of the Christian era, having the advantage of so many previous discoveries, gives a more particular description of India than what is to be met with in any of the ancient writers; notwithstanding which, his accounts are frequently insufficient not only with modern discoveries, but with those of more ancient geographers than himself. A most capital error in his geography is, that he makes the peninsula of India stretch from the Sinus Barygazenus, or gulf of Cambay, from west to east, instead of extending, according to its real direction, from north to south; and this error must appear the more extraordinary, when we consider that Megasthenes had published a measurement of this peninsula nearly conformant to truth, which had been adopted with some variations by Eratosthenes, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, and Pliny. His information concerning the situation of places, however, was much more accurate. With respect to some districts on the eastern part of the peninsula, as far as the Ganges, he comes nearer the truth than in his descriptions of any of the rest. These are particularly pointed out by M. d'Anville, who has determined the modern names of many of Ptolemy's stations, as Kilkare, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEGAPATAM\">Negapatam</a>, the mouth of the river Cauveri, Mafulpatam, &c. The river Cauveri is the Chabaris of Ptolemy; the kingdom of Arcot, Avcai Regio; and probably, says Dr Robertson, the whole coast has received its present name of Coromandel from Sor Mandulam, or the kingdom of Sora, which is situated upon it. Ptolemy had likewise acquired so much knowledge concerning the river Ganges, that he describes six of its mouths, though his delineation of that part of India which lies beyond the Ganges is hardly less erroneous than that of the nearer peninsula. M. d'Anville, however, has been at great pains to elucidate these matters, and to illustrate those parts of the writings of Ptolemy which appear to be best founded. According to him, the golden Cheronefus of Ptolemy is the peninsula of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALACCA\">Malacca</a>; he supposes the gulf of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIAM\">Siam</a> to be the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a> of Ptolemy, and the Sin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">Metropolis</a> of the same writer he looks upon to be Sin-hoa in the western part of the kingdom of Cochin-China, though Ptolemy has erred in its situation no less than 50 degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGITUDE\">longitude</a> and 20 of latitude. M. Goffelin, however, differs from his countryman M. d'Anville, in a late work intitled \"The Geography of the Greeks analysed; or the systems of Eratosthenes, Strabo, and Ptolemy, compared with each other, and with the knowledge which the moderns have acquired.\" In the opinion of M. Goffelin, the Magnum Promontorium of Ptolemy is not Cape Romania at the southern extremity of the peninsula of Malacca, as M. d'Anville supposes, but the point Bragu, at the mouth of the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVA\">Ava</a>. The great bay of Ptolemy he supposes not to be the gulf of Siam, but of Martaban.\n\nHe endeavours to prove that the position of Cattipnara, as laid down by Ptolemy, corresponds with that of Mergui, a sea port on the west of Siam; and that Thina, or Sin Metropolis, is not Sin-hoa, but Tana-serim, a city on the same river with Mergui; and he contends, that the Ibbadji insula of Ptolemy is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMATRA\">Sumatra</a>, as D'Anville would have it, but one of the small isles which lie in a cluster off this coast. M. Goffelin is of opinion that the ancients never sailed through the straits of Malacca, nor had any knowledge of the island of Sumatra, or of the eastern ocean.\n\nThe errors of Ptolemy have given occasion to a mistake of more modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a>, viz. that the ancients were acquainted with China. This arose from the resemblance betwixt the name of that empire and the Sin of the ancients. The Ayeen Akbery informs us, that Cheen was an ancient name of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEGU\">Pegu</a>; whence, says Dr Robertson, \"as that country borders upon Ava, where M. Goffelin places the great promontory, this near resemblance of names may appear perhaps to confirm his opinion that Sin Metropolis was situated on this coast, and not so far east as M. d'Anville has placed it.\"\n\nThus we see that the peninsula of Malacca was in all probability the boundary of the ancient discoveries of the navigation of the ancients.\n\nThe Romans having extended their dominions as far as the river Euphrates, found this method of conveyance still established, and the trade was by them encouraged and protected. The progress of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARAVANS\">caravans</a> being frequently interrupted by the Parthians, particularly when they travelled towards those countries where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> and other of the most valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> were procured, it thence became an object to the Romans to conciliate the friendship of the sovereigns of those distant countries. That such an attempt was actually made, we know from the Chinese historians, who tell us, that Antoun, by whom they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> the emperor Marcus Antoninus, the king of the people of the western ocean, sent an embassy to Ounti, who reigned in China in the 166th year of the Christian era; but though the fact is mentioned, we are left entirely in the dark as to the issue of the negotiations. It is certain, however, that during the times of the Romans such a trade was carried on; and as we cannot suppose all those who visited that distant region to be entirely defective in science, we may reasonably enough conclude, that by means of some of these adventurers, Ptolemy was enabled to determine the situation of many places which he has laid down in his geography, and which correspond very nearly with the observations of modern times.\n\nWith regard to the Indian islands, considering the few Indian little way they extended their navigation, they could lands differ not be acquainted with many of them. The principal covered by the ancients was that of Ceylon, called by the ancients Taprobane. The name was entirely unknown in Europe before the time of Alexander the Great; but that conqueror, though he did not visit, had somehow or other heard of it; with regard to any particulars, however, he seems to have been very flatteringly informed; and the accounts of ancient geographers concerning it are confused.\nconfused and contradictory. Strabo says, it is as large as Britain, and situated at the distance of seven days according to some reports, or 20 days sailing according to others, from the southern extremity of the peninsula. Pomponius Mela is uncertain whether to consider Taprobane as an island, or the beginning of another world; but inclines to the latter opinion, as nobody had ever sailed round it. The account of Pliny is still more obscure; and by his description he would make us believe, that it was seated in the southern hemisphere beyond the tropic of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPRICORN\">Capricorn</a>. Ptolemy places it opposite to Cape Comorin, at no great distance from the continent; but errs greatly with regard to its magnitude, making it no less than 15 degrees in length from north to south. And Agathemus, who wrote after Ptolemy, makes Taprobane the largest island in the world, affixing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> place to Britain. From these discordant accounts, some learned men have supposed that the Taprobane of the ancients is not Ceylon, as is generally believed, but the island of Sumatra; though the description of it by Ptolemy, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> delineated in his maps, seems to put it beyond a doubt, that Ceylon, and not Sumatra, is the island to which Ptolemy applies the designation of Taprobane. The other islands described by that geographer to the eastward of Taprobane, are, according to Dr Robertson, those called Andaman and Nicobar in the gulf of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a>.\n\nFrom the time of Ptolemy to that of the emperor Julian, we have no account of any intercourse of the Europeans with India, or of any progress made in the geographical knowledge of the country. Under that emperor one Cosmas, an Egyptian merchant, made some voyages to India, where he acquired the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURNAME\">surname</a> of Indicopleustes. Having afterwards turned monk, he published several works; one of which, named Christian Topography, has reached us. In this, though mixed with many strange reveries, he relates with great simplicity and appearance of truth what he had seen in his travels or had learned from others. He describes several places on the western coast of the hither peninsula, which he calls the chief seat of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>-trade; and from one of the ports on that coast, named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">Male</a>, Dr Robertson thinks that the name Malabar may probably be derived, as well as that of Maldives given to a cluster of islands lying at no great distance. Cosmas informs us also, that in his time the island of Taprobane had become a great staple of trade. He calls it not Taprobane, but Sieddibia, derived from Selendib, or Serendib, the name by which it is still known all over the east. From him also we learn, that the Persians having overthrown the empire of the Parthians, applied themselves with great diligence and success to maritime affairs; in consequence of which they became formidable rivals to the Romans in the India trade. The latter finding themselves thus in danger of losing entirely that lucrative branch, partly by reason of the rivalry just mentioned, and partly by reason of the frequent hostilities which took place between the two empires, formed a scheme of preserving some share of the trade by means of their ally the emperor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABYSSINIA\">Abyssinia</a>. In this he was disappointed, though afterwards he obtained his end in a way entirely unexpected. This was introduced by means of two monks who had been employed as missionaries in different parts of the east, and had penetrated as far as the country of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SERES\">Seres</a> or China. From thence, induced by the liberal promises of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTINIAN\">Justinian</a>, they brought a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of the eggs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-SILK_WORMS\">silk-<a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a> in a hollow cane. They were then hatched by the heat of a dunghill; and being fed with the leaves of the mulberry, worked and multiplied as well as in those countries of which they are natives. Vast numbers were soon reared in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>; from whence they were exported to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>, and from thence to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>; in all which countries silk manufactures have since been established.\n\nOn the conquest of Egypt by the Saracens in the year 640, the India trade was of course transferred to them; and they soon began to pursue it with much more vigour than the Romans had done. The city of Balhara was built by the caliph Omar upon the western banks of the great river formed by the union of the Euphrates with the Tigris. Thus the command of both rivers was secured, and the new city soon became a place of such consequence as scarce to yield to Alexandria itself. Here Dr Robertson takes notice, that from the evidence of an Arabian merchant who wrote in the year 851, it appears, that not only the Saracens, but the Chinese also, were destitute of the main Chinese compass; contrary to the general opinion, that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> was known in the east long before it made its appearance in Europe. From this relation, as well as much concurring evidence, says our author, \"it is manifest, that not only the Arabians but the Chinese were destitute of this faithful guide, and that their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of navigation was not more adventurous than that of the Greeks and Romans. They steered servilely along the coast, seldom stretching out to sea so far as to lose sight of land; and as they layed their course in this timid manner, their mode of reckoning was defective, and liable to the same errors with that of the Greeks and Romans.\" Notwithstanding this disadvantage, however, they penetrated far beyond Siam, which had set bounds to the navigation of the Europeans. They became acquainted with Sumatra and other Indian islands; extending their navigation as far as the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTON\">Canton</a> in China. A regular commerce was now carried on from the Persian gulf to all the countries lying betwixt it and China, and even with China itself. Many Saracens settled in India properly so called, and in the countries beyond it. In the city of Canton particularly, they were so numerous, that the emperor permitted them to have a cadi or judge of their own religion; the Arabian language was understood and spoken in every place of consequence; and ships from China are even said to have visited the Persian gulf.\n\nAccording to the Arabian accounts of those days, State of India when the peninsula of India was at that time divided into four kingdoms. The first was composed of the provinces situated on the Indus and its branches, the capital of which was Mouttan. The second had the city of Canoge, which, from the ruins of it remaining at this day, appears to have been a very large place. The\nIndian historians relate, that it contained 30,000 shops in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BETEL\">betel</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> was sold, and 60,000 sets of musicians and fingers who paid a tax to government. The third kingdom was that of Cachmere, first mentioned by Maffoudi, who gives a short description of it. The fourth kingdom, Guzerat, is represented by the same author as the most powerful of the whole. Another Arab writer, who flourished about the middle of the 14th century, divides India into three parts; the northern, comprehending all the provinces on the Indus; the middle, extending from Guzerat to the Ganges; and the southern, which he denominates Comar, from Cape Comorin.\n\nFrom the relation of the Arabian merchant above mentioned, explained by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMENTARY\">commentary</a> of another Arabian who had likewise visited the eastern parts of Asia, we learn many particulars concerning the inhabitants of these distant regions at that time, which correspond with what is observed among them at this day. They take notice of the general use of silk among the Chinese; and the manufacture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORCELAIN\">porcelain</a>, which they compare to glass. They also describe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">tea</a> plant, with the manner of using its leaves; whence it appears, that in the ninth century the use of this plant in China was as common as it is at present. They mention likewise the great progress which the Indians had made in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>; a circumstance which seems to have been unknown to the Greeks and Romans: they assert, that in this branch of science the Indians were far superior to the most enlightened nations of the west, on which account their sovereign was called the \"King of wisdom.\" The superstitions, extravagant penances, &c., known to exist at this day among the Indians, are also mentioned by those writers; all which particulars manifest that the Arabs had a knowledge of India far superior to that of the Greeks or Romans. The zeal and industry of the Mohammedans in exploring the most distant regions of the east was rivalled by the Christians of Persia, who sent missionaries all over India and the countries adjoining, as far as China itself. But while the western Asiatics thus kept up a constant intercourse with these parts, the Europeans had in a manner lost all knowledge of them. The port of Alexandria, from which they had formerly been supplied with the Indian goods, was now shut against them; and the Arabs, satisfied with supplying the demands of their own subjects, neglected to send any by the usual channels to the towns on the Mediterranean. The inhabitants of Constantinople and some other great towns were supplied with Chinese commodities by the most tedious and difficult passage imaginable. The silk of that country was purchased in the most westerly province named Chenii; from whence it was conveyed by a caravan, which marched 80 or 100 days, to the banks of the Oxus. Here it was embarked, and carried down the river to the Caspian sea; whence, after a dangerous voyage across that sea, it was carried up the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYRUS\">Cyrus</a> as far as that river is navigable; after which it was conducted by a land carriage of five days to the river Phasis, then down that stream into the Euxine, and thence to Constantinople. The passage of goods from Hindostan was less tedious; they being carried either directly to the Caspian or to the river Oxus, but by a passage much shorter than that from China; after which they were conveyed down the Phasis to the Euxine, and thus to Constantinople.\n\nIt is evident that a commerce thus carried on must have been liable to a thousand disadvantages. The goods conveyed over such vast tracts of land could not be sold but at a very high price, even supposing the journey had been attended with no danger; but as the caravans were continually exposed to the assaults of barbarians, it is evident that the price must on that account have been greatly enhanced. In spite of every difficulty, however, even this commerce flourished, and Constantinople became a considerable mart for East Indian commodities; and from it all the rest of Europe was chiefly supplied with them for more than two centuries. The perpetual course of hostilities in which the Christians and Mohammedans were during this period engaged, contributed still to increase the difficulty; and it is remarkable, that the more this difficulty increased, the more devious the Europeans seemed to be of procuring the luxuries of Asia.\n\nAbout this time the cities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMALFI\">Amalfi</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>, with some others in Italy, having acquired a greater degree of independence than they formerly possessed, began first to exert themselves in promoting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> manufactures, and then to import the productions of India in much larger quantities than formerly. Some traces of this revival of a commercial spirit, according to Dr Robertson, may be observed from the end of the seventh century. The circumstances which led to this revival, however, are entirely unnoticed by historians; but during the seventh and eighth centuries, it is very probable that no commercial intercourse whatever took place between Italy and Alexandria; for, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> to the period we speak of, all the public deeds of the Italian and other cities of Europe had been written upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> made of the Egyptian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPYRUS\">papyrus</a>, but after that upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARCHMENT\">parchment</a>.\n\nThe mutual antipathy which the Christians and Mohammedans bore against each other, would no doubt for a long time retard the progress of commerce between them; but at last the caliphs, perceiving the advantage which such a traffic would be of to their subjects, were induced to allow it, while the eagerness with which the Christians coveted the Indian products and manufactures, prompted them to carry it on. But the effect of scarcity was the trade begun, when it seemed in danger of being totally interrupted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRUSADES\">crusades</a>. Notwithstanding the enthusiastic zeal of these adventurers, however, there were many to whom commerce was a greater object than religion. This had always been the case with numbers of the pilgrims who visited the holy places at Jerusalem even before the commencement of the crusades: but these, after they took place, instead of retarding the progress of this kind of commerce, proved the means of promoting it to a great degree. Various circumstances (says Dr Robertson) concurred towards this. Great armies, conducted by the most illustrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a> of Europe, and composed of men of the most enterprising spirit in all the kingdoms of it, marched towards Palestine, through countries far advanced beyond those which they left in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of improvement. They beheld the dawn of prosperity in the republics of Italy, which had begun to vie with each other in the arts of industry, and in their efforts to engross the lucrative commerce with the\nthe east. They next admired the more advanced state of opulence and splendor in Constantinople, raised to a pre-eminence above all cities then known by its extensive trade, particularly that which it carried on with India and the countries beyond it. They afterwards served in those provinces of Asia through which the commodities of the east were usually conveyed, and became matters of several cities which had been staples of that trade. They established the kingdom of Jerusalem, which subsisted near 200 years. They took possession of the throne of the Greek empire, and governed it about half a century. Amidst such a variety of events and operations, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of the fierce warriors of Europe gradually opened and improved; they became acquainted with the policy and arts of the people whom they subdued; they observed the sources of their wealth, and availed themselves of all this knowledge. Antioch and Tyre, when conquered by the crusaders, were flourishing cities, inhabited by opulent merchants, who supplied all the nations trading in the Mediterranean with the productions of the east; and, as far as can be gathered from incidental occurrences mentioned by the historians of the holy war, who being mostly priests and monks, had their attention directed to objects very different from those relating to commerce, there is reason to believe, that both in Constantinople while subject to the Franks, and in the ports of Syria acquired by the Christians, the long-established trade with the east continued to be protected and encouraged.\n\nOur author next goes on to show in what manner the commerce of the Italian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> was promoted by the crusades, until at last, having entirely engrossed the East India trade, they strove with such eagerness to find new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a> for their commodities, that they extended a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for them to many parts of Europe where they had formerly been little known. The rivalry of the Italian states terminated at last in a treaty with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SULTAN\">sultan</a> of Egypt in 1425, by which the port of Alexandria and others in Egypt were opened to the Florentines as well as the Venetians; and soon after, that people began to obtain a share in the trade to India.\n\nThe following account of the manner in which the India trade was carried on in the beginning of the 14th century, is given by Marino Sanudo a Venetian nobleman. The merchants of that republic were supplied with the commodities they wanted in two different ways. Those of small bulk and great value, such as cloves, nutmegs, gems, pearls, &c., were carried up the Persian gulf to Baffora, from thence to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAGDAD\">Bagdad</a>, and afterwards to some port on the Mediterranean. The more bulky goods, such as pepper, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CINNAMON\">cinnamon</a>, and other spices, were brought in the usual manner to the Red sea, and from thence to Alexandria. The goods brought by land, however, were always liable to be seized by barbarians; and therefore the supply that way was scanty, and the price extravagantly dear, while, on the other hand, the sultan of Egypt, by imposing duties upon the East India cargoes to the amount of a full third of the value, seemed to render it impossible that the owners should find purchasers for their goods. This, however, was far from being the case; the demand for India goods continually increased; and thus a communication, formerly unknown, betwixt all the nations of Europe, was begun and kept up. All this time, however, there had been no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> communication betwixt Europe and India, as the Mohammedans would never allow any Christian to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through their dominions into that country. The dreadful incursions and conquests of the Tartars under Jenghiz-khan, however, had so broken the power of the Mohammedans in the northern parts of Asia, that a way was now opened to India through the dominions of these barbarians. About the middle of the 13th century, therefore, Marco <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLO\">Polo</a>, a Venetian, by getting access to the Marco Khan of the Tartars, explored many parts of the east which had long been unknown even by name to the Europeans. He travelled through China from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEKING\">Peking</a> on its northern frontier to some of its most southerly provinces. He visited also different parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HINDUSTAN\">Hindustan</a>, and first mentions Bengal and Guzerat by their modern names as great and flourishing kingdoms. He obtained also some account of an island which he called Ziapangri, and was probably no other than Japan; he visited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAVA\">Java</a> with several of the islands in its neighbourhood, the island of Ceylon, and the coast of Malabar as far as the gulf of Cambay; to all which he gave the names they have at this day. The discovery of such immense regions unknown before in Europe, furnished vast room for speculation and conjecture; and while the public attention was yet engaged by these discoveries, the destruction of Constantinople by the Turks trade to India ruined gave a very considerable turn to the East India commerce, by throwing it almost entirely into the hands of the Venetians. Hitherto the Genoese had rivalled Constantinople in the commerce we speak of, and they had nipt, possessed themselves of many important places on the coast of Greece, as well as of the port of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAFFA\">Caffa</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK_SEA\"><a class=</a>\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> sea. Nay, they had even established themselves at Constantinople, in the suburb of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERA\">Pera</a>, in such a manner as almost entirely to exclude the Greeks themselves from any share in this commerce; but by the destruction of Constantinople they were at once driven out of all these possessions, and so thoroughly humbled, that they could no longer contend with the Venetians as before; so that, during the latter part of the 15th century, that republic supplied the greater part of Europe with the productions of the east, and carried on trade to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> far beyond what had been known in former times. The mode in which they now carried on this trade was somewhat different from what had been practised by ancient nations. The Tyrians, Greeks, and Romans, had sailed directly to India in quest of the commodities they wanted; and their example has been imitated by the navigators of modern Europe. In both periods the Indian commodities have been paid for in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> and silver; and great complaints have been made on account of the drain of those precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, which were thus buried as it were in India, never to return again. The Venetians, however, were exempted from this loss; for having no direct intercourse with India, they supplied themselves from the warehouses they found, in Egypt from their and Syria, ready filled with the precious commodities they wanted; and these they purchased more frequently by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARTER\">barter</a> than with ready money. Thus, not only the republic of Venice, but all the cities which had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> to become emporia for the India goods imported by it, were raised to such a pitch of power.\npower and splendor as scarce ever belonged to any European state. The citizens of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUGES\">Bruges</a>, from which place the other European nations were for a long time supplied with these goods, displayed such magnificence in their dress, buildings, and manner of living, as excited even the envy of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> Joan of Navarre who came to pay them a visit. On the removal of the staple from Bruges to Antwerp, the latter soon displayed the same opulence; and in some cities of Germany, particularly Augsburg, the great mart for Indian commodities in the internal parts of that country, there are examples of merchants acquiring such large fortunes as entitled them to high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and consideration in the empire. The most accurate method, however, of attaining some knowledge of the profits the Venetians had on their trade, is by conferring the rate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> on money borrowed at that time. This, from the close of the 11th century to the commencement of the 16th, we are told, was no less than 20 per cent, and sometimes more. Even as late as 1500, it was 10 or 12 in every part of Europe. Hence we are to conclude that the profits of such money as was then applied in trade must have been extremely high; and the condition of the inhabitants of Venice at that time warrants us to make the conclusion.\n\n\"In the magnificence of their houses (says Dr Robertson), in richness of furniture, in profusion of plate, and in everything which contributed either towards elegance or parade in their mode of living, the nobles of Venice surpassed the state of the greatest monarch beyond the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a>. Nor was all this display the effect of an ostentatious and inconsiderate dissipation; it was the natural consequence of successful industry, which, having accumulated wealth with ease, is entitled to enjoy it in splendor.\"\n\nThis extensive superiority of wealth displayed by the Venetians could not fail to excite the envy of the other states of Europe. They were at no loss to discover that the East India trade was the principal source from whence their wealth was derived. Some of them endeavored to obtain a share by applying to the sultans of Egypt and Syria to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> admission into their ports upon the same terms with the Venetians; but either by the superior interest of the latter with those princes, or from the advantages they had of being long established in the trade, the Venetians always prevailed. So intent indeed were the other European powers on obtaining some share of this lucrative commerce, that application was made to the sovereign of Russia to open an intercourse by land with China, though the capitals of the two empires are upwards of 6000 miles distant from each other. This, however, was beyond the power of the Russian prince at that time; and the Venetians imagined that their power and wealth were fully established on the most permanent basis, when two events, altogether unforeseen and unexpected, gave it a mortal blow, from which it never has recovered, nor can recover itself. These were the discovery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> and that of the passage to the East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope. The former put Spain in possession of immense treasures; which being gradually diffused all over Europe, soon called forth the industry of other nations, and made them exert themselves in such a manner as of itself must have soon lessened the demand for Indian productions.\n\nThe discovery of the passage to India by the Cape of Good Hope, however, was the most effectual and speedy in humbling the Venetians. After a tedious course of voyages along the western coast of Africa, continued for near half a century, Vasco de Gama, an active and enterprising Portuguese officer, doubled the Cape of Good Hope, and, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COASTING\">coasting</a> along the eastern shore of the continent, sailed next across the Indian ocean, and landed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALICUT\">Calicut</a> on the coast of Malabar, on the 22d of May 1498, ten months and two days after leaving the port of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LISBON\">Lisbon</a>. On his arrival in India he was at first received with great kindness by the sovereign of that country, styled the Samar\u00edn; but afterwards, from what causes we cannot now well determine, the Indian prince suddenly changed his kindness into mortal enmity, and attempted to cut off Gama with his whole party. The Portuguese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a>, however, found means to escape every plot that was laid against him; and loaded his ships not only with the products of that part of the country, but with many of the valuable products of the more remote regions.\n\nOn his return to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, De Gama was received with all imaginable demonstrations of kindness. The Portuguese nation, nay all the nations in Europe, the guests in Venetians alone excepted, rejoiced at the discovery which had been made. The latter beheld in it the certain and unavoidable downfall of their own power, while the Portuguese, presuming upon their right of prior discovery, which they took care to have confirmed by a papal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a>, plumed themselves on the thoughts of having the whole Indian commerce centre in their nation. The expectations of the one, and the apprehensions of the other, seemed at first to be well-founded. A succession of gallant officers sent into the east from Portugal accomplished the greatest and most arduous undertakings. In 24 years after the voyage of De Gama, they had made themselves masters of many important places in India; and among the rest of the city of Malacca, where the great staple of trade throughout the whole East Indies was established. As this city stands nearly at an equal distance from the eastern and western extremities of all the countries comprehended under the name of Indies, it was frequented by the merchants of China, Japan, of all the kingdoms on the continent, the Moluccas and other islands in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, as well as by those of Malabar, Ceylon, Coromandel, and Bengal. Thus the Portuguese acquired a most extensive influence over the internal commerce of India; while, by the settlements they had formed at Goa and Diu, they were enabled to engraft the trade on the Malabar coast, and greatly to obstruct the long established intercourse of Egypt with India by the way of the Red sea. Their ships now frequented every port in the east where any valuable commodities were to be had, from the Cape of Good Hope to the river of Canton in China; and all along this immense extent of more than 4000 leagues, they had a chain of forts and factories established for the convenience of protecting their trade. They had likewise made themselves masters of several stations favourable to commerce along the southern coast of Africa, and in many islands lying between Madagascar and the Moluccas. In all places where they came, their arms had struck such terror, that they not only carried on their trade without any rival or control, but even prescribed\nto the natives the terms of their mutual intercourse; nay, sometimes they set what price they pleased upon the commodities they purchased, and thus were enabled to import into Europe the Indian commodities in greater abundance and at a lower rate than had ever been done before. Not satisfied with this, they formed a scheme of excluding all other nations from any share of the trade they enjoyed; and for that purpose determined to make themselves masters of such stations on the Red sea and Persian gulf as might put them in possession of the navigation of both these seas, and enable them not only to obstruct the ancient commerce between Egypt and India, but to command the mouths of the great rivers which we have formerly mentioned as the means of conveying the Indian goods through the internal parts of Asia. The conduct of these enterprises was committed to Alfonso <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBUQUERQUE\">Albuquerque</a>, the most distinguished officer at that time in the Portuguese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. By reason of the vast number of the enemies he had to contend with, however, and the scanty supplies which could be derived from Portugal, he could not fully accomplish what was expected from him. However, he took from the petty princes who were tributaries to the kings of Persia the small island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORMUS\">Ormus</a>, which commanded the mouth of the Persian gulf; and thus secured to Portugal the possession of that extensive trade with the east which the Persians had carried on for several centuries. On this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARREN_ISLAND\">barren island</a>, almost entirely covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, and so hot that the climate can scarcely be borne, destitute of a drop of fresh water, except what was brought from the continent, a city was erected by the Portuguese, which soon became one of the chief seats of opulence, splendour, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a>, in the eastern world. In the Red sea the Arabian princes made a much more formidable resistance; and this, together with the damage his fleet sustained in that sea, the navigation of which is always difficult and dangerous, obliged Albuquerque to retire without effecting anything of importance. Thus the ancient channel of conveyance still remained open to the Egyptians; but their commerce was greatly circumscribed and obstructed by the powerful interest of the Portuguese in every port to which they had been accustomed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a>.\n\nThe Venetians now began to feel those effects of De Gama's discovery which they had dreaded from the beginning. To preserve the remains of their commerce, they applied to the sultan of the Mameluks in Egypt, who was no less alarmed than themselves at the loss of such a capital branch of his revenue as he had been accustomed to derive from the India trade. By then this fierce and barbarous prince was easily persuaded to send a furious manifesto to Pope Julius II. and Emmanuel king of Portugal. In this, after stating his exclusive right to the Indian trade, he informed them, that if the Portuguese did not relinquish that new course of navigation by which they had penetrated into the Indian ocean, and cease from encroaching on that commerce which from time immemorial had been carried on between the east of Asia and his dominions, he would put to death all the Christians in Egypt, Syria, and Palestine, and demolish the holy sepulchre itself. To this threat, which some centuries before would have alarmed all Christendom, no regard was paid; so that the Venetians, as their last resource, were obliged to have recourse to a different expedient. This was to excite the sultan to fit out a fleet in the Red sea to attack the Portuguese, and drive them from all their settlements in the east; nay, in order to assist him in the enterprise, he was allowed to cut down their forests in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DALMATIA\">Dalmatia</a>, to supply the deficiency of Egypt in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> for ship-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>. The timber was conveyed from Dalmatia to Alexandria; and from thence, partly by water and partly by land, to Suez; where twelve men of war were built, on board which a body of Mameluks were ordered to serve under the command of an experienced officer. Thus the Portuguese were affrighted by a new enemy, far more formidable than any they had yet encountered; yet such was the valour and conduct of the admiral, that after several severe engagements, the fleet of the infidels was entirely ruined, and the Portuguese became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> masters of the Indian ocean.\n\nThis disaster was followed in no long time by the total overthrow of the dominion of the Mameluks in Egypt by Selim the Turkish sultan; who thus also became master of Syria and Palestine. As his interest was now the same with that of the Venetians, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> was quickly formed betwixt them for the ruin of the power of the Portuguese in India. With this view Selim confirmed to the Venetians the extensive commercial privileges they enjoyed under the government of the Mameluks; publishing at the same time an edict, by which he permitted the free entry of all the productions of the east imported directly from Alexandria into any part of his dominions, but imposed heavy taxes upon such as were imported from Lisbon. All this, however, was insufficient to counteract the great advantages which the Portuguese had obtained by the new passage to India, and the settlements they had established in that country; at the same time that the power of the Venetians being entirely broken by the league of Cambrai, they were no longer able to contribute any assistance. They were therefore reduced to the necessity of making an offer to the king of Portugal to purchase all the spices imported into Lisbon, over and above what might be requisite for the consumption of his own subjects. This offer being rejected, the Portuguese for some time remained uncontrollable masters of the Indian trade, and all Europe was supplied by them, excepting some very inconsiderable quantity which was imported by the Venetians through the usual channels.\n\nThe Portuguese continued to enjoy this valuable branch of commerce undisturbed almost for a whole Portuguese century; to which, however, they are indebted more for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> situation of the different European nations than to their own prowess. After the accession of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. to the throne of Spain, that kingdom was again either so much engaged in a multiplicity of operations, owing to the ambition of that monarch and his son Philip II., or so intent on prosecuting the discoveries and conquests in the new world, that no effort was made to interfere with the East Indian trade of the Portuguese, even though an opportunity offered by the discovery of a second passage by sea to the East Indies through the straits of Magellan. By the acquisition of the crown of Portugal in 1580, Spain, instead of becoming the rival, became the protector and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">guardian</a> of the Portuguese trade. The resources of France all\nthis time were so much exhausted by a continuance of long and defolating wars, that it could bestow neither much attention on objects at such a distance, nor engage in any expensive scheme. England was defoliated by the ruinous wars between the houses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANCASTER\">Lancaster</a>, and afterwards its enterprising spirit was restrained by the cautious and covetous Henry VII. His son Henry VIII., in the former part of his reign, by engaging in the continental quarrels of the European princes, and in the latter part by his quarrel with the pope and contests about religion, left no time for commercial schemes. It was not therefore till the reign of Queen Elizabeth that any attention was paid to the affairs of the east by that kingdom. The first who shook the power of the Portuguese in India were the Dutch; and in this they were gladly seconded by the natives, whom the Portuguese had most grievously oppressed. The English soon followed their example; and in a few years the Portuguese were expelled from their most valuable settlements, while the most lucrative branches of their trade have continued ever since in the hands of those two nations.\n\nIt is not to be supposed that the other European nations would sit still and quietly see these two engross the whole of this lucrative commerce without attempting to put in for a share. East India companies were therefore set up in different countries; but it was only between France and Britain that the great rivalry commenced; nor did this fully display itself till after the peace of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIX\">Aix</a>-la-Chapelle. Both nations had by this time made themselves masters of considerable settlements in India. The principal of those belonging to Britain were, 1. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURAT\">Surat</a>, situated on the western side of the peninsula within the Ganges, between the 21st and 22nd degrees of N. Lat. This peninsula comprehended the kingdoms of Malabar, Decan, Golconda, and Bijapur, with the principalities of Gingi, Tanjore, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MADURA\">Madura</a>; the western coast being distinguished by the name of Malabar, and the eastern by that of Coromandel. 2. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-BOMBAY\">Bombay</a>, a small island in the kingdom of Decan, about 45 leagues to the south of Surat. 3. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DABUL\">Dabul</a>, about 40 leagues farther to the south, in the province of Canan. 4. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARWAR\">Carwar</a>, in N. Lat. 15\u00b0, where there was a small fort and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTORY\">factory</a>. 5. Tillicherry, to which place the English trade was removed from Calicut, a large town 15 leagues to the southward. 6. Anjengo, between eight and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> degrees of latitude, the most southerly settlement on the western coast of the peninsula. 7. On the Coromandel coast they possessed Fort St David's, formerly called Tegapatam, situated in the kingdom of Gingi, in 11\u00b0 40' N. Lat. 8. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MADRAS\">Madras</a>, the principal settlement on this coast, between 13\u00b0 and 14\u00b0 N. Lat. not far from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMOND\">diamond</a> mines of Golconda. 9. Vizigapatam, farther to the north. 10. Balasore, in latitude 22\u00b0, a factory of small consequence. 11. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALCUTTA\">Calcutta</a>, the capital of all the British settlements in the East Indies. These were the principal places belonging to Britain which we shall have occasion to mention in the account of the contests which now took place; those of the French were chiefly Pondicherry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHANDERNAGORE\">Chandernagore</a>.\n\nThe war is said to have been first occasioned by the intrigues of the French commandant M. Duplex; who immediately after the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, began to sow dissension among the nabobs, who had by this time usurped the sovereignty of the country. Nizam Almuck, viceroy of Decan, and nabob of Arcot, had, as officer for the Mogul, nominated Anaverdy Khan to be governor of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CARNATIC\">Carnatic</a>, in the year 1745. On the death of Nizam, his second son Nazir-zing was appointed to succeed him in his viceroyalty, and his nomination was confirmed by the Mogul. He was opposed by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a> Muzapher-zing, who applied to Duplex for alliance. By him he was supplied with a body of Europeans and some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>; after which, being also joined by Chunda Saib, an active Indian prince, he took the field against Nazir-zing. The latter was supported by a body of British troops under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> Laurence; and the French, dreading the event of an engagement, retired in the night; so that their ally was obliged to throw himself on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLEMENCY\">clemency</a> of Nazir-zing. His life was spared, though he himself was detained as a state prisoner; but the traitor, forgetting the kindness shown him on this occasion, entered into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> against the life of Nazir-zing, and murdered him in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>; in which infamous transaction he was encouraged by Duplex and Chunda Saib, who had retired to Pondicherry. Immense riches were found in the tents of Nazir-zing, great part of which fell to the share of Duplex, whom Muzapher-zing now associated with himself in the government. By virtue of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a>, the Frenchman assumed the state and formalities of an eastern prince; and he and his colleague Muzapher-zing appointed Chunda Saib nabob of Arcot. In 1749, Anaverdy Khan had been defeated and killed by Muzapher-zing and Chunda Saib, assisted by the French; after which his son Mohammed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALI\">Ali</a> Khan had put himself under the protection of the English at Madras, and was confirmed by Nazir-zing as his father's successor in the nabobship or government of Arcot. This government therefore was disputed between Mohammed Ali Khan, appointed by the legal viceroy Nazir-zing, and supported by the English company, and Chunda Saib nominated by the usurper Muzapher-zing, and protected by Duplex, who commanded at Pondicherry. Muzapher-zing, however, did not long enjoy his ill-got authority; for in the year 1751, the nabobs who had been the means of raising him to the power he enjoyed, thinking themselves ill rewarded for their services, fell upon him suddenly, defeated his forces, and put him to death; proclaiming Salabat-zing next day viceroy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECCAN\">Deccan</a>. On the other hand, the Mogul appointed Gauzedy Khan, the elder brother of Salabat-zing, who was confirmed by Mohammed Ali Khan in the government of Arcot; but the affairs of the Mogul were at that time in such disorder, that he could not with an army support the nomination he had made. Chunda Saib in the mean time determined to recover by force the nabobship of Arcot, from which he had been deprived by the Mogul, who had placed Anaverdy Khan in his room. With this view he had recourse to Duplex at Pondicherry, who reinforced him with 2000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEPOYS\">Sepoys</a>, 60 Caffres, and 400 French; upon condition that if he succeeded, he should cede to the French the town of Velur in the neighbourhood of Pondicherry, with its dependencies, consisting of 45 villages. Thus reinforced, he defeated Anaverdy Khan, who lost his life in the engagement, reassumed the government of Arcot.\ncot, and punctually performed the engagements he had come under to his French allies.\n\nAll this time Mohammed Ali Khan had been supported by the English, to whom he fled after his father's death. By them he was supplied with a reinforcement of men, money, and ammunition, under the conduct of Major Laurence, a brave and experienced officer. By means of this supply he gained some advantages over the enemy; and repairing afterwards to Fort St David's, he obtained a further reinforcement. With all this assistance, however, he accomplished nothing of any moment; and the English auxiliaries having retired, he was defeated by his enemies. Thus he was obliged to enter into a more close alliance with the English, and cede to them some commercial points which had been long in dispute; after which, Captain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPE\">Cope</a> was despatched to put Trichinopoly in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, while Captain de Gingis, a Swiss officer, marched at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of 400 Europeans to the assistance of the nabob. On this occasion Mr Clive first appeared in a military capacity. He had been employed before as a writer, but appeared very little qualified for that or any other department in civil life. He now marched towards Arcot at the head of 210 Europeans and 500 Sepoys. In the first expedition he displayed at once the qualities of a great commander. His movements were conducted with such secrecy and dispatch, that he made himself master of the enemy's capital before they knew of his march; and gained the affections of the people by his generosity, in affording protection without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RANSOM\">ransom</a>. In a short time, however, he found himself invested in Fort St David's by Rajah Saib, son to Chunda Saib, an Indian chief, pretender to the nobbship of Arcot, at the head of a numerous army; the operations of the siege being conducted by European engineers. Thus, in spite of his utmost efforts, two practicable breaches were made, and a general assault given; but Mr Clive having got intelligence of the intended attack, defended himself with such vigour, that the assailants were everywhere repulsed with loss, and obliged to raise the siege with the greatest precipitation. Not contented with this advantage, Mr Clive, being reinforced by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> from Trichinopoly, marched in quest of the enemy; and having overtaken them in the plains of Arani, attacked and entirely defeated them on the 3rd of December 1751.\n\nThis victory was followed by the surrender of the forts of Timery, Conjaveram, and Arani; after which Mr Clive returned in triumph to Fort St David's. In the beginning of the year 1752 he marched towards Madras, where he was reinforced by a small body of troops from Bengal. Though the whole did not exceed 300 Europeans, with as many natives as were sufficient to give the appearance of an army, he boldly proceeded to a place called Kopperipauk, about 15 miles from Arcot, where the enemy lay to the number of 1500 Sepoys, 1700 horses, with 150 Europeans, and eight pieces of cannon. Victory was long doubtful, until Mr Clive having sent round a detachment to fall upon the rear of the enemy while the English attacked the entrenchments in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> with their bayonets, a general confusion ensued, the enemy were routed with considerable slaughter, and only saved from total destruction by the darkness of the night. The French to a man threw down their arms, and surrendered themselves prisoners of war; all the baggage and cannon falling at the same time into the hands of the victors.\n\nOn the return of Mr Clive to Fort St David's, he was superseded in the command by Major Laurence, who was detached with 400 Europeans, a few Mahratta soldiers, and a body of Sepoys, to cut off the enemy's retreat to Pondicherry. In this enterprise he was attended with his usual good success, took several forts, vanquished the French commander M. d'Anteuil, and obliged him with all his party to surrender prisoners of war.\n\nChunda Saib, in the mean time, lay encamped with an army of 30,000 men at Syringham, an island in the Chunda neighbourhood of Trichinopoly; but Major Laurence having found means to intercept his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, he was obliged to fly. Being obliged to pass through the camp of the Tanjore general, he obtained a pass for the purpose; but was nevertheless detained by the nabob; who was an ally of the English, and his head was struck off, in order to prevent any disputes that might arise concerning him.\n\nAfter the flight of Chunda Saib, his army was attacked and routed by Major Laurence; and the island of Syringham surrendered, with about 1000 French soldiers under the command of Mr Law, brother to him who schemed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MISSISSIPPI\">Mississippi</a> company. M. Dupleix, exceedingly mortified at this bad success, proclaimed pretended Rajah Saib, son to Chunda Saib, nabob of Arcot; and afterwards produced forged commissions from the Mogul, Great Mogul, appointing him governor of all the Car-and affects natic from the river Kritnah to the sea. The better the state of carry on this deception, a messenger pretended to come from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DELHI\">Delhi</a>, and was received with all the pomp of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> from the Great Mogul. Dupleix mounted on an elephant, and preceded by music and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a> women, after the oriental fashion, received his commission from the hands of this impostor; after which he affected the state of an eastern prince, kept his durbar or court, appeared fitting crofs-legged on a sopha, and received presents as sovereign of the country, from his own council as well as from the natives.\n\nThus the forces of the English and French East India companies were engaged in a course of hostilities at a time when no war existed between the two nations; and while they thus continued to make war upon each other, under the title of auxiliaries to the contending parties, Gauzy Khan took possession of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> appointed him by the Mogul; but had not been in possession of it above 14 days when he was poisoned by his own sister. His son Scab Abadin Khan was appointed to succeed him by the Mogul; but the latter being unable to give him proper assistance, Salabat zing remained without any rival, and made a present to the French commander of all the English possessions to the northward.\n\nThus concluded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> of 1752. Next year both parties received considerable reinforcements; the English, by the arrival of Admiral Watson with a squadron of ships of war, having on board a regiment commanded by Colonel Aldercroon; and the French by M. Gadeheu, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSARY\">commissary</a> and governor-general of all their settlements, on whose arrival M. Dupleix departed.\nparted for Europe. The new governor made the most friendly proposals; and desired a cessation of arms until the disputes could be adjusted in Europe. These proposals being readily listened to on the part of the English deputies were sent to Pondicherry, and a provisional treaty and truce were concluded, on condition that neither of the two companies should for the future interfere in any of the differences that might take place in the country. The other articles related to the places or settlements that should be retained or possessed by the respective companies, until fresh orders should arrive from the courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSAILLES\">Versailles</a>; and till then it was stipulated, that neither of the two nations should be allowed to procure any new grant or cession, or to build forts in defence of any new establishment; nor should they proceed to any cession, retrocession, or evacuation, of what they then possessed; but everything should remain on the same footing as formerly.\n\nThe treaty was published on the 11th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1755; at the end of which month Admiral Watson returned with his squadron from Bombay, and M. Gadeau returned to France in the beginning of February, leaving M. Leyrit his successor at Pondicherry. M. Buffy, with the Soubahdar Salabat-zing, commanded in the north; and M. de Sauffay was left to command the troops at Syringham. Matters, however, did not long continue in a state of tranquillity. Early in the year it appeared that the French were endeavouring to get possession of all the provinces of the Deccan. M. Buffy demanded the fortresses of Golconda from Salabat-zing; and M. Leyrit encouraged the phansier or governor who rented Velu to take up arms against the nabob. He even sent 300 French and as many Sepoys from Pondicherry to support this rebel, and oppose the English employed by the nabob to collect his revenues from the tributary princes. In this office they had been employed ever since the cessation of hostilities; one half of the revenue being paid to the nabob, and the other to the company, which now involved them in a kind of military expedition into the country of the Polygars, who had been previously summoned to send agents to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> accounts with the nabob. Four of them obeyed the summons; but one Lachenai refused, and it was therefore resolved to attack him. The country was very strong, being almost entirely fortified by nature or art; for it was surrounded by craggy hills detached from one another, and covered with bushes so as to be impassable for any but the natives, who had thrown up works from hill to hill. These works were indeed very rude, being formed of large stones laid upon one another without any cement, and flanked at proper distances by round earthen towers; before the wall was a deep and broad ditch, with a large hedge of bamboos in front, so thick that it could not be penetrated but by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HATCHET\">hatchet</a> or by the fire. This was forced, though not without some loss; after which another work of the same kind, but stronger, made its appearance; but this being likewise forced, Lachenai was obliged to submit and pay his tribute.\n\nThe English army now marched to Madura, a strong Indian town about 60 miles south of Trichinopoly. On their approach it submitted without any opposition, and the inhabitants seemed pleased with their change of government. Here a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPUTATION\">deputation</a> was received from a neighbouring Polygar, desiring an alliance, and as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of his sincerity making an offer of two settlements on the sea-coast of his country opposite to the settlements of Ceylon, which would greatly facilitate their future commerce with Tinivelly. Before this time by the English they could not have reached that city but by a circuitous march of 400 or 500 miles; but from the new settlements the distance to Tinivelly was no more than 30 miles, and reinforcements or supplies of any kind might be sent them from Madras or Fort St David in four or five days. This offer being accepted, Colonel Heron, the English commander, marched to attack the governor of Madura, who had fled to a place called Colegoddy; on the approach of the English he fled from this place also, leaving the greatest part of his troops to defend the place. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> was so rugged, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRIAGES\">carriages</a> of the cannon broke down; and as the troops were not furnished with scaling ladders, there seemed to be little hope of gaining the place, which was very strong. The colonel, however, determined to make an assault after the Indian manner, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> down the gates with bundles of straw; and to encourage his men in this new method of attack, he himself carried the first torch, being followed by Mohammed Issouf, who bore the second. The place was taken, plundered, not sparing even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a>; whereupon the inhabitants with the utmost abhorrence of the victors on account of their contempt of the Indian religion.\n\nAfter this exploit the army removed to Madura; and a garrison being left in the place, they proceeded to Tinivelly, which submitted without opposition, and owned the jurisdiction of the nabob; though some of the Polygars still evaded payment, and therefore hostilities were commenced against them.\n\nThe new expedition was marked by an act of the cruellest and most disgraceful cruelty at a fort named Nellecotah, 40 miles south of Tinivelly. It was fortified by a mud wall with round towers. The assault was made with great resolution, and the troops gained possession of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAPET\">parapet</a> without being repulsed. On this the garrison called out for quarter, but it was barbarously refused; a general massacre of men, women, and children ensued, only six persons out of 400 being suffered to escape with life.\n\nIt now appeared that the revenues collected in this expedition had not been sufficient to defray the expenses of the army; and a report being spread that Salabat-zing was advancing into the Carnatic at the head of his army, along with M. Buffy the French commander, to demand the Mogul's tribute, it was thought proper to recall Colonel Heron to Trichinopoly. Before this, he had been prevailed on by the Indian chief who accompanied him, to convey to him (Mazuphe Cawn) an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTITURE\">investiture</a> of the countries of Madura and Tinivelly for an annual rent of 187,500l. sterling. In his way he was likewise induced by the same chief to make an attempt on a strong fort named Nelyangaville, situated about 30 miles west of Tinivelly; and belonging to a refractory Polygar. This attempt, however, proving unsuccessful for want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTERING\">battering</a> cannon, the colonel returned with Mazuphe Cawn to Trichinopoly, where he arrived on the 22d of May 1755.\nThe last expedition of this commander was against a mud fort named Volfynatam, situated near the entrance of the woods belonging to the Colleries. These people were highly incensed at the plundering of Coilgoody, and particularly at the loss of their sacred images which the rapacious conquerors had carried off. In consequence of this they had already slaughtered a party of Sepoys whom the commanding officer at Madura had sent out to collect cattle. In their march the English army had to go through the pass of Natam, one of the most dangerous in the peninsula. It begins about 20 miles north of Trinchinopoli, and continues for six miles through a wood impassable to Europeans. The road which lay through it was barely sufficient to admit a single carriage at a time, at the same time that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> running along each side rendered it impossible to widen it. In most places the wood was quite contiguous to the road; and even where part of it had been felled, the eye could not penetrate above 20 yards.\u2014A detachment of Europeans, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIONEERS\">pioneers</a>, and sepoys, were sent to scour the woods before the main body ventured to pass through such a dangerous defile. The former met with no opposition, nor did any enemy appear against the latter for a long time. At last the march was stopped by one of the heaviest tumbrils sticking in a flough, out of which the oxen were not able to draw it. The officers of artillery suffered the troops marching before to proceed; and the officer who commanded in the rear of the battalion, not suspecting what had happened, continued his march, while most of the Sepoys who marched behind the rear division of the artillery were likewise suffered to pass the carriage in the flough, which choked up the road, and prevented the other tumbrils from moving forward, as well as three field pieces that formed the rear division of artillery, and the whole line of baggage that followed. In this divided and defenceless state the rear division of the baggage was attacked by the Indians; and the whole would certainly have been destroyed, had it not been for the courage and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> of Capt. Smith, who here commanded 40 Caffres and 200 Sepoys, with one six-pounder. Considerable damage, however, was done, and the Indians recovered their goods; which certainly were not worth the carrying off, being only made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, and of a diminutive size.\u2014Colonel Heron was tried by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-COURT_MARTIAL\">court-martial</a> for misconduct in this expedition; and being found guilty, was declared incapable of serving the company any longer: soon after which he returned to Europe, and died in Holland.\n\nIn the mean time Nanderauze, an Indian prince, formed a scheme to get possession of Trinchinopoli; and in order to compass his end with greater facility, communicated his design to M. de Sauffay the commander of the French troops. But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> having communicated intelligence to the English commander, the enterprise miscarried, and no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> betwixt these two rival nations as yet took place. It does not, however, appear that the English were in the least more solicitous to avoid hostilities than the French; for as soon as the company were informed of the acquisitions made by M. Bally in the Deccan, it was determined to encourage the Maharratas to attack Salabat-zing, in order to oblige him to dismiss the French auxiliaries from his service. In order to succeed in this enterprise, it was necessary to have a commander well experienced in the political systems of the country, as well as in military affairs; and for this purpose Mr Clive, now governor of Fort St David's, and invested with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> colonel's commission in the king's troops, offered his service. Three companies of the king's artillery, consisting of 100 men each, and 300 recruits, were sent from England on this expedition, who arrived at Bombay on the 27th of November; when on a sudden the presidency of Madras took it into consideration that this expedition could not be prosecuted without infringing the convention made with the French commander. \"This (says Mr Grofe) was acting with too much caution; for every thing relating to Salabat-zing and the French troops in his service seemed to have been studiously avoided. The court of directors had explained their whole plan to the presidency of Madras; but the ship which had the letters on board was unfortunately wrecked on a rock about 800 miles east of the Cape of Good Hope.\" The whole expedition was therefore laid aside, and the presidency of Madras directed all their force for the present against Tulagee Angria, who had long been a formidable enemy to the English commerce in those parts.\n\nThe dominions of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIRATE\">pirate</a> consisted of several islands near Bombay, and an extent of land on the continent about 180 miles in length, and from 30 to 60 in breadth. He possessed also several forts that had been taken from the Europeans by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>; the trade of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIRACY\">piracy</a> having, it seems, been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and indeed followed by most of the inhabitants of this coast. This was the more dangerous for trading vessels, as the land breezes do not here extend more than 40 miles out at sea, so that the ships are obliged to keep within sight of land; and there was not a creek, harbour, bay, or mouth of a river, along the whole coast of his dominions, where Angria had not erected fortifications, both as stations of discovery and places of refuge to his vessels. His fleet consisted of two kinds of vessels peculiar to this country, named grabs and gallivats. The former have generally two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASTS\">masts</a>, though some have three; the latter being about half the size of the former. They are built to draw little water, being very broad in proportion to their height; but narrowing from the middle to the end, where, instead of bows, they have a prow projecting like a Mediterranean galley, and covered with a strong deck <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with the main deck of the vessel, from which it is separated by a bulk-head that terminates the forecastle. As this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> subjects the grab to pitch violently when sailing against a head sea, the deck of the prow is not inclosed with sides as the rest of the vessel, but remains bare, that the water which comes upon it may pass off without interruption. Two pieces of cannon are mounted on the main deck under the forecastle, carrying balls of nine or twelve pounds, which point forwards through port-holes cut in the bulk-head, and fire over the prow; those of the broad-side are from six to nine pounds. The gallivats are large row-boats built like the grab, but smaller, the largest scarce exceeding 70 tons burden. They have two masts, the mizen slightly made, and the main-mast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> one large and triangular sail. In general they are covered with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAR\">spar</a> deck made of split...\nIndia. split bamboos, and carry only paterroes fixed on swivels in the gunnel of the vessel; but those of a larger size have a fixed deck, on which they mount six or eight pieces of cannon from two to four pounders. They have 40 or 50 stout oars, by which they may be moved at the rate of four miles an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>.\n\nAngria had commonly a fleet of eight or ten grabs, with 40 or 50 gallivats; which shipped their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CABLES\">cables</a> and put out to sea as soon as any vessel had the misfortune to come within sight of the port or bay where they lay. If the wind blew with any strength, their construction enabled them to swim very swiftly: but if it was calm, the gallivats rowed, and towed the grabs. As soon as they came within gunshot of the enemy, they assembled afters, and the grabs began the attack, firing at first only at the masts, and choosing the most advantageous positions for this purpose. If the vessel happened to be dismayed, they then drew nearer, and battered her on all sides till she struck; but if the defense was obstinate, they sent a number of gallivats with 200 or 300 soldiers in each, who boarded from all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> in hand.\n\nThis piratical state had for more than 50 years been formidable to all the nations in Europe; the English East India company had kept up a naval force for the protection of their trade at the rate of more than 50,000 annually, and after all found it scarcely adequate to the purpose. An unsuccessful attempt had been made in 1717, by the presidency of Bombay, against the forts Geriah and Kemnary, the principal strong holds of Angria.\u2014Another was made in 1722, under Admiral Matthews, against a fort named Coila-bley, about 15 leagues south of Bombay; but this also miscarried through the cowardice and treachery of the Portuguese, who pretended to assist the English. In 1735 Fort Geriah was unsuccessfully attacked by a Dutch armament of seven ships, two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOMB\">bomb</a>-ketches, and a numerous body of land forces; while all this time the piracies of Angria went on successfully, and not only trading vessels, but even men of war belonging to different nations, were captured by him, particularly in the month of February 1754, when three Dutch ships of 50, 36, and 18 guns, were burnt or taken by the piratical fleet.\n\nThis last success encouraged Angria so much, that he began to build vessels of a large size, boasting that he should be master of the Indian seas. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-MAHRATTAS\">Mahrattas</a> having implored the affiance of the English against this common enemy, Commodore William James was sent from Bombay on the 22d of March 1755, with the Protector of 44, the Swallow of 16 guns, and two bomb-ketches; but with instructions not to hazard the fleet by attacking any of the pirate's forts, only to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCKADE\">blockade</a> the harbours, while the Mahratta army carried on their operations by land. He had scarce begun his voyage when he fell in with a considerable fleet of the pirates, which he would certainly have taken, had it not been for the timidity and dilatory behaviour of his allies, who could not by any means be induced to follow him. They had, however, invested three of the forts, but after a very strange manner; for they durst not approach nearer than two miles, and even there entrenched themselves up to the chin, to be secure against the fire of the fort, which they returned only with one four pounder. The commodore, provoked at this pusillanimous behaviour, determined, for the honour of the British arms, to exceed the orders he had got. Running within 100 yards of a fort named Severndroog, he in a few hours ruined the walls, and set it on fire; a powder <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">magazine</a> also blowing up, the people, to the number of about 1000, abandoning the place, and embarking on board of eight large boats, attempted to make their escape to another fort named Goa, but were all intercepted and made prisoners by the English. The whole force of the attack being then turned upon Goa, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a> was soon hung out as a signal to surrender. The governor, however, did not think proper to wait the event of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a>, but without delay passed over to Severndroog, where he hoped to be able to maintain his ground notwithstanding the ruinous state of the fortifications. The fire was now renewed against this fortress; and the garrison having cut a passage through one of the gates with their axes, the garrison soon surrendered, at the same time that two other forts besieged by the Mahrattas hung out flags of truce and capitulated: and thus were four of Angria's forts, for so many years deemed impregnable, subdued in one day.\n\nThese successes were followed by the surrender of The pirate Bancoote, a strong fortified island, now called Fort Victoria, and which the English retained in possession; but the other forts were delivered up to the Mahrattas. On the arrival of Admiral Watson in the beginning of November 1755, it was determined to root out the pirate at once, by attacking Geriah the capital of his dominions; but it was so long since any Englishman had been this place, and the reports of its strength had been so much exaggerated, that it was thought proper to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECONNOITRE\">reconnoitre</a> it before any attack was made. This was done by Commodore James; who having reported that the fort, though strong, was far from being inaccessible or impregnable, it was resolved to prosecute the enterprise with the utmost expedition and vigour. It was therefore attacked by such a formidable fleet, that Angria, losing courage at their approach, fled to the Mahrattas, leaving Geriah to be defended by his brother. The fort, however, was soon obliged to surrender, with no more loss on the part of the English than 19 men killed and wounded: but it was afterwards acknowledged, that this success was owing principally to the terror of the garrison, occasioned by such a violent cannonade; for their fortifications appeared to have been proof against the utmost efforts of an enemy. All the ramparts of this fort were either cut out of the solid rock, or built of stones at least ten feet long laid edgeway.\n\nIn this fortress were found 200 pieces of brass cannon, with six brass mortars, and a great quantity of ammunition and military stores, besides money and effects to the value of 125,000l. Angria's fleet was entirely destroyed, one of the ships having been set on fire by a shell from the English fleet, and the flames having spread from thence to all the rest. About 2000 people were made prisoners; among whom were the wife, children, mother, brother, and admiral of the pirate: but they were treated with the greatest clemency; and his family, at their own request, continued under the protection of the English at Geriah. All\nthe other forts belonging to Angria soon submitted; so that his power on the coast of Malabar was entirely annihilated.\n\nWhile the affairs of the English went on thus successfully, M. Buffly had been constantly employed near the person of Salabat-zing, whom he had served in much the same manner that the English had Mohammed Ali Cawm. As he made use of his influence with that prince, however, to enlarge the possessions of the French, and was continually making exorbitant demands upon him, the prime minister of Salabat-zing at length represented to him the danger and shame of allowing a small body of foreigners thus to give law to a great prince; and having formed a powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> against the French, at last obtained an order for their dismission. M. Buffly took his leave without any marks of disgust, having under his command about 600 Europeans, with 3000 Sepoys, and a fine train of artillery. His enemies, however, had no mind to allow him to depart in safety; and therefore sent orders to all the polygars to oppose their passage, feeding 6000 Mahattas after them to harass them on their march.\n\nNotwithstanding this opposition, M. Buffly reached <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HYDERABAD\">Hyderabad</a> with very little loss. Here he took possession of a garden formerly belonging to the kings of Golconda, where he resolved to keep his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> until succours should arrive from Pondicherry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-MASULIPATAM\">Masulipatam</a>. Here Salabat-zing proposed to attack him; and the better to attain his purpose, applied to the English presidency at Madras for a body of troops to assist him in this service. Nothing could be more agreeable to those who had the power at that place than such an invitation; and a detachment of 400 Europeans and 1500 Sepoys was on the point of being ordered to the assistance of Salabat-zing, when express from Bengal informed them of the greatest danger that had ever threatened the British settlements in India.\n\nThis danger arose from the displeasure of Surajah Dowla the new nabob of Bengal. His grandfather Aliverdy Khan having died in April or May 1756, Surajah succeeded to the nabobship of Bengal, Bihar, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORISSA\">Orissa</a>. He was congratulated on his accession by Mr Drake the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> at Calcutta, who requested his favour and protection in behalf of his countrymen. This was readily promised, even to a greater degree than what had been shown by his grandfather; but in a short time his resentment was incurred by the imprisonment, as it is said, of Omichund, an eminent Gentoo merchant, who had lived several years under the protection of the English government at Calcutta. Of this, however, Surajah Dowla did not directly complain; but founded his pretence of war upon the conduct of the English in repairing the fortifications of Calcutta; which indeed was absolutely necessary on account of the great likelihood of a war with the French. On this account, however, the nabob signified his displeasure, and threatened an attack if the works were not instantly demolished. With this requisition the president and council pretended to comply; but nevertheless went on with their works, applying first to the French and then to the Dutch for assistance; but as neither of these nations thought proper to interfere, the English were obliged to stand alone in the quarrel.\n\nSurajah Dowla took the field on the 27th of May 1756, with an army of 40,000 foot, 30,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, on against and 400 elephants; and on the 24th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> detached Calcutta, 20,000 men to invest the English fort at Cossimbazar, a large town situated on an island formed by the western branch of the Ganges. The fort was regularly built, with 60 cannon, and defended by 300 men, but principally Sepoys. The nabob pretending a desire to treat, Mr Watts the chief of the factory, was persuaded to put himself in his power; which he had no sooner done, than he was made a close prisoner, along with Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTON\">Batton</a> a surgeon who accompanied him. The two prisoners were treated with great indignity, and threatened with death; but two of the council who had been sent for by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>'s command were sent back again, with orders to persuade the people of the factory to surrender it at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a>. This proposal met with great opposition in the council; but was at last complied with, though very little to the advantage of the prisoners; for they were not only deprived of every thing they possessed, but stripped almost naked, and sent to Huegley, where they were closely confined.\n\nThe nabob, encouraged by this success, marched directly to Calcutta, which he invested on the 15th. Though he now threatened to drive the English entirely out of his dominions, yet he proposed an accommodation with Mr Drake, provided he would pay him his duty upon the trade for 15 years, defray the expenses of his army, and deliver up the Indian merchants who were in the fort. This being refused, a siege commenced, and the place was taken in three days, through the treachery of the Dutch guard of prisoners who had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of a gate. The nabob promised strictness on the word of a folder, that no harm should be done to the English; nevertheless they were shut up in a prison for a night for want of air but 22. It was not, however, supposed that any massacre at this time was intended; and it is probable that he only gave orders to confine the prisoners closely for the night, without taking into consideration whether the place they were confined in was large or small.\n\nThe news of this disaster put an end to the expedition projected against M. Buffly; and Colonel Clive was instantly dispatched to Bengal with 400 Euro-Expeditors and 1000 Sepoys, on board of the fleet commanded by Admiral Watson. They did not arrive till the 15th of December, at a village called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FULTA\">Fulta</a>, situated on a branch of the Ganges, where the inhabitants of Calcutta had taken refuge after their misfortune, nabob. Their first operations were against the forts Burbudia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TANNA\">Tanna</a>, Fort-William, and Calcutta now in the hands of the enemy. All these were reduced almost as soon as they could approach them. An expedition was then proposed against Huegley, a large town about 60 miles above Calcutta, and the place of rendezvous for all nations who traded to Bengal; its warehouses and shops being always filled with the richest merchandise of the country. This was likewise easily reduced; and the city was destroyed, with the granaries and storehouses of salt located on each side the river; which proved...\nproved very detrimental to the nabob, as depriving him of the means of subsistence for his army.\n\nSurajah Dowlah, enraged at this success of the English, now seemed determined to crush them at once by a general engagement. From this, however, he was intimidated by a successful attack on his camp, which soon induced him to conclude a treaty. This took place on the 9th of February 1757, on the following conditions. 1. That the privileges and immunities granted to the English by the king (Mogul) should not be disputed. 2. That all goods with English orders should pass, by land or water, free of any tax, fee, or imposition. 3. All the Company's factories which had been seized by the nabob should be restored; and the goods, money, and effects, which had been plundered, should be accounted for. 4. That the English should have permission to fortify Calcutta as they thought proper. 5. They should also have liberty to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a> their own imports of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BULLION\">bullion</a> and gold.\n\nAs certain intelligence was now received of a war between France and England, the first object that naturally occurred, after the conclusion of this treaty, was the reduction of the French power in the east; in consequence of which it was represented to Admiral Watson, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> of the council of Bengal, that this was the only opportunity he perhaps might ever have of acting offensively against them. An attack would therefore immediately have been made on Chandernagore, had not a deputation arrived from that place, requesting a neutrality in this part of the world until matters should be finally decided in Europe. The negociation, however, was broken off on a suggestion that the government of Chandernagore, being subordinate to that of Pondicherry, could not render any transaction of this kind valid. It remained therefore only to obtain the consent of the nabob to make an attack upon this place: but this seemed not likely to be got; for in ten days after the conclusion of the treaty, he sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to the admiral, complaining of his intention. \"It appears (says he) that you have a design to besiege the French factory near Hooghly, and to commence hostilities against that nation. This is contrary to all rule and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, that you should bring your animosities and differences into my country; for it has never been known, since the days of Timur, that the Europeans made war upon one another in the king's dominions. If you are determined to besiege the French factories, I shall be necessitated, in honour and duty to my king, to assist them with my troops. You are certainly bound to abide by your part of the treaty strictly, and never to attempt or be the occasion of any troubles or disturbances in future within the provinces under my jurisdiction, &c.\" To this Admiral Watson replied, that \"he was ready to desist from his intended enterprize if the French would agree to a solid treaty of neutrality; or if the nabob, as joubahadar (viceroy) of Bengal, would, under his hand, guarantee this treaty, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> to protect the English from any attempts made by the French against their settlements in his absence.\" This letter did not prove satisfactory; the nabob having been informed by the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>, that the English designed to turn their arms against him as soon as they had made themselves masters of Chandernagore. This was firmly denied by the admiral; and a number of letters passed between him and the nabob, in one of which the latter made use of the following expressions, which were supposed to imply a tacit consent that Chandernagore should be attacked. \"My forbidding war on my borders was because the French were my tenants, and upon this affair desired my protection: on this I wrote to you to make peace, and no intention had I of favouring or afflicting them. You have understanding and generosity: if your enemy with an upright heart claims your protection, you will give him his life; but then you must be well satisfied of the innocence of his intentions; if not, then whatsoever you think right, that do.\"\n\nHaving thus, as was supposed, obtained the consent of the nabob, an attack was made on Chandernagore, which was soon reduced to the necessity of capitulation; though the French made a gallant defence, and, as Mr Ives informs us, \"stood to their guns as long as they had any to fire.\" A messenger was dispatched with the news to Surajah Dowlah three days after the place had surrendered, intimating also that the French had been pursued some way up the country. This intelligence, however, seemed to be by no means agreeable, as he could scarce be induced to return an answer. At last he pretended displeasure on account of the design of the English to infringe the treaties, and complained that they had ravaged some parts of his dominions. This was denied on the part of the admiral; who in his turn accused the nabob of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> of promise, and neglect in fulfilling his engagements. The last letter sent by Admiral Watson to the nabob, of date 19th April 1757, concludes in this manner. \"Let me again repeat to you, that I have no other views than that of peace. The gathering together of riches is what I desire; and I call on God, who sees and knows the spring of all our actions, and to whom you and I must one day answer, to witness the truth of what I now write: therefore, if you would have me believe that you wish for peace as much as I do, no longer let it be the subject of our correspondence for me to ask the fulfillment of our treaty, and you to promise and not perform it; but immediately fulfill all your engagements: thus let peace flourish and spread throughout all your country, and make your people happy in the re-establishment of their trade, which has suffered by a ruinous and destructive war.\" From this time both parties made preparations for war. The nabob returned no answer till the 13th of June, when he sent the following declaration of war. \"According to my promises, and the agreement made between us, I have duly rendered every thing to Mr Watts, except a very small remainder: Notwithstanding this, Mr Watts, and the rest of the council of the factory at Calicumbazar, under the pretence of going to take the air in their gardens, fled away in the night. This is an evident mark of deceit, and of an intention to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the treaty. I am convinced it could not have happened without your knowledge, nor without your advice. I all along expected something of this kind, and for that reason I would not recall my forces from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASSEY\">Plassey</a>, expecting some treachery. I praise God, that the breach of the treaty has not been on my part,\" &c.\n\nNothing less was now resolved on in the English council at Calcutta than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> of the nabob; on which\nwhich at this time appeared practicable, by supporting the pretensions of Meer Jaffier Ali Cawn, who had with other noblemen entered into a conspiracy against him. Meer Jaffier had married the sister of Aliverdy Cawn, the predecessor of Surajah Dowla; and was now supported in his pretensions by the general of the horse, and by Jugget Seet the nabob's banker, who was reckoned the richest merchant in all India. By these three leading men the design was communicated to Mr Watts the English resident at the nabob's court, and by him to Colonel Clive and the secret committee at Calcutta. The management of the affair being left to Mr Watts and Mr Clive, it was thought proper to communicate the secret to Omichund, through whom the necessary correspondence might be carried on with Meer Jaffier. This agent proved so avaricious, that it was resolved to serve him in his own way; and by a piece of treachery to him also, to gain their point with both parties. Two treaties were therefore written out; in one of which it was promised to comply with Omichund's demand, but in the other his name was not even mentioned; and both these treaties were signed by all the principal persons concerned, Admiral Watson alone excepted, whom no political motives could influence to sign an agreement which he did not mean to keep. These treaties, the same in every respect excepting as to Omichund's affair, were to the following purpose: 1. All the effects and factories belonging to the province of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, shall remain in possession of the English, nor should any more French ever be allowed to settle in these provinces. 2. In consideration of the losses sustained by the English company by the capture and plunder of Calcutta, he agreed to pay one crore of rupees, or 1,250,000 sterling. 3. For the effects plundered from the English at Calcutta, he engaged to pay 50 lacks of rupees, or 625,000. 4. For the effects plundered from the Gentooos, Moors, and others inhabitants of Calcutta, 20 lacks, or 250,000. 5. For the effects plundered from the American merchants, inhabitants of Calcutta, seven lacks, or 87,500. 6. The distribution of all these sums to be left to Admiral Watson, Colonel Clive, Roger Drake, William Watts, James Kilpatrick, and Richard Becher, Esquires, to be disposed of by them to whom they think proper.\n\nAll things being now in readiness, Colonel Clive began his march against Surajah Dowla on the 13th of June, the very day on which Surajah Dowla sent off his last letter for Admiral Watson. Before any act of hostility was committed, however, Colonel Clive wrote the nabob a letter, upbraiding him with his conduct, and telling him at last, that \"the rains being so near, and it requiring many days to receive an answer, he had found it necessary to wait upon him immediately.\" This was followed by the decisive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> at Plafley; in which the treachery of Meer Jaffier, who commanded part of the nabob's troops, and stood <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEUTER\">neuter</a> during the engagement, undoubtedly rendered the victory more easily acquired than it would otherwise have been. The unfortunate nabob fled to his capital with a few that continued faithful to him. He reached the city in a few hours; but not thinking himself safe there, left it the following evening, disguised like a Faquir, with only two attendants. By these he appears to have been abandoned and even robbed; for on the 3rd of July he was found wandering forlorn and almost naked on the road to Patna. Next day he was brought back to Muxadabad; and a few hours after privately beheaded by Meer Jaffier's eldest son, to whose care he had been committed. The usurper took possession of the capital in triumph; and on the 29th of June Colonel Clive went to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, and in presence of the rajas and grandees of the court solemnly handed him to the musnud or carpet and throne of state, where he was installed unanimously saluted fouhabdar or nabob, and received the submission of all present.\n\nWhile these transactions were going forward with Colonel the nabob, the utmost efforts were used to expel the French entirely from Bengal. By the articles of capitulation at Chandernagore, the whole of that garrison were to continue prisoners of war; but about the time of signing the treaty, Mr Law with a small body of troops made his escape out of Calcutta, and bent his march towards Patna. There he had been protected by the late nabob; and on the commencement of fresh hostilities, had collected about 200 French, the only remains of that nation in Bengal, to make an attempt to succour him. With these he was within two hours' march of Surajah Dowla's camp when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of Plafley was fought; on hearing the news of which he stopped; but afterwards being informed of the nabob's escape, he marched again to his assistance, and was within a few hours of joining him when he was taken. Three days after he was pursued by Major Eyre Coote at the head of 223 Europeans, three companies of Sepoys, 50 Lascars or Indian sailors, and 10 Marmitty men or pioneers to clear the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>, together with two pieces of cannon, six pounders. On this expedition the major exerted his utmost diligence to overtake his antagonist, and spent a very considerable space of time in the pursuit; for though he set out on the 6th of July, he did not return to Muxadabad till the 1st of September. Mr Law, however, had the good fortune to escape; but though the major did not succeed in what was proposed as the principal end of his expedition, he was, nevertheless, says Mr Ives, of considerable service to the company and to his country in general. He had obliged Ramnarain, the most powerful rajah in the country, to swear allegiance to Meer Jaffier; he laid open the interior state of the northern provinces; and, in conjunction with Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JOHNSTONE\">Johnstone</a>, gave the company some insight into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALTPETRE\">saltpetre</a> butinels, from which such advantages have since been derived to the public.\n\nBefore the return of Major Coote, Admiral Pocock Death had succeeded to the command of the fleet, in consequence of the decease of Admiral Watson, who died on Watson, the 16th of August. The joy of the British was considerably damped by the loss of this gentleman, who had gained a great and deserved reputation both in the military line and every other. News were also received, that the French had been very successful on the coast of Coromandel. Salabat-zing, as has already been observed, had applied to the English for assistance against the French; but as they were prevented from performing their agreement by the disaster at Calcutta, he found himself under a necessity of accommodating the differences with his former friends, and to admit them again into his service. M. Buffy was now reinforced by the troops under Mr Law; who\nhad collected as many Europeans in his journey as made up 500 with those he had at first. With these he undertook to reduce the English factories of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INGERAM\">Ingeram</a>, Bandermalanka, and Vizagapatnam. As none of the two former places were in any state of defence, the greatest part of the company's effects were put on shipboard on the first alarm; but as Vizagapatnam was garrisoned by 140 Europeans and 420 Sepoys, it was supposed that it would make some defense. If any was made, however, it appears to have been very trifling; and by the conquest of this the French became masters of all the coasts from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GANJAM\">Ganjam</a> to Maifilipatnam. In the southern provinces the like bad success attended the British cause. The rebel Polygars having united their forces against Mazuphe Cawn, obtained a complete victory over him; after which the English Sepoys, being prevailed upon to quit Madura, the conqueror seized upon that city for himself.\n\nIn the beginning of 1758, the French made an attempt on Trichinopoly. The command was given to M. d'Auteuil, who invested the place with 900 men in battalions, with 4000 Sepoys, 100 hussars, and a great body of Indian horse. Trichinopoly was then in no condition to withstand such a formidable power, as most of the garrison had gone to besiege Madura under Captain Caillaud; but this commander having received intelligence of the danger, marched back with all his forces, and entered the town by a difficult road which the enemy had neglected to guard; and the French general, disconcerted by this successful manoeuvre, drew off his forces, and returned to Pondicherry.\n\nThis fortunate transaction was succeeded by the siege of Madura, in which the English were so vigorously repulsed, that Captain Caillaud was obliged to turn the siege into a blockade in order to reduce the place by famine. But before any progress could be made in this way, Mazuphe Cawn was prevailed upon to give it up for the sum of 170,000 rupees. A large garrison of Sepoys was again put into the place, and Captain Caillaud returned to Trichinopoly.\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt was now made by Colonel Ford on Nellore, a large town surrounded by a thick mud wall, with a dry ditch on all sides but one, where there is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of a river always dry but in the rainy season. The enterprise is said to have proved unsuccessful through the unheard-of cowardice of a body of Sepoys, who having sheltered themselves in a ditch, absolutely refused to stir a step farther, and rather chose to allow the rest of the army to march over them to the assault, than to expose themselves to danger. Several other enterprises of no great moment were undertaken; but the event was on the whole unfavourable to the English, whose force by the end of the campaign was reduced to 1718 men, while that of the French amounted to 3400 Europeans, of whom 1000 were sent to Pondicherry.\n\nBoth parties now received considerable reinforcements from Europe; Admiral Pocock being joined on the 24th of March by Commodore Stevens with a squadron of five men of war, and the French by nine men of war and two frigates, having on board General Lally with a large body of troops. The English admiral no sooner found himself in a condition to cope with the enemy than he went in quest of them; and an engagement took place, in which the French were defeated with the loss of 600 killed, and a great many wounded, while the English had only 29 killed and 89 wounded. The former returned to Pondicherry, where they landed their men, money, and troops. After the battle three of the British captains were tried for misbehaviour, and two of them dismissed from the command of their ships. As soon as his vessels were refitted, the admiral sailed again in quest of the enemy, but could not bring them to an action before the 3rd of August, when the French dictated a second time, with the loss of 251 killed, and 602 wounded.\n\nNotwithstanding this success at sea, the English were greatly deficient in land forces; the re-establishment of their affairs in Bengal having almost entirely drained the settlements on the coast of Coromandel of the troops necessary for their defense. The consequence of this was the loss of Fort St David, which General Lally retaken, destroyed the fortifications, demolished also the adjacent villages, and ravaging the country in such a manner as filled the natives with indignation, and in the end proved very prejudicial to his affairs. He proved successful, however, in the reduction of Devicotah, but was obliged to retreat with loss from before Tanjore, his army being greatly distressed for want of provisions; and money in particular being so deficient, that on the 7th of August the French seized and carried into Pondicherry a large Dutch ship from Batavia bound to Negapatnam, and took out of her about 5000l. in specie.\n\nFrom this time the affairs of the French daily declined. On their retreat from Tanjore, they abandoned the island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERINGHAM\">Seringham</a>; however, they took Tripaf-fore, but were defeated in their designs on the important post of Chinglapet, situated about 45 miles southeast of Madras. Their next enterprises on Fort St George and Madras were equally unsuccessful. The latter was besieged from the 12th of December 1758 to the 17th of February 1759, when they were obliged to abandon it with great loss; which disaster greatly contributed to depress their spirits, and abate those sanguine hopes they had entertained of becoming masters in this part of the world.\n\nThe remainder of the year 1759 proved entirely favourable to the British arms. M. d'Ache the French admiral, who had been very roughly handled by Admiral Pocock on the 3rd of August 1758, having refitted his fleet, and being reinforced by three men of war at the islands of Mauritius and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOURBON\">Bourbon</a>, now ventured once more to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> his antagonist, who on his part did not at all decline the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a>. A third battle ensued French defeated a third time withstanding their superiority, both in number of ships and weight of metal, were obliged to retreat with considerable loss; having 1500 men killed and wounded, while those on board the English fleet did not exceed 569. By the 17th of October the English fleet was completely refitted; and Admiral Pocock having been joined by a reinforcement of four men of war, soon after returned to England.\n\nAll this time the unfortunate General Lally had been employed in unsuccessful endeavours to retrieve the affairs of his countrymen; still, however, he attempted to act on the offensive; but his fate was at last decided by...\nby laying siege to Wandewaith, which had lately been taken by Colonel Coote. The advantage in numbers was entirely in favour of the French general; the English army consisting only of 1700 Europeans, including artillery and cavalry, while the French amounted to 2200 Europeans. The auxiliaries on the English side were 3000 black troops, while those of the French amounted to 10,000 black troops and 300 Caffres; nor was the odds less in proportion in the artillery, the English bringing into the field only 14 pieces of cannon and one howitzer, while the French had 25 pieces in the field, and five on their batteries against the fort. The battle began about 11 o'clock on the 22nd of January 1763, and in three hours the whole French army gave way and fled towards their camp, but quitted it on finding themselves pursued by the English, who took all their cannon except three small pieces. They collected themselves under the walls of Chelatput, about 18 miles from the field of battle, and soon after retired to Pondicherry. Colonel Coote caused the country to be waited to the very gates of this fortress, by way of retaliation for what the French had done in the neighbourhood of Madras. He then set about the siege of Chelatput, which surrendered in one day; a considerable detachment of the enemy was intercepted by Captain Smith; the fort of Timmery was reduced by Major Monson, and the city of Arcot by Captain Wood. This last conquest enabled the English to restore the nabob to his dominions, of which he had been deprived by the French; and it greatly weakened both the French force and interest in India.\n\nM. Lally, in the mean time, had recalled his forces from Seringham, by which means he augmented his army with 500 Europeans. All these were now shut up in Pondicherry, which was become the last hope of the French in India. To complete their misfortunes, Admiral Cornwall arrived at Madras with six men of war; and as the French had now no fleet in these parts, the admiral readily engaged to cooperate with the land forces. The consequence was the reduction of Calcutta, Chellambrum, and Verdichellum, by a strong detachment under Major Monson; while Colonel Coote reduced Permooril, Alampervra, and Waldour. Thus he was at last enabled to lay siege to Pondicherry itself. Previous to this, however, it had been blockaded by sea and land, which reduced the place to great straits for want of provisions, and induced a mutinous disposition among the garrison. The batteries were not opened till the beginning of December 1763; and the place capitulated on the 15th of January 1764, by which an end was put to the power of the French in this part of the world.\n\nWhile the English were thus employed in effectually reducing the power of their rivals in every part of India, Meer Jaffer, the nabob of Bengal, who had been raised to that dignity by the ruin of Surajah Dowlah, found himself in a very disagreeable situation. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> of the late nabob had been valued at no less than 64 crore of rupees, about 80 millions sterling; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of such a vast sum, Meer Jaffer had no doubt thoughtlessly submitted to the enormous exactions of the English already mentioned. On his accession to the government, however, the treasure of which he became master fell so much short of expectation, that he could by no means fulfil his engagements to them and supply the expenses of government at the same time. This soon reduced him to the necessity of mortgaging his revenues to supply present demands; and by this ruinous expedient he put it out of his own power ever to extricate himself. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILEMMA\">dilemma</a> his grandees became factious and discontented, his army mutinous for want of pay, and he rendered himself odious to his subjects by the exactions he was necessitated to lay upon them. The English, who for their own interest had raised him to the supreme power, no sooner found that he was incapable of answering their purpose any longer, than they began to scheme against him; and in order to have some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of reason for pulling down the man whom they had just set up, they either invented or gave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> to the most malicious calumnies against him. The charges brought against him were shortly these: 1. That soon after his advancement he had resolved to reduce that power which raised him to the dignity. 2. That, to effect this, he affianced or banished every person of importance whom he suspected of being in the English interest. 3. That he negotiated with the Dutch to introduce an armament for the expulsion of the English. 4. That he had in different instances been guilty of the deepest deceit and treachery towards the English, his best benefactors and allies. 5. That at three different periods the English commander in chief had been basely deserted both by the nabob and his son, when he and the troops were hazarding their lives for them. 6. That he meditated a secret and separate treaty with Shah-Zadah, the Mogul's son, and had intended to betray the English to him. 7. That the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of his government had been one uninterrupted chain of cruelty, tyranny, and oppression. 8. That he meditated, and was near carrying into execution, an infamous secret treaty with the Mahrattas, which would have proved the total destruction of the country if it had taken place. 9. That he threw every possible obstruction in the way of the collection of the English tontas or assignments upon lands. 10. That he encouraged the obstructions given to the free currency of the English sicca; by which the company suffered heavy losses. 11. That by his cruelties he had rendered it scandalous for the English to support his government any longer; and, 12. That by his misconduct, he had brought the affairs of the company as well as his own into the utmost danger of ruin.\n\nIn what manner these charges were supported it is difficult to know, nor perhaps were the accusers very solicitous about the strength of their evidence. This seems the more probable, as the accusations of cruelty were, in some instances at least, void of foundation. On the 13th of June 1763, Mr Holwel wrote from Calcutta to Mr Warren <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HASTINGS\">Hastings</a>, that by express he had received intelligence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> of the princesses of Aliverdy Khan and Shah Amet, in a most inhuman manner, by Meer Jaffer's orders. He was said to have sent a jemmatdar with 100 horse to Jefferaut Khan to carry this bloody scheme into execution; with separate orders to the jemmatdar to put an end to their lives. He refused acting any part in the tragedy, and left it to the other; who carried them out by night in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a>, tied weights to their legs, and threw them overboard. They struggled for some time, and held by the gunwale of the boat; but by frokes on their heads,\nand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> off their hands, they were at last forced off and drowned. In like manner we were told that many others of Surajah Dowlas relations had perished; yet when it was thought proper to replace Meer Jaffier in 1761, all these dead persons were found alive excepting two. It must also be remembered, in behalf of the unfortunate nabob, that besides the sums exacted from him by the English at his accession, he had ceded to them a large extent of territory, and granted them so many immunities in trade, that he had in a manner deprived himself of all his resources; and it was impossible for him to defray the necessary expenses without either extorting money from his subjects, or infringing the privileges he had so inconsiderately granted.\n\nThere were two accounts of this remarkable revolution published, materially differing from one another. The first was given in a memorial drawn up at a consultation at Fort William, November 10, 1760, where were present Henry Vanfittart, Esq., president; William Ellis, B. Sumner, William McGuire, Henry Verelst, and Henry Smyth, Esqs. \"We resolved (says the governor) to give the nabob the next day (October 19, 1760) to reflect upon the letters I had delivered him, proposing some measures for regulating these abuses. I heard nothing from him all that day; but found by my intelligence that he had been in council at his old advisers, whose advice, I was sure, would be contrary to the welfare of the country and of the company. I therefore determined to act immediately on the nabob's fear. There could not be a better opportunity than the night of the 19th offered, it being the conclusion of the Gentoo feast, when all the principal people of that caste would be pretty well fatigued with their ceremonies. Accordingly I agreed with Colonel Caillaud, that he should cross the river with the detachment between three and four in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>; and having joined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COFFIN\">Coffin</a> Ali Khan and his people, march to the nabob's palace, and surround it just at daybreak. Being extremely delirious to prevent disturbance or bloodshed, I wrote a letter to the nabob, telling him, I had been waiting all the day in expectation that he would have settled the urgent affairs upon which I conferred with him yesterday; but his having favoured me with no answer, plainly showed that all I could represent to him for the good of his country would have no effect, as long as his evil counsellors were about his person, who would in the end deprive him of his government and ruin the company's affairs. For this reason I had sent Colonel Caillaud with forces to wait upon him, and to expel those bad counsellors, and place his affairs in a proper state, and I would shortly follow. This letter I gave to the colonel, to send to the nabob at such a time as he should think most expedient. Measures were taken at the same time for seizing his three unworthy ministers, and to place Coffin Ali Khan in the full management of all the affairs, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a> and successor to the nabob.\n\n\"The necessary preparations being made with all care and secrecy possible, the colonel embarked with the troops, joined Coffin Ali Khan without the least alarm, and marched into the court-yard of the palace just at the proper instant. The gates of the inner court being shut, the colonel formed his men without, and sent the letter to the nabob, who was at first in a great rage, and long threatened that he would make what resistance he could, and take his fate. The colonel forbore all hostilities, and several messengers talked between him and the nabob. The affair remained in this doubtful state for two hours, when the nabob, finding his periliting was to no purpose, sent a messenger to Coffin Ali Khan, informing him that he was ready to send the seals and all the ensigns of dignity, provided he would agree to take the whole charge of the government upon him, to discharge all arrears due to the troops, to pay the usual revenue to the king, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> his life and honour, and to give him an allowance sufficient for his maintenance. All these conditions being agreed to, Coffin Ali was proclaimed; and the old nabob came out to the colonel, declaring that he depended on him for his life. The troops then took possession of all the gates; and the old nabob was told, that not only his person was safe, but his government too if he pleased, of which it was never intended to deprive him. He answered, that he had now no more business in the city, where he should be in continual danger from Coffin Ali Khan; and if he was permitted to go and live at Calcutta, he should be contented. Coffin Ali Khan was now placed on the mainmast, and the people in general seemed much pleased with the revolution. The old nabob did not think himself safe even for one night in the city. Coffin Ali Khan supplied him with boats, and permitted him to take away about 60 of his family, with a reasonable quantity of jewels. He begged that he might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> in his boat that night; which he accordingly did, and on the morning of the 22nd of October he set out for Calcutta, and arrived there on the 29th. He was met by a deputation from the council, and treated with every mark of respect due to his former dignity.\"\n\nThe second account of this affair was not published till the 11th of March 1762, and was signed Eyre Coote, P. Amyatt, John Cavac, W. Ellis, S. Batton, H. Verelst. \"In September 1760 (say they), when there was not the least appearance of a rupture or disgust between us and the nabob, but friendship and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> subsisting, Meer Coffin Khan his son-in-law came down to Calcutta, and having stayed a short time returned to Moorshedabad. A few days after, Mr Vanfittart went up to that city on the pretence of a visit to the nabob Meer Jaffier. Colonel Caillaud, with 200 Europeans and some Sepoys, attended him; who, it was pretended, were going to join the army at Patna. When Mr Vanfittart arrived at Moradabagh, the nabob paid him two visits; at the last of which Mr Vanfittart gave him three letters, proposing the reformation of the abuses in his government, insisted on his naming some person among his relations to take charge of the ship, and particularly recommended Coffin Ali Khan, who was sent for, and the nabob desired to stay till he came: But the nabob being greatly fatigued, was suffered to depart to his palace. The night and following day passed in concerting measures with Coffin Ali how to put in execution the plan before agreed on in Calcutta, where a treaty was signed for this purpose. In consequence of these deliberations, our troops crossed the river next night, and being joined by Coffin and his party, surrounded the nabob's palace. A letter from Mr Vanfittart was sent to the nabob, demanding his compliance with what had been proposed to him. To this the nabob returned for answer, 'that he never\nnever expected such usage from the English; that while a force was at his gates, he would enter into no terms. A message was sent in, that if he did not directly comply, they should be obliged to storm the palace. Afflicted and terrified at this menace, he opened the gates, exclaiming, that 'he was betrayed; that the English were guilty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERJURY\">perjury</a> and breach of faith; that he perceived their designs against his government; that he had friends enough to hazard at least one battle in his defense; but although no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a> were sacred enough to bind the English, yet as he had sworn to be their faithful friend, he would never swerve from his engagement, and rather suffer death than draw his sword against them.' So culpable was he of being sold, that he desired to know what sum of money Coffin Ali Khan was to give for the subahship, and he would give half as much more to be continued. He hoped, however, if they intended to dethrone him, that they would not leave him to the mercy of his son-in-law, from whom he feared the worst; but wished they would carry him from the city, and give him a place of safety in Calcutta. \"This last request of the nabob was confirmed in the light of a voluntary resignation. Our troops took possession of the palace; Meer Coffin was raised to the musjid; and the old nabob hurried into a boat with a few of his domestics and necessaries, and sent away to Calcutta in a manner wholly unworthy of the high rank he so lately held, as was also the scanty subsistence allowed him for his maintenance at Calcutta by his son-in-law. Thus was Jaffer Ali Khan deposed, in breach of a treaty founded on the most solemn oaths, and in violation of the national faith.\"\n\nAccording to this account, the servants of the company, who were the projectors of the revolution, made no secret that there was a present promised them of 200,000 rupees from Coffin, who was desirous of making the first act of his power the assassination of Jaffer, and was very much displeased when he found that the English intended giving him protection at Calcutta.\n\nIt could scarce be supposed that Meer Coffin, raised to the nabobship in the manner we have related, could be more faithful to the English than Meer Jaffer had been. Nothing advantageous to the interests of the company could indeed be reasonably expected from such a revolution. No successor of Meer Jaffer could be more entirely in subjection than the late nabob, from his natural imbecility, had been. This last consideration had induced many of the council at first to oppose the revolution; and indeed the only plausible pretense for it was, that the administration of Meer Jaffer was so very weak, that, unless he was aided and even controlled by some persons of ability, he himself must soon be ruined, and very probably the interests of the company along with him. Meer Coffin, however, was a man of a very different disposition from his father-in-law. As he knew that he had not been served by the English out of friendship, so he did not think of making any return of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>; but instead of this, considered only how he could most easily get rid of such troublesome allies. For a while, however, it was necessary for him to dissemble, and to take all the advantage he could of the power of his allies whilst it could be serviceable to him. By their alliance he cleared his dominions of invaders, and strengthened his frontier against them; he reduced, by means of the same affluence, the rajas or independent Indian chiefs who had rebelled in the time of his predecessor, obliging them to pay the usual tribute; by which means he repaired his finances, and thereby secured the discipline and fidelity of his troops. Having thus, by the affluence of the English forces, brought his government into subjection, he took the most effectual means of securing himself against their power. As the vicinity of his capital, Muzaffabad, to Calcutta, gave the English factory there an opportunity of inspecting his actions, and interrupting his designs when they thought proper, he took up his residence at Mongheer, a place 200 miles farther up the Ganges, which he fortified in the best and most expeditious manner he could. Being very sensible of the advantages of the European discipline, he resolved to form his army on a new model. For this purpose he collected all the Armenian, Persian, Tartar, and other soldiers of fortune, whose military characters he supposed might serve to raise the spirits of his Indian forces, and abate their natural timidity. He also carefully collected every wandering European who had borne arms, all the Sepoys who had been dismissed from the English service, distributing them among his troops, in order to teach them the English exercise. He changed the fashion of the Indian muskets from matchlocks to firelocks; and as their cannon were almost as deficient as their small arms, he procured a pattern of one from the English, by which he soon formed a train of artillery; and having thus done everything in his power to enable himself to withstand the English by force of arms, he resolved also to free his court from their emissaries, by imprisoning or putting to death every person of any consequence in his dominions who had shown any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to their interest.\n\nHis next step was to free himself from some of those restraints which his predecessor Meer Jaffer, and even he himself, had been obliged to lay upon the trade of the country, in order to gratify the avarice of his European allies. At his accession indeed he had ceded to the company a tract of land worth no less than 700,000l. annually, besides 70,000l. a-year on other accounts. All this, however, was not sufficient; the immunities granted them in trade were of still worse consequences than even those vast concessions. He knew by experience the distresses which these immunities had brought upon his predecessor, and therefore determined to put an end to them. In pursuance of this resolution, he began, in the year 1762, every duty on where to subject the English traders to the payment of certain duties throughout his dominions, and required that their disputes, if beyond the limits of their own jurisdiction, should be decided by his magistrates. This gave such an alarm at Calcutta, that, in November 1762, the governor Mr Vanittart waited on him in person at Mongheer, in order to expostulate with him upon the subject. The nabob answered his remonstrances in the following manner. \"If (said he) the servants of the English company were permitted to trade in all parts, and in all commodities, custom free, as many of them now pretend, they must of course draw all the trade into their own hands, and my customs would be of so little value, that it would be much more for my interest to lay trade entirely open, and collect no customs from any person whatever upon any\nany kind of merchandise. This would draw a number of merchants into the country, and increase my revenues by encouraging the cultivation and manufacture of a large quantity of goods for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>, at the same time that it would effectually cut off the principal subject of disputes which had disturbed the good understanding between us, an object which I have more than any other at heart.\"\n\nBy these intimations Mr Vanfittart was very much disconcerted; nor indeed was it in any person's power to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVISE\">devise</a> a plausible answer. What the nabob had threatened was evidently in his power; and though he had laid the trade entirely open, no reasonable fault could have been found with him. The proceeding, however, tended evidently to destroy the private trade carried on by the gentlemen of the factory; and even to prejudice, as they said, that of the company itself. Mr Vanfittart therefore thought proper to submit to certain regulations, by which the trade of the English was put under certain restrictions.\n\nThis new agreement being instantly put in execution on the part of the nabob, excited the utmost indignation at Calcutta. On the 17th of January 1763, the council passed a resolution, disavowing the treaty made by the governor, and affirmed that he assumed a right to which he was by no means authorized; that the regulations proposed were dishonourable to them as Englishmen, and tended to the ruin of all public and private trade; and that the president's issuing out regulations independent of the council was an absolute breach of their privileges. They sent orders therefore to all the factories, that no part of the agreement between the governor and nabob should be submitted to. Application was again made to Meer Collim to persuade him to a third agreement; but before the success of this negociation could be known, hostilities commenced on the part of the English.\n\nThere was at that time in the city of Patna (situated on the Ganges, about 300 miles above Calcutta), a fortified factory belonging to the East India company, where were a few European and Indian soldiers. By this factory the city was suddenly attacked on the 25th of June 1763, and instantly taken, though it was defended by a strong garrison, and the fortifications had been newly repaired. The governor and garrison fled out into the country on the first appearance of danger; but perceiving that the victors took no care to prevent a surprize, he suddenly returned with a reinforcement from the country, retook the city, and either cut in pieces or drove into their fort all the English who were in it, after having been only four hours in possession of the place. The English, disheartened by this disaster, did not now think themselves able to defend their fort against the Indians; for which reason they left it, with a design to retreat into the territories of a neighbouring nabob; but being pursued by a superior force, they were all either killed or taken.\n\nThis piece of perfidy, for such it certainly was, the nabob repaid by another, viz. slaughtering the deputies who had been sent him by the council of Calcutta to treat about a new agreement with regard to commercial affairs. They set out from Mongheer on the 24th of June, having been unable to bring Meer Collim to any terms; and though he furnished them with the usual passports, yet, as they were passing the city of Muxadabad, they found themselves attacked by a number of troops assembled for that purpose on both sides of the river, whose fire killed several gentlemen in the boats. Mr Amyatt, the chief of the embassy, landed with a few Sepoys, whom he forbade to fire, and endeavoured to make the enemy's troops understand that he was furnished with the nabob's passports, and had no design of committing any hostilities; but the enemy's horse advancing, some of the Sepoys fired notwithstanding Mr Amyatt's orders to the contrary. On this a general confusion ensued, and Mr Amyatt, with most of the small party who attended him, were cut in pieces.\n\nThese acts of treacherous hostility were soon followed by a formal declaration of war. Meer Jaffer, notwithstanding the crimes formerly alleged against him, was proclaimed nabob of Bengal, and the army immediately took the field under the command of Major Adams. The whole force, however, at first consisted of only one regiment of the king's troops, a few companies of Sepoys, and 12 pieces of cannon. The Meer Coftim very soon came to action with the enemy; and having got the better in two skirmishes, cleared the country of them as far as Calimbuzar river, a branch of the Ganges, which lay between Calcutta and Muxadabad, or Moorshedabad, the capital of the province.\n\nThe war was now carried on with uninterrupted success on the part of the English; nor does it appear that all the pains taken by Meer Coftim to discipline his troops had made them in the least more able to cope with the Europeans. The English were suffered to pass the river without opposition; but an army of 10,000 Indians were advantageously posted between the river and the city. The English were entirely defeated. In his way he found the Indians again strongly posted with intrenchments 15 feet high, and defended by a numerous artillery. This strong post was taken by stratagem; a feint being made with a small body of troops against that part where the enemy had collected their greatest strength. Thus the attention of the enemy was drawn entirely to that place, without regarding others where no attack was apprehended. The greatest part of the English army, however, had in the night-time marched round the Indian fortification, and by daybreak made a furious assault on a place where there was only a slight guard. The Indians instantly fled; the intrenchments were abandoned; and the city, which was protected only by them, fell of course into the hands of the conquerors.\n\nThis success of the English served only to make them redouble their diligence. They now penetrated into the heart of the province, crossed the numerous branches of the Ganges, and traversed marshes and forests in quest of their enemy. Meer Coftim, on the other hand, was not wanting in his defence; but the utmost efforts he could use were totally insufficient to stop the career of an enemy so powerful and now flushed with victory.\n\nThe two armies met on the banks of a river called Nunas Nullas, on the 2d of August 1763. The Indians, who had chosen their post with great judgment, and had defeated much more the appearance of an European army than it Nunas ever was observed before, not only in their arms and...\nand accoutrements, but in their division into brigades, and even in their clothing. The battle was much more obstinate than usual, being continued for four hours; but though the Indian army consisted of no fewer than 20,000 horse, and 8000 foot, the English proved in the end victorious, and the enemy were obliged to quit the field with the loss of all their cannon.\n\nFrom this time the Indians did not attempt any regular engagement with the English. They made a stand indeed at a place called Anda Nulla, which they had fortified in such a manner that it seemed proof against any sudden attack. But here also they suffered themselves to be deceived in a manner similar to that above-mentioned, and the place was taken with great slaughter. They now abandoned a vast tract of country; and though there were several very defensible posts one behind another, so much were they disheartened by this misfortune, that they never attempted to stop the progress of the English, but laid open the whole country to the very gates of Mongheer.\n\nThe next operation was the siege of Mongheer itself; which notwithstanding all the pains Meer Coffin had been at to fortify it, held out no more than nine days after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENCHES\">trenches</a> were opened; so that nothing now remained to complete the conquest of Bengal but the reduction of the city of Patna. The unfortunate Meer Coffin, in the mean time, enraged at the irrefutable progress of the English, vented his rage on the unhappy prisoners taken at Patna; all of whom, to the number of about 200, he caused to be inhumanly murdered. This villainy was perpetrated by one Somers, a German, who had originally been in the French service, but deserted from them to the English East India company, and from the company to Meer Coffin. This affront, by the Indians called Soomeroo, having invited the English gentlemen to sup with him, took the opportunity of borrowing their knives and forks, on pretence of entertaining them after the English manner. At night, when he arrived, he stood at some distance in the cook-room to give his orders; and as soon as the two first gentlemen, Mr. Ellis and Lushington, entered, the former was seized by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, his head pulled backward, and his throat cut by another. On this Mr. Lushington knocked down the murderer with his fist, seized his sword, wounded one and killed two before he himself was cut down. The other gentlemen being now alarmed, defended themselves, and even repulsed the Sepoys with plates and bottles. Somers then ordered them on the top of the house to fire down on the prisoners; which they obeyed with reluctance, alleging that they could not think of murdering them in that manner, but if he would give the prisoners arms, they would fight them; on which he knocked several of them down with bamboos. The consequence was, that all the gentlemen were either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> or had their throats cut. Dr. Fullarton was the only person who escaped, having received a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> from the tyrant a few days before the massacre.\n\nThis inhumanity was far from being of any service to the cause of Meer Coffin. Major Adams marched without delay from Mongheer to Patna; and as the place was but indifferently fortified, it could make but a feeble resistance. The cannon of the English soon made a practicable breach, and in no longer time than eight days this great city was taken by storm. Thus the nabob was deprived of all his fortified places, his army reduced to a small body, and himself obliged to fly to Sujah Dowla nabob of Oude, who acted as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> vizier to the Mogul. Here he was kindly received, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a> promised for his person, but adherence was refused to his army, nor would this prince consent at any rate to make his country a seat of war. The English were now entire masters of Bengal; for though Meer Jaffier was proclaimed nabob, it is not to be supposed that he had now any authority farther than what they pleased to give him. Major Adams did not long survive the conquest of Patna, which was taken on the 6th of November 1763; he died in the month of March 1764.\n\nMeer Coffin being thus driven out, an agent was sent from Calcutta to Sujah Dowla, proposing an alliance with him and the Mogul, who was along with him, and offering to assist them against Meer Coffin or any other enemy who should attempt an invasion of their disputed dominions; in return for which, it was expected that they should declare themselves open enemies to Meer Coffin, and use their utmost endeavours to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> and deliver him up with all his effects. This design was communicated to Major Adams on the 8th of December 1763; but as he was next day to resign the command of the army, Major Carnac was desired to take the command upon him, and to watch the motions of Meer Coffin, as well as to guard the dominions of Meer Jaffier against any hostilities which might be attempted. It was also resolved, that in case Meer Coffin should prevail upon the Mogul and Sujah Dowla to assist him, Major Carnac was desired to advance to the banks of the river Carumna, and there oppose the entrance of any hostile army.\n\nIt soon appeared that the friendship of the English was not what Sujah Dowla desired. He considered them as rapacious usurpers, who having got a footing in the country under pretence of commerce, could be satisfied with nothing less than the entire possession of it, to the ruin of the natural inhabitants. In the beginning of February 1764, therefore, it was known that Sujah Dowla had determined to assist Meer Coffin in attempting to recover Bengal. The president and council on this wrote him, that though they heard such a report, they could not believe it, considering the former connections subsisting between him and the chiefs of the company, and were persuaded he would not act in such an unjust manner; but if it really was his intention to espouse the cause of Meer Coffin, they informed him that they were resolved to keep Bengal free from troubles, and carry the war into the dominions of Sujah Dowla himself. To this the nabob replied by enumerating the many favours conferred on the English by the Mogul. \"Notwithstanding these (says he) you have interfered in the king's country, polluted yourselves of districts belonging to the government, and turned out and established nabobs at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, without the consent of the imperial court. Since you have imprisoned dependants on the court, and exposed the government of the king of kings to contempt and dishonour; since you have ruined the trade of the merchants of the country, granted protection to the king's servants, injured the revenues of the imperial court, and crushed the inhabitants by your acts of violence;\"\nsince you are continually feeding fresh people from Calcutta, and invading different parts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> dominions; to what can all those wrong proceedings be attributed, but to an absolute disregard to the court, and a wicked design of feigning the country to yourselves? If these disturbances have arisen from your own improper desires, desist from such behaviour in future; interfere not in the affairs of government; withdraw your people from every part, and send them to their own country; carry on the company's trade as formerly, and confine yourselves to commercial affairs,\" &c.\n\nAnother letter, much to the same purpose, was sent to Major Carnac; but the president and council of Calcutta, instead of paying any regard to the remonstrances of the nabob, determined to commence an immediate and offensive war against him.\n\nNotwithstanding this resolution, several difficulties occurred in carrying on a war at this time. The principal were the death of Major Adams, whose name had become formidable to the Indians, and the mutinous disposition of the army. The former was obviated by the appointment of Colonel Hector Munro, who, in military skill, appeared nothing inferior to his predecessor; and the mutinous disposition of the soldiery was got the better of by a most severe example of the mutineers, 24 of whom were blown away from the mouths of cannon. Hostilities were commenced on the part of Meer Collim, who cut off a small party of English troops, and sent their heads to the Mogul and Sujah Dowlia. An army of 50,000 men was collected, with a most formidable train of artillery, such as might be supposed to follow an European army of equal numbers. This prodigious armament seems to have effaced all the caution of Meer Collim; for though he had formerly experienced the bad effects of engaging the English in a pitched battle, yet he now thought proper to try his fortune a second time in the same way. The two armies met on the 22nd of October 1764, at a place called Buxard, on the river Carumnafla, about 100 miles above the city of Patna. The event was similar to that of other engagements with the English, to whom it never was possible for any advantages either in situation or number to make the Indians equal. The allied army was defeated with the loss of 6000 killed on the spot, 130 pieces of cannon, a proportionable quantity of military stores, and all their tents ready pitched; while, on the side of the conquerors, only 32 Europeans and 239 Indians were killed, and 57 Europeans and 473 Indians wounded.\n\nThe only place of strength now belonging to the allies on this side the river was a fort named Chanda Geer. The reduction of this place, however, might well have been deemed impracticable, as it stood on the top of a high hill, or rather rock, situated on the very brink of the Ganges, by which it could be constantly supplied with provisions; and as to military stores, it could not stand in need of any as long as stones could be found to pour down on the assailants. Notwithstanding all those difficulties, however, Colonel Munro caused his soldiers advance to the attack; but they were received with such volleys of stones, which the Indians threw both with hands and feet, that they were repulsed in a very short time; and though the attack was renewed the next day, it was attended with no better success; on which the English commander encamped with his army under the walls of Benares.\n\nSoon after this, Colonel Munro being recalled, the command of the army devolved on Sir Robert Fletcher, a major in the company's troops. The nabob, in the mean time, instead of attacking the English army at once, contented himself with sending out parties of light horse to skirmish with their advanced posts, while the main body lay at the distance of about 15 miles from Benares, which rendered it very dangerous for them to move from their place. On the 14th of January 1765, however, Sir Robert ventured at midnight to break up his camp under the walls of Benares, and to march off towards the enemy, leaving a party to protect that place against any attempt during his absence. In three days he came up with the main body of Indians, who retreated before him; on which Chandagreer, before which the late commander had been foiled by Sir Robert, His success would in all probability have been no better than that of his predecessor, had not the garrison mutinied for want of pay, and obliged the commander to surrender the place.\n\nThe reduction of Chanda Geer was followed by that of Eliabad, the capital of the enemy's country, a large city on the Ganges, between 60 and 70 miles above Chanda Geer, defended by thick and high walls and a strong fort; soon after which Sir Robert was superseded in the command of the army by Major Carnac. Sujah Dowlia in the mean time had been defeated with the English soon after the battle of Buxard. He did not, however, give himself up to despair, but gathered together, with great alacrity, the remains of his routed armies; and seeing that his own territories could not supply him with the requisite number of troops, he now applied to the Mahrattas for assistance. But these people, though very formidable to the other nations of Indotan, were far from being able to cope with the English. On the 20th of May 1765, General Carnac having assembled his troops, marched immediately to attack them; and having gained a complete victory at a place called Calpi, obliged them to retreat with precipitation across the Yumna into their own country.\n\nSujah Dowlia, now destitute of every resource, determined to throw himself on the clemency of the English. Previous to this, however, he allowed Meer Collim and the affianced Somers to escape; nor could any consideration ever prevail upon him to deliver them up. Three days after the battle of Calpi, the nabob surrendered himself to General Carnac, without illusing any thing in his own favour, farther than that he should await the determination of Lord Clive concerning him.\n\nIn the beginning of February this year died Meer Najem Ali Cawn, nominal nabob of Bengal. The succession was disputed betwixt his eldest surviving son Najem il Doula, a youth of about 18 years of age, and a grandchild by his eldest son Miran, at that time only seven years old. As the English were in reality absolute sovereigns of the country, it was debated in the council of Calcutta whether Meer Najem's son should be allowed to succeed, according to the custom of the country,\ncountry, or the grandfon, according to the English custom. The point being carried in favour of Najem, it was next debated on what terms he should be admitted to the succession. The late nabob, among other impositions, had obliged himself to support an army of 12,000 horse and as many foot. It was alleged on this occasion, that he had not fulfilled his engagement; that he had disbanded most of the troops; that at best they were but an useless burden, having never answered any purpose in real service, for which reason the company had been obliged to augment their military establishment: it was therefore now judged expedient that the nabob should settle a sum, upwards of 80,000l. annually, on the company, to be paid out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>: that he should also discard his prime minister and great favourite Nuncomar, and receive in his place a person appointed by the council, who was to act in the double capacity of minister and governor to assist and instruct him. The council were also to have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> upon the nomination of all the superintendents and principal officers employed in collecting or receiving of the revenues; that he should take their advice, and have their consent to such nominations whenever they thought proper to interfere in them. He was also to receive their complaints, and pay a due attention to them upon the misbehaviour of any of the officers who either were appointed already or should be in time to come.\n\nWith these extravagant requisitions the young nabob was obliged to comply, though he had discernment enough to perceive that he was now an absolute slave to the council at Calcutta. Though obliged by treaty to dismiss Nuncomar from the office of prime minister, he still continued to show him the same favour, until at last he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with carrying on a treasonable correspondence with Sujah Dowla, for which the nabob was enjoined to send him to Calcutta to take his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>. The unfortunate prince used every method to deliver his favourite from the impending danger, but to no purpose: he was obliged to submit to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> of having all his offers with regard to his release rejected, though the committee at Calcutta afterwards thought proper to let him at liberty without any trial.\n\nThese extraordinary powers, exerted in such a despotic manner by the council of Calcutta for such a length of time, could not but at last induce their superiors to circumscribe them in some degree, by appointing others who should act independently even of this council, and who might be supposed to be actuated by more upright and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> principles than had hitherto appeared in their conduct. The great character which Lord Clive had already gained in the east, justly marked him out as a proper person for adjusting the affairs of Bengal. On the 3rd of May 1765 he arrived in the east, with full powers as commander in chief, president, and governor of Bengal. An unlimited power was also committed to a select committee, consisting of his lordship and four gentlemen, to act and determine every thing themselves, without dependence on the council. It was, however, recommended in their instructions, to consult the council in general as often as it could be done conveniently; but the sole power of determining in all cases was left with them, until the troubles of Bengal should be entirely ended. By these gentlemen a plan of reformation was instantly set about; by which, however, violent disputes were occasioned; but the committee, disregarding these impotent efforts, exerted their authority to the full extent, seldom even acquainting the council with their transactions, and never allowing them to give their opinion on any occasion.\n\nOn taking the affairs of Bengal into thorough consideration, Lord Clive found that the success of the restored British arms could be productive of nothing but wars; that to ruin Sujah Dowla was to break down the strongest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> which the Bengal provinces could have against the incursions of the Mahattas and other barbarous people to the westward, who had long desolated the northern provinces; and the Mogul, with whom the company had concluded a treaty, was utterly unable to support himself, and would require the whole English power in the east to secure him in his dignity. His lordship therefore found it necessary to conclude a treaty with Sujah Dowla. The Mogul was satisfied by obtaining a more ample revenue than he had for some time enjoyed; by which means he might be enabled to march an army to Delhi to take possession of Lord Clive's empire. For the company his lordship obtained the office of duan or collector of revenues for the province of Bengal and its dependencies. Thus Sujah Dowla was again put in possession of his dominions, excepting a small territory which was referred to the Mogul, and estimated at 20 lacks of rupees, or 250,000l. annually. The company were to pay 26 lacks of rupees, amounting to 325,000l. sterling. They engaged also to pay to the nabob of Bengal an annual sum of 53 lacks, or 662,500l. for the expenses of government, and the support of his dignity. The remainder of the revenues of Bengal were allotted to the company, who on their part guaranteed the territories at that time in possession of Sujah Dowla and the Mogul.\n\nThus the East India company acquired the sovereignty of a territory equal in extent to the most flourishing kingdom in Europe. By all this, however, they were so far from being enriched, that the disorder of their affairs attracted the attention of government, and gave the British ministry an opportunity at last of depriving them of their territorial possessions, and subjecting the province of Bengal to the authority of the crown. See East India Company found a most formidable enemy in Hyder Ali, or Hyder Naig. This man, from the rank of a common Sepoy, had raised himself to be one of the War with most considerable princes in the empire of Indostan, Hyder Ali. Being sensible that the power of the English was an insuperable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> to his ambitious designs, he practised on the nizam of the Deccan, and partly by promises, partly by threats, engaged him to renounce his alliance with the company, and even to enter into a war against them. As he had been at great pains to introduce the European discipline among his troops, and had many renegadoes in his service, he imagined, that with the advantage of numbers he should certainly be able to cope with his antagonists in the open field. In this, however, he was deceived; for on the 26th of September 1767, his army was entirely defeated by Colonel Smith at a place called Errera near Trincomallee; after which the nizam thought it advisable to defer his new\nnew ally, and conclude another treaty with the English. From the latter, however, he did not obtain peace but at the expense of ceding to them the dominions of the Dageat Carnatic, which includes the dominions of Hyder Aly and some petty princes.\n\nHyder, thus deserted by his ally, transferred the seat of war to a mountainous country, where, during the year 1767, nothing decisive could be effected; while the Indian cavalry was sometimes enabled to cut off the supplies, and interrupt the communications of their antagonists. During these operations some ships were fitted out at Bombay, which conveyed 400 European soldiers and about 800 Sepoys to attack <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANGALORE\">Mangalore</a>, one of Hyder Aly's principal sea-ports, where all his ships lay. This enterprise proved successful, and nine ships were brought away; but too small a garrison having been left in the place, it was almost immediately after retaken, and all who were in it made prisoners by Hyder Aly.\n\nIn the meantime, an injudicious measure, adopted by the English in their method of managing the army, proved not only of the utmost detriment to their cause, but occasioned disgraces hitherto unheard of in the history of the nation, viz., the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFECTION\">defection</a> of officers from the service of Britain to that of a barbarous prince, and the giving up of forts in such a shameful manner as could not but suggest a suspicion that they had been betrayed.\u2014The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> cause of all this mischief was the appointment of field-deputies to attend the army, and to control and superintend the conduct of the commander-in-chief; and these, in the present instance, being deeply concerned in the contracts for the army, took care to regulate its motions in such a manner as best suited their private interest or convenience. Hyder Aly did not fail to improve the errors consequent upon this kind of management to his own advantage. General Smith had penetrated far into his country, taken several of his fortresses, and was in a fair way of becoming master of his capital, when all his operations were checked at once by the field-deputies. His antagonist being thus allowed some respite, suddenly entered the Carnatic with a numerous army of horse, ravaging and destroying everything at pleasure. Thus the English were obliged to relinquish all their conquests in order to defend their own territories; while this reverse of fortune not only discouraged the allies of the English, but even produced in them an inclination to desert their cause, and go over to Hyder Aly, while those who remained faithful paid dearly for their attachment. The nabob of Arcot, the most faithful ally the English ever had, suffered extremely on this occasion. Hyder Aly had long entertained a violent enmity against this prince; most probably on account of his inviolable attachment to the English. His dominions were therefore ravaged without mercy; and thus, while Hyder gratified his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> resentment against him, he cut off from the English one of the principal resources they had for carrying on the war.\n\nOn the return of the company's forces to the defense of the Carnatic, they found themselves very little able to cope with their adversary; for, besides the continuance of the same causes which had formerly contributed to their want of success, they had been very much weakened in their expedition. Hyder Aly had also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> to avoid a general engagement, but frequently intercepted the convoys of the English, cut off their detached parties, and wearied them out with long and continual marches. The news of his successes against an enemy hitherto invincible by all the powers of India, so raised his reputation, that adventurers flocked to him from all parts; by which means his cavalry were soon increased to upwards of 90,000; to which, however, his infantry bore no proportion.\n\nNotwithstanding all his successes, it appears that the forces of Hyder Aly were altogether unable to cope with those of Britain, even when there was the greatest imaginable disparity of numbers. A detachment of the company's forces had made an assault upon a fort called Mulwagglee, in which they were repulsed with some loss. This, with the small number of the detachment, encouraged Hyder Aly to march at the head of a great part of his army to the protection of the fort. The commanding officer, however, Colonel Wood, did not hesitate, with only 460 Europeans and 2300 Sepoys, to attack his army, consisting of 14,000 horse, 12,000 men armed with matchlock guns, and six battalions of sepoys. The engagement lasted five hours; when at last Hyder Aly, notwithstanding his defeated by numbers, was obliged to retreat, leaving the field covered with dead bodies; the loss of the British being upwards of 300 killed and wounded. This engagement, however, was attended with no consequences affecting the war in general, which went on for some time in the same manner, and greatly to the disadvantage of the company. The divisions and discontent among the officers and council daily increased, the soldiers deserted, and every thing went to ruin. The revenues of the establishment of Madras being at last unequal to the expenses of the war, large remittances were made from Bengal to answer that purpose; and as these were made in a kind of base gold coin, the company is laid by that means alone to have lost 40,000l. in the difference of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> only. At last Hyder Aly having given the English army the slip, suddenly appeared within a few miles of Madras; which occasioned such an alarm, that the presidency there were induced to enter into a negotiation with him. The Indian prince, on his part, was very ready to hearken to proposals of peace upon any reasonable terms. An offensive and defensive treaty was therefore concluded on the 3d of April 1769, on the simple condition that the forts and places taken on both sides should be restored, and each party fit down contented with their own expenses.\n\nBy this treaty it was particularly stipulated, that in case either party being attacked by their enemies, the English the other should give them assistance; and in this case even the number of troops to be supplied by each was specified. It soon after appeared, however, that the presidency of Madras were resolved to pay very little regard to their engagements. Hyder Aly having in a little time been involved in a war with the Mahrattas, applied for assistance, according to agreement; but was refused by the presidency, who pretended to fear a quarrel with the Mahrattas themselves. As the latter are a very powerful and warlike nation, Hyder Aly found himself overmatched, and therefore applied several times to the English for the assistance he had a right to expect; but was constantly refused on various pretexts; which convinced him at last that he could place\nno dependence on the friendship of the English, and filled him with an implacable hatred against them. As soon, therefore, as he could make up his differences with the Mahrattas, he resolved to recover his losses, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> himself on those faithless allies. With this view he applied himself to their rivals the French; whom no Indian nation ever found backward in supplying them with the means of defence against the English. By their means he obtained military stores in the greatest abundance, a number of experienced officers and soldiers; and the European discipline was brought to much greater perfection than even he himself had ever been able to bring it before this period. Thus, in a short time, imagining himself a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a> for the Mahrattas, he renewed the war; and gained such decisive advantages, as quickly obliged them to conclude an advantageous treaty with him.\n\nIt now appeared that the English, notwithstanding their pretended ill-will to quarrel with the Mahrattas, had not the least hesitation at doing so when their interest was concerned. In order to understand the subsequent transactions, however, we must observe, that the Mahrattas, like other nations of India, were originally governed by princes called rajahs, who reigned at Setterah; and though in process of time they came to be divided into a number of petty states, yet they paid a nominal respect to the ram-rajah, who had a right to alienate their chiefs, and order out their troops on any necessary occasion. By degrees this dignity of ram-rajah or fou-rajah (as he was also called), became merely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TITULAR\">titular</a>, the administration being entirely policed by the pahluwa or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a>. This office being usurped by one particular family, Nana-row, the reigning pahluwa, seized the ram-rajah and confined him in a fortress near Setterah. At his death he left two sons, Mada-row and Narain-row; of whom the former, as being the elder, succeeded him in the pahluwship. Jonogee Boola, or Bouncella, the immediate predecessor of Moodage Boola, rajah of Berar, was one of the pretenders to the dignity of ram-rajah, as being the nearest of kin; at the same time that Roganaut-row, called also Ragabah, uncle to Mada-row himself, pretended to the pahluwship. On this account the latter was confined by Mada-row, but who imprudently released him a little before his death, and even recommended him to the most affectionate manner the care of his brother Narain-row, who was to succeed to the pahluwship. The care he took in consequence of this recommendation was such as might easily have been imagined; the unhappy Narain-row was murdered, and Roganaut-row the allusion fled to Bombay; where, on promising a cession of territory, he was protected and encouraged in his pretensions. The Mahrattas remonstrated against this behaviour; but the English had determined at all events to profit by the civil divisions of the Indians, and therefore paid no regard to the justice or injustice of their cause. The Mahrattas therefore not only made up their differences with Hyder Aly, as has been already mentioned, but became determined enemies to the English, at the same time that a dangerous confederacy was formed among the most powerful princes of India to expel from that part of the world those intruders whose avarice could be satisfied with no concessions, and whom no treaties could bind when it served their turn to break them.\n\nThe resentment of Hyder Aly was particularly directed against the presidency of Madras for the reasons already given; he had also received fresh provocation by their causing a body of troops march through his dominions without his leave, and that to the afflatus of a prince for whom he had no great friendship; also by the capture of the French settlement of Mahic, on the coast of Malabar, which he said was within his dominions, and consequently that the French were under his protection. His troops were therefore assembled from every quarter, and the greatest preparations made for a powerful invasion. The presidency of Madras in the mean time spent their time in mutual alterations, neglecting even to secure the passes of the mountains, through which only an invasion could be made, until their active antagonist, having feigned and guarded those passes, suddenly poured out through them at the head of 100,000 men, among whom was a large body of European troops under French officers, and commanded by Colonel Lally, a man of great bravery and experience in war.\n\nThe alarm was given on the 24th of July 1780 that Hyder Aly's horde were only nine miles distant from Madras. The inhabitants instantly deserted their houses and fled into the fort; while the unfeasted barbarian burnt the villages, reduced the inferior forts, and prepared to lay siege to the capital. It being now absolutely necessary to make some resistance, measures were taken for assembling the troops; in doing which an express was sent to Colonel Baillie, at that time at Gumeroponda, about 28 miles from Madras, to proceed from thence directly to Conjeevaram with the corps under his command, where the main body was to meet him. But when the latter was under marching or unfortunate, the first regiment of cavalry positively refused to move without money; and as they persisted in their resolution, were at last made prisoners and sent to Madras. The main body, then, consisting of 1500 Europeans and 4200 Sepoys, under Sir Hector Munro, with their train of artillery, proceeded towards Conjeevaram; and such were the fatigues of their march, that 250 men belonging to the 73rd regiment were left lying on the road. On their arrival at Conjeevaram, they found the town in flames, great bodies of the enemy's cavalry advancing on both flanks, and no appearance of Colonel Baillie's detachment. The march of this body had been impeded by a small river swollen by a sudden fall of rain. On this occasion, the officer who gives the account of his disaster makes the following observation. \"In this incident we have a most remarkable proof and example of the danger of procrastination, and on what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> circumstances and sudden springs of the mind the fortune and the general issue of war may depend. Had Colonel Baillie passed over the Tripassore without halting, as some advised, and encamped on its southern instead of its northern bank, the disaster that soon followed would have been prevented, and an order of affairs wholly different from that which took place would have succeeded.\"\n\nHyder Aly having now raised the siege of Arcot, in which he had been employed, marched towards Conjeevaram; in the neighbourhood of which he encamped.\ncamped, and in the course of several days, at different times, offered battle. On the 6th of September, he detached his son Tippoo Saib with the flower of his army to cut off the detachment under Colonel Baillie, who was now at Perrambaukam, a small village distant from the main body about 15 miles, he himself remaining in the neighbourhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJEVERAM\">Conjeveram</a>, in order to watch the motions of Sir Hector Munro.\n\nThe detachment under Tippoo Saib consisted of 30,000 horse, 8000 foot, with 12 pieces of cannon. Notwithstanding this superiority in number, however, they were bravely repulsed by Colonel Baillie's handful of troops; and a junction was effected with a detachment under Sir Robert Fletcher, sent by Sir Hector Munro on first hearing the noise of the engagement.\n\nThis junction was effected on the 9th of September, and next morning orders were given for the whole army to march; Colonel Fletcher's detachment being dispersed in different parts of the line. From the moment they began to march, the enemy played off their rockets, which, however, did but little execution; but about ten at night several guns began to open on the rear of the English. Colonel Baillie, therefore, after some proper manoeuvres, caused his troops form a line, while the enemy cannonaded them incessantly with great execution. On this Colonel Baillie detached Captain Rumley with five companies of Sepoy grenadiers to storm their guns; which service they would have undoubtedly accomplished, had not their march been interrupted by a torrent of water which at that time happened to be unfordable. Captain Rumley therefore returned about half an hour after eleven, when the guns of the enemy were heard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> off towards the English front, and a general alarm was perceived throughout their camp; owing, as was supposed, to their having received intelligence of the party that had been sent to storm their guns.\n\n\"From their noise, confusion, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> firing (says our author), one would have imagined that a detachment of our men had fallen upon them with fixed bayonets. At that critical moment, had a party of grenadiers been sent against them, they would have routed without difficulty the whole of Tippoo's army. Having about ten o'clock in the evening advanced a few hundred yards into an avenue, the detachment remained there in perfect silence till the morning.\n\n\"Colonel Fletcher being asked by some officers, why Colonel Baillie halted? modestly answered, that Colonel Baillie was an officer of established reputation, and that he no doubt had reasons for his conduct. It cannot, however, be concealed, that this halt afforded an opportunity for Tippoo Saib to draw off his cannon to a very strong post by which the English were obliged to pass; and at the same time of informing Hyder of their situation, and suggesting to him the expediency of advancing for the improvement of so favourable a conjuncture.\n\n\"On the 10th of September, at five o'clock in the morning, our little army marched off by the right in subdivisions, having their baggage on their right flank and the enemy on their left. A few minutes after six two guns opened on their rear, on which the line halted a few minutes. Large bodies of the enemy's cavalry now appeared on their right flank; and just at the moment when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGODA\">pagoda</a> of Conjeveram appeared in view, and our men had begun to indulge the hopes of a respite from toils and dangers, a rocket-boy was taken prisoner, who informed them, that Hyder's whole army was marching to the assistance of Tippoo. Four guns now opened on their left with great effect. So hot was the fire they sustained, and so heavy the loss, that Colonel Baillie ordered the whole line to quit the avenue, and present a front to the enemy; and at the same time dispatched Captain Rumley with ten companies of Sepoy grenadiers to storm the enemy's guns.\n\n\"Within a few minutes after Captain Rumley had left the line, Tippoo's guns were silenced. Rumley's little detachment immediately took possession of four of the enemy's guns, and completely routed the party attached to them. Captain Rumley, overcome with fatigue, ordered Captain Gowdie, the officer next in command, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> on the party, and take possession of some more guns placed a few hundred yards in their front. But in a few minutes after, as they were advancing for this purpose, a sudden cry was heard among the Sepoys, of horde! horde! The camp followers, whose numbers were nearly five to one of the troops under arms, were driven on a part of our line by the numerous and surrounding forces of Hyder Ali; who being informed of the embarrassing situation of Colonel Baillie, had left his camp without striking his tents, with a view to conceal his march from the English. A great confusion among our troops was the unavoidable consequence of this sudden onset. The Europeans were suddenly left on the field of action alone; and at that critical moment a detachment from the advanced guard of Hyder's army pressed on with great celerity between our line and Captain Rumley's party. The commanding officer, therefore, apprehensive of being cut off from our little army, judged it most prudent to retreat.\n\n\"Colonel Baillie, when he was informed that an immense body of horse and infantry was marching towards him, and that this was supposed to be Hyder's main army, said, 'Very well, we shall be prepared to receive them.' Hyder's whole forces now appeared incalculably in view; and this barbarian chief, who, as was observed of the Roman general by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PYRRHUS\">Pyrrhus</a>, had nothing barbarous in his discipline, after dividing his guns agreeably to a preconcerted plan, opened from 60 to 70 pieces of cannon, with an innumerable quantity of rockets.\n\n\"Hyder's numerous cavalry, supported by his regular infantry and European troops, driven on by threats, encouraged by promises, and led on by his most distinguished officers, bore on our little army in different quarters without making the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>. Our men, both Europeans and Sepoys, repeatedly presented and recovered their fire-arms as if they had been manoeuvring on a parade. The enemy were repulsed in every attack; numbers of their best cavalry were killed, and many more were wounded; even the English infantry were forced to give way; and Hyder himself would have ordered a retreat, had it not been for the advice of General Lally, who informed him that it was now too late, as General Munro was most probably...\nbably advancing on their rear from Conjeevaram; for which reason nothing remained but to break the detachment by their artillery and cavalry.\n\n\"Tippoo Saib had by this time collected his party together, and renewed the cannonade; and at the same time that the English were under the necessity of sustaining an attack both from the father and son, two of their tumbrils were blown up by Hyder's guns, and a large opening made in both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a>. They had now no other ammunition than grape; their guns discontinued firing; and in this dreadful situation, under a terrible fire not only of guns but rockets, losing great numbers of officers and men, they remained from half past seven till nine o'clock.\n\n\"On this Hyder Aly, perceiving that the guns were quite silenced, came with his whole army round their right flank. The cavalry charged them in distinct columns, and in the intervals between these the infantry poured in volleys of musquetry with dreadful effect. Mhiar Saib, with the Mogul and Sanoor cavalry, made the first impression. These were followed by the elephants and the Myforean cavalry, which completed the overthrow of the detachment, Colonel Baillie, though grievously wounded, rallied the Europeans, and once more formed them into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>; and with this handful of men he gained an eminence, where, without ammunition, and most of the people wounded, he resisted and repulsed 13 separate attacks; but fresh bodies or cavalry continually pouring in, they were broken without giving way. Many of our men, desperately wounded, raising themselves from the ground received the enemy on their bayonets.\n\n\"Captain Lucas's battalion of Sepoys, at the time when our men moved up to a rising ground, was stationed to the right of the European grenadiers; but that corps, seeing the Europeans in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, and mistaking perhaps this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVOLUTION\">evolution</a> for a retreat, broke in the utmost confusion. The Europeans, bravely sustaining their reputation for intrepid valour, remained in this extremity of distress steady and undaunted, though surrounded by the French troops, and by Hyder's cavalry to the number of 40,000. They even expressed a desire, though their number did not exceed 400, of being led on to the attack. A party of Tipperaries, who lay at the distance of about 30 yards in our front, kept up an incessant fire of small arms with great effect. Many attempts were made by the enemy's cavalry to break this small body of men; but by the steady conduct of both our officers and men they were repulsed.\n\n\"Colonel Baillie, finding that there was now no prospect of being relieved by General Munro, held up a flag of truce to one of the chiefs of Hyder's army. But this was treated with contempt, and the sirdar endeavoured at the same time to cut off the colonel. The reason the enemy assigned for this was, that the Sepoys had fired after the signal was hoisted.\n\n\"A few minutes after this, our men received orders to throw down their arms, with intimation that quarter would be given. This order was scarcely complied with, but when, with the enemy rushed in upon them in the most savage and brutal manner, sparing neither age nor infancy nor any condition of life; and, but for the humane interposition of the French commanders Lally and Pimorran, who implored and inflicted with the conqueror to show mercy, the gallant remains of our little army must have fallen a sacrifice to that savage thirst of blood with which the tyrant disgraced his victory.\" (A)\n\nIn this unfortunate action near 700 Europeans were killed.\n\n---\n\n(A) In a narrative of the sufferings of the English who survived this fatal day, said to be published by an officer in Colonel Baillie's detachment, we find it related, that \"Hyder Aly, seated in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENT\">tent</a>, enjoyed the sight of the heads of the slain, as well as of his prisoners. Colonel Baillie, who was himself very much wounded, was brought to his camp on a cannon, and with several other gentlemen in the same situation laid at the tyrant's feet on the ground and in the open air. In this situation they saw many of the heads of their countrymen presented to the conqueror, some of them even by English officers, who were forced to perform that horrid task; in a little time, however, Hyder ordered no more heads to be brought to him while the English gentlemen were present. A tent was fitted up for Colonel Baillie and his officers, but without straw or anything else to lie upon, though many of them were dangerously wounded; and as the tent could only contain 10 persons, the rest were obliged to lie in the open air. When the prisoners were removed from place to place, they were wantonly insulted, and even beaten by those who had the charge of them. If the latter halted to refresh themselves under a tree, they would be at the trouble of carrying their prisoners to the side next to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, lest they should enjoy the benefit of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>. Sometimes they were tormented with thirst, at others the people allowed them to drink water out of the palms of their hands, it being reckoned a profanation to allow an European to drink out of a vessel belonging to an Indian,\" &c.\n\nIn this narrative are likewise mentioned some examples of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> from wounds, which, if we can depend on their authenticity, must undoubtedly show a restorative power in the human body altogether unknown in this climate.\n\n\" Lieutenant Thomas Bowler received a musket <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> in his leg, and after that eight desperate wounds with a scymitar. He lay for seven hours on the spot, deprived of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>; but, towards evening, awakened from his trance, stripped of all his clothes, except a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of under drawers and part of his shirt, with an intense thirst, calling out, and imploring a little water from the enemy. Some were moved with compassion, while others answered his intreates only with insults and threats of immediate death. Some water, however, was brought from a pool in the field of battle, about 50 or 60 yards from the place where he lay. It was deeply tinged with blood; nevertheless, Mr Bowler being furnished with one of Hyder's soldiers with an earthen chatty, or pot containing about a pint, and directed to the place, crawled thither as well as he could. Though struck with horror at the sight of the dead and wounded with which it was filled, he quenched his thirst with the liquid; and having\nkilled on the spot; the loss on Hyder Aly's part was so great that he indifferently concealed it, being enraged that the conquest of such an inconsiderable body should cost him so many of his bravest troops. He seemed ever after to consider the English with an extreme degree of terror; insomuch that, notwithstanding his pretended exultation on account of the present victory, he no sooner heard a report of Sir Hector Munro's march to attack him, that he left his camp in the utmost confusion, abandoning great part of his tents and baggage, as well as the vast numbers that had been wounded in the late action.\n\nOn the news of Colonel Baillie's disaster, the supreme council of Bengal requested Sir Eyre Coote to take upon him the management of the war; for the carrying on of which a large supply of men and money was instantly decreed. This was readily undertaken by the illustrious officer just mentioned, notwithstanding his very precarious state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> at that time; and from the moment he took upon him the management of affairs, the fortune of the war was changed.\n\nThe spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a>, which for a long time had infected the presidency of Madras, was indeed the true cause of all the misfortunes that had happened. This was found by Sir Eyre Coote to be even greater than he had heard by report: the respect and confidence of the natives was wholly lost; the complaints of the officers and soldiers were loud and acrimonious; an inactivity prevailed in all the councils and operations, while the enemy carried every thing before them. Sir Hector Munro had been greatly harassed on his march to Madras, whither he had retreated after Colonel Baillie's disaster; the forces of Hyder Aly had invested all the places in that neighbourhood in such a manner as in a great measure to cut off all supplies; and Arcot, the capital city of the most faithful ally the British ever had, was taken by storm, together with an adjoining fort, by which means an immense quantity of ammunition and military stores fell into the hands of the enemy.\n\nNo sooner had Sir Eyre Coote taken upon him the command of the British forces, than his antagonist thought proper to change his plan of operations entirely. He now detached large parties of his numerous forces to lay siege to the principal fortresses belonging to the company; while, with the bravest and best disciplined part, he kept the field against the British commander in person. On the very first appearance of the British army, however, his resolution failed, and he abandoned the siege of every place he had invested, retiring to a considerable distance on the other side of the river Palar, without even disputing the passage of it, as it was expected he would have done.\n\nA respite being thus obtained from the incursions of Pondicherry, this formidable enemy, the next operation was to secure Pondicherry, whose inhabitants had revolted. They were, however, easily disarmed, their magazines reduced, and all the boats in their possession destroyed; in consequence of which precaution, a French squadron that soon after appeared off Pondicherry was obliged to depart without being furnished with any necessaries. But in the mean time Hyder Aly having drawn large reinforcements from all parts of his dominions, resolved to try his fortune in a pitched battle. His army amounted to 200,000 men, 40,000 of whom were cavalry, and 15,000 well disciplined Sepoys. Still, however, he durst not openly attack the British army in the field, but took a strong post from whence he might harass them on their march. Sir Eyre Coote, however, was not on his part backward to make the attack; and on the other hand Hyder Aly prepared to engage him with all possible advantage. The battle was fought on the 11th of July 1781; and notwithstanding the vast superiority of Hyder Aly's army, he was routed with great slaughter. The Indians, however, made a much more obstinate resistance than usual; and the engagement lasted from nine in the morning till four in the afternoon, and the deficiency of the English in cavalry prevented them from pursuing the advantage they had gained.\n\nNotwithstanding the loss of this battle, Hyder Aly was soon encouraged to venture another. This was fought on the 27th of August the same year, on the very spot where Colonel Baillie had been defeated. It was more obstinately contested than even the former, being continued with great fury from eight in the morning to near dark. A number of brave officers and soldiers fell on the part of the British, owing chiefly to the terrible fire of the enemy's artillery and the advantageous position of their troops. At last, however, the Indian army was totally defeated, and driven from every post it had occupied; though from the obstinate resistance made at this time, Hyder began to entertain hopes that his forces might, by a succession of such battles, be at last enabled to cope with the English. He therefore ventured a third battle in some weeks after, but was now defeated with greater loss.\n\nhaving filled his chatty, endeavoured to proceed towards Conjeveram. He had not, however, moved from his place above 300 or 400 yards, when, being quite overcome, he was obliged to lie all night in the open air, during which time there fell two heavy showers of rain. Next morning he proceeded to Conjeveram; but after walking about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>, was met by some of the enemy's horsemen, by whom he was brought back prisoner, and obliged to walk without any assistance. When delivered up to the enemy's Sepoys, he was so stiff with his wounds, that he could not stoop or even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> his body in the smallest degree.\n\n\"The quarter-master <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERGEANT\">sergeant</a> of artillery received so deep a cut across the back part of his neck, that he was obliged to support his head with his hands in order to keep it from falling to a side all the journey. The least shake or unevenness of the ground made him cry out with pain. He once and again ceased from all attempts to proceed; but being encouraged and conjured by his companions to renew his efforts, he did so, reached the camp, and at last, as well as Mr Bowler, recovered.\"\u2014It is also remarkable, that, according to our author, out of 32 wounded persons only six died; though one would be apt to think that the excessively severe usage they met with would have killed every one.\nIndia. los than before. Undiscouraged by this bad success, however, he laid siege to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VELLORE\">Vellore</a>; and expecting that the relief of it would be attempted, seized a strong pass through which he knew the British army must direct their march. The British commander accordingly advanced, and found the enemy in possession of some very strong grounds on both sides of a marsh through which he was obliged to pass. Here he was attacked on all sides, but principally on the rear, the enemy directing their force principally against the baggage and convoy of provisions designed for the garrison. Their utmost efforts, however, were unavailing, and Sir Eyre Coote forced his way to Vellore in spite of all opposition. Hyder Ali did not fail to wait his return through the same pass; and having exerted his utmost skill in posting his troops, attacked him with the utmost vigour: but though the English were assaulted in front and in both flanks at once, and a heavy cannonade kept up during the whole time of the engagement, the Indians were at last defeated with great slaughter.\n\nBy these successes the presidency of Madras were now allowed so much repose, that an enterprise was planned against the Dutch settlement of Negapatam, situated to the south of Madras, and in the neighbourhood of Tanjore. A very inconsiderable force, however, could yet be spared for this purpose, as Hyder Ali, though so often defeated, was still extremely formidable. Sir Hector Munro had the management of the expedition: and so furious was the attack of the British sailors, that the troops left to guard the avenues to the place were defeated at the very first onset. A regular siege ensued; which, however, was of very short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, a breach being soon made and the garrison surrendering prisoners of war.\n\nThe loss of Negapatam was quickly followed by that of Trincomalee in Ceylon. Admiral Hughes, who had conveyed Sir Hector Munro with the land forces to that place, and assisted him with his sailors, immediately after its surrender set sail for Trincomalee, where he arrived about the middle of January 1782. The fort of that name was quickly reduced; but the main strength of the settlement consisted of a fort named Offenburgh, the principal place on the island, and by the capture of which the whole settlement would be reduced. This fort stands on a hill which commands the harbour, but is itself overlooked by another hill at the distance of no more than 200 yards. Though the gaining of this post was undoubtedly to be attended with the loss of the fort, it does not appear that the governor even attempted to defend it. A British detachment of sailors and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINES\">marines</a> therefore took possession of it, when the admiral sent a summons of surrender, representing the uselessness of making any farther defence after the loss of such a post; and being extremely desirous of avoiding an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of blood, repeated his arguments at several different times. The governor, however, proving obstinate, the place was taken by storm, with the loss of about 60 on the part of the British, and very little on that of the Dutch, the victors giving quarter the moment it was asked. Four hundred Europeans were taken prisoners; a large quantity of ammunition and military stores, with a numerous artillery, were found in the place; and two Indians richly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a>, with a number of small trading vessels, were taken in the harbour.\n\nA more formidable enemy, however, now made his appearance on the coast of Coromandel. This was Suffrein the French admiral; who setting out from India with his native country with 11 ships of the line and several powerful frigates, had fallen in with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANNIBAL\">Hannibal</a> of 50 guns, and taken her when separated from her consorts. This ship, along with three others, a 74, a 64, and a 50, had been sent out to the assistance of Sir Edward; and the three last had the good fortune to join him before the arrival of M. de Suffrein. The latter, supposing that he had not yet received this reinforcement, bore down upon the English squadron at Madras, to which place they had sailed immediately after the capture of Trincomalee. Perceiving his mistake, however, he instantly bore away. The English admiral pursued, took five vessels, five of them English prizes, and the sixth a valuable transport laden with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a> and other military stores, besides having on board a number of land-officers and about 300 regular troops. This brought on an engagement, in which M. Suffrein, perceiving the rear division of the British fleet unable to keep up with the rest, directed his force principally against it. The ships of Admiral Hughes Engage-\n\nhimself and Commodore King sustained the most violent bent efforts of the French, having mostly two, and at times three, vessels to contend with. Thus the commodore's ship was reduced almost to a wreck; but Hughes, about six in the evening, the wind becoming more favourable to the English, the squadron of the enemy were obliged to draw off. The loss of men on the part of the British amounted to little more than 130 killed and wounded, but that of the French exceeded 250.\n\nAfter the battle Sir Edward returned to Madras; but meeting with no intelligence of Suffrein at that place, he made the best of his way for Trincomalee, being apprehensive of an attack upon that place, or of the intercepting of a convoy of stores and reinforcements at that time expected from England. Suffrein had indeed got intelligence of this convoy, and was at that time on his way to intercept it. This brought the hostile fleets again in sight of each other; and as the British admiral had been reinforced by two ships of the line, he was now better able to encounter his adversary. A desperate battle ensued, which continued till towards night, when the ships on both sides were too much shattered, that neither could renew the engagement next day.\n\nThough these engagements produced nothing decisive, they were nevertheless of the utmost prejudice to the affairs of Hyder Ali, who was thus prevented from receiving the succours he had been promised from France; and he was still farther mortified by the defeat of his forces before Tellicherry, which place he had blockaded since the commencement of hostilities. Ali's forces here, however, was in some measure compensated by Braithwaite's entire defeat of a detachment of about 2000 English infantry and 300 cavalry under Colonel Braithwaite, a brave and experienced officer. This detachment, Tipoo Saib.\nment, consisting of chosen troops from Sir Eyre Coote's army, lay encamped on the banks of the Coleroon, which forms the northern boundary of Tanjore. Tipu Saib having procured exact intelligence of the situation of this party, formed a design of attacking it while no danger was suspected on account of the distance of Hyder Aly's army. He set out on his design with an army of 15,000 horse and 5000 foot, accompanied by a body of French regulars; and having crossed the Coleroon, suddenly surrounded the British forces on all sides. The colonel, perceiving his danger, formed his men into a square, distributing the artillery to the several fronts, and keeping his cavalry in the centre. In this situation he resisted for three days the utmost efforts of his numerous enemies, always compelling them to retreat with great loss. At last General Lally, rightly conjecturing that the strength of the English must be exhausted and their numbers thinned by such desperate service, proposed that the French infantry, which was fresh and entire, should attack one of the fronts of the square, while the forces of Tipu should do the same with the other three. This last attack proved successful; the British forces were broken with great slaughter, which however was softened by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> of the French commander; who even obtained from Tipu Saib the care of the prisoners, and treated them with tenderness and humanity they certainly would not otherwise have experienced. A number of British officers, however, perished in the engagement, and only one remained unwounded.\n\nIn the meantime, the succours from France, so long expected by Hyder, made their appearance. As soon as a junction was formed, they proceeded, under the command of M. Duchemin, to invest Cuddalore; which not being in any situation to stand a siege, was surrendered on capitulation. In like manner some other places of smaller consequence were reduced, until at last being joined by Hyder's numerous forces, they determined to lay siege to Vandervath, a place of great importance, and the loss of which would have been extremely detrimental to the English. This quickly brought Sir Eyre Coote with his army to its relief; but Hyder Aly, notwithstanding his being reinforced by the French, durst not yet venture a battle in the open field. On this the British commander proceeded to attack Arnee, the principal depository of Hyder's warlike stores and necessaries. Thus the latter was obliged to quit his advantageous ground; but he did so with such celerity and speed, that he came upon the British army unawares while preparing for its last march to Arnee, now only five miles distant. Perceiving that the march of the British troops was through low grounds, encompassed on most parts with high hills, he planted his cannon upon the latter; from which he kept a continual and heavy fire on the troops below, while his numerous cavalry attacked them on every side. Notwithstanding all disadvantages, the British commander at last closed in with the enemy; and after an obstinate dispute completely routed them. Neither this, however, nor any other engagement with Hyder Aly, ever proved decisive; for as the want of cavalry prevented the British general from pursuing his advantage, so that his antagonist was too numerous, that by it he always covered his retreats in such an effectual manner as to lose but few men, and in a short time to be in a condition to act again on the offensive. This was remarkably the case at present; for notwithstanding this defeat, which happened on the 2d of June 1782, he cut off an advanced body of the British army five days after; and harassed the whole in such a manner, that Sir Eyre Coote, notwithstanding his success, was obliged to move nearer Madras; soon after which, he was obliged, on account of his bad state of health, to relinquish the command of the army to General Stuart.\n\nHyder Aly now perceiving that he was likely to be attended with no success by land, began to rely his hopes on the success of the French by sea. He therefore earnestly requested M. Suffren, who possessed at that time a decisive superiority in the number of ships, to lose no time in attacking the British squadron before it could be joined by a reinforcement which was then on its way, and was reported to be very formidable. As the French commander was by no means deficient in courage, a third engagement took place on the 5th of July 1783. At this time the British had the advantage of the wind, the battle was much of the more close, and the victory more plainly on their side, French. It is said indeed, that had not the wind fortunately shifted in such a manner as to enable the French to disengage their ships, a total and ruinous defeat would have ensued. After the engagement, the French admiral proceeded to Cuddalore, having received intelligence that a large body of French troops in transports had arrived off the island of Ceylon, in company with three ships of the line. As this seemed to afford hopes of retaliation, he used such diligence in refitting his ships, that the fleet was able to put to sea in the beginning of August. His intention was to make an attempt on Trincomalee; and so well were his designs conducted, that Sir Edward received no intelligence of the danger, till a British frigate chancing a French one, which took shelter with the squadron at Trincomalee, discovered it by this accident, and hastened back with the news to Madras. It was now, however, too late; the place was not in a condition to resist a siege; and the French batteries having silenced those of the fort in two days, a capitulation took place on the last day of August.\n\nSir Edward Hughes having been detained by contrary winds, did not arrive at Trincomalee before the 2d of September, when he had the mortification to see the forts in the hands of the French, and that Suffren was in the harbour with 15 sail of the line while he had only 12. He did not hesitate at venturing a fourth engagement with this inferiority, nor did M. Suffren decline the combat. The event of the battle was between the French and no other than shattering the fleets and killing and wounding a number of men on both sides. In this, however, as well as in the other engagements, the superiority of the English was very manifest; and in entering the harbour of Trincomalee the French lost a 74 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUN\">gun</a> ship.\n\nThe loss of Trincomalee was severely felt by the English; for while the French lay safely in the harbour refitting their squadron, the English were obliged for that purpose to fall to Madras. Here the fleet was threatened by one of the most dreadful tempests ever known on that coast. Trading vessels to the number of...\nof near 100 were wrecked, as well as those for Madras laden with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>, of which there was an extreme scarcity at that place. Thus the scarcity was augmented to a famine, which carried off vast numbers of the inhabitants before supplies could arrive from Bengal. The continuance of the bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> obliged Sir Edward with his whole squadron to fail to Bombay; and there he did not arrive till towards the end of the year, when his squadron was so much shattered, that, in order to repair it with proper expedition, he was obliged to distribute it between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCK\">dock</a>-yards of Bombay and the Portuguese settlement at Goa.\n\nIn the mean time Sir Richard Bickerton arrived at Bombay from England with five men of war, having on board 5000 troops, after a very favourable passage; having neither seen nor heard of the bad weather which had desolated the coasts of India. It was likewise the intention of France to signalize the campaign of this year by an immense force both by sea and land in India. Exclusive of the forces already on the coast of Coromandel, they were to be joined by 5000 more, all regulars, from their islands on the African coast. Suffren was to be reinforced by several ships of the line, when it was hoped that a decided superiority at sea would be obtained over the English; while their superior numbers and artillery on shore would render them invincible by any force that could be brought against them. To oppose these designs, it was deemed necessary by the presidency of Bombay to make a powerful diversion on the coast of Malabar. Here was situated the kingdom of Mylore, the sovereignty of which had been usurped by Hyder Aly under the title of Dayro, as that of the Mahrattas was by a person styled Pajibar. This kingdom is nearly in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> with Arcot. To the northward is the kingdom of Canara, which is said to have been the favourite possession of Hyder Aly; the name of its capital is Bidnore, which also gives name to an extensive territory, and was by Hyder changed to that of Hydermangur. The expedition had been set on foot as early as the end of the year 1781; a strong body of forces under the command of Colonel Humberstone had taken the two cities of Calicut and Pannyan, besides others of lesser <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, and penetrated into the inland country, which is there difficult and dangerous. Having here made himself master of a place called Mongarry Cotta, of which the situation commanded the entrance into the inner parts of the country, he proceeded to attack Palatacherry, a considerable town at some miles distance; but being suddenly environed with a numerous and hostile army, instead of making himself master of the place, it was not without the utmost difficulty that he made his escape after losing all his provisions and baggage. A great army, consisting of 20,000 foot and 10,000 horse, under Tippoo Saib, advanced against him with such celerity, that the colonel had only time to retreat to Pannyan, where he was superseded in the command by Colonel Macleod; and soon after the place was invested by the forces of the enemy, among whom was General Lally with a considerable body of French. Two British frigates, however, having come to the assistance of the place, rendered all the attempts of the enemy to reduce it abortive. At last Tippoo Saib, impatient of delay, made a vigorous effort against the British lines; but though both the Indian and French commanders behaved with great bravery, the attack not only proved unsuccessful, but they were repulsed with such loss as determined Tippoo to abandon the siege of the place, and retire beyond the river of Pannyan.\n\nAs soon as the presidency of Bombay were acquainted with the success of Colonel Humberstone, General Matthews was dispatched to his assistance with a powerful reinforcement. This expedition, which began the news campaign of 1783 in the kingdom of Canara, has been related with circumstances to disgraceful, and to exceedingly contrary to the behaviour for which the British troops are remarkable, that we are totally at a loss to account for them. On the one hand, it seems surprising how the national character could be forfeited by a particular body, and not by any other part of the army; and on the other, it seems equally surprising why such calumnies (if we suppose them to be so) should have arisen against this particular body and no other part of the army. Such accounts of it, however, were published as raised the indignation of the military charged gentlemen, who thought proper to publish a vindication of themselves. In the Annual Registers, from this expedition hence, next to the gazettes and newspapers, the generality receive what they look upon to be authentic intelligence, the character of this army is treated with the highest asperity. \"In the story of the conquest and recovery of Canara (says the New Annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">Register</a>), the Spaniards may be said to be brought a second time upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a>, but not to sit down in fulness and infold prosperity after all their crimes. The Spaniards of Britain were overtaken in the midst of their career; and he who is more of a man than an Englishman, will rejoice in the irregular and unmeasured, but at the same time the just and merited vengeance that was inflicted upon them by the prince whose dominions they were ravaging!\" In support of this dreadful exclamation the following account is given of the expedition. It began with the putting in execution a design formed by General Matthews of carrying the war into the heart of Hyder Aly's dominions. For this purpose the English invested the city of Onore, situated about 300 miles to the south of Bombay, and one of the principal places in the country of Canara. \"It was taken by assault (says Dr. Andrews) with great slaughter, and plundered with circumstances of avarice and rapine that disgraced the victors; among whom, at the same time, great differences arose concerning the division of the spoil.\" \"No quarter (says the Annual Register) was given by the victorious English; every man they met was put to the sword. Upon this occasion we beg leave to transcribe three lines from the private letter of one of the officers concerned in the expedition. 'The carnage (says he) was great: we trampled thick on the bodies that were thrown in the way. It was rather than owing to humanity; but such are only secondary considerations, and to a soldier, whose bosom glows with heroic glory, they are thought only accidents of course; his zeal makes him aspire after farther victory.' This part of the peninsula had hitherto been untouched by the barbarous and unpitiful hands of Europeans, and of consequence was full of riches and splendour. In the fortresses of Onore were found sums of money to an unknown amount, besides jewels and diamonds.\nA considerable part of this appears to have been secured as private plunder by General Matthews. The complaints of the military were loud; they thought, and naturally, that the acquisition of riches was the fair and reasonable consequence of the perpetration of bloodshed. But their commander turned a deaf ear to their representations; and hastened, by adding new laurels to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, to hide the flatterer that might otherwise rest upon him.\n\nFrom Onore the army proceeded to the nearest fortresses on the sea coast, More and Cundapour. Here they were joined by a reinforcement from Bombay under the command of Colonels Macleod and Humberstone, with positive orders to proceed for Bidnure or Hydemanur the capital of Canara. On this General Matthews marched for the mountains called the Ghauts, where there is a pass three miles in length, though only eight feet wide, and which was then strongly fortified and defended by a vast number of the natives. \"The English (say our authors), however, had already obtained a considerable reputation by their executions; and the use of the bayonet, the most fatal instrument of war, and which was employed by them on all occasions, created such an extreme terror in the enemy, as to enable them to surmount this otherwise impregnable defile.\"\n\nThe gaining of this pass laid open the way to Bidnure the capital, to which a summons was now sent. An answer was returned, that the place was ready to submit, provided the inhabitants were not molested, and the governor was permitted to secure his property. The wealth of this city was undoubtedly great, but the estimates of its amount are very different. By the accounts of Bombay it was stated only at 175,000l., while the officers concerned in the expedition say that it was not less than 1,200,000l. or even 1,920,000l.; and even this was only public property; that seized upon by the soldiers, and which belonged to private persons, was undoubtedly very considerable also.\n\nThis treasure was at first thrown by the general to his officers, and declared to belong to the army; but he afterwards told them that it was all the property of the Mohammedan governor, and had been secured to him by the terms of the surrender. It was therefore sent to Cundapour under the convoy of Lieutenant Matthews, brother to the general, to be thence transmitted to Bombay; but whether any part of it ever reached that settlement or not was never known. The discontent of the army were now carried to the utmost height; and the contest became so furious, that Colonels Macleod, Humberstone, and Shaw, quitted the service altogether, and returned to Bombay. The officers charged their general with the most infatuated and shameful aversion; while he, in return, accused his whole army of doing everything disrespectful and injurious to him; of paying no regard to order and discipline, and of becoming loose and unfeeling as the most licentious freebooters.\n\nFrom Bidnure detachments were sent to reduce several fortresses, the principal of which was Anantpore or Anantpore. Here orders were issued for a storm and no quarter. Every man in the place was put to death, except one horseman who made his escape after being wounded in three places. \"The women, unwilling to be separated from their relations, or exposed to the brutal licentiousness of the soldiery, threw themselves in multitudes into the moats with which the fort was surrounded. Four hundred beautiful women, pierced with the bayonet, and expiring in one another's arms, were in this situation treated by the British with every kind of outrage.\"\n\nThis exploit was succeeded by the reduction of Carwa and Mangalore, which completed the reduction of Canara, when General Matthews put his army in cantonments for the rainy season.\n\nThis rapid success was owing to the death of Hyder Ali, which happened in the end of the year 1782. His son Tippoo Saib, however, having taken possession of the government, and settled his affairs as well as time would allow, instantly resumed his military operations. On the 7th of April 1783 he made his appearance before Bidnure, so that General Matthews had scarce time to collect a force of 2000 men, and to write to Bombay for a reinforcement. But, however necessary the latter might have been in his circumstances, the presidency were so much prejudiced against him by the unfavourable reports of his officers, that they suspended him from his commission, appointing Colonel Macleod to succeed to the command of the army.\n\nTippoo Saib now advanced with a vast army, supposed not to be fewer than 150,000 men, covering the hills on each side of the metropolis as far as the eye could reach. The army of General Matthews, altogether unable to cope with such a force, was quickly driven from the town, and forced to take refuge in the citadel. Tippoo having cut off their retreat by gaining possession of the Ghauts, laid close siege to the fortresses; which in less than a fortnight was obliged to capitulate. The terms proposed were, that all public property should remain in the fort; that the English should engage not to act against Tippoo for a stipulated time; that they should march out with the honours of war; that they should pile their arms, and have full liberty to proceed unmolested with their private property to the sea-coast, from thence to embark for Bombay; and in this capitulation the garrisons of Anantpore and other inland fortresses were also included.\n\nAll these terms were broken by Tippoo, who said that they had forfeited their title to liberty by a breach of the articles of capitulation, in embezzling and feigning the public money, which was all, in good faith, to be delivered up. That this was really the case seems to be universally acknowledged. In the Annual Register we are told, that \"to prevent too much money being found in the possession of one man, the general ordered his officers to draw on the paymaster-general for whatever sums they wanted. When the fort was surrendered to the sultan, there was not a single rupee found in it.\" By this circumstance the fate of the garrison was decided. General Matthews was sent for next morning to a conference. He was not, however, admitted to his presence, but immediately thrown into chains. Most of the other principal officers were, on various pretences, separated from the army. The general and his companions were conducted to Seriugapatam the capital of Mylor; and after having experienced a variety of sufferings, were at last put to death by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a>. In this manner the general and 20 officers perished.\nperished. The poison administered was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> of the cocoa-tree, which is said to be very deadly.\n\nThe above account was repeatedly complained of as partial, and at last openly contradicted in a pamphlet entitled \"A Vindication of the Conduct of the English Forces\" employed in that expedition, and published by order of the East India Company. In this pamphlet the circumstance most found fault with was that regarding the women at Anantpore, which was positively contradicted. On this account, therefore, the publishers of the above-mentioned work retract that part of their narrative, as being founded in misrepresentation. Notwithstanding this vindication, however, they still draw the following conclusions. \"It is already sufficiently evident, how little has been effected by this vindication of the Bombay officers. The great outlines of the expedition remain unaltered. It is still true that a remarkable degree of severity was employed in the field; that, in the capture of the fortresses of Canara, the principle of a storm and no quarter was very frequently applied; and that the acquisition of money was too much the governing object in every stage of the undertaking. The vindication of the officers has therefore done them little service; and it happens here, as it generally does in the case of an imperfect reply, that the majority of the facts are rather strengthened and demonstrated by the attempt to refute them. With respect to the conclusion of the story, the treachery of Hyderanagar, and the charge brought against them by Tippoo, that they had broken the terms of the capitulation, and that when the fort was surrendered not a rupee was to be found in it; these circumstances are pallied over by the officers in the profoundest silence. It was this that roused the sultan to vengeance; and it is to this that he appeals for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTIFICATION\">justification</a> in disregarding a capitulation which had been first dissolved by the vanquished English.\"\n\nThe vindication above alluded to was signed by one major and 52 subaltern officers. It seems not, however, to have given entire satisfaction to the military gentlemen themselves, as other vindications have appeared, said to be written by officers; but these being anonymous, can be supposed to add very little weight to that already mentioned, where such a respectable body have signed their names. We shall therefore drop a subject so disagreeable, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of which at the same time is entirely foreign to the plan of this work.\n\nIt now remains to give some account of the war with the Mahrattas, begun, as was formerly hinted, on account of the protection afforded to the afflatus Rogahaut-row. This man had formerly obliged the Mogul the Mahrat to take shelter in the English factory at Bengal; but being unable to keep up his credit among his countrymen, was expelled as already related. On his arrival at Bombay, an alliance was formed between him and the English government; by which the latter engaged to replace him in the Mahratta regency in consideration of some valuable cessions of territory. The supreme council of Bengal, however, disowned this treaty, and concluded one with the Mahrattas in the month of March 1776; by which it was agreed that they should provide for Ragobah's subsistence according to his rank, on condition of his residing in their country.\n\nThis being not at all agreeable to Ragobah, he fled once more to Bombay, where a new confederacy was entered into for his restoration. The council of Bengal approved of this on account of the approaching rupture with France; and in consequence of this, a detachment was, in February 1778, ordered to march across the continent of India. By some mismanagement in this expedition, the whole army was obliged to capitulate with the Mahratta general on the 9th of January 1779. One of the terms of the capitulation was, that a body of troops which were advancing on the other side should be obliged to return to Bengal. But General Goddard, the commander of these forces, denying the right of the council of Bengal to remand him, proceeded on his march, and arrived on the 18th of February. Here he received orders to conclude a new treaty, if it could be obtained on easier terms than that of the capitulation, by which it had been engaged to cede all our acquisitions in the country of the Mahrattas.\n\nSuch extreme disregard to any stipulations that could be made, undoubtedly provoked the Mahrattas, and induced them to join in the confederacy with Hyder Aly already mentioned. The war, however, was successfully begun by General Goddard in January 1780. In three months he reduced the whole province of Guzerat. Madajee Scindia the Mahratta general advanced to oppose him; but as he did not choose to venture a battle, the English general stormed his camp, and totally routed him. Other exploits were performed in the course of this campaign; during which the governor-general (Mr Haltings) seeing no hopes of an accommodation, entered into a treaty with the rajah of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOHUD\">Gohud</a>, and with his consent Major Popham reduced a fortress in his dominions named Quallah, garrisoned by the Mahrattas, and hitherto reckoned impregnable.\n\nThese successes were followed by the dreadful incursions of Hyder Aly already related, which put a stop to the conquests of General Goddard; all the forces he could spare being required to assist the army under Sir Eyre Coote. The last exploit of General Goddard was the reduction of the island of Salsette, and of a strong fortress named Baffin in its neighbourhood. The army of Scindia, consisting of 30,000 men, was also defeated this year by Colonel Carnac; and the Mahrattas, threatened by their losses, consented to a separate peace with the English, leaving Hyder Aly to manage the war as he thought proper.\n\nIn the mean time, however, the expenses incurred by these wars were so high, that Mr Haltings, who was obliged to furnish them some how or other, was reduced to the greatest difficulties. For this purpose not only all the treasure of Bengal was exhausted, but it was found necessary to draw extraordinary contributions from the British allies, which was productive of many disagreeable circumstances. One of the most remarkable was the revolt of Benares. The rajah of this country had formerly put himself under the protection of the English, who on their part agreed to secure his dominions to him on condition of his paying an annual subsidy to the nabob of Oude. In 1770 the rajah died, and was succeeded by his son Chait Singh, who held the sovereignty at the time we speak of. On the death of the nabob in 1775, a new treaty was made with his successor.\nsuccessor, by which the sovereignty of Benares was transferred to the East India Company, an acquisition <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to \u00a340,000 per annum; at the same time that the subsidy paid by Sujah Dowlah, and which, by Lord Clive, had been fixed at \u00a336,000, and afterwards raised to \u00a352,000, was now augmented to \u00a312,000 per annum.\n\nOn receiving intelligence in July 1778, that war had actually commenced between France and England, Chit Sing was required to pay \u00a350,000 as his share of the public burdens. Such a demand was paid with extreme reluctance on the part of a prince who already contributed \u00a340,000, and probably thought that an abundant equivalent for the protection enjoyed. The same requisition, however, was made the two succeeding years, but with a promise that the demand should cease when peace was restored. Instead of any present alleviation, however, a body of troops was also quartered upon him, and he was likewise obliged to pay for their maintenance, lest he should not voluntarily pay the additional \u00a350,000. In November 1780, in addition to all these demands, he was also required to send into the field such a body of horse as he could spare; but this requisition, owing to some misunderstanding, was never complied with.\n\nIn July 1781 Mr Hastings having, it is said, received some intelligence that the oppressed rajah meditated rebellion, set out on a visit to the nabob of Oude, and in his way proposed to clear up the misunderstanding with him. The method by which he intended to clear up this misunderstanding was to lay a fine upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> prince of \u00a340,000 or \u00a350,000; and as a reason for doing so, it was alleged that the late rajah had left a million sterling in his treasury; a sum which was continually increasing. Chit Sing advanced to the borders of his territories to meet the governor-general, behaved with all imaginable submission; and having got private intelligence of what was meditated against him, offered to pay down \u00a320,000. This was refused; and the governor-general having reached the capital, forbade the rajah his presence, and by a letter acquainted him with his causes of complaint. Chit Sing sent a very submissive answer; but as he endeavoured to exculpate himself, Mr Hastings was so far from being satisfied, that he put the prince under an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARREST\">arrest</a>.\n\nSuch an unheard-of proceeding excited the utmost surprize and resentment in subjects accustomed to regard their sovereign with a degree of reverence little short of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a>. On the very day of the arrest they assembled tumultuously, cut in pieces the guard which had been set on the palace, and carried off their prince in triumph. It does not appear, however, that this was any other than a transitory tumult; for though they could easily have cut off the governor-general, they made no attempt against him. Chit Sing protested his innocence, and made the most unlimited offers of submission, but all in vain. His government was declared vacant, and the zemindary bestowed on the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a>; the annual subsidy to the government of Bengal was augmented from \u00a340,000 to \u00a350,000 annually. The miserable rajah was forced to fly his country; and his mother, though promised leave to retire upon conditions, was attacked in her retreat and plundered by the soldiery. After all his endeavours to procure money, however, Mr Hastings found this adventure turn out much less profitable than he had expected; for the treasury of the fugitive prince was seized and retained by the soldiery.\n\nAs to the nabob of Oude, a new treaty was concluded with him; the design of which was evidently to cede the nabob of some of the burdens to which he was at that time of Oude subjected. Part of the British troops were therefore withdrawn from his dominions. As Fizulla Khan, the most prosperous of his dependents, had been called upon to furnish a body of 5000 horse to join the nabob's army, and had not complied with the requisition, the guarantee of his treaty with the nabob, formerly executed, was withdrawn; but it being afterwards discovered that his territory was not equivalent to the claims of the governor, the treaty was renewed on payment of a slight fine. As the widow of Sujah Dowlah was suspected of favouring the late rajah Chit Sing, the reigning prince was allowed to reclaim the treasures of his father in her possession, on condition of paying her a certain stipulated allowance annually. The treasures were seized as payment of the debts of the prince to the company.\n\nHostilities continued in India between the French and English till the year 1783 was far advanced, and long after tranquillity had been restored to other parts of the world. In the beginning of the season for action the governor and council of Bengal determined to send an ample supply to the presidency of Madras, that they might be enabled to put an end to the war, which Tipoo seemed willing to prosecute with even more vigour than his father had done. For this purpose Sir Eyre Coote, who, for his health, had gone to Bengal by sea, fell once more for Madras, being intrusted with a large sum of money for the necessary expenses of the war. In his passage he was chased for forty-eight hours by two French men of war. The solicitude and fatigue he underwent during this time, being almost constantly upon deck, occasioned a relapse, so that he died in two days after his arrival at Madras. His death was greatly lamented, as the greatest expectations had been formed of a happy conclusion being put to the war by his extraordinary military talents, for which he had already acquired so great a reputation in India.\n\nThe invasion of Tipoo's dominions having called him off from the Carnatic, General Stuart took the opportunity of attacking him in another quarter. Colonel Fullarton was despatched with a large body of troops to invade the province of Coimbatore. This he executed with great success; overrunning the country, taking several fortresses, and making a very alarming diversion on this side of Tipoo's dominions. General Stuart, however, having still greater designs in view, was obliged to recall this gentleman in the midst of his successes. The siege of the strong fortress of Cuddalore was the operation which now engaged his attention. It was now become the principal place of arms belonging to the French; was strongly fortified, and garrisoned by a numerous body of the best troops in France, as well as a considerable number of Tipoo's choicest forces. The siege therefore proved so difficult, that though the English displayed the utmost valour and military skill, they were not able to reduce the place until hostilities were interrupted by the news of a general pacification having taken place in Europe.\nthis siege a remarkable circumstance took place, viz. that of a corps of Sepoy grenadiers encountering and overcoming the French troops opposed to them with fixed bayonets. For this remarkable instance of valour, they not only received the highest applause at the time, but provision was made for themselves and families by the prejudices to which they belonged.\n\nAfter the reduction of Hyderabadd, and the destruction of the army under General Matthews, the English possessed only three places of consequence in the kingdom of Canara. These were Mangalore, Onore, and Carwa. The siege of all these places was undertaken at once. Mangalore, the principal port in the country, was defended by a very numerous garrison under Major Campbell. Tippoo sat down before it on the 19th of May; and the attack and defence were both conducted with the greatest spirit and activity. Notwithstanding the utmost efforts of the besiegers, however, and that the garrison were reduced to the last extremity for want of provisions, they held out in spite of every difficulty, until the general pacification being concluded, the place was afterwards delivered up. In other parts nothing more happened than an indecisive engagement between M. Suffren and Admiral Hughes; so that the British empire in Bengal was for that time fully established, and continued un molested by foreign enemies, till the ambition of Tippoo Saib again prompted him to invade the territories of the nabob, an ally of Britain. This again brought on a war with that restless, but able prince; in this war the British were joined by the Mahrattas, and the conduct of it was entrusted to Lord Cornwallis.\n\nAmong the various usurpers who suddenly rose to the rank of sovereign princes on the fall of the Mogul empire, Hyder Aly was the most successful. A master in dissimulation and treachery, he laboured, while in a humble station, to acquire the confidence of his superiors, that he might the more completely betray them. These qualities, so necessary to a successful usurper, were in time accompanied with considerable military skill, and great talents for government. Hence the power which he at first so treacherously obtained, was soon augmented by fresh acquisitions; and the territories which he conquered were governed with a systematic arrangement and rigorous justice, which speedily augmented their population, and increased his own resources.\n\nHis son, Tippoo Sultan, though far inferior to his father in the art of government, in moderation, and in the general steadiness of his character, was, however, distinguished in India as an excellent officer and intrepid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a>; qualities which effectually secured him the confidence of his troops. The operation of the system established by his father, and the warlike <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a> of his own character, continued to support the general prosperity of his dominions, which were enlarged on all sides by conquests from his neighbours, and were strengthened by a great number of the most impregnable fortresses in the peninsula.\n\nHence the power of the Mysoorean kings, which in its rise had been often contested, and sometimes defeated by the Mahrattas, at last acquired a decided ascendancy in the south of India. The discipline and fidelity of their troops, till their late aggressions on the British, had constantly been increasing in reputation; and fully evinced the excellent regulations which had been established for the army. The government of both princes was strict; that of the last, violent and arbitrary. It was still, however, the despotism of an able and warlike sovereign, who may rigorously check, but does not destroy those subjects which must form the means of his future aggrandisement.\n\nFrom these causes the extensive territory of the Mysores and its dependencies had not, in the course of many years, suffered materially, either from insurrection or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> invasion\u2014a felicity but rarely experienced in any quarter of India. When they were invaded by the British and their allies, under the conduct of Lord Cornwallis, the whole country was found in a high state of cultivation, and filled with inhabitants. The regular army consisted of 70,000 men; and the troops employed in the garrisons, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a>, and in the collection of revenue, amounted, by the most authentic accounts, to twice that number. This vast establishment was to completely furnished with artillery in the numerous forts, and in the field, that upwards of 400 cannon were found in the outskirts of the capital alone. The most frequent bar to the efficiency of native armies, is the want of regular pay: an obstacle the provident sultan had removed, by gradually amassing vast treasures, which he secured in the forts, or in the capital; and by improving his revenue, which amounted annually to upwards of three millions sterling.\n\nThe power and resources of the Mysoorean dominions, thus formidable in themselves, cannot be fairly estimated, unless we take into account their advantageous position and the character of the sovereign. Lying in the heart of the Deccan, and strengthened by innumerable forts, they command the adjoining frontiers of all their neighbours; while the restless and enterprising spirit of the prince has long obliged all around him to keep in a state of constant military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>, to them nearly as expensive as that of actual war. Few years were sufficient to elapse, in which their territories were not either menaced or actually invaded. The open and defenceless frontier of the Carnatic was frequently the object of these incursions; and the territory of our ally, the nabob of Arcot, had often suffered devastations that are still remembered with horror. The British, who were bound by treaty to be the protectors of this prince, had their own territories plundered extensively; and, on one occasion, had been forced to submit to an ignominious peace, which was dictated to them at the gates of Madras.\n\nThe French officers in India, many of whom had influence of long been entertained in the service of Tippoo, had the French communicated to his policy that marked hostility against the British nation, by which it was to peculiarly differ. A splendid embassy, which had been dispatched to France, returned previous to 1789, before the breaking out of the late war; which must be regarded as the commencement of a regular system of hostility for the entire overthrow of the British power in the east.\n\nAlthough the events of the French revolution operated to divert their attention from prosecuting the objects of this new alliance, the power of Tippoo had become so formidable to the British government, that the revenues of Madras and Bombay were inadequate to support the forces necessary for their defence. Large supplies\nsupplies both of troops and of money were required from Europe; and experience had fully proved, that unless the power of the kings of Mylore was reduced, the British possessions in the east could not be retained without incurring an annual loss to the state.\n\nHappily the power, talents, and ambition of the present sultan were fully known to the whole of India. His views of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> conquest had alarmed all the native powers of the peninsula; and both the Nizam and the Mahrattas were roused to combine for their own defence. Tippoo was the first Mohammedan prince, since the establishment of the Mogul empire, who openly disclaimed the authority of the king of Delhi, or Great Mogul. He was the first also to impress coin with his own titles; a mark of disrespect which none of the native governments had ever shewn. The great zeal which he adopted soon after his father's death, and which he affixed to all his public deeds, declared him to be \"the messenger of the true faith,\" and announced his ambition to appear as a prophet as well as conqueror. In the spirit of eastern vanity, he not only declared himself the greatest king on earth, but announced himself to be the restorer of the Mohammedan faith; and to avail himself of the enthusiasm of his sect, he invites all true Mussulmans to join his standard, and not only to drive the European infidels out of India, but to establish the empire of Mohammed over the world.\n\nAn ambition so openly avowed, and to an extent so inordinate, created immediate alarm among the native powers of India. It rendered an union peculiarly necessary between the Nizam and the Mahrattas; states who differed in religion, in government, and in every point of interest, except that fear, which combined them against this powerful adversary, who was ever ready to attack them, and who, in fact, already commanded their southern frontier.\n\nThe policy of the British, who had earlier foreseen the danger, led them to adopt a still more vigorous preparation than the native powers. Four additional regiments had been raised in Europe, and sent to India under General Abercromby and Colonel Muirgrave; and as early as 1788, there were in that country thirteen European battalions, consisting of 8000 men, besides the troops in the company's establishment. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">Earl</a> Cornwallis, and several of the first officers in the British service, were appointed to command them, under a new system, by which the powers of the governor-general and commander in chief were united in the same person. Thus the counteraction of different authorities was avoided, and every advantage secured which might give efficiency to the operations of warfare.\n\nHappily for the execution of those views of defence, the climate of the Mylore, like all the central parts of the peninsula of India, is temperate and healthy, in a degree superior to that of any other region of the globe lying within the tropics. The monsoons which deluge the coasts of Malabar and Coromandel, have their force broken as they approach the high mountains of the interior, where they fall out in showers, which, though heavy, are not commonly of long continuance. The verdure of the country is thus preserved; and the temperature of the climate is moderated throughout almost the whole year. The British army was therefore able to remain constantly in the field, during the whole war; and although they did not enter into cantonments, or leave their tents, yet the health of the troops did not materially suffer.\n\nThe military operations against Tippoo may therefore be divided into campaigns, not so much from the change of season, as from the success or failure of the British against Tippoo. Several plans of attack that were carried on against that prince. The first campaign commenced in the month of June 1790, and was directed to the southern part of the peninsula, with a view to relieve the rajah of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAVANCORE\">Travancore</a>, whose country had already been attacked by the sultan. During it, the main army was commanded by General Meadows; and before the end of the year, it effected the reduction of his rich provinces below the mountains; while the Bombay troops, under General Abercromby, conquered the valuable districts below the Ghauts on the west and north, as far as the river Balipatnam.\n\nThe second campaign was carried on by Earl Cornwallis in the heart of Tippoo's dominions. Though unsuccessful in effecting its ultimate object, it was distinguished by the capture of the important fortresses of Bangalore in the interior of the country; an event which fixed the seat of war in the enemy's territory, and was decisive of its final success. A successful battle was also fought in the vicinity of Seringapatam; and a demonstration made against that capital, which, from the advanced season and the swelling of the Cavery, proved abortive.\n\nThe last failure, which must in part be ascribed to the delay of the Mahratta armies, and the want of provisions, was speedily followed by the arrival of these allies, and by preparations for a fresh campaign. As these new efforts completely humbled the sultan, and produced a successful termination of hostilities, it is necessary to detail them more particularly.\n\nThe season of the year, which, after the battle in 1791, prevented an immediate attack of Seringapatam, was also unfavourable to the numerous draught cattle belonging to the army. They were infected with an epidemic disorder, which was aggravated by famine, and killed them in vast numbers; while the remainder, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>, became unfit for service. Meanwhile the scarcity of grain, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARRACK\">arrack</a>, and every article of subsistence, daily increased; this scarcity became at last so urgent, that the camp followers, which in India are four times as numerous as the fighting men, were reduced to the necessity of devouring the putrid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> of the dead bullocks; and to add to all these calamities, the smallpox unfortunately raged in the camp.\n\nSimilar distresses were suffered by the Bombay army, who, with infinite labour, had dragged their artillery for 50 miles through the most steep and difficult passes, in order to co-operate with Lord Cornwallis. Unable to form a junction, from the swelling of the Cavery and the badness of the roads, they were compelled to retrace their steps over those vast woody mountains, which form the immense and impregnable barrier between the kingdom of Mylore and the Malabar coast. In this perilous retreat, the battering train of both armies was unavoidably lost, being too unwieldy to be moved by the small portion of draught cattle which now survived; upwards of 40,000 had already perished since the commencement of the campaign. Disappointed\nDisappointed of the relief and assistance which the junction of the Bombay troops might have afforded, the position of the main army became a scene of the greatest distress. The tents and clothing of the troops, as well as their provisions, were nearly worn out. Great part of the horses of the cavalry were so far reduced by want and fatigue, that they were unable to carry their riders. The ground at Caniambaddy, where it had encamped for a few days to favour the junction, or to protect the retreat, of General Abercromby, was covered to an extent of several miles, with the carcases of the cattle and horses; and the last sight of the gun carriages, carts, and stores of the battering train, left in flames, was the melancholy spectacle which the troops beheld, as they pattered along, on quitting this deadly camp.\n\nFortunately for them in this dreadful situation, they were met, before they had finished the first day's march, by the allied force of the Mahrattas, under Purieram Bow and Hurry Punt. Every despatch sent to these chiefs had been intercepted by the vigilance of the enemy. They were astonished when they learned the disasters which had been occasioned by their delay; their arrival, which convinced their sincerity in the cause, produced general satisfaction in the British camp, and a conviction, that the ruin of the sultan, though delayed, must now become certain and inevitable. Tipoo himself, on seeing his enemies firm and active in their union, was not insensible to the dangers that awaited him. Before the allied armies left the vicinity of his capital to forward their preparations for a new campaign, he made overtures to Lord Cornwallis for the conclusion of a peace; but that nobleman would listen to no terms of accommodation in which his allies were not included, and which were not preceded by the release of all the prisoners that had been detained during the present and former wars.\n\nThe arrival of the Mahratta troops, amounting to 32,000 cavalry, however fortunate it might be deemed at the critical moment in which it happened, brought little additional effective strength to the allied army. Their battalions were unwieldy, irregular, and ill-disciplined; their force had declined as much as Tipoo's had advanced in improvement; and they were at present far inferior to those troops who, under Madha Row, had defeated Hyder Aly in 1772. Their chiefs were, however, overjoyed that they had effected a junction nearly on the spot where that signal victory had been obtained. They were pleased at having met the British army without having occasion to try their strength singly with Tipoo, of whose discipline and abilities in the field they entertained a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>.\n\nTo avoid confusion and interference, they were encamped at a distance from the British troops. Their ground, from the number of followers, and their families, had the appearance of a large town, or of a whole nation emigrating from its territory. The tents of the chiefs are placed around their general's, without any regularity or order. They are of all dimensions, and of every variety of colour, resembling hovels rather than canvas. The streets, winding and crooking in every direction, present the appearance of a great fair; in which smiths, jewellers, merchants, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, are displaying their wares, and as busily employed in their trades, as if they lived in their own capital, and enjoyed a profound peace.\n\nThe state of their artillery, upon which modern warfare so much depends, will at once demonstrate the imperfection of the military system among the Mahratta peasantry. In the construction of their gun carriages, they India make little use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, but for their strength they trust to the bulk and solidity of the timber: Hence they are General unwieldy from their weight, and clumsy beyond all belief; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a>, in particular, are heavy and low, being formed of large solid pieces of wood united together. The guns themselves are ponderous in the extreme, and of the most irregular dimensions; each is painted in a fantastic manner, and bears the name of some one of their gods. Not a few are dragged after the army long after they have ceased to be serviceable, from the great dilapidation they are held in, on account of past achievements which they are supposed to have performed for the state. Some of these useless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-IMPEDIMENTS\">impediments</a> of a march are dragged along at the immense expense of 100, and sometimes 150 draught cattle yoked in pairs. The most insurmountable obstacle to the efficiency of the Mahratta artillery, was the scarcity of ammunition with which they were provided at this period; subsequent improvements have enlarged this supply, and rendered them far more formidable to their enemies.\n\nThe infantry of this nation holds a rank, if possible, still more contemptible than their artillery. Its officers are half-caste Portuguese or French; and the privates consist of outcasts of every description, who are uniform in nothing but in the wretched condition of their muskets, ammunition, and accoutrements. The Mahrattas themselves hold them in contempt, ride through them on the march, without ceremony, or even the appearance of respect. If there happen to be a few Europeans among the officers and men, which in these times was but seldom the case, they execute the service, and till they find an opportunity of escape continue to deplore their fate.\n\nThe cavalry is the favourite portion of a Mahratta army; and it is to his horses, and the bazars, that the attention of every chief is almost solely directed. On marching days, the baggage and infantry move off at daybreak, while the chiefs and their principal followers remain upon the ground smoking their hookahs till they have advanced some miles; they then follow, each pursuing his own route, attended by his principal people; while the inferior ranks disperse over the country to plunder and forage in every direction.\n\nThe troops of the Nizam at this period joined Lord Cornwallis and the Mahrattas; their state of equipment and discipline was almost in every respect as bad as that of the Mahrattas. Their forces, when united, amounted to about 80,000 men; and if to these be added four times the number of camp followers, baniaries, and the carriage department, the number of strangers to be subsisted in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSORE\">Mysore</a> alone, cannot be much less than half a million. That no distrust, jealousy, or counteraction, should have disturbed the combined operations of such an immense multitude, must be ascribed to the unexampled moderation and vigilance conduct of the commander in chief. Such a vast army had never taken the field in India in the British cause;\ncaus\u00e9; yet no murmurs, or even the slightest appearance of distrust, were ever manifested by the allies towards the British commander. They submitted with implicit confidence not only to his arrangements in carrying on the war; but, which was little to be expected among allies so much alive to their particular interests, they acquiesced in his distribution of the conquered territories with a deference which evinced the most perfect confidence in his liberality and justice.\n\nThe steady cooperation, however, of any native power with the British army in the field, is a circumstance hardly to be looked for, and must therefore prove a resource on which no commander would choose to rely. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> will often be severely tried by their irregularities and delays; and in the most critical emergencies his views may be frustrated by their want of punctuality, or by a total failure in their engagements. Even in the article of provisions, the presence of the native armies, bating the temporary relief at their first junction, proved a much greater annoyance than a benefit; for it increased the number of mouths to be supplied, in a country defoliated by its friends as well as by the hostile armies.\n\nWith these coadjutors, Lord Cornwallis set out in the month of June, towards Bangalore. He determined on a new and circuitous route, northward by Naggemgumulam, that he might accomplish some of the important objects necessary to enable the confederates to commence another campaign. He had to enable the Mahrattas to withdraw the pows, which they had left on their march, when they advanced from Poonah towards Serigapatnam. He had to confine the sultan to as small a portion of his territory as practicable, and thus to oblige him to consume the provisions which he had laid up for the defence of his capital; and, lastly, he had to gain time for collecting and bringing forward the vast stores of camp equipage, provisions, and supplies, which he had ordered for the succeeding campaign.\n\nIn order to facilitate the communication between the Mysore and the Carnatic, from which the supplies were chiefly to be drawn; the various hill forts, which command the different passes, were to be reduced. Many of these fortresses, from their situation upon high and precipitous rocks, are of such strength that they have always been deemed impregnable by the native armies of India. In ancient times they formed the inaccessible retreats of the rajahs who still retained their independence; and it was not till the vigorous administration of Tippoo and his father, that they were brought into subjection and garrisoned by the Mysoorean troops.\n\nAmong these forts, Savendroog, Chittledroog, and Kifnaghury, are the most remarkable in point of natural strength. The first of these consists of a vast mountainous rock, which rises above half a mile in perpendicular height above its own base, which covers a space of eight or ten miles in circumference. This rock is surrounded by walls on every side, and defended by crosiers wherever it was deemed accessible. Towards the upper part, the immense pile is almost precipitous, and has the farther advantage of being divided on the top into two hills, which have each their defences, and are capable of being maintained independent of the garrison in the lower works.\n\nTo the siege of this tremendous fortress, Lieutenant-colonel Stewart commanding the right wing of the main army was appointed. The attempt commenced on the 10th of December, when this officer pitched his camp within three miles of the north side of the rock. The formidable appearance of the place itself, had with Savendroog drawn the attention of the troops from a circumstance which proved on trial the chief obstacle to the execution of their arduous attempt. It consisted in the formation of a gun road from the camp to the foot of the mountain. This was found a work of incredible labour, since it led through a long tract of rocky hills, thickly planted with bamboos; and after every effort, the battering guns were still to be dragged over rocks of considerable height, and at an ascent almost perpendicular.\n\nThis celebrated rock, so difficult of approach, and of such immense strength, is no less famed for a noxious atmosphere, occasioned by the hills and immense tracts of wood by which it is surrounded; the appellation of Savendroog, or Rock of death, is said to have been given it, from the noxious and fatal nature of its climate. Tippoo Sultan, sensible of all its advantages, congratulated his army on the infatuation of the British which had at last led them to an enterprise which would speedily operate their disgrace, and terminate in their ruin. One half of the Europeans, he assured, would be destroyed by disease, and the other half he was confident would be killed in the assault. The garrison which Tippoo had selected for the station of Savendroog were of the same sentiments with their master: regarding the attempt to reduce it as madness, they fortunately trusted more to its strength, than to their own exertions for its defence; and hence, little or no opposition was made to the erection of our batteries, farther than the ill-directed fire of their artillery produced.\n\nIn three days, during which it was found necessary to advance the batteries nearer to the wall, a practicable breach was effected, and a lodgment made for the troops within twenty yards of the breach. The storming party, which consisted chiefly of Europeans, was led by Lieutenant-colonel Niblet, and was divided into four different parties of attack, in order to secure both hills into which the mountain was divided, and to distract the attention of the enemy. Each party succeeded in gaining its object; for a large body of the enemy who were seen in the morning coming down for the defence of the breach, on observing the Europeans advancing to the storm, was seized with a panic, and fled. The eastern hill immediately above the breach, was carried by Captain Gage, without meeting, or even overtaking, the enemy; the main body of which endeavoured to gain the western hill, and, had they effected their object, the siege must have recommenced. Happily, however, the pathway leading from the breach to this hill is so steep and narrow that the fugitives impeded each other, and the assailants pressed them so hard, that they entered the different batteries along with the enemy. In these numbers were killed, among whom was the second killadar; and the citadel on the summit of the hill was at last gained, where the first killadar was made prisoner. So close and critical was the pursuit...\non this fortunate occasion, that a sergeant of the 71st regiment, when at some distance, shot the man who was in the act of shutting the first gate; and upon this occurrence, almost accidental, the fate of the citadel hinged. It was instantly taken, without the loss of a single man; although an hundred of the enemy had been killed during the advance, and many had perished by falling from the precipices in endeavouring to escape. Only one private soldier was wounded in this remarkable assault of the impregnable fortress of Saverdroog: it formed a display of successful prowess, fortunate almost beyond example; and it exhibited before the enemy, in open day, an instance of intrepidity, of high value to the reputation of the army and the interests of the India government.\n\nThe beneficial consequences of this important capture, were sensibly felt at the different forts, almost impregnable, by which this part of the country is so remarkably strengthened. Colonel Stewart's detachment, which had been so much distinguished by this achievement, marched in two days against Outredroog, another fortress strengthened by five different walls, and so steep as to prove tenable by a handful of men against the largest army. After the refusal of a summons to surrender, the lower fort was escaladed with such rapidity, that the killadar requested a parley. While this was in agitation, an appearance of treachery was discovered in the upper fort, where the garrison were seen moving and pointing their guns against the assailants. Fired at this sight, Lieutenant M'Innes led on the storming party with impetuosity; some of the gates were instantly broken, others were escaladed, till five or six different walls on the face of the steep rock were passed, when the troops gained the summit, and put the garrison to the sword. So panic-struck were the enemy, when they saw a single European above the walls, that they could make no resistance. The killadar was made prisoner, a number of the garrison was killed, and not a few, terrified at the approach of Europeans with their bayonets, are said to have precipitated themselves from the rocks.\n\nThe assault of these fortresses, which had hitherto been deemed impregnable, made so serious an impression on the enemy, that in none of the hill forts, however inaccessible, did they afterwards make an attempt to resist the British troops. Hence, the strong mountainous country between Bangalore and Seringapatam, which, studded with forts, had so much checked all communication, now afforded security to the convoys. These now reached the army without opposition; and the supplies of warlike stores of every description were as completely re-established as they had been at the beginning of the last campaign.\n\nTo prevent any future scarcity of the great article of grain, the commander-in-chief encouraged the native brigadiers, a class of men whose employment is purchasing grain where it is cheap, and selling it to the army. By constantly affording regular payment and a good price to these native merchants, they supplied the camp to an extent far exceeding what could ever be furnished by the most extensive carriage establishment. The grain-dealers had at this time passes for no less than 50,000 bullocks, whose rice was instantly paid for, as soon as it reached the camp, and orders given for purchasing more from whatever quarter it could be procured. This brought forth the resources of the enemies country as well as our own; for several of Tippoo's brigadiers, tempted by the certainty of payment and a high price, sold their rice in the British camp.\n\nSupplies being thus provided to an extent far exceeding every former example, the allied armies, and another the different detachments, were ordered to assemble for another campaign. The Bombay troops, destined again to act from the same quarter as last season, marched from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANANORE\">Cananore</a>, and arrived at the foot of the Poodicherry Ghaut in the month of December. Several weeks of hard labour were necessary to drag the artillery through woods extending near 60 miles, and over mountains of immense height. These mountains, which on the west command a view of the Malabar coast, and on the east of the country of the Myfore, form an elevated ridge towering into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOUDS\">clouds</a>, on which the rivers are seen taking their rise, and flowing in different directions, till they reach the eastern and western shores of the peninsula. The friendly territory of the Coorga rajah surrounds the interior of this formidable pass, where a small opposition might bid defiance to a whole army. This circumstance enabled the Bombay troops, consisting of 8,400 men, with all their baggage and artillery, and a supply of rice for 40 days, to penetrate with safety into the Myfore frontier, which they reached on the 22nd of January 1792. To facilitate the return of our army, batteries were constructed, and the defence of this pass committed to Lieutenant-colonel Pech\u00e9 with 300 men, a precaution which had not the sultan overlooked, he would have suffered no invasion on this quarter of his dominions.\n\nThe Mahratta forces, which had separated from the main army at Bangalore, had spent the season of the monsoon in a train of exploits which seemed to imply more than their usual share of activity. With the affluence of the Bombay detachment of three native battalions, they took the important post of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SIMOGA\">Simoga</a>, after defeating Reza Saib and near 10,000 of the sultan's cavalry. This brilliant success encouraged Purferran Bow to engage in an enterprise against Bednore, which had nearly frustrated the whole plan of the campaign, by protracting his junction with General Abercromby beyond the stipulated time. From this attempt, however, he was diverted by the arrival of Cummerud Deen Khan, one of Tippoo's best generals, who had been dispatched against him. This chieftain retook the fort of Simoga; but being too weak to encounter the Bow in the field, the Mahrattas effected their junction with the Bombay army, though somewhat later than the appointed season. The main army under Lord Cornwallis, which had been so actively employed during the rains in subduing the hill forts, and in collecting the necessary stores and reinforcements, was ordered ultimately to assemble at Outredroog, one of the strongest of Tippoo's forts, which was situated within 50 miles of his capital. This place, being equally spacious and strong, was fitted up as a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a>, and formed into a magazine for the grain and public stores that were not immediately needed for the army. The battering train under Colonel Duff, and the last convoys under Colonel Floyd, having safely joined, the main army was at last fully prepared to resume its enterprises against...\nagainst the sultan, who, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of his father, when formerly attacked in 1767, had encamped with the whole of his force in a strong position under the walls of his capital.\n\nOne junction more was still expected; that of the Nizam or Soubah from Gurrumcondah, the lower fort of which he had captured. This prince having left a strong force to garrison the place, marched again to meet Lord Cornwallis, who was detained in expectation of this event for several days beyond the time he had appointed for leaving Outredroog. On the 25th of January, the young prince at last arrived with his army; his youth and inexperience were put under the guidance of a minister 60 years of age, a man of great talents and established reputation. The confederacy, which thus united the chief powers in the peninsula for the overthrow of a formidable and ambitious enemy, was attended also by an ambassador, who arrived at this time, from Madajee Boonila the rajah of Berar. The Pehwa and the Nizam were themselves in the field on their respective frontiers, and all India looked with anxious expectation to the event of this important campaign.\n\nOn the 1st of February the allied armies marched from Hocleadroog, the last hill fort of which they had taken possession, lying at the distance of only 40 miles from Seringapatam. Tippoo's cavalry, which had been sent out to harass them on the march, made little impression, and were therefore chiefly occupied in burning the intermediate villages, and in laying waste the country. The last march of the 5th of February, stretched across a range of barren hills lying six miles north-east of Seringapatam. From these heights, a view of the whole city was presented to the army, and the encampment of the sultan under its walls. Every circumstance was eagerly viewed by our troops; and, from the sultan's position, it was evident he meant to defend the place in person, and to make it the grand concluding scene of the war.\n\nThe camp of the allies was pitched on the north side of the island. The British formed the front line, and extended its whole length on both sides of the Lockany, a small river which at this place flows into the Cavery. The reserve was placed a mile in the rear, to afford space for the baggage and stores; and the Nizam and Mahrattas were stationed still farther in the rear, to prevent interference with the British camp.\n\nOpposite to Seringapatam, on both sides of the river, a large space is inclosed by a bound hedge which marks the limits of the capital, and affords a refuge to the peasants during the incursions of cavalry. Tippoo's front line, or fortified camp, lay immediately behind this hedge, where it was defended by heavy cannon in the redoubts, and by a large field train advantageously placed. In this line there were 100 pieces of artillery, and in the fort and island which formed his second line there were above thrice that number. The redoubts on his left were entrusted to two of his best officers, and a corps of Europeans commanded by Monsieur Vigie; Sheik Anfar, a general of established reputation, was stationed on the right, and the Carighaut hill; while Tippoo himself commanded the centre, having his tent pitched in the sultan's redoubt. The fort and island, where there was the greatest number of guns, were entrusted to Syed Saib and other commanders. The whole army of the sultan, thus stationed, consisted of about 50,000 men.\n\nEver since the junction of the allied armies, Tippoo finding he could not keep the field, employed his chief attention, and the labours of his main army, in fortifying this camp, and in strengthening his defences in the fort and island. The country had already been laid waste in the former campaign; and the sultan seemed to rest his hopes, that the strength of his works and the valour of his army would protract the siege, till the want of supplies, or the approach of the monsoon, would again force his enemies to abandon their enterprise, as they had been compelled to do on former occasions.\n\nImpressed with these ideas, Tippoo made no attempt to interrupt our reconnoitring parties, who had been busily employed on the first day after their arrival in examining his camp. The distance of our position, and the absence of the armies under General Abercromby and Purseram Bow, increased his security; for he did not imagine that Lord Cornwallis would venture to attack him without their affluence; far less could he believe that a fortified camp, defended by the guns of his capital and a powerful army, would be attempted by infantry alone, without guns, and in the uncertainty of night.\n\nThe promptitude and spirit of Lord Cornwallis had suggested far different ideas, and a plan of attack which was bold beyond even the expectations of his own army. On the evening of the fifth of February, just after the troops had left the parade, orders were issued for an attack at 7 o'clock on the enemy's camp and lines in three divisions. The British camp was left to be defended by the artillery and cavalry; while the assailants who were instantly furnished with guides and scaling ladders, marched in perfect confidence that muskets alone would prove the fittest instruments for opening their way into the enemy's camp.\n\nNo part in the execution of this bold enterprise was assigned to the troops of the allies; nor was the intended assault even communicated to them, till after the columns had marched. It was perhaps good policy to conceal from them a measure so repugnant to all their maxims of war, and in which they could not possibly take part. This opinion seems justified by the surprize and consternation which they displayed, on learning that Lord Cornwallis, like a common soldier, was personally to lead the attack on the enemy's fortified camp. They not only deemed his success impossible, but they dreaded that the ruin of the allied armies would be involved in the attempt.\n\nThe three columns into which the assailants had been divided, marched with equal intrepidity to execute the different objects that had been allotted them; many obstacles intervened; various conflicts ensued in different quarters of the enemy's camp; each party was uncertain of the fate of the rest, and each individual of his associates. The return of day at last removed their fears and uncertainty, by disclosing the complete success which had crowned their exertions throughout the whole line of attack.\n\nThe right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> commanded by General Meadows had met with more impediments than the rest; it attacked and carried the end gal, a redoubt on the enemies\nmies left, which was defended by eight guns, and a numerous garrison, nearly 500 of which fell in this attack. Considerable loss was also sustained by the British in this redoubt. After its capture, the column was again formed in its original order, and marched with a view to support the centre under Lord Cornwallis; but mistaking the proper track, and making too wide a circuit, it reached the Carighaut hill on the enemy's right, which had already been carried by Col. Maxwell.\n\nThe centre column about 11 o'clock forced through the bound hedges, amidst a heavy fire from the sultan's redoubt and Tippoo's lines. These, however, were also forced. The troops were now enabled to cross the river, and penetrate into the island. So closely did they press upon the fugitives, that they would have entered the citadel along with them, but for the precaution of raising the drawbridge, which they had drawn up at the moment of entering the place. So precipitately had Tippoo been forced to abandon his tent in the sultan's redoubt, that his silver sticks, pikes, and mathematical instruments, were found scattered in the place. The fort being inaccessible from the removal of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>, the advanced party forced into the town or pettah, which had been almost abandoned for the defence of the batteries. Here they found 27 half-starved Europeans, loaded with irons, and confined in a dungeon. Some of these unhappy men, who were now relieved, had been cruelly given up to Tippoo by Admiral Suffren; others were deserters, whom Tippoo, however, had treated with equal severity.\n\nThe left division of the attack, which was commanded by Lieut. Col. Maxwell, was destined to take possession of the Carighaut hill, and from thence to descend and penetrate into the island on the right flank of the enemy. These objects were effected with rapidity, and but little loss, except in crossing the Cavery, which was deep and rapid, and at the same time strongly defended by the enemy's batteries. In crossing the stream, which at this place was neck deep, the ammunition was unavoidably damaged; but the troops pressed forward with the bayonet, and at last joined the other divisions who were now assembled at the pettah.\n\nThe enemy having lost all their positions on the north side of the river, where the siege was to commence, and almost the whole of the island, every material object of the assault was secured. On the side of the British, the loss, though considerable, was small in proportion to the importance of the victory, and the disasters of the enemy; of whom, it afterwards appeared, that no less than 20,000 had either deserted, or been slain in the various conflicts during this night of enterprise, danger, and death.\n\nOn the 7th, the enemy, as if ashamed of the rapidity with which their different posts had been abandoned, made several attempts to recover them. Their efforts were directed chiefly to the sultan's redoubt, commanded by Major Sibbald. Explored to the guns of the fort, and the batteries on the island, the major's little party defended the place for the whole day; and having successfully repulsed the different assaults of the enemy, they at last, weary of the attempt, desisted from the enterprise. The endeavour which the sultan's troops made to regain the pettah, met with a similar check; and the night of the 7th would have afforded some repose to the army, had not the rumour of an intended attack by Tippoo during the night, kept them on the alert. That such an attack had been meditated, there was full evidence; but both the chiefs and the soldiery were so much dispirited by the fatal train of events that had so rapidly taken place during the last twenty-four hours, that they could not be induced to second the zeal of their sovereign. During the various conflicts of the 6th and 7th, the fatigues and dangers of the British army were severe; and its loss in killed, wounded, and missing, was far from being inconsiderable (539 men). The extent and importance of the acquisitions gained by this brilliant contest seemed, however, to compensate every sacrifice that had been made. It now occupied the lines and posts from which the enemy had been driven; and the works which had been so completely fortified for the defence of the capital, now became lines of circumvallation for its attack. The troops on the one side were broken and dispirited; on the other they were in perfect order, and animated with their recent success. The Europeans in the service of Tip- poo, after the disastrous events of the last two days, now despairing of his fortunes, deserted to our army; and many of them enlisted with the Mahrattas; others retired to the French settlements. After their departure, the sultan's army never encamped in order, or assumed a formidable appearance.\n\nThe British army, now in possession of the island and the town of Serinapatanam, was immediately employed in making the necessary preparations for the siege of the fortres or citadel. This enchanting island being plentifully watered by the Cavery, and a vast number of intersecting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>, maintains a perpetual verdure; on the east, it is decorated by the buildings of the fort, which occupies a mile square; on the west, by the Laul Baug, containing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAUSOLEUM\">mausoleum</a> of Hyder Ali, adorned by tall cypresses, shaded walks, and a variety of trees, whose foliage and perennial verdure announce an everlasting spring. The mosques and religious buildings were converted into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOSPITALS\">hospitals</a> for the wounded and sick; and the trees, now for the first time felled by the axe, furnished materials for fascines and gabions for the approaching siege.\n\nThe proud mind of the sultan could not remain tranquil, on seeing his beautiful gardens and all his improvements threatened with destruction, by an enemy who was also preparing to deprive him of his citadel and all that remained of his power. His indignation was expressed by a continual discharge of cannon from the fort, directed against the island, the redoubts, and every party of ours that seemed within his reach. Some of his shot ranged as far as the camp, aimed apparently at headquarters; but the distance of the several posts was too great; and his ineffectual cannonade served rather to proclaim the wrath of the sovereign, than materially to annoy his enemies.\n\nTired by these repeated efforts, which he saw were vain, and worn out by the ebullitions of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a>, Tippoo at last began to meditate seriously on the necessity of a peace, the only means by which he could extricate himself from his perilous state. In order to smooth the way for his overtures, he previously liberated two British officers, who had been detained contrary to capitulation in Coimbatore; these officers, till now the victims of his cruelty, he loaded with presents, and made\nthem the bearers of a letter to Lord Cornwallis suing for peace. Another expedient, more daring, but far less honourable, was nearly at this time practised to attain his deliverance. A small party of horsemen were despatched to the British camp in the night, for the purpose of assassinating the commander in chief; as straggling parties of the Nizam's horse were near, the troopers, mistaken for friends, had little difficulty in entering the camp; and, but for an accident, might have effected their purpose. Detected, however, by their inquiries for his lordship's tent, they were fired at by a party of recruits; and such was the speed with which they made off, that they suffered little damage in this disgraceful enterprise, which is so often referred to by the princes of India. This was the second attempt against the commander's life during the present war: that both were unsuccessful, must be ascribed to that intoxication in which the natives are plunged, before they can be induced to venture upon such hazardous deeds.\n\nThough Tippoo had recourse to these vile projects, which he knew were countenanced by the practice of his country, he did not trust to them solely for his defence. The Bombay army which was at this time approaching, he combated and harassed by every effort of honourable war: its junction, however, with the main army was effected on the 16th; and on the second night after this event, the trenches were opened, and a parallel formed within 800 yards of the north face of the fort. General Abercromby, stationed on the south quarter with a strong detachment, was ordered to cannonade it from the heights. This attack being directed against the weakest part of the fort, occasioned the greatest alarm. Tippoo himself, therefore, at the head of his troops, marched to dislodge the general: being supported by the guns of the fort, he maintained the action for the whole day; but towards evening, he was forced to retreat.\n\nThis desperate effort was the last that Tippoo made for his defence. His affairs hastened to a crisis; cabals were formed by the chiefs, and his troops deserted in multitudes during the night. Plenipotentiaries from the allies, since that, had been treating with his vassals; his haughty spirit, hitherto untractable, was now forced to yield to their demands. He saw his capital blockaded on every side by a powerful army, plentifully supplied with provisions, which must infallibly reduce his troops by famine, should they even prove successful in repelling its assaults; even his last hopes of relief from the monsoon, and the swelling of the river, were thus finally cut off.\n\nOn the 23rd of February, therefore, the preliminaries of peace were signed by Tippoo, amidst the conflicting emotions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a>, resentment, and fear; and orders were issued to the troops on both sides to cease from farther hostilities; a stipulation, of which the dread of an immediate assault alone enforced the observance.\n\nBy the terms of this treaty, Tippoo was compelled to pay, as an indemnification for the expenses of the war, three crore and 30 lacks of rupees at two instalments, the first to be advanced immediately, and the second at the end of four months. Other articles of this instrument provided farther, that the whole prisoners taken from the allied powers from the time of Hyder Ali, should be unconditionally restored; that no less than one-half of his territories should be ceded to the allies; and that two of Tippoo Sultan's three eldest sons should be given as hostages, for the due performance of the treaty.\n\nThe candid and upright conduct of Lord Cornwallis had gained the full confidence of all the allies. So complete was the ascendancy he possessed over their councils, that they submitted without a murmur to all the arrangements which he proposed; a circumstance (considering the deep interests which were at stake) that must be regarded as not the least extraordinary in this campaign.\n\nThe terms of this agreement, which resembled a capitulation more than a treaty, were hard, and Tippoo with great difficulty was prevailed on to subscribe to them. Another struggle, perhaps still greater, yet remained for his family. This arose from the distress in his faraglio, on parting with his children. The sultan was entreated to request another day for making preparations for their departure; and Lord Cornwallis, though he had already dispensed with their accompanying the treaty, as first agreed, had the humanity to grant this request.\n\nAbout noon day on the 26th the princes mounted their elephants richly caparisoned, and attended with a splendid retinue left the fort, the walls and ramparts of which were crowded with multitudes of spectators. Amidst the vast multitudes whom curiosity or affection had drawn out to witness this scene, Tippoo himself was beheld standing above a high gateway, through which, as they passed, the princes were saluted by the guns of the fort; a compliment which they again received as they approached the British camp. They were seated in silver howdahs, attended by their father's minister, and a numerous retinue. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESSION\">procession</a> which they thus formed, was equally grand and interesting. It was led by several camel harcarras and standard-bearers, carrying green flags suspended from rockets, followed by one hundred pikemen with spears inlaid with silver. Their guard of two hundred Sepoys, and a party of horse, brought up the rear (c).\n\nIn this order the princes proceeded till they approached the tent of Lord Cornwallis, who had ordered a battalion of Sepoys for their reception; where the commander in chief embraced them with a cordiality and tenderness that resembled parental affection. The manners, dress, and appearance of the young princes themselves, formed an interesting spectacle to their European hosts. Bred up from their infancy with infinite care, and instructed to imitate in their manners the reserve and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a> of more advanced age, all present were astonished to observe the correctness and propriety of their conduct. Abdul Kallik, the eldest, was of a dark complexion, even among the natives of India; but his countenance was marked by thoughtfulness and intelligence,\n\n(c) For the substance of this account we are indebted to an eye witness, Major-general Dirom; who has favoured the public with an excellent narrative of this campaign.\nThe young Mooza ud Deen, was remarkably fair; a regular set of features, with an open appearance, rendered him the general favourite, and more admired than his brother. Clothed in red turbans and long white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MUSLIN\">muslin</a> gowns, everywhere sparkling with emeralds, rubies, and pearls, their external decorations displayed a brilliancy far surpassing every European idea of dress, and seemed to realize those laboured descriptions of splendor, which are in the western world only seen in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANCE\">romance</a>. Thus attired, the young princes, immediately after their reception, were seated on each side of Lord Cornwallis, when Gulam Aly, the head vakeel of Tippoo, thus addressed the British general: \"These children were this morning the sons of the sultan my master: Their situation is now changed: They must look up to your lordship as their father.\"\n\nThe conduct of the commander in chief had perhaps suggested this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>: he had in fact received the boys, as if they had been his own sons; and he again anxiously assured the vakeels, and the young princes themselves, that every possible attention would be shown them, and the greatest care taken of their persons.\n\nThe scene became more interesting; the faces of the children brightened up; and not only their attendants, but all the spectators, were delighted to observe, that any fears they might have harboured were removed, and that they would soon be reconciled to their change of situation. With regard to the youngest, this desirable object was likely to be first attained. He was the favourite son, and was said to be the sultan's destined heir: his mother, a beautiful and delicate woman, had lost her brother in a late action; and she herself had died of fright a few days before the attack of the lines. These circumstances, together with his own captivating appearance, drew to the youngest boy the greatest share of attention, and rendered his situation doubly interesting.\n\nAfter being regaled, in the eastern manner, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OTTER\">otter</a> of roses and betel nut; the princes were presented each with a gold watch from Lord Cornwallis, a gift from which they seemed to receive great delight. On this occasion the ministers of the Nizam and the Mahrattas attended with their suites; and when the ceremony of their reception was ended, the princes were led back to the tents furnished by the sultan, which were of a green colour, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMBLEM\">emblem</a> of majesty which Tippoo always had carried with him into the field.\n\nThe detaining of Tippoo's sons as hostages, may be deemed a rigorous condition imposed on that prince; the event, however, soon proved, that without this precaution, he never could have been induced, unless by a renewal of hostilities, to fulfil the terms of the treaty. The value of the money to be received, as well as the rents of the different districts to be ceded, were keenly disputed. When the territory of the Coorga rajah, in particular, was required, the demand seemed unexpected both by the sultan and his ministers, and was at first received with astonishment and disdain. This rajah was considered as a chief cause of the war, and Tippoo, therefore, wished to crush him. Lord Cornwallis seemed equally resolute in his defence; for he again manned the works, and threatened to recommence the attack. Happily, his stock of provisions was ample; and although upwards of 400,000 strangers and half a million of cattle were daily to be fed, the supply was sufficient for the whole; while one million sterling of the fine imposed on Tippoo, had already been paid. The firm determination of the commander in chief, aided by these circumstances, which were not unknown to the sultan, damped his resolution. His resentment cooled, and he finally implemented the terms agreed upon, copies of which were delivered to the confederated powers.\n\nThe war against Tippoo, which was now happily terminated, placed the dominions of the India Company and of their allies in a state of safety and tranquillity which they had never enjoyed since the aggrandisement of his ambitious family. In the former campaigns against the Myfores, the civil and military powers were placed in separate hands; measures were planned without either energy or uniformity of system; and their execution being entrusted to other hands, seldom displayed the promptitude or vigour necessary to their success. They had often ended in the accumulation of debt, without adequate advantage; sometimes they produced the devastation of the company's possessions; and hitherto they had uniformly increased the power and pretensions of the formidable adversary whom they were meant to subdue.\n\nThis war just concluded, was followed by effects suited to the energy and perseverance with which it had been conducted. The one half of his dominions was at once wrested from the hands of the common enemy; and while his power was thus diminished, an additional strength and security was conferred on his neighbours, by that impregnable barrier which was added to their territories. In the three different campaigns the sultan's loss had been great; in the last, it seemed almost irredeemable, not less than 67 forts were taken, 800 cannon fell into the hands of the allies; and the killed, wounded, and missing of Tippoo's troops amounted to 49,000 men. At the conclusion of the treaty very few places of strength were left in his possession; his treasury was drained, and the strength and spirit of his army completely broken. To the moderation of the British commander alone it was owing that he still remained a sovereign; for he was at last completely in the power of the victors. This moderation, but little merited by a cruel and vindictive enemy, he easily forgot when his power was afterwards revived, and he permitted his French counsellors to persuade him that he was again able to contend against the British government.\n\nIn the meantime, however, the India Company's advantages territories feebly felt the advantages of the treaty of this truce at Serinapatan. The presidency of Madras, which was most exposed to inroads from the Myfores, has by that event secured a chain of forts along its frontiers, which has ever since effectually freed it from the evils of invasion. The Carnatic, recovered from its former calamities, must improve its revenue, while it is defended at a less expense. The Malabar coast and presidency of Bombay has experienced, ever since the victory at Serinapatan, a state of still greater security than the Carnatic. It contains a country the most varied, and perhaps the most fertile in India, which under a regular government may be improved to an extent at present.\npresent almost inconceivable. Hitherto, from being a scene of constant war and bloodshed, it has not been suffered to develop its resources.\n\nWhile the relative situation of the British and the Sultan were thus improved by the pacification, the interests of our allies were perhaps still more essentially benefited. The Mahrattas have gained an addition of strength as well as territory, by enlarging their frontier from Daulatpur to the Tumuldra; and the Nizam has gained a similar advantage, being strengthened on the one side by the same river, and on the other by the Sanar and Gungecotta. Both powers are by their position placed nearer the aid of the British, to whom they must in future look up for their defence against all their enemies, as well as the aggressions of the Myorean armies. During the seven years tranquillity that succeeded this memorable campaign, the armies of both these powers, having no external enemy to call forth their exertions, gradually relaxed in discipline, and assumed a still more tumultuary and unmilitary appearance.\n\nOn the other hand, the troops of Tipu, from his unconquerable hostility to the British power, and from the secret intrigues of the French, were kept in a state of constant preparation, by which their discipline was improved. The influence of time, and the resources of a vigorous government, gradually repaired the vast losses which had been sustained during the three last campaigns. The power of the Myorean court had indeed been much impaired, but it had lost none of that antipathy and hatred against the neighbouring states by which it had always been distinguished.\n\nOf all the confederated powers engaged in this war, the British derived, perhaps, the smallest share of the direct and immediate advantages which resulted from it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a>-money shared by the army, although increased by the renunciation of the shares of Earl Cornwallis and General Meadows, was not great; and the territories that were ceded to the India Company being disunited and at a distance, seem to have been demanded rather with a view to weaken the common enemy than to add to their resources. Prior to the year 1799, the period of the final conquest of Seringapatam and the Myore, more than two-thirds of the ancient territory of the Mogul empire still remained in the hands of populous and independent states, professing either the Hindoo or Mohammedan faith. Among the latter, the Nizam and the king of Myore still held the chief rank, while five powerful Mahratta chiefs, the adherents of Brahminism, occupied the first station in the former class.\n\nSome of these princes, during the former wars in Hindostan, had individually arranged themselves on the side of the monarchy of France, against that of Britain. These rival and leading powers in Europe, had for near a century occupied a similar position in the east, which decided in some measure the fate of Asia. The republican councils, however, by which the French government had been lately subverted, embraced a much wider range in their foreign policy.\n\nThey attempted to form at once all these different princes collectively into a combination, which they hoped might become the instrument of their own ambition. Hence proceeded their warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROFESSIONS\">professions</a> of philanthropy to the natives, and their new-born zeal for improving their condition, and for rescuing them from the rapacity and tyranny of the British. The same unperishable thirst after external conquest and universal dominion which inflamed that nation to attempt those momentous changes, which were lately beheld in Europe, began to display their violence in the east, and to characterize the whole of the French policy in Asia. Confidential agents had already been dispatched over the territories of these princes; officers from France had been secretly sent out and appointed to their armies. For several years these agents had been sedulously employed not only in disciplining their troops, but in promoting among the native princes a combination for the purpose of subverting the British government, and for annihilating throughout the peninsula every power that might be deemed hostile to their own.\n\nThese schemes of ambition, wild and romantic as they may seem, have been executed with complete success over almost one half of Europe; and it must be confessed, that the power of the mighty confederacy which was projected in the east, was more than sufficient to subjugate the whole of India, had it been possible to effect the steady co-operation of its members in any common system of policy. A closer view of it will evince its power and efficiency for the execution of the most extensive plans even of French ambition.\n\nThe Mahratta empire, by being properly consolidated, must of itself command an immense force. Stretching throughout the whole length of the peninsula, from the bay of Bengal to the banks of the Indus, its population has been estimated at no less than forty millions of souls; while its known revenue has been found to amount to seventeen millions sterling. These resources, however ample, it must be noticed, are far more efficient in India than in Europe; they have there been found by actual experiment, adequate to the establishment and constant maintenance of an army of upwards of 300,000 men. Nor has the progress of the French emigr\u00e9es in communicating European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TACTICS\">tactics</a> to this immense force, been at all inadequate to the vast schemes of their policy, or to the magnitude of their undertaking; many battalions in the service of the Peshwa and of Holkar, but more especially in the establishment of Scindiah, have been found in a state of discipline that might have been deemed creditable in most European armies. Among the troops of this latter prince, the brigade of General Perron has long been distinguished by a system of tactics hardly inferior to that of the British Seapoys; it consists of about 40,000 men, who are regularly regimented and brigaded, and as completely clothed and accoutred as the British troops. The pay of this force is regularly fixed, a rare occurrence in India; and while in the field, its operations are sustained by a well appointed artillery, consisting of upwards of 40 pieces of ordnance.\n\nTo the charge of this favourite portion of his army Scindiah has for some time past committed the capital of the empire, and the custody of the venerable but unfortunate Shah Alam; a monarch who, it is said, has reached the uncommon period of 90 years; and who, it would appear, is more waited and broken down by an unexampled load of calamity, than by either the weight or feebleness of his singular age. The forcible restraints to which this unhappy prince has for many years\nyears been subjected, easily enabled the French party among Scindiah's troops to wrest from him the sanction of the imperial name, and the semblance at least of legitimate authority; a matter of some moment, as it served to screen the progress of usurpation. It was accordingly in the vicinity of the capital, and almost in the presence of the deposed emperor, that the projects of French ambition seemed to tend to maturity with the most steady and rapid course. Considerable advances had already been made towards the formal cession of the important provinces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGRA\">Agra</a> and Delhi to the French government, and towards their final union with that distant kingdom.\n\nFortunately for the independence of the neighbouring states, and the safety of the British empire, that nobleman who at this critical period had been appointed to the government of India possessed a complete knowledge of the character and views of the French nation. Soon after the arrival of the marquis of Wellesley in the east, his innate penetration, and unrestrained industry in acquiring the knowledge of Indian politics, enabled him to discover the whole range and extent of those plans of hostility which the French had meditated in Asia. He was fully apprised of the dangerous situation of the British empire in that quarter of the globe; and with equal promptitude and energy he employed the whole resources of its power in order to avert or repel the danger.\n\nIt was, however, at Hyderabad in the Deccan that the impatience and activity of French intrigue first compelled him to meet actual hostility in the field: an insurrection of the French officers there had wrested from the Nizam the whole authority over his army, and in fact, had already converted that faithful and peaceable ally of the British into an open enemy. By a sudden and unexpected movement of a small part of our army, that had been prepared for this purpose, these officers were all suddenly apprehended, and the allegiance of the Nizam, and the subordination of his army, were almost instantaneously restored. This first act of the marquis Wellesley, though scarcely heard of in Europe, certainly augured favourably of his government; for it not only paved the way to his subsequent success against the Mysore, but from its promptitude and decision it deserved to be ranked among the most meritorious measures of his whole administration.\n\nThe vengeance of the king of Mysore, for his former losses and defeats, had not suffered him to enjoy a moment of tranquillity after the late pacification (1). He had in fact been raising up a Mohammedan confederacy, which was to consist of the grand seignior, the Persian chiefs, the nabob of Oude, and the Nizam; and was intended for a purpose, no less splendid in the eyes of the faithful, than the extirpation, not only of the British, but of all the enemies of Islamism throughout Hindoostan. The army of this prince was fully prepared to take the field, but the fortunate event that has just been related, had deprived him of the cooperation of the Nizam, his nearest, and therefore his most efficient ally.\n\nThe native princes of India are in general far more prompt in imbibing resentment, and in learning maxims of hostility against their neighbours, than cautious or prudent in their application. Their French instructors were also, at this period, so much intoxicated with the new form which their own government in Europe had assumed, that they had instituted a society, in the capital of Mysore, for the romantic purpose of spreading the doctrine of liberty and equality among the depots and slaves of Asia. The sovereign of Mysore himself was easily persuaded to become an honorary member of this institution, where he appeared among its associates under the name of Citizen Tipoo, an appellation perhaps the most awkward and incongruous that had ever been assumed by an eastern depot. The wild and frantic orisons that were daily poured forth in this club, in favour of an imaginary liberty, were constantly accompanied with sentiments of detestation, and vows of eternal hostility, against the British government; its forces were therefore instantly prepared and marched into the field to meet an aggression, which there had been so little care taken to conceal. Past experience had taught the British officers to avoid the pursuit of a native army in its rapid and disconcertive evolutions in the field; the British, therefore, marched directly towards the capital of the enemy, which fell, but not till two decided victories had been obtained without its walls, and also an obstinate defence had been made in the interior of the city. In this last conflict (2), which was maintained by both the abjects and the natives with equal valour and obstinacy, much blood was spilt, and the lives of many brave men were lost, among the rest that of Tipoo Sultan, whose body was found, after long search, among heaps of the slain, where he had fallen nobly defending the last bulwark of his kingdom, and where, however unfortunate he may be deemed in other respects, he at last met with a fate not unworthy of his bravery.\n\nBy the pacification at Hyderabad, the fall of Serinapatan, and the death of Tipoo Sultan, the Mohammedan branch of the grand confederacy, which the French had raised against the British power in India, was completely broken and finally destroyed. For although the few remaining adherents of the deceased monarch made some desperate efforts for the restoration of his family, these were rendered abortive by the activity and vigilance of those British officers who had been left in charge of the conquered country (3). The campaign against the Mysore was, therefore, completed by a signal act of justice, as creditable to the government of India, as the late brilliant successes had been honourable to the British arms. The greater part of the vanquished territory was restored to the rajah of Mysore, and his ancient family again mounted that throne,\n\n---\n\n(1) Effectuated by Marquis Cornwallis.\n(2) This memorable attack was led by General Baird, who had been for three years confined in a dungeon by the tyrant.\n(3) Particularly by Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARTHUR\">Arthur</a> Wellesley, who signalized himself by the defeat of Doondea Waugh, the most steady adherent of Tipoo.\nfrom which they had been driven by the treachery and usurpation of Tippoo and his father; nor did the vengeance of the Brittili, though hurled with such destructive rapidity against the most formidable and inveterate of all their enemies, prevent them from affording sympathy and relief to the surviving family of the Myforesan kings; ample endowments were set apart for their support, which they still continue to enjoy, with perhaps equal comfort, and certainly with greater security, than in the most prosperous days of the fortunes of their house.\n\nThis train of important and successful events took place during the short space of only a few months after the arrival of the marquis de Wellesly, and they certainly entitled his administration to rank with the most active and brilliant that had ever been displayed by any governor of India; according, however, to his views of the state of that country, he must have regarded his labours as scarcely half finished. He saw the immense power of the Mahratta empire still remaining not only unbroken, but daily increasing, and consolidating under the active and unceasing operation of French influence. A French state, as already noticed, of large extent and formidable power, had been framed by the successive labours of Generals de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOYNE\">Boyne</a> and Perron, around the capital of India. This nascent power the all-devouring ambition of the new emperor had already grasped as a rich prize, and its destruction became therefore absolutely necessary to the safety of our empire in India, since, amidst all the multiplied aggressions of his neighbours, the usurper had uniformly distinguished the British nation as the marked, though perhaps not the ultimate object of his hostility.\n\nThe reduction of a hostile power so immediately in the vicinity of our possessions, might certainly have justified a war; but as no actual aggression had yet been committed in that quarter, it was on the other side of the peninsula that the marquis of Wellesly was again first called upon for the active support of the interests of his government: the danger became at once pressing and immediate by the usurpation of the whole Mahratta power by a single chief; and the cause of the fugitive was identified with our own.\n\nThe politics of India were never so refined, or considerate, as to admit of a balancing system, by which the overgrown power of any individual state might be prevented from endangering the independence of the rest. Hardly any circumstance of common danger has ever been deemed sufficiently urgent, to unite the native princes in the defence of the country even against foreign invasion. During the contest between the British and the king of Myfores, the Mahrattas observed a suspicious neutrality: they gazed on the combatants with an indifference that bordered on fatuity; and which strongly foreboded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of their state. After the fall of that kingdom, their empire actually fell into a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a> that demanded the most prompt measures of precaution for the safety of the British territories, and those of its allies, which lay around its frontiers. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of their empire, originally ill constructed and undefined, had lately been radically changed. The ancient rajas of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SATARAH\">Satarah</a>, who had originally laid the foundation of its power, and extended its influence over the peninsula with such unexampled rapidity, had gradually sunk from the rank of sovereigns to imbecility, and, owing to the personal ambition of their servants, fell into a station, if not of absolute privacy, at least of complete insignificance.\n\nTheir ministers, already become hereditary in their offices, and too powerful for control, had sufficient influence to remove the seat of government from Satarah, and to constitute the town of Poonah the capital of the empire. There, removed from the eyes of the princes, they no longer deemed it necessary further allegiance, than the semblance of delegated power; they accordingly retained the appellation of Pethwa, but compelled the subordinate members of the confederacy to acknowledge them as the legitimate organ of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXECUTIVE_POWER\">executive power</a> of the state, whether civil or military. It is, however, scarcely possible, accurately to define either the rights or the power attached to the Pethwa, after his being acknowledged representative of the supreme head of the empire. The extent of his prerogatives seems to have varied at different times, according to the personal talents and ambition of each incumbent in the exercise of this recent power.\n\nBajee Rao, the present Pethwa, from that imbecility and indolence which in Asia is so often attached to high station, had devolved upon inferior agents almost the whole of the active duties of his office. His power had frequently been disputed or controlled; he had at different times nearly become a prey to the ambition of the subordinate chiefs; and, at the period now under review, though defended by Scindiah, he had been completely defeated by Holkar's troops, and obliged to flee for security beyond the limits of his own dominions.\n\nThe danger to the British possessions, and those of their allies, became pressing and immediate, from this usurpation of almost the whole Mahratta power by the hands of a single chieftain; and the cause of the Pethwa thus became identified with that of our India government.\n\nA treaty of defensive alliance between the India Company and the Pethwa, was therefore drawn up at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> solicitation of that prince, and was finally ratified at Baillein, where he had fled from the aggressions of Holkar for protection. By this instrument, it was stipulated, that he should be restored to his dominions, and to the exercise of his legitimate authority, on condition of his maintaining, for the defence of his territories, and at his own expense, a brigade of British troops; which it was at first agreed should consist of 6000, but afterwards the number was increased to 10,000 men.\n\nThe terms of this convention were no sooner arranged, than the British army, under Sir Arthur Wellesly, marched towards Poonah with that promptitude and decision which have always distinguished the services of this valuable officer. The rapidity of his movements, and his unexpected advance, saved the capital from destruction; for the troops of Holkar, who had continued to pillage the city, since it fell into their possession, had at last resolved to finish the catastrophe, by setting it on fire. Alarmed, however, by the sudden approach of the British army, they fled from the place with the utmost precipitation, and soon after abandoned the territory of Poonah. Room was thus made for the peaceable\nable restoration of the depoed sovereign; and the Peshwa, when he afterwards arrived, was received by his subjects, not merely with submission and quietness, but with every mark of the sincerest joy and satisfaction. During his absence the inhabitants had been subjected to the severest forms of military execution; and forced to submit to the various exactions of a chief the most needy, desperate, and rapacious, of all the leaders of the predatory bands of his countrymen. When, therefore, they again beheld their lawful sovereign, they greeted his return by salutes from all the forts in his kingdom, and testified their joy by illuminations on the tops and acclivities of the hills throughout the whole vicinity of Poonah.\n\nThus far the measures of the governor of India wore an aspect of conciliation and vigour, which augured well in favour of their ultimate success. The justice of his interference at this time, to check the overgrown power of an aspiring adversary, and to succour the distresses of a fallen prince, will hardly be questioned by such as are versant in the politics of India: Nor will it be denied, since all the Mahratta princes exercised the right of making treaties themselves, that the same privilege belonged to the head of the empire.\n\nAccording to these views, the defensive treaty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-BASSEIN\">Bassein</a> was not only avowed by the parties, but freely communicated to the rest of the chiefs, who explicitly declared, that it contained no stipulations injurious either to the principles of their constitution, or to the just rights of any member of the Mahratta confederacy.\n\nOn the other hand, its advantages were sufficiently obvious. It had the immediate effect of restoring a deposed prince to his throne, and to the exercise of his acknowledged rights, as well as of checking a dangerous usurpation. It detached from the influence of French councils a very important branch of the Mahratta confederacy, and therefore coincided with the general tendency and spirit of the British policy in the east.\n\nBut the power of the Peshwa, and the predominant rights which, by the constitution of the empire, were attached to his office, had, as was already noticed, become a grand object of ambition among the more considerable chiefs. Scindiah had for many years laboured to gain an ascendancy at the court of Poonah, and on some occasions actually possessed a powerful influence on its councils. Ragoojee Boonsa had, from family connection, some grounds for the advancement of his own claims to this office; while Holkar had lately, by the fortune of war, had the whole authority placed within his grasp, and in the name of Amrut Rao, brother to the Peshwa, had actually begun to exercise its different prerogatives.\n\nThe final deprivation of these chiefs, of so fair an object of ambition as the general control of the whole Mahratta empire, seemed to reproach their indolence and want of ambition; and the nearer they considered its attainment, the stronger the jealousy and disappointment which its loss occasioned. The deep resentment thus excited among these chiefs, though unacknowledged by themselves, was the true cause of that open hostility which they were now about to commence against the British power. Thus impelled by the strong emotions of disappointed ambition, Scindiah and the rajah of Nagpore entered into a close engagement to frustrate the arrangements lately stipulated by the treaty of Bassein. In order to execute this purpose, each chief set on foot a large army, which was marched from different quarters to a point of union, bordering on the territories of the Nizam, an ally of the India company.\n\nThis menacing position they maintained for a considerable time, in order to complete their own preparations, and the more effectually to urge Holkar to join their confederacy; nor could they be persuaded to abandon it by the strongest remonstrances of our government against military preparations so unnecessary for their own defence, and in a situation so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with the peace and safety of the British allies. However unwilling the marquis of Wellesley might be to hazard the tranquillity and safety of the British empire in the east by entering into a contest with these powerful chiefs, whose dominions actually stretched over more than one-half of the peninsula of India, he had however no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a> left him. The full and positive information which he had from various sources obtained, of the nature and extent of the hostilities that had for some time past been meditated, was now confirmed by the menaces of the enemy, and the actual preparations that he had made to carry them into execution. He foresaw the dangerous crisis which was now to near at hand; and the hollow profession of friendships which were constantly sent in reply to his remonstrances, did not for a moment prevent him from bringing forward the whole resources of his government to defeat their enterprises.\n\nA combination of the Mahratta empire, so extensive, armies so vast and powerful as that now formed by the confederates, had never hitherto been brought into action against the British power; and it must be acknowledged also, that a system of defence, equally prompt, vigorous, and comprehensive, was never planned by any former governor of British India. Five different armies, each of considerable force, were speedily prepared, brought into the field, and ready to invade the vast territory of the enemy, nearly at the same period of time. The value of the previous arrangements that had been formed with the Nizam and the Peshwa, particularly the subsidiary treaties, was now distinctly felt. By them the British army was enabled to proceed through the friendly territories of allied chiefs, to the very boundary of the Mahratta dominions, where it was joined by a large subsidiary force both from Hyderabad and Poonah, which materially promoted the success of the campaign. The marquis thus was enabled to attack the extensive dominions of the enemy, from almost every available point, by an effort almost simultaneous.\n\nOn the fourth they were invaded by a powerful division of the Madras army under Sir Arthur Wellesley; in Guzerat, on the west, by Colonel Murray, and a strong detachment of the Bombay troops; a similar effort was also made by General Lake on the northern extremity of Scindiah's dominions, where the main strength of his army was stationed in conjunction with the celebrated brigade of General Perron. On the east, in Bundelcund, the same system of attack was pursued, where the adherents of the confederacy Ali Mohammed and Himmat Bahadur were overpowered and dispersed. During the execution of all these operations, the provinces of Balafore and Cuttack were wrested from the rajah of Nagpore, by the immediate direction and under the auspices of the governor-general.\nTheir immediate consequences were the defeat of the combined armies of the confederate chiefs; and, from the loss of their artillery, an irreparable blow to their strength and resources throughout the whole of India. Their prosperity results were, no doubt, aided and accelerated by the auspicious progress of the army at all the different points from which it invaded the Mahratta empire. Soon after these successes, the French officers attached to Scindiah's army, after having quarrelled with the native soldiers and with each other, abandoned the service of that chief; after the example of Perron their principal partizan, they submitted to the protection of the British commander, who suffered them to retire with whatever property they had acquired, and had been able to bring away.\n\nThus the grand fabric of French power which that nation had been anxiously raising up, with the assumed sanction of the imperial authority, and the more efficient support of the Mahratta power, was at last broken down, and completely destroyed throughout the whole of India. The conquest of Balafores and Cuttack by Colonel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARCOURT\">Harcourt</a> seemed well calculated to prevent its future renovation; for it connected the two presidencies of Bengal and Madras, and united the British territories along the whole extent of the Coromandel coast, where they now present an unbroken and hostile frontier against every incursion from the shore, and form a barrier against the introduction of French supplies, and officers to discipline the armies of every inimical power.\n\nThe strong detachment of the Bombay army under Colonel Murray, though engaged in enterprises apparently less splendid, were equally serviceable in promoting the important results of the campaign. This officer not only defended the coast and British territory in that quarter, and those of our ally the Guicar rajah; but he also reduced the fortresses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROACH\">Broach</a>, Povanghur, and other posts of importance. Thus, in every quarter of this extended warfare, was the British cause triumphant;\u2014on the shores of Guzerat and Balafores, on the mountains of the Deccan, and in the plains of Delhi, her banners were supported with equal energy and spirit; and victory everywhere continued steadily to follow them.\n\nIn the space of a few months, a rapid succession of events had taken place, of sufficient importance to change completely the relative condition of the British empire, and the different powers of India. Its power was enlarged; and its ascendancy among the neighbouring states was without control. Seven hundred pieces of cannon had been taken from the enemy; their armies routed and dispersed. Eight fortresses had been reduced, either by siege or by escalade. The mighty strength of the French and Mahratta confederacy had been suddenly crushed throughout a territory extending over 1000 miles square. What seemed, however, of no less importance, in these warlike times, and in the critical situation of the British empire, then attacked and threatened with invasion, by its most powerful and inveterate enemy in Europe; her military reputation was heightened; the laurels she had lately gathered in Syria and Egypt were refreshed; and she enjoyed a satisfactory proof, that amidst increasing luxury and imminent danger, no portion of the enterprise and valour of her armies had been lost. Nor is it to be forgotten...\ngotten that all her late victories in the east, had been obtained over troops, not in the ordinary circumstances of Indian armies. They had been disciplined by European officers, and led with intrepidity and skill. The proficiency they had made in European tactics was so great, that during the action at Affye, the Mahrattas made no less than five different changes of position, and sustained on the same day an equal number of assaults, before they yielded the contest. It was by the point of the bayonet alone, that they were at last compelled to relinquish their guns; 100 of which were taken on the field of battle, by an army scarcely amounting to a tenth-part of the number of that which they had, with such singular bravery, driven from the field.\n\nThe Mahratta confederacy being finally subdued, a peace was concluded between the India Company, Dowlut Rao Scindia, and the Berar rajah, in January 1804. The short period of tranquillity that succeeded this event, was speedily interrupted by Holkar, another powerful chief, whose expulsion of the Peshwa had originally occasioned the war. This prince, though he kept aloof from the confederacy of his countrymen, with an indifference which seemed to argue at once a deficiency of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a> and a want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> policy, was, nevertheless, found to maintain the contest for his independence with far greater skill and bravery than any prince whom the British arms had opposed in India.\n\nThe power and resources of Holkar had gradually been increased, like that of the other chiefs, by the introduction of European officers into his army, and by an improved system of discipline which was thus established. Thus formidable itself, his power was rendered almost unavailable, from the nature of his country, which is uncommonly mountainous, and, during the rains, impassable from jungles and morasses. His skill in maintaining the predatory warfare, so congenial to a Mahratta army, was far superior to that of the other chiefs; whose experience had so fully taught him the danger of risking any regular engagement with European troops. Thus, although his territories were invaded on all sides by detachments of the company's forces, he constantly eluded their attacks; and by the singular rapidity of his movements, he was enabled suddenly to assemble almost his whole force, and overpower whatever detachments he might find at a distance from support. In this situation, the troops under Colonel Monson were surprised. This officer had marched against his capital Indore, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> with Colonel Murray, who had reached the place from Bombay, and captured it without much opposition. His less fortunate coadjutor, however, after being betrayed by his guides, and deserted by a part of his troops, was attacked by a superior force, under Holkar himself, before which he was forced to retreat towards Agra, through a country impassable from the rains, and destitute of provisions. After several disastrous conflicts, during a retreat of seven weeks, which degenerated into a flight, the greater part of his guns, and the whole of the baggage and military stores, were lost. A few only of the troops reached Agra at midnight, in a state of extreme distress; the greater part had been overtaken in their flight, and were either massacred, or cruelly mutilated, by their ferocious pursuers.\n\nColonel Willot of the Bengal artillery was almost equally unsuccessful in an attack which he had planned against a strong post in the interior; he failed in the attempt; and soon after died of the wounds he had received. It was in Bundelcund, and the country of the Rohillas, that Holkar received the most considerable checks, which produced a reverse of fortune. From both those territories he was completely driven by Lieutenant-colonel Fawcett and General Smith.\n\nParties of his cavalry had been repeatedly defeated by Lord Lake; but the rapidity of their movements as often saved them from destruction; and it was not till the decisive battle of Deeg, on the 13th of November, that the main strength of this enterprising chief was completely broken. At this place, his army, trusting to the great strength of its position, behind succussive ranges of batteries, was induced to hazard a general action. From these different batteries, which extended to the depth of two miles, they were successively driven by the gallant General Frazer, who had the credit of forcing a post which had been deemed impregnable; and which at this period was defended by 24 battalions of infantry, and 150 pieces of cannon.\n\nIn this brilliant achievement the general was wounded in the leg, and soon after was obliged to be carried off the field. The completion of the victory thus fell to Colonel Monson, who now saw complete vengeance inflicted for his past disasters, and for the unexampled cruelty of his enemy; 2000 of whom were killed, either in the battle or during the retreat. An immense number was wounded, and among those many considerable chiefs; while 87 pieces of cannon fell into his hands, which partly consisted of the same guns which he had himself lost during his disastrous retreat to Agra.\n\nHad Holkar confined merely to his effective force in the field, his cause might have now been regarded as desperate. His boldness, however, and his unexampled success, had gained him the support of several of the native princes. Among these he had seduced the rajah of Bhurtpore, an ally of the British, and the chief of the celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> of the Jats, the most warlike <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> in upper India. General Lake was therefore obliged to concentrate his army, and to employ it in the reduction of Bhurtpore, a fortress which experience has proved to have been the strongest and most impregnable in the whole peninsula. While thus employed, the dispersed troops of Holkar had time to rendezvous in distant quarters; and were successful in cutting off his supplies of provisions, and in plundering the surrounding districts, by that predatory mode of warfare, for which the Mahrattas have always been celebrated.\n\nThe reduction of Bhurtpore, thus defended by the indefatigable efforts of Holkar, by its intrepid garrison, and its own natural strength, proved the most arduous enterprise which the British troops had ever undertaken in Asia. The success of the besieged in repelling four different assaults, animated them with fresh courage, and intrepidity. The rajah and his whole tribe were united by the ties of blood, as well as of civil authority. They had claim to a high caste among the natives, which they knew must be forfeited forever by unconditional submission: Unfortunately these were the only terms which General Lake, in the peremptory instructions which were given for its reduction, was permitted to accept. The rajah, therefore, having collected in\nthe fort, his women, his children, and his treasures, resolved to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> them all with himself under its ruins, rather than submit to terms which were deemed as disgraceful to his religion and his rank, as they were mortifying to his feelings as a soldier.\n\nCompelled by the orders of his superior, and undaunted by all the past disasters which the troops had already suffered, General Lake resolved to hazard another attempt. In the account given of it in his dispatch to the governor-general, dated 22nd February, he observes, that \"it appeared our failure on the 20th was to be accounted for, in a great measure, by the occurrence of unexpected accidents and delays, as part of the corps who formed the forlorn party had surmounted the principal difficulty, and had nearly gained the summit of the battalion; where, I was informed, a few hours more battering would make the ascent perfectly easy, I determined to make another attempt yesterday.\"\n\n\"The party for this service consisted of the whole European force, and the two battalions of the native infantry of the Bengal army; and the greater part of his majesty's 55th and 86th regiments, the grenadier battalion, and the flank companies of the 1st battalion 3rd regiment, from the Bombay division. The whole moved on to the attack about three o'clock in the afternoon, under the command of the honourable Brigadier Monson. The troops, most confident of success, commenced the attack, and persevered in it for a considerable time, with the most determined bravery; but their utmost exertions were not sufficient to enable them to gain the top of the breach. The battalion, which was the point of attack, was extremely steep; the resistance opposed to them was vigorous, and as our men could only mount by small parties at a time, the advantages were very great on the side of the enemy. Discharges of grape, logs of wood, and pots filled with combustible materials, immediately knocked down those who were ascending; and the whole party, after having engaged in an obstinate contest for two hours, and suffering very severe loss, was obliged to relinquish the attempt, and to retire to our trenches.\" The loss of the British army in this last assault, and that of the 20th, amounted to 300 killed, and 1,664 wounded; its whole loss during the different attacks, amounted to upwards of 3,000 of the bravest of our troops; while the unconditional surrender of the place, though the ultimate object of all these perilous attempts, was never attained.\n\nThe Rajah, however, again proposed the terms he had formerly offered; and contended to pay three lacks of rupees to the army, and the expenses of the war. Hostages were given for the regular discharge of these sums, at different instalments. Thus the last prince in India who resisted the British arms, was found to have made the most glorious defence of his independence, and to have secured for himself the most honourable terms. Holkar himself, after having been often beaten, was at last defeated by almost the whole of his troops, and was obliged to escape with a retinue so scanty, as was hardly sufficient for the protection of his person. In this manner, an arduous campaign of 11 months was completed, after occasioning a greater loss of blood and treasure than had, perhaps, ever been incurred by the subjugation of any single chief. Nor did this daring and magnificent prince deign to tender submission, or to sue for peace, till the marquis of Wellesley had returned to Europe; till he had beheld the downfall of all the leading men of his nation; and till, like another Gallicus, he had secured to himself the honour of being the last prince who had dared to uphold the standard of independence in his native country.\n\nThus ended the contest between the British government and the Mahratta states\u2014a combination of military chiefs who had suddenly emerged from obscurity, and rose to the highest rank among the native powers. Their growing influence had invariably been hostile both to the Mohammedan and British power. Their vicinity was the fertile source of intrigue, stratagem, and war: By their downfall, the India Company has obtained a full ascendancy over the peninsula; time and future experience will show whether this new authority shall better promote the peace and prosperity of that populous country.\n\n**INDIA COMPANY.** See COMPANY.\n\n**INDIA RUBBER.** See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAOUTCHOUC\">CAOUTCHOUC</a>.\n\n**INDIAN,** in a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, denotes anything belonging to the Indies, East or West.\n\n**INDIAN BERRY.** See MENISPERMUM.\n\n**INDIAN <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">BREAD</a>.** See JATROPHA.","sp":199,"ep":258},{"h":"INDIAN CORN","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Maize.** See ZEA.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">INDIAN</a> CREEPS.** See TROPHELUM.\n\n**INDIAN FIG.** See CACTUS.\n\n**INDIAN POGO-TREE.** See FICUS.\n\n**INDIAN <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INK\">INK</a>.** See ISK.\n\n**INDIAN REED.** See CANNA, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">BOTANY</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">INDEX</a>.\n\n**INDICATION,** in Physic, whatever serves to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the physician how to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>.\n\n**INDICATIVE,** in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">Grammar</a>, the first mood or manner of conjugating a verb, by which we simply affirm, deny, or ask something: as, *amant,* \"they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>;\" *non amant,* \"they do not love;\" *amant ne?* \"do they love?\" See GRAMMAR.\n\n**INDICTION,** in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">Chronology</a>, a cycle of 15 years.

They ought to be freeholders; but to what amount is uncertain: which seems to be *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a> usum omnium,* and as proper to be supplied by the legislature as the qualifications of the petit jury; which were formerly equally vague and uncertain, but are now settled by several acts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>. However, they are usually gentlemen of the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> in the county. As many as appear upon this panel, are sworn upon the grand jury, to the amount of twelve at the least, and not more than twenty-three; that twelve may be a majority. Which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, as well as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> itself, we find exactly described so early as the laws of King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ETHELRED\">Ethelred</a>: *Exeunt seniores duodecim thani, et praefectus cum eis, ut juret.*\nIndictment jurent super sanctuarium quod eis in manus datur, quod nonint ullam innocentum acculae, nec aliquem noxium celere. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of King Richard I. (according to Hoveden), the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of electing the grand jury, ordained by that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, was as follows: Four knights were to be taken from the county at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, who chose two more out of every hundred; which two associated to themselves ten other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> freemen, and those twelve were to answer concerning all particulars relating to their own district. This number was probably found too large and inconvenient; but the traces of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> still remain, in that some of the jury must be summoned out of every hundred. This grand jury are previously instructed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of their inquiry, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> from the judge who presides upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENCH\">bench</a>. They then withdraw to sit and receive indictments, which are preferred to them in the name of the king, but at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> of any private prosecutor; and they are only to hear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> on behalf of the prosecution: for the finding of an indictment is only in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of an inquiry or accusation, which is afterwards to be tried and determined; and the grand jury are only to inquire upon their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a>, whether there be sufficient cause to call upon the party to answer it. A grand jury, however, ought to be thoroughly persuaded of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of an indictment, so far as their evidence goes; and not to rest satisfied merely with remote probabilities: a doctrine that might be applied to very oppressive purposes.\n\nThe grand jury are sworn to inquire only for the body of the county, pro corpore comitatus; and therefore they cannot regularly inquire of a fact done out of that county for which they are sworn, unless particularly enabled by act of parliament. And to so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> a nicety was this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> anciently carried, that where a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> was wounded in one county, and died in another, the offender was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> law indictable in neither, because <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> complete act of felony was done in any one of them: but by statute 2d and 3d Edw. VI. c. 24, he is now indictable in the county where the party died. And, by statute 2 Geo. II. c. 21, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the stroke or poisoning be in England, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> or out of England, or vice versa, the offenders, and their accessories, may be indicted in the county where either the death, poisoning, or stroke, shall happen. And so in some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>; as particularly, where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a> is committed out of the realm, it may be inquired of in any county within the realm, as the king shall direct, in pursuance of statutes 26 Hen. VIII. c. 13, 33.; Hen. VIII. c. 23, 35.; Hen. VIII. c. 2, 5, 6.; Edw. VI. c. 11. And counterfeiters, washers, or minishers, of the current <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a>, together with all manner of felons and their accessories, may, by statute 26 Hen. VIII. c. 6. (confirmed and explained by 34 and 35 Hen. VIII. c. 26, \u00a7 75, 76.) be indicted and tried for those offenses, if committed in any part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, before the justices of gaol-delivery and of the peace, in the next adjoining county of England, where the king's writ runneth: that is, at present in the county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEREFORD\">Hereford</a> or Salop; and not, as it should seem, in the county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHESTER\">Chester</a> or Monmouth: the one being a county palatine where the king's writ did not run; and the other a part of Wales, in 26 Hen. VIII. Murders also, whether committed in England or in foreign parts, may, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of the statute 33 Hen. VIII. c. 23, be inquired of and tried by the king's special commission in any shire or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. By statute 10 and 11 W. III. c. 25, all robberies, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> crimes, committed in Newfoundland, may be inquired of and tried in any county in England. Offences against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> act, 9 Geo. I. c. 22, may be inquired of and tried in any county of England, at the option of the prosecutor. So felonies, in deftroying turnpikes, or works upon navigable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, erected by authority of parliament, may, by statutes 8 Geo. II. c. 20, and 13 Geo. III. c. 84, be inquired of and tried in any adjacent county. By statute 26 Geo. II. c. 19, plundering or stealing from any vessel in distress or wrecked, or breaking any ship contrary to 12 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANN\">Ann</a>. statute 2, c. 18, may be prosecuted either in the county where the fact is committed, or in any county next adjoining; and if committed in Wales, then in the next adjoining English county: by which is understood to be meant, such English county as, by the statute 26 Hen. VIII. above mentioned, had before a concurrent jurisdiction of felonies committed in Wales. Felonies committed out of the realm, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> or deftroying the king's ships, magazines, or stores, may, by statute 12 Geo. III. c. 24, be inquired of and tried in any county of England, or in the place where the offence is committed. By statute 13 Geo. III. c. 63, misdemeanors committed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> may be tried upon information or indictment in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of king's-bench in England; and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> is marked out for examining witnesses by commission, and transmitting their depositions to the court. But, in general, all offences must be inquired into, as well as tried, in the county where the fact is committed. Yet if larceny be committed in one county, and the goods carried into another, the offender may be indicted in either; for the offence is complete in both. Or he may be indicted in England for larceny in Scotland, and carrying the goods with him into England, or vice versa; or for receiving in one part of the united kingdom goods that have been stolen in another. But for robbery, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURGLARY\">burglary</a>, and the like, he can only be indicted where the fact was actually committed: for though the carrying away and keeping of the goods is a continuation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> taking, and is therefore larceny in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> county, yet it is not a robbery or burglary in that jurisdiction. And if a person be indicted in one county for larceny of goods originally taken in another, and be thereof convicted, or stands <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MUTE\">mute</a>, he shall not be admitted to his clergy; provided the original taking be attended with such circumstances as would have ousted him of his clergy by virtue of any statute made previous to the year 1661.\n\nWhen the grand jury have heard the evidence, if they think it a groundless accusation, they used formerly to endorse on the back of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILL\">bill</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORAMUS\">Ignoramus</a>; or, We know nothing of it: intimating, that though the facts might possibly be true, that truth did not appear to them. But now they assert in English more absolutely, Not a true bill; or (which is the better way) Not found; and then the party is discharged without farther answer. But a fresh bill may afterwards be preferred to a subsequent grand jury. If they are satisfied of the truth of the accusation, they then endorse upon it, \"A true bill;\" anciently, Billa vera. The indictment is then said to be found, and the party stands indicted. But to find a bill, there must at least twelve...\nIndictment: Twelve of the jury agree; so tender is the law of England of the lives of the subjects, that no man can be convicted at the suit of the king of any capital offence, unless by the unanimous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of twenty-four of his equals and neighbours; that is, by twelve at least of the grand jury, in the first place, assenting to the accusation; and afterwards by the whole petit jury of twelve more, finding him guilty upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>. But if twelve of the grand jury assent, it is a good indictment, though some of the rest disagree. And the indictment, when so found, is publicly delivered into court.\n\nIndictments must have a precise and sufficient certainty. By statute i Hen. V. c. 5, all indictments must set forth the Christian name, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURNAME\">surname</a>, and addition of the estate and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, mystery, town, or place, and the county of the offender; and all this to identify his person. The time and place are also to be ascertained, by naming the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> and township in which the fact was committed: though a mistake in these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> is in general not held to be material, provided the time be laid previous to the finding of the indictment, and the place to be within the jurisdiction of the court; unless where the place is laid, not merely as a venue, but as part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the fact. But sometimes the time may be very material, where there is any limitation in point of time assigned for the prosecution of offenders; as by the statute 7 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">Will</a>. III. c. 3, which enacts, that no prosecution shall be had for any of the treasons or misprisions therein mentioned (except an affadavement deigned or attempted on the person of the king), unless the bill of indictment be found within three years after the offence committed: and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a>, the time of the death must be laid within a year and a day after the mortal stroke was given. The offence itself must also be set forth with clearness and certainty; and in some crimes particular words of art must be used, which are appropriated by the law to express the precise idea which it entertains of the offence, that no other words, however <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNONYMOUS\">synonymous</a> they may seem, are capable of doing it. Thus, in treason, the facts must be laid to be done \"treasonably, and against his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a>;\" anciently, \"proditione et contra ligavitice fuc debitum;\" else the indictment is void. In indictments for murder, it is necessary to say that the party indicted \"murdered,\" not \"killed\" or \"flew;\" the other; which, till the late statute, was expressed in Latin by the word mur-davit. In all indictments for felonies, the adverb \"feloniously,\" \"felonice,\" must be used; and for burglaries also, \"burglariter,\" or, in English, \"burglariously;\" and all these to ascertain the intent. In rapes, the word rapuit, or \"ravished,\" is necessary, and must not be expressed by any periphrasis, in order to render the crime certain. So in larcenies also, the words \"felonice cepit et aportavit,\" \"feloniously took or carried away,\" are necessary to every indictment; for these only can express the very offence. Also, in indictments for murder, the length and depth of the wound should in general be expressed, in order that it may appear to the court to have been of a mortal nature: but if it goes through the body, then its dimensions are immaterial, for that is apparently sufficient to have been the cause of the death. Also, where a limb, or the like, is absolutely cut off, there such description is needed.\n\nLastly, in indictments, the value of the thing which is the subject or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of the offence must sometimes be expressed. In indictments for larcenies this is necessary, that it may appear whether it be grand or petit larceny; and whether entitled or not to the benefit of clergy. In homicides of all sorts it is necessary; as the weapon with which it is committed is forfeited to the king as a deadman.

Some pretend it was given to all the gods in general; and others, only to the demigods, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> great men deified. Others say, it was given to such gods as were originally of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, or rather such as were the gods of the country that bore this name; and others again hold it was ascribed to such gods as were patrons and protectors of particular cities. Lastly, others hold indigetes to be derived from inde gentium or in loco degens, or from inde and ago, for dego, \"I live, I inhabit;\" which last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> seems the most probable.\n\nIn effect it appears, 1. That these indigetes were also called local gods (dii locales), or topical gods, which is the same thing. 2. The indigetes were ordinarily men deified, who indeed were in effect local gods, being deemed the protectors of those places where they were deified; so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> and third opinions are very consistent. 3. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a> joins patrii with indigetes, as being the same thing, Georg. i. ver. 408. \"Dii patrii, indigetes.\" 4.

See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">Botany</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-INDEX\">Index</a>.\nThis plant requires a smooth rich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, well tilled, and not too dry. The seed of it, which, as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, resembles <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, is sown in little furrows that are about the breadth of the hoe, two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> three inches deep, at a foot's distance from each other, and in as straight a line as possible. Continual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> is required to pluck up the weeds, which would soon choke the plant. Though it may be sown in all seasons, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> preferred. Moisture causes this plant to shoot above the surface in three or four days. It is ripe at the end of two months. When it begins to flower, it is cut with pruning-knives; and cut again at the end of every six weeks, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> is a little rainy. It lasts about two years, after which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> it degenerates; it is then plucked up, and planted afresh. As this plant soon exhausts the soil, because it does not absorb a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEW\">dew</a> to moisten the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, it is of advantage to the planter to have a vast space which may remain covered with trees, till it becomes necessary to fell them in order to make room for the indigo.\n\nIndigo is distinguished into two kinds, the true and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASTARD\">bastard</a>. Though the first is sold at a higher price on account of its superiority, it is usually advantageous to cultivate the other, because it is heavier. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> grow in many different soils; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> succeeds best in those which are most exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>. Both are liable to great accidents. Sometimes the plant becomes dry, and is destroyed by an insect frequently found on it; at other times, the leaves, which are the valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the plant, are devoured in the space of 24 hours by caterpillars. This last misfortune, which is but too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>, has given occasion to the saying, \"that the planters of indigo go to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> rich, and rise in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> totally ruined.\"\n\nThis production ought to be gathered in with great precaution, for fear of making the farina that lies on the leaves, and is very valuable, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> off by shaking it. When gathered, it is thrown into the sleeping-vat, which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> tub filled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. Here it undergoes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a>, which in 24 hours at furthest is completed. A cock is then turned, to let the water run into the second tub, called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a> or pounding tub. The sleeping-vat is then cleaned out, that fresh plants may be thrown in; and thus the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> without interruption.\n\nThe water which has run into the pounding-tub is found impregnated with a very subtile earth, which alone constitutes the dregs or blue-substance that is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, and which must be separated from the useless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> of the plant, because this makes the dregs swim on the surface. To effect this, the water is forcibly agitated with wooden buckets, that are full of holes and fixed to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> handle. This part of the process requires the greatest precautions. If the agitation be discontinued too soon, the part that is used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYEING\">dyeing</a>, not being sufficiently separated from the salt, would be lost. If, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the dye were to be agitated too long after the complete separation, the parts would be brought together again, and form a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a>; and the salt reacting on the dregs would excite a second fermentation, that would alter the dye, spoil its colour, and make what is called burnt indigo. These accidents are prevented by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> attention to the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> that the dye undergoes, and by the precaution which the workmen take to draw out a little of it from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to time in a clean vessel. When they perceive that the coloured particles collect by separating from the rest of the liquor, they leave off shaking the buckets, in order to allow time to the blue dregs to precipitate to the bottom of the tub, where they are left to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> till the water is quite clear.\u2014Holes made in the tub, at different heights, are then opened one after another, and this useless water is let out.\n\nThe blue dregs remaining at the bottom having acquired the consistence of a thick muddy liquid, cocks are then opened, which draw it off into the settler. After it is still more cleared of much superfluous water in this third and last tub, it is drained into sacks; from whence, when water <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> longer filters through the cloth, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, now become of a thicker consistence, is put into chests, where it entirely loses its moisture. At the end of three months the indigo is fit for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>.\n\nIt is used, in walking, to give a bluish colour to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>; painters also employ it in their water-colours; and dyers cannot make fine blue without indigo. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> procured it from the East Indies; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times, it has been transplanted into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>. The cultivation of it, successively attempted at different places, appears to be fixed at Carolina, St Domingo, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a>. That which is known under the name of Guatemala indigo, from whence it comes, is the most perfect of all.\n\nThere are two kinds of indigo prepared in the East Indies, particularly on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Coromandel, at Pondicherry, &c. Of these the worst kind is used for giving the body of colour to the dyed substance, the other being employed only to give it a glost afterwards. The finest is prepared on the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGRA\">Agra</a>, Mahilpatnam, and Ayano, but especially in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAVA\">Java</a>; but this last, being extremely dear, is very little used by the dyers. The best ought to float on the surface of water; its colour ought to be a very dark blue inclining to violet, bright and sparkling, especially when broken. It may be tried by dissolving a little in a glass of water: if pure, it will mix equably with the liquor; but if otherwise, will separate and fall to the bottom. Another method of trying the goodness of this substance is by fire; for the pure indigo will be entirely consumed, while the extraneous particles will remain. The pounded indigo is much more subject to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADULTERATION\">adulteration</a> than such as is sold in cakes or tablets; as the ashes or dirt with which it is mixed are very apt to separate from the pure colouring substance when standing in a liquid state, as it must always do before the moisture is evaporated: whence, on breaking a bit of indigo so adulterated, the extraneous matter will be perceived in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> of a different colour.","sp":260,"ep":265},{"h":"INDIVIDUAL","t":"a particular being of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> that which cannot be divided into two or more beings equal or alike.\n\nThe usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> in logic is made into genera, or into genuses; those genera into species; and those species into individuals.","sp":265,"ep":265},{"h":"INDIVISIBLE","t":"among metaphysicians.\u2014A thing is said to be absolutely indivisible that is a simple being, and consists of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> parts into which it may be divided.

It is done by giving the clerk corporal possession of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, as by holding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> of the door, tolling a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>, or the like; and is a form required by law, with intent to give all the parishioners due notice and sufficient certainty of their new minister, to whom their tythes are to be paid.

Such indulgences were first invented in the 11th century, by Urban II., as a recompense for those who went in person upon the glorious enterprise of conquering the Holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">Land</a>. They were afterwards granted to those who hired a soldier for that purpose; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> were bestowed on such as gave money for accomplishing any pious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> enjoined by the pope.\n\nThe power of granting indulgences has been great. Indulgently abused in the church of Rome. Pope Leo X., in order to carry on the magnificent structure of St Peter's at Rome, published indulgences, and a plenary remission, to all such as should contribute money towards it. Finding the project take, he granted to Albert <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELECTOR\">elector</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENTZ\">Mentz</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGDEBURG\">Magdeburg</a>, the benefit of the indulgences of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a> and the neighbouring parts, and farmed out those of other countries to the highest bidders; who, to make the best of their bargain, procured the ablest preachers to cry up the value of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WARE\">ware</a>. The form of these indulgences was as follows: \"May our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Jesus Christ have mercy upon thee, and absolve thee by the merit of his most holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>. And I, by his authority, that of his blest apostles Peter and Paul, and of the most holy Pope, granted and committed to me in these parts, do absolve thee, first from all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> censures, in whatever manner they have been incurred; then from all thy sins, transgressions, and excesses, how enormous soever they may be, even from such as are referred for the cognizance of the holy see, and as far as the keys of the holy church extend: 'I remit to you all punishment which you deserve in purgatory on their account; and I restore you to the holy sacraments of the church, to the unity of the faithful, and to that innocence and purity which you professed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAPTISM\">baptism</a>; so that when you die, the gates of punishment shall be shut, and the gates of paradise of delight shall be opened: and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> you shall not die at present, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> shall remain in full force when you are at the point of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>.' In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\"\n\nThe terms in which the retailers of indulgences described their benefits and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of purchasing them, are so extravagant, that they appear almost incredible. If any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> (said they) purchases letters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a>, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> may rest secure with respect to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a>. The souls confined in purgatory, for whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDEMPTION\">redemption</a> indulgences are purchased, as soon as the money tinkles in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>, instantly escape from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of torment, and ascend into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>. That the efficacy of indulgences was so great, that the most heinous sins, even if one should violate (which was impossible) the mother of God, would be remitted and expiated by them; and the person be freed both from punishment and guilt. That this was the unspeakable gift of God, in order to reconcile men to himself. That the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> erected by the preachers of indulgences was equally efficacious with the cross of Christ itself. \"Lo! the heavens are open; if you enter not now, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> you enter? For twelve pence you may redeem the soul of your father out of purgatory; and are you so ungrateful, that you will not refuse your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> from torment? If you had but one coat, you ought to strip yourself instantly, and sell it, in order to purchase such benefits,\" &c.\n\nIt was this great abuse of indulgences that contributed not a little to the first reformation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> in Germany, where Martin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a> began first to declaim against the preachers of indulgences, and afterwards against indulgences themselves: but since that time the popes have been more sparing in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of this power; however, they still carry on a great trade.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDULT\">Indult</a> trade with them to the Indies, where they are purchased at two rials a-piece, and sometimes more.\n\nThe pope likewise grants indulgences to persons at the point of death; that is, he grants them, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a>, power to choose what confessor they please, who is authorized thereby to absolve them from all their sins in general.","sp":266,"ep":267},{"h":"INDULT","t":"in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Rome, the power of presenting to benefices granted to certain persons by the pope.

In criminal matters. The law of England does in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> privilege an infant under the age of 21, as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> misdemeanors; so as to escape fine, imprisonment, and the like: and particularly in the cases of omission, as not repairing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HIGHWAY\">highway</a>, and other similar offenses; for, not having the command of his fortune till the age of 21, he wants the capacity to do those things which the law requires. But where there is any notorious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> of the peace, a riot, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTERY\">battery</a>, or the like, (which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> when full-grown are at least as liable as others to commit;) for those, an infant above the age of 14 is equally liable to suffer as a person of the full age of 21.\n\nWith regard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> crimes, the law is still more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> and circumspect; distinguishing with greater nicety the several degrees of age and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a>. By the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Saxon law, the age of twelve years was established for the age of possible discretion, when first the understanding might open; and from thence till the offender was 14, it was etas pubertatis proxima, in which he might, or might not, be guilty of a crime, according to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> capacity or incapacity. This was the dubious stage of discretion; but, under twelve, it was held, that he could not be guilty in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, neither after fourteen could be supposed innocent, of any capital crime which he in fact committed. But by the law, as it now stands, and has stood at least ever since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of Edward III., the capacity of doing ill, or contracting guilt, is not so much measured by years and days, as by the strength of the delinquent's understanding and judgment. For one lad of 11 years old may have as much cunning as another of 14; and in these cases our maxim is, that malitia supplet etatem. Under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years of age, indeed, an infant cannot be guilty of felony; for then a felonious discretion is almost an impossibility in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>: but at eight years old, he may be guilty of felony. Also, under 14, though an infant shall be prima facie adjudged to be doli incapax, yet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it appear to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a> that he was doli capax, and could discern between good and evil, he may be convicted and suffer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. Thus a girl of 13 has been burnt for killing her mistress: and one boy of ten, and another of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> years old, who had killed their companions, have been sentenced to death, and he of ten years actually hanged; because it appeared upon their trials, that the one hid himself, and the other hid the body he had killed; which hiding manifested a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of guilt, and a discretion to discern between good and evil. And there was an instance in the last century, where a boy of eight years old was tried at Abington for firing two barns; and, it appearing that he had malice, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a>, and cunning, he was found guilty, condemned, and hanged accordingly. Thus also, in very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times, a boy of ten years old was convicted on his own confession of murdering his bedfellow; there appearing in his whole behaviour <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> tokens of a mischievous disposition; and, as the sparing this boy merely on account of his tender years might be of dangerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to the public, by propagating a notion that children might commit such atrocious crimes with impunity, it was unanimously agreed by all the judges, that he was a proper subject of capital <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>. But, in all such cases, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of that malice, which is to supply age, ought to be strong and clear beyond all doubt and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a>.\n\n2. In civil matters. The ages of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> are different for different purposes. A male at 12 years old may take the oath of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a>; at 14 is at the years of discretion, and therefore may consent or disagree to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, may choose his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">guardian</a>, and, if his discretion be actually proved, may make his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">testament</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> estate; at 17 may be an executor; and at 21 is at his own disposal, and may alienate his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, goods, and chattels. A female also at seven years of age may be betrothed or given in marriage; at nine is entitled to dower; at 12 is at years of maturity, and therefore may consent or disagree to marriage, and, if proved to have sufficient discretion, may bequeath her personal estate; at 14 is at years of legal discretion, and may choose a guardian; at 17 may be executrix; and at 21 may\nmay dispose of herself and her lands. So that full age in male or female is 21 years, which age is completed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> preceding the anniversary of a person's birth; who till that time is an infant, and so styled in law. Among the ancient Greeks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, women were never of age, but subject to perpetual guardianship, unless when married, nisi convenientem in manum viri; and when that perpetual tutelage wore away in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time, we find that, in females as well as males, full age was not till 25 years. Thus by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of different kingdoms, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, which is merely arbitrary, and juris positivi, is fixed at different times. Scotland agrees with England in this point; (both probably copying from the old Saxon constitutions on the continent, which extended the age of minority <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a> annum vigesimum primum, et eo ulgue juvenes sub tutelam reponunt;) but in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a> persons are of full age at 18; in France, with regard to marriage, not till 30; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> at 25.\n\nThe very disabilities of infants are privileges; in order to secure them from hurting themselves by their own improvident acts. An infant cannot be sued but under the protection, and joining the name, of his guardian; for he is to defend him against all attacks as well by law as otherwise; but he may sue either by his guardian, or prochein amy, his next friend who is not his guardian. This prochein amy may be any person who will undertake the infant's cause; and it frequently happens, that an infant, by his prochein amy, institutes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a> against a fraudulent guardian.\n\nWith regard to estates and civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, an infant hath many privileges. In general, an infant shall lose nothing by nonclaim, or neglect of demanding his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>; nor shall any other laches or negligence be imposed on an infant, except in some very particular cases.\n\nIt is generally true, that an infant can neither alien his lands, nor do any legal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, nor make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a>, nor indeed any manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a>, that will bind him. But still to all these rules there are some exceptions: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of which were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> now mentioned in reckoning up the different capacities which they assume at different ages: and there are others, a few of which it may not be improper to recite, as a general specimen of the whole.

Also it is generally true, that an infant can do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> legal act: yet an infant, who has an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOWSON\">advowson</a>, may present to the benefice when it becomes void. For the law in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> dispenses with one rule, in order to maintain others of far greater consequence: it permits an infant to present a clerk (who, if unfit, may be rejected by the bishop), rather than either suffer the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> to be unfurnished till he come of age, or permit the infant to be debarred of his right by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> to the bishop. An infant may also purchase lands, but his purchase is incomplete; for, when he comes to age, he may either agree or disagree to it, as he thinks prudent or proper, without alleging any reason; and so may his heirs after him, if he dies without having completed his agreement. It is, farther, generally true, that an infant, under 21, can make no deed but what is afterwards voidable: yet in some cases he may bind himself apprentice by deed indented or indentures, for seven years; and he may by deed or will appoint a guardian to his children, if he has any.\n\nLastly, it is generally true, that an infant can make no other contract that will bind him: yet he may bind himself to pay for his necessary meat, drink, apparel, physic, and such other necessaries; and likewise for his good teaching and instruction, whereby he may profit himself afterwards.","sp":268,"ep":269},{"h":"INFATUATE","t":"to prepossess any one in favour of some person <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> thing that does not deserve it, so far as that he cannot easily be disabused.\u2014The word infatuate comes from the Latin fatuus \"fool;\" of fari, \"to speak out,\" which is borrowed from the Greek \u03c6\u03ac\u03c9, whence \u03c6\u03ac\u03c9\u03bd, which signifies the same with \u03bd\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c2 in Latin, or prophet in English; and the reason is, because their prophets or priests used to be seized with a kind of madness or folly, when they began to make their predictions, or deliver <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORACLES\">oracles</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> called those persons infatuati, who fancied they had seen visions, or imagined the god Faunus, whom they called Fatues, had appeared to them.

These are fertile topics of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a> and ingenuity; but it might mortify the vanity of some very vain writers and talkers, if they were to recollect, what is undoubtedly true, that it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of wit and ingenuity which not only the vilest, but the most stupid and illiterate of mankind, have frequently displayed in all its possible perfection.\n\nThere is indeed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> doubt, but that vanity is one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> causes of infidelity. It must be the sole cause of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> it to others, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> or conversation. For let us suppose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of a very humane, judicious, and learned man, entertaining doubts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of Christianity: if he cannot clear his doubts by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, he will yet recollect that doubts are no certainties; and, before he endeavours to propagate his scepticism, he will ask himself these questions: \"Am I quite convinced that what I doubt of cannot possibly be true? If I am convinced of it, am I sure that the publication of my opinions will not do more harm than good? Is not the disturbing of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>-established civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> attended with confusion, rebellion, bloodshed, and ruin? And are not the majority of men more strongly attached to the religion than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of their forefathers? Will it serve my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> to introduce discontent of any species? May not those innovations in religion, which discontent may introduce, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to all the evils which are caused by frenzy and fanaticism? Granting that I were able to make a party formidable enough to crush opposition and to exterminate Christianity, still am I certain that I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, in this instance, like a good member of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>? For is not this system, whether well or ill founded, friendly to society? I must confess it; its greatest enemies have acknowledged it. What <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> then can induce me to divulge my doubts of its authenticity? Not the good of mankind; for it is already allowed by unbelievers, that the good of mankind is interested in the belief of its divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>. Is it for my\nmy own good, and with a view to be convinced? I will not deceive myself; my motive, I suspect, is of another kind; for do I read those books which have been already written to satisfy similar doubts? Nothing but the vanity of appearing to be wiser than my credulous neighbours can induce me to interrupt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of their belief. But vanity of this sort, which tends to disturb society, to injure the national morals, and to rob many thousand individuals of a copious source of sweet and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> comfort, must be pronounced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> wickedness, even according to the obvious dictates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> religion. I shall act the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a good citizen and a good man, by conforming to a system whose beneficial influence I feel and confess, and by endeavouring to acquire a belief in that which has for so many centuries been established, and which promises to soothe me in distress with the sweetest consolations, and to brighten the dismal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, by the hope of a more glorious and happy state of existence. At all events, I shall have the satisfaction of having commanded myself so far, as not to have run the hazard of endangering the welfare of my fellow-creatures, either here or hereafter, by indulging a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of vanity, which, in a creature so weak and so short-lived as myself, is a folly very inconsistent with the superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> which I seem to arrogate.\n\n\"I will venture to repeat (continues our author), that all writers against Christianity, however they may affect even the extremes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, and enlargement of mind, are actuated by vanity and wickedness of heart. Their motives are as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a>, selfish, narrow, and in every respect unjustifiable, as the tendency of their writings is mischievous. Their malice is often impotent, through the foolish sophistry of their arguments; but, if ever it be successful, it is highly injurious: and indeed, considering their motives and the probable consequences of their endeavours, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDEL\">infidel</a> writer is a greater enemy to society, and consequently guiltier, according to all the principles of social union, than the thief or the traitor. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSECUTION\">Persecution</a> would, however, only promote his cause, and his proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> is contempt.\n\n\"It is certainly no derogation from the character of a man of sense, to conform, even while he is so unfortunate as to doubt their truth, to the opinions of his country. His conformity will probably lead him to a train of actions and of thought, which, in due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, will induce him to believe. But, if that should not happen, yet he will act, as very wise and very great men have acted, in paying a respectful deference to the avowed conviction of others. The most intelligent and powerful men of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> Rome, not only appeared to believe a very absurd and hurtful system, but afflicted in all its ceremonies as priests. Even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a>, who evidently entertained some notions adequate to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of the one great and supreme Being, yet thought it was a duty which he owed to his country, so far to conform to the wretched establishment, as to order in his dying words a sacrifice to \u00c6sculapius. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> conformity to the national religion ought not to be confounded with hypocrisy. If indeed it is carried to extremes, or zealously affected, it certainly is very blamable and contemptible deceit; but while it keeps within the bounds of reason and moderation, it ought to be called a decent deference to the opinions of the majority, arising from humility, and from a desire to maintain the tranquillity of the state, and to continue an innocent and useful system, which has and will always greatly contribute to lessen the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> and degree both of moral and of natural evil.\n\n\"The easiest, after all, or at least the most effectual method of appearing in any character, is really to be what we wish to appear. But belief, you will say, is not in our power, and how can we believe what appears to us incredible? Certainly you cannot while it appears incredible. But let me ask you, whether you have taken any pains to believe, or have at once and at a glance persuaded yourself, that the Christian religion is totally false? It is probable that a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of sceptical writers never gave themselves the trouble to read those Scriptures which they warmly oppose. They hear objections, they read objections, and they find, that from men of reputed wit and ingenuity the objections often originate. They also wish to be reputed men of wit and ingenuity, and therefore eagerly adopt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> and sentiments of the order. Perhaps the vanity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> of this class of men will render all attempts to convince them abortive; but to modest doubters, and to those whose good sense and good dispositions lead them to wish to adopt the religion of their country, it may not be useless to suggest advice, with a view to facilitate their conviction.\n\n\"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> thing required is to free themselves from the pride of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> reason. Humility (and surely our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLINDNESS\">blindness</a> and imperfections are sufficient to render us humble, if we would be reasonable), humility will open our hearts, and belief will find admission. Sincere endeavours, seconded by prayers, will never fail to help our unbelief. But, alas! a fine, gay, spirited, liberal, and enlarged modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, would be ashamed to be found on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a>, or with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a> in his possession. There is scarcely any vicious act, or any vicious book, which would put him so much to blush.\n\n\"A modest well-meaning man might, however, one should think, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> himself of those prejudices which prevent the possibility of belief, by the following folio:\n\n\"I find myself placed in a world abounding with evil and misery. Under the immediate pressure of it, I feel my heart inclining, like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>, by its natural tendency, to the Deity for support. Man, of all animals, is the only one who has the sense of religion. Feeling this distinctive propensity of my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, I look around to discover to what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, and in what manner, that part of my fellow creatures, who live in the same society with myself, pay their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a>. I find a system of religion already established, and which has been established in the most enlightened countries of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> near 2000 years. I resolve to examine it. It claims that respect from its antiquity and universality. Many difficulties appear on the first inspection. My reason is often startled, and my belief wavering. But I will not yet give up a point of so serious importance, without further and closer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to it. I reflect, that 2000 years is a vast space in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of the world. How many myriads of men like myself have lived and died in the faith during that time! And were all of them fools or hypocrites?\"\ncrites? It could not have been. Can the understanding of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> individual, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> come into the world, and hardly knowing where he is, comprehend on intuition an object of such magnitude, and make the mighty discovery which has elapsed millions of the wisest and most learned of mortals? Or, supposing that they all perceived the deception, am I then at last the only honest man who will confess it? I am ashamed to avow such an idea to myself. But yet, if I reject what they received, surely I avow it in the more expressive language of my conduct. Pride, I fear, is the foundation of my skepticism; and humility must form the basis of my belief. I will check my own presumption, and reject the cavils of vain and foolish philosophy. Shall a poor weak creature, who cometh up like a flower, and is cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, who fleeth as a shadow, and never continueth in one stay, presume to pronounce decisively in that little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, in which he has scarcely time to look about him before he dies, against a system which has strong internal and external <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of divine original, which is most useful and comfortable, and which has been admitted among a great portion of mankind during almost 20 centuries? No, it is the first wisdom to be humble. Humility will be followed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a>, and grace by faith, and faith by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a>. It plainly appears, that I can lose nothing by belief, but some of those excessive and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> enjoyments, which would destroy my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; but I may possibly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> and a happiness which shall continue to all eternity.\"","sp":270,"ep":272},{"h":"INFINITE","t":"that which has neither beginning nor end: in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> God alone is infinite.\n\nINFINITE is also used to signify that which has had a beginning, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> end, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">angels</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> souls.

By the statute 31 Eliz. c. 5, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> prosecution upon any penal statute, the guilt and benefit whereof are limited in part to the king and in part to the prosecutor, can be brought by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> informer after one year is expired since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of the offence; nor on behalf of the crown, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of two years longer; nor, where the forfeiture is originally given only to the king, can such prosecution be had after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> of two years from the commission of the offence.\n\nThe informations that are exhibited in the name of the king alone, are also of two kinds: first, those which are truly and properly his own suits, and filed ex officio by his own immediate officer, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTORNEY_GENERAL\">attorney-general</a>; secondly, those in which, though the king is the nominal prosecutor, yet it is at the relation of some private person <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> common informer; and they are filed by the king's coroner and attorney in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENCH\">bench</a>, usually called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the crown-office, who is for this purpose the standing officer of the public. The objects of the king's own prosecutions, filed ex officio by his own attorney-general, are properly such enormous misdemeanors, as peculiarly tend to disturb or endanger his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, or to molest or affront him in the regular discharge of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> functions. For offences so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> and dangerous, in the punishing or preventing of which a moment's delay would be fatal, the law has given to the crown the power of an immediate prosecution, without waiting for any previous application to any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a>: which power, thus necessary, not only to the ease and safety, but even to the very existence, of the executive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>, was originally referred in the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, wherein provision is wisely made for the due preservation of all its parts.

And when an information is filed, either thus, or by the attorney-general ex officio, it must be tried by a petit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> where the offence arises: after which, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the defendant be found guilty, he must refer to the court for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>.

See INFORMATION.\n\nInformers were very common both in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> and Rome. Every corner of the streets was peopled with swarms of turbulent rascals, who made it their constant business to pick up stories and catch at every occasion to accuse persons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> and reputation: these by the Greeks were called \u03a3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2; for a more particular account of whom, see the article SYCOHANT.\n\nAmongst the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, informers were of two sorts, mandatores and delatores.

What tended to increase the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of these petition fellows was, that the informers were entitled to a fourth part of the effects of the person convicted. Wicked princes rewarded and countenanced this mischievous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a>; but Titus set on foot a most diligent search after them, and punished such as he found with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> or banishment.

In a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> entitled Friendly Cautions to Officers, the following atrocious instance of ingratitude is related. An opulent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> in the west of England, little used to have troops with them, had a regiment sent to be quartered there: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> inhabitants and wealthiest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>, glad to show their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to their sovereign, took the first opportunity to get acquainted with the officers, inviting them to their houses, and showing them every civility in their power. This was truly a desirable situation. A merchant, extremely easy in his circumstances, took so prodigious a liking to one officer in particular, that he gave him an apartment in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, and made him in a manner <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of it, the officer's friends being always welcome to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>. The merchant was a widower, and had only two favourite daughters; the officer in so comfortable a station <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> his wanton eyes upon them; and too fatally succeeding, ruined them both. Dreadful return to the merchant's misplaced friendship! The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this ungenuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> was, that all officers ever after were thumped as a public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NUISANCE\">nuisance</a>, as a pest to society: nor have the inhabitants perhaps yet conquered their aversion to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>-coat.\n\n2. We read in Rapin's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a>, that during Monmouth's rebellion, in the reign of James II., a certain person knowing the humane disposition of one Mrs Gaunt, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> was one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of benevolence, fled to her house, where he was concealed and maintained for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. Hearing, however, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a>, which promised an indemnity and reward to those who discovered such as had harboured the rebel, he betrayed his benefactress; and such was the spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a> which prevailed among the ministers, that he was pardoned and recompensed for his treachery, while she was burnt alive for her charity!\n\n3. The following instance is also to be found in the same history.\u2014Humphry Bannister and his father were both servants to and raised by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUCKINGHAM\">Buckingham</a>; who being driven to abscond, by an unfortunate accident befalling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> he had raised against the usurper Richard III., he without footman or page retired to Bannister's house near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALISBURY\">Salisbury</a>, as to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where he had all the reason in the world to expect security. Bannister, however, upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s proclamation promising 1000l. reward to him that should apprehend the duke, betrayed his master to John <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MERTON\">Merton</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHROPSHIRE\">Shropshire</a>, who sent him under a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> to Salisbury, where the king then was, and there in the market-place the duke was beheaded. But Divine vengeance pursued the traitor Bannister; for demanding the 1000l. that was the price of his master's blood, King Richard refused to pay it him, saying, \"He that would be false to so good a master, ought not to be encouraged.\" He was afterwards hanged for manslaughter, his eldest son run mad and died in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOG\">hog</a>-stye, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> became deformed and lame, and his third son was drowned in a small puddle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. His eldest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> was got with child by one of his carters, and his second was seized with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEPROSY\">leprosy</a> whereof he died.\u2014Hist. of Eng. 8vo. vol. i. p. 304.\n\nThe following barbarous instances are from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> History.\n\n4. When <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-XERXES\">Xerxes</a> king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a> was at Celene, a city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHRYGIA\">Phrygia</a>, Pythius, a Lydian, who had his residence in that city, and next to Xerxes was the most opulent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> of those times, entertained him and his whole army with an incredible magnificence, and made him an offer of all his wealth towards defraying the expenses of his expedition. Xerxes, surprized and charmed at so generous an offer, had the curiosity to inquire to what a sum his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> amounted. Pythius made answer, that having the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of offering them to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, he had taken an exact account of them, and that the silver he had by him amounted to 2500 talents (about 255,000l. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>), and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> to 4,000,000 of daries (about 1,700,000l. sterling), wanting 7000. All this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> he offered him, telling him, that his revenue was sufficient for the support of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a>. Xerxes made him very hearty acknowledgments, and entered into a particular friendship with him, but declined accepting his present. The same prince who had made such obliging offers to Xerxes, having desired a favour of him some time after, that out of his five sons who served in his army, he would be pleased to leave him the eldest, in order to be a comfort to him in his old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>: the king was so enraged at the proposal, though so reasonable in itself, that he caused the eldest son to be killed before the eyes of his father, giving the latter to understand...\nthat it was a favour he spared him and the rest of his children.

When he was about 21 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, he was introduced to William <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Normandy (who visited the court of England, A.D. 1051, and made himself Ingulphus, so agreeable to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, that he appointed him his secretary, and carried him with him into his own dominions. In a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> he became the prime favourite of his prince, and the dispenser of all preferments, humbling some, and exalting others, at his pleasure; in which difficult station, he confessed, he did not behave with a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>. This excited the envy and hatred of many of the courtiers; to avoid the effects of which, he obtained leave from the duke to go in pilgrimage to the Holy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">Land</a>. With a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of 30 horsemen, he joined Sigfrid duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENTZ\">Mentz</a>, who, with many German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>, clergy, and others, was preparing for a pilgrimage to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>. When they were all united, they formed a company of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> fewer than 7000 pilgrims. In their way they spent some time at Constantinople, performing their devotions in the several churches. In their passage through Lycia, they were attacked by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of Arabs, who killed and wounded many of them, and plundered them of a prodigious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>. Those who escaped from this disaster, at length reached Jerusalem, visited all the holy places, and bedewed the ruins of many churches with their tears, giving money for their reparation. They intended to have bathed in Jordan; but being prevented by the roving Arabs, they embarked on board a Genoese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> at Joppa, and landed at Brundusium, from whence they travelled through Apulia to Rome. Having gone through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> course of devotions in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, at the several places distinguished for sanctity, they separated, and every one made the best of his way into his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>.

Ingulph was now so much disgusted with the world, that he resolved to forsake it, and became a monk in the abbey of Fontenelle in Normandy; in which, after some years, he was advanced to the office of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a>. When his old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> was preparing for his expedition into England, A.D. 1066, he was sent by his abbot, with 100 marks in money, and 12 young men, nobly mounted and completely armed, as a present from their abbey.

In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this he raised him to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the rich abbey of Croyland in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINCOLNSHIRE\">Lincolnshire</a>, A.D. 1076, in which he spent the last 34 years of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, governing that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> with great prudence, and protecting their possessions from the rapacity of the neighbouring barons by the favour of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> master.

The best account of the method of injecting the sanguiferous vessels of animals, is that by the late Dr Monro, published in the Medical Essays, vol. i. p. 79.\n\n\"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> with which the liquor is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> thrown into the vessels is a tight easy going syringe of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, to which several short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PIPES\">pipes</a> are fitted, and can be fixed by screws, the other extremities of these pipes being of different diameters without any screw, that they may slide into other pipes, which are so exactly adapted to them at one end, that when they are pressed a little together, nothing can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> between them: and because their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> is not so great as to resist the injection pushing force of the injection, which would drive off this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> pipe, and spoil the whole operation; therefore the extremity of this second sort of pipes, which receives the first kind, is formed on the outside into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, bounded behind and before by a rising circle, which hinders the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEY\">key</a> that closely grasps the square <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> from sliding backwards or forwards; or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> of brass must stand out from each side of it to be held with the fingers. The other extremity of each of these second sort of pipes is of different diameter; and near it a circular notch, capable of allowing a thread to be sunk into it, is formed; by this, the thread tying the vessel at which the injection is to be made, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not be allowed to slide off.\n\nBesides this form described, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to all this second sort of pipes, we ought to have some of the larger ones, with an additional mechanism, for particular purposes; as, for instance, when the larger vessels are injected, the pipe fastened into the vessel ought either to have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VALVE\">valve</a> or a stop-cock, that may be turned at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, to hinder any thing to get out from the vessel by the pipe; otherwise, as the injection, in such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> to congealate, the people employed in making the injection must either continue all that while in the same posture; or, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the syringe is too soon taken off, the injected liquor runs out and the larger vessels are emptied. When the syringe is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> enough to hold at once all the liquor necessary to fill the vessels, there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of filling it again. If, in order to do this, the syringe was to be taken off from the pipe fixed in the vessel, some of the injection would be lost, and what was exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> would cool and harden; therefore some of the pipes ought to have a reflected curve tube coming out of their side, with a valve to dispose, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> liquor can come from the straight pipe into the crooked one, but, on the contrary, may be allowed to pass from the crooked to the straight one: the injector then, taking care to keep the extremity of the reflected pipe immersed in the liquor to be injected, may, as soon as he has pushed out the first syringeful, fill it again by only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> back the sucker; and, repeating this quickly, will be able to throw several syringefuls into the vessels.\n\nAll these different sorts of pipes are commonly made of brass.\n\nThe liquors thrown into the vessels, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> to fill the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> tubes, are either such as will incorporate with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, or such as are oily: both kinds have their advantages and inconveniences; which I shall mention in treating of each, and shall conclude with that which I have found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> to succeed best.\n\nAll the different kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLUE\">glue</a>, or ichthyocolla, fish, common glue, &c., dissolved and pretty much diluted, mix easily with the animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>, which is of great advantage, and will pass into very small vessels of a well-chosen and prepared subject, and often answer the intention sufficiently, where the design is only to prepare some very fine membrane, on which no vessels can be expected to be seen so large as the eye can discover whether the transverse sections of the vessels would be circular, or if their sides are collapsed. But when the larger vessels are also to be prepared, there\nInjection, there is a manifest disadvantage to the usefulness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>; for if nothing but the glutinous liquor is injected, one cannot keep a subject so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as the glue takes of becoming firm; and therefore, in directing the injected part, several vessels will probably be cut and emptied. To prevent this, one may indeed either soak the part well in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALCOHOL\">alcohol</a>, which coagulates the glue; but then it becomes so brittle, that the least handling makes it crack; and if the preparation is to be kept, the larger vessels appear quite shrivelled, when the watery part of the injection is evaporated: or the efflux of the injection may be prevented, by carefully tying every vessel before we are obliged to cut it; still, however, that does not hinder the vessels to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> when the glue is drying. It, to obviate these difficulties, the glutinous liquor should first be injected in such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> as the capillary vessels will contain, and the common oily or waxy injection is pulled in afterwards to keep the larger vessels distended, the wax is very apt to harden before it has run far enough; the two sorts of liquors never mix to mix irregularly, and the whole appears interrupted and broken by their soon separating from each other; which is still more remarkable afterwards, when the watery particles are evaporated.\n\n\"Spirits of wine coloured mixes with water and oils, and so far is proper to fill the very smaller vessels with: but, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, it coagulates any of our liquor it meets, which sometimes blocks up the vessels too much, that no more injection will pass; then it scarce will suspend some of the powders that prove the most durable colours; and as it entirely evaporates, the vessels must become very small; and the small quantity of powder left, having nothing to serve for connecting its particles together, generally is seen so interrupted, that the small ramifications of vessels rather have the appearances of random scratches of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a>, than of regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a>.\n\n\"Melted tallow, with a little mixture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> of turpentine, may sometimes be made to fill very small vessels, and keeps the larger ones at a full stretch; but where any quantity of the animal liquors are still in the vessels, it is liable to stop too soon, and never can be introduced into numbers of vessels, which other liquors enter; and it is so brittle, that very little handling makes it crack, and thereby renders the preparation very ugly (a).\n\n\"The method I have always succeeded best with, in making what may be called fustile or fine injections, is, first throw in coloured oil of turpentine, in such a quantity as might fill the very small vessels; and, immediately after, to push the common coarse injection into the larger ones. The oil is fustile enough to enter rather smaller capillary tubes than any colouring can; its resinous parts, which remain after the spirituous injection is evaporated, give a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADHESION\">adhesion</a> to the particles of the substance with which it is coloured, to keep them from separating, and it intimately incorporates with the coarser injection; by which, if the injection is rightly managed, it is impossible or the sharpest eye to discover that two sorts have been made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of (b).\n\n\"All the liquors with which the vessels of animals are artificially filled, having very faint, and near the same colours, would not all appear in the very small vessels, because of their becoming entirely diaphanous, without a mixture of some substance to impart its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> to them; and where several sorts of even the largest vessels of any part were filled, one sort could not be distinguished from another, unless the colour of each was different; which has likewise a good effect in making preparations more beautiful. Wherefore anatomists have made use of a variety of such substances, according to their different fancies or intentions; such as gamboge, saffron, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INK\">ink</a>, burnt ivory, &c., which can be easily procured from painters. My design being only to consider those that are fit to be mixed with the injecting liquors proposed to fill capillary vessels, which is scarce ever to be done in any other, except the branches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTERIES\">arteries</a> and of some veins, I shall confine myself to the common colours employed to these last named two sorts of vessels, which colours are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, green, and sometimes blue, without mentioning the others, which require very little choice.\n\n\"Anatomists have, I imagine, proposed to imitate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> colours of the arteries and veins in a living creature, by filling the arteries with a red substance, and the veins with a blue or green: from which, however, there are other advantages, such as the strong reflection which such bodies make of the rays of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, and the unaptitude most such bodies have to transmit these same rays, without at least a considerable reflection of the rays peculiar to themselves; or, in other words, their unfitness to become completely pellucid; without which, the very fine vessels, after being injected, would still be imperceptible. The animal or vegetable substances made use of for colouring injections, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COCHINEAL\">cochineal</a>, lacquer, rad. anchusa, brazilwood, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a>, &c., have all one general fault of being liable to run into little knots which stop some of the vessels: their colour fades sooner when kept dry; they more easily yield their tincture when the parts are preserved in a liquor; and rats, mice, and insects, will take them for food: for which reasons, though I have frequently succeeded in injecting them, I rather prefer the mineral kind, such as minium or vermillion for red; of which this last is, in my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, the best, because it gives the brightest colour, and is commonly to be bought finely levigated. The green-coloured powder generally\n\n(a) Rigiterus (Introduct. in notitiam rerum natur. &c. 4to, Hogae, 1743; titul. Balzamum) gives Ruytch's method of injecting and preserving animals, which, he says, Mr Blumentroft, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> of the Petersburg academy, assured him was copied from the receipt given in Ruytch's own hand-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CZAR\">Czar</a>. According to this receipt, melted tallow, coloured with vermillion, to which, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> wax was added, was Ruytch's injecting ceracia materies.\n\n(b) Mr Ranby's injecting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, as published by Dr Hales, (H\u00e6mat. Ex. 21.) is white rosin and tallow, of each two ounces, melted and strained through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>; to which was added three ounces of vermillion, or finely ground indigo, which was first well rubbed with eight ounces of turpentine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a>.\ngenerally used is verdigris; but I rather choose that preparation of it called distilled verdigris; because its colour is brighter, and it does not so often run into small knots as the common verdigris, but dissolves in the oily liquors.\n\n\"The method of preparing the injection composed of these materials, is to take for the fine one, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of clear oil of turpentine, which is gradually poured on three ounces of vermillion, or distilled verdigris finely powdered, or rather well levigated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> on marble; stir them well with a small wooden spatula till they are exactly mixed, then strain all through a fine linen rag. The separation of the groser particles is, however, rather better made, by pouring some ounces of the oil upon the powder, and after stirring them together strongly, stop rubbing with the spatula for a second or so, and pour off into a clean vessel the oil with the vermillion or verdigris suspended in it; and continue this sort of operation till you observe no more of the powder come off; and all that remains is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANULATED\">granulated</a>. The coarser injection is thus prepared: Take tallow, 1 pound; wax, bleached white, 5 ounces; salad oil, 3 ounces; melt them in a skilful put over a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>: then add <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> turpentine, 2 ounces; and as soon as this is dissolved, gradually sprinkle in of vermillion or verdigris prepared, 3 ounces; then pass all through a clean, dry, warmed linen-cloth, to separate all the groser particles; and, when you design to make it run far into the vessels, some oil of turpentine may be added immediately before it is used.\n\n\"The next thing to be considered, and indeed what chiefly contributes to the success of injections, is the choice and preparation of the subject whose vessels are to be filled.\n\n\"In choosing a fit subject, take these few general rules: 1. The younger the creature to be injected is, the injection will, exacter paribus, go farther, and vice versa. 2. The more the creature's fluids have been dissolved and exhausted in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, the success of the operation will be greater. 3. The less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> the part designed to be injected is, the more vessels will be filled. 4. The more membranous and transparent parts are, the injection flows better; whereas, in the solid very hard parts of a rigid old creature, that has died with its vessels full of thick strong blood, it is scarcely possible to inject great numbers of small vessels.\n\n\"Therefore, in preparing a subject for injecting, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> things to be aimed at are, To dissolve the fluids, empty the vessels of them, relax the solids, and prevent the injection's coagulating too soon. To answer all these intentions, authors have proposed to inject tepid or warm water by the arteries, till it returns clear and untincted by the veins, and the vessels are thereby so emptied of blood, that all the parts appear white; after which, they push out the water by forcing in air; and lastly, by pressing with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, they squeeze the air also out. After this preparation,\n\none can indeed inject very subtilly; but generally there are inconveniences attend it. For in all the parts where there is a remarkable vacua cellulae, it never fails to be full of the water, which is apt to spoil any parts designed to be preserved either wet or dry; and some particles of the water seldom mix to be mixed in the larger as well as smaller vessels with the oily injection, and make it appear discontinued and broken: therefore it is much better to let this injection of water alone, if it can be possibly avoided, and rather to macerate the body or part to be injected a considerable time in water, made to warm (c) as one can hold his hand easily in it; taking care to keep it of an equal warmth all the time, by taking out some of the water as it cools, and pouring in hot water in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>; by which the vessels will be sufficiently softened and relaxed, the blood will be melted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, and the injection can be in no danger of hardening too soon; whereas, if the water is too hot, the vessels shrink, and the blood coagulates. From time to time we squeeze out the liquids as much as possible at the cut vessel by which the injection is to be thrown in (D). The time this maceration is to be continued, is always in proportion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of the subject, the bulk and thickness of what we design to inject, and the quantity of blood we observe in the vessels, which can only be learned by experience; at least, however, care ought to be taken, that the whole subject, or part macerated, is perfectly well warmed all through; and that we continue the pressure with our hands till no more blood can be brought away, whatever position we put the subject in.\n\nWhen the syringe, injections, and subjects, are all in readiness, one of the second sort of pipes is chosen, as near to the diameter of the vessel by which the injection is to be thrown as possible; for if the pipe is too large, it is almost needless to tell it cannot be introduced. If the pipe is much smaller than the vessel, it is scarcely possible to tie them so firmly together, but, by the wrinkling of the coats of the vessel, some small passage will be left, by which part of the injection will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> back on the injector in the time of the operation, and the nearest vessels remain afterwards undisturbed, by the loss of the quantity that oozes out. Having chosen a fit pipe, it is introduced at the cut orifice of the vessel, or at an incision made in the side of it; and then a waxed thread being brought round the vessel, as near to its coats as possible, by the help of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a>, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> eyed probe, the surgeon's knot is made with the thread, and it is drawn as firmly as the thread can allow; taking care that it shall be sunk into the circular notch of the pipe all around, otherwise it will very easily slide off, and the pipe will be brought out probably in the time of the operation, which ruins it.\n\n\"If there have been large vessels cut, which communicate with the vessels you design to inject, or if there are any others proceeding from the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a>, which\n\n(c) Ruysh orders a previous maceration for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> or two in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> water; which must have a better effect in melting the blood than warm water has.\n\n(D) When Ruysh intended to inject the whole body, he put one pipe upwards, and another downwards, in the descending aorta.\nInjection, which you do not resolve to fill, let them be all carefully now tied up, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the injected liquor, and make the operation succeed better in the view you then have.\n\n\"When all this is done, both sorts of injections are to be warmed over a lamp, taking care to stir them constantly, lest the colouring powder <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to the bottom and burn (r). The oil of turpentine needs be made no warmer than will allow the finger to remain in it, if the subject has been previously well warmed in water; when the maceration has not been made, the oil ought to be scalding hot, that it may warm all the parts which are designed to be injected. The coarse injection ought to be brought near to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a>. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, having wrapped several folds of linen round the parts of the syringe which the operator is to grip, and secured the linen with thread, the syringe is to be made very hot by sucking boiling water several times up (s), and the pipe within the vessel is to be warmed by applying a sponge dipped in boiling water to it (c).\n\n\"After all is ready, the syringe being cleared of the water, the injector fills it with the finer injection; and then introducing the pipe of the syringe into that in the vessel, he presses them together, and either with one hand holds this last pipe firm, with the other grips the syringe, and with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> pushes the sucker; or, giving the pipe in the vessel to be held by an assistant, in any of the ways mentioned in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of these sorts of pipes, he grips the syringe with one hand, and pushes the sucker with the other, and consequently throws in the injection, which ought to be done slowly, and with no great force, but proportioned to the length and bulk of the part to be injected and strength of the vessels. The quantity of this fine injection to be thrown in is much to be learned by use. The only rule I could ever fix to myself in this matter was to continue pushing till I was sensible of a stop which would require a considerable force to overcome. But this will not hold where all the branches of any vessel are not injected; as for instance, when the vessels of the thorax only are to be injected: for the aorta bears too great a proportion to the branches sent from it, and therefore less fine injection is requisite here. As soon as that stop is felt, the sucker of the syringe is to be drawn back, that the nearest large vessels may be emptied. Then the syringe is taken off, emptied of the fine injection, and filled with the coarser, which is to be pushed into the vessels quickly and forcibly, having always regard to the strength and firmness of the vessels, bulk, &c. of the part. Continue to thrust the sucker, till a full stop, or a sort of push backwards, is felt, when you must beware of thrusting any more, otherwise some of the vessels will be burst, and the whole, or a considerable share of the preparation you designed, will be spoiled by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRAVASATION\">extravasation</a>; but rather immediately stop the pipe by the turn-cock, and take out the syringe to clean it, and allow sufficient time for the coarse injection to coagulate fully, before any part is discharged.\" Ruysh, immediately after throwing in the injection, put the body into cold water, and stirred it continually for some time, to prevent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMILION\">vermilion</a> to separate from the tallow.\"\n\nII. The injection of the lymphatic system is much more difficult than that of the sanguiferous, on account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> smallness of the vessels; so that till very lately it was almost quite impracticable. Methods indeed had been attempted for this purpose; but by reason of the improper form of the instruments, and the inferior skill of anatomists in former times, we may justly look upon this as one of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> improvements in anatomy.\n\nThe first thing to be considered, when the lymphatics are to be injected, is a proper method of discovering them; for this is by no means an easy matter, on account of their smallness and transparency.\u2014To find out these vessels, the subject must be viewed in a proper place, where the light is neither very strong nor very weak. Mr Sheldon, who has written a treatise upon this subject, recommends a winter forenoon from ten to two; it being chiefly in the winter season that anatomical preparations are made, and because at that time of the day the light is more clear and steady. He says also, from his own experience, that the light passing through the glass of a window is better for this purpose than the open air, as the vessels are more distinctly seen. The injecting of the vessels is likewise rendered more difficult in the open air by the ease with which the humidity is evaporated from them. It will likewise be necessary to incline the part in various ways to the light, as some of the vessels are most easily discoverable in one position and some in another. The lacteal trunks under the peritoneal coats of the intestines, and the lymphatics on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> surface of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a>, &c., particularly require this method. He recommends the use of magnifying glasses. \"I am persuaded (says he), that those who attempt to find them through this medium will not acquire that visus cruditus which is obtained to a surprising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> by those who have been much experienced in injecting lymphatic vessels. A lateral light is likewise preferable to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a>, or even to an oblique sky-light.\n\n\"The subjects must be laid upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> of sufficient height, which might be contrived with a ledge fixed to the table in such a manner as to be water-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>; which would be useful for preventing the quicksilver, which is almost always necessary for injecting these vessels, from being lost. The surface of the table should likewise be hollowed, so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> which falls may be collected in the middle, where a hole with a stopper may be made to take out occasionally the quicksilver which collects. Such a table would also be convenient for holding water for the purpose of sleeping membranous parts which are frequently to be injected; and\n\n(r) Ruysh melts his tallow by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of warm water, into which he puts the vessels containing the injection.\n\n(s) He warms his syringe by laying it on hot coals.\n\n(c) He warms his pipe, by putting the body, after the pipe is fixed in the vessel, into hot water. When this is to be done, a cork ought to be put into the pipe, to prevent the water getting into the vessel that is to be injected.\nInjection, and which, from being exposed to the air, become dry; which also it is inconvenient and hazardous to move into water during the time of operation. Even a common table with a hole cut in the middle may answer the purpose: the hole may be round or square according to the fancy of the anatomist; but the table must be constructed of such materials as are not liable to warp in warm water. Should the anatomist not be provided with either of these tables, the parts must be laid in a tray or earthen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISH\">dish</a>, that the quicksilver may be saved.\n\nThe materials for injecting these vessels are only quicksilver, and the ceraceous or coarse injection of anatomists; the former being always used in injecting the lymphatics and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LACTEALS\">lacteals</a>, it being almost impossible to fill them with another fluid in the dead body. The ceraceous injection is chiefly used for the thoracic duct; and in some particular instances, where the lymphatic trunks have been found larger than the ordinary size, a coarse injection has been made use of.\n\nInjections of the lymphatics may be made even while the animal is alive, and that without any great cruelty, by feeding it with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> previous to its being strangled. Of all the barbarous methods of opening the animal while alive, the most useful seems to be that of Mr Hunter, who directs to perforate the small intestine, and throw in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STARCH\">starch</a>-water with solutions of mucus, or indigo and tar-water. \"In a word (says Mr Sheldon), any gelatinous fluids rendered opaque with such colours as will be absorbed, are extremely useful for experiments of this kind; for much more may be seen by examining the vessels distended with a coloured fluid from natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a>, than by anatomical injection practised in the dead body.\" Lieberkuhn first discovered the ampullae by feeding children in whom the lacteal glands were obstructed previous to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> with milk; by which means not only the lacteal trunks became distended with chyle, but likewise the ampullae. Thus absorbing mouths of the lacteal vessels were discovered by Lieberkuhn; and in a similar manner Aeslinus discovered the lacteals themselves. Thus also Eustachius discovered the thoracic duct in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>; and Mr Hewson traced the lacteal vessels, lymphatics, and thoracic duct, in birds, by making ligatures on the root of the meniscus, and other parts, which had been previously fed with barley. Mr Hunter likewise was enabled to observe the lacteals of a crocodile when distended with chyle.\n\nThe coarse injection for the lymphatics is made of mutton-fat and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> resin, in the proportion of two thirds of resin to one of fat. If required of a thicker consistence, we may add a small quantity of pure wax: if of a softer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, we may augment the quantity of fat: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORPIMENT\">Orpiment</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s yellow is generally made use of; though others are equally proper, provided they be fine enough.\n\nThe instruments necessary for injecting the lymphatic vessels are the injecting tube and pipes, lancets, blow-pipes, knives, scissors, forceps, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLES\">needles</a>, and thread. The old injecting tube has been found in a manner entirely useless, the pipe being fixed in a glass tube two or three feet long; which is one of the reasons why, before the time of Hewson, so little of the lymphatic system could be injected. Tubes of such a length are entirely unmanageable by one person, and it is impossible to perform the operation properly with two. To perform it in the best manner, the instrument should be held in the hand like a pencil or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a>. The instruments used by our author are tubes made either of glass or of brass; which, when filled with mercury, may be held in the hand like a pen: a glass tube, however, is preferable to the metallic one. It is somewhat in the shape of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRUMPET\">trumpet</a>; six inches and a half in length, an inch and a half <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> where broadest, and three-eighths of an inch where narrowest. A collar of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> half an inch broad and three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of an inch long is cemented to this pipe, and a smaller tube of the same metal is screwed upon the end of the collar; the whole terminating in a capillary tube about an inch in length. This last is the most difficult part of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> to execute; it should be drilled out of a solid piece of metal, and not made of a thin bit of plate foldered, as these are apt to turn ragged in the edges, and the folder is also liable to be destroyed by the mercury. Those used by Mr Sheldon were made by drilling a small hole lengthwise through a bit of well-tempered wire. It is cleaned by means of a very small piece of steel-wire capable of passing through the bore of the tube. This ought to be annealed lest it should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a>; in which case the broken bit could not easily be got out. Very small tubes may be made of glass drawn out as fine as we choose; and though very apt to break, they are easily repaired. They ought to be very thin, that they may be easily melted. Sometimes it has been found convenient to fit the collar with a steel stop-cock.\n\nThe brass tube represented by our author is about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> inches and a half in length, and half an inch wide where widest. The collar is a full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an inch broad, and three quarters of an inch long; a steel piece and capillary tube being screwed to it as in the other.\n\nThe lancets are to be exquisitely sharp, in order to cut into the lymphatic vessels. The latter are easily inflated by the small silver blow-pipes usually put up in the dissecting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> mathematical instrument makers: dissecting knives, fine-pointed scissors, accurately made dissecting forceps, with straight or crooked needles, are likewise substituted with advantage, as not being affected by the quicksilver.\n\nWe must next consider the proper subjects for injection. Mr Sheldon recommends, that they should be as free from fat as possible: he has always found in the human subject those who died universally dropsical, or of an affections or anaemia, to be the best, for the following reasons, viz., in such there is little or no animal oil, and but a very small quantity of red blood; both of which, when they occur in great abundance, very much impede the discovery of the lymphatic vessels; but when the cellular vessels are loaded with water, the absorbents are more readily traced, and with less risk of wounding them in dissection: the preparations also, particularly the dried ones, are more lasting. This circumstance is found to be of most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> in preparing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSORBENT\">absorbent</a> vessels of the trunk and extremities of the human subject. Of all the viscera in young subjects, only the liver and lungs can be injected with success; and these may be successfully injected even in the fetus. It will be most proper to begin the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OPERA\">opera</a>-\nInjection upon the subject immediately after death, as lymph or chyle will then be more readily found in the vessels, than when we wait a longer time. In preparing the lacteals, previously distended with milk in the living subject, it is proper to have the intestines and mesenteries plunged (with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGATURE\">ligature</a> upon the root of the latter) into rectified spirit of wine. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> will coagulate the chyle; and the fluid being opaque, the vessels will be beautifully seen when we mean to prepare the parts, by preserving them in proof-spirit, as wet specimens: \"In this way (says Mr. Sheldon) I have made in the dog one of the most natural preparations that can be seen of the lacteals injected from their orifices by the natural absorption.\" We may also prepare the lacteals by the method used by Mr. Hunter, already mentioned; by which they will be very conspicuous, by the indigo absorbed from the cavity of the intestines. By tying the thoracic duct near its insertion into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> formed between the subclavian and jugular veins on the left side, or by tying these veins on both sides, we may distend almost all the absorbents of the animal. Thus we are enabled to pursue these vessels in many parts where they have not yet been discovered, where they can scarcely be traced by injection, and even in some parts where it is utterly impossible for the injections to reach them.\n\nAnother method, sometimes successfully used by our author, was first practised by Malpighi. In this the part is to be steeped in water, and the liquid changed as long as it appears tinged with blood; suffering the parts afterwards to remain in the same water till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a> begins. As soon as this begins to take place, the air which is extricated will distend the lymphatics, so that they may be easily seen, and then injected with quicksilver. It is, however, remarkable, that this method will not in general answer so well in the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a>; the air having never passed by putrefaction into the human lacteals in any of the subjects which Mr. Sheldon tried, though it will take place in those of the horse or ass and many other animals: drawing of the lacteals may likewise be made in this method to very great advantage. In some parts of the human body also this method may be employed to advantage; as the liver, heart, &c. It may likewise be useful to make ligatures on the large trunks of the vessels previous to the maceration, that thus the air may be confined as soon as it is extricated from the coats by putrefaction. Our author adds, that if ligatures were made upon the wrists and legs in articulo mortis, or immediately after death, the lymph would be flopped in the vessels, the latter would become distended, and might be injected with the greatest facility by the common method after taking off the ligature. Mr. Sheldon in such a case recommends the tourniquet. \"I have reason (says he) to believe, that absorption goes on as long as muscular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a> remains; which last continues a considerable time after the general life of the animal is lost.\" On this, however, we cannot forbear to remark, that making ligatures for such purposes upon a human creature in articulo mortis, or even immediately after death, favours so much of barbarity, that we cannot think it will be often practised. In some cases, even in the dead subject, ligatures are useful; as when we are searching for the lymphatics in the fingers and toes.\n\nIn these it is useful to stroke up the parts with the injection finger, by which means the small quantity of lymph remaining in the vessels will be forced upwards, and stopped by the ligature; after which the vessels may be easily injected with quicksilver, as already mentioned.\n\nTo inject the vessels, we must open one or more of them, directing the point of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANCET\">lancet</a> almost always towards the trunk or trunks of the vessels, and taking care not to carry the incision through the opposite side. If the vessels happen to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> under the peritoneum as the lacteals, or under the pleura as the lymphatics of the lungs, we may cut into their cavity through these membranes. In injecting those of the extremities, however, and in many other parts of the body, it is absolutely necessary to distend the vessels we design to fill away from the fat and reticular substance before we attempt to open them with the lancet. The tube with the pipe affixed to it is previously to be filled with mercury; the anatomist then inflates the vessel by means of the blow-pipe, takes the tube from the afflant, and introduces the small tube into the puncture. In this operation it will be found necessary not to carry the tube farther into the vessel than is sufficient to give the mercury a free passage; for if we introduce it farther, the passage of the mercury will be impeded by the pipe being pushed against the side of the vessel. Should not the fluid be able to effect a passage, it will then be necessary to press upon the surface of it in the tube with our fingers. If it defend freely, and without any of its puffing between the side of the vessel and small pipe, we have only to fill up the tube with mercury as the latter defends; but if it gets out, we must then tie the vessel. This, however, should always be avoided if possible; because, if not very dexterously performed, the operator will be apt to separate the tube from the vessel; and on this account the puncture ought always to be very small, no larger indeed than is necessary to allow the pipe to get in with difficulty. As the injection proceeds, the pressure upon the surface of the quicksilver must be carried on higher and higher in the course of the lymphatic, till we come near the gland or glands into which the vessels terminate; otherwise we shall seldom get the cells of the glands, or the vessels emerging from the opposite side of the glands, well injected. In injecting the lymphatic vessels of the extremities, it will be useful to raise the part where the pipe is inserted higher than the other end of the limb, and to make the afflant press with his hands along the skin in the course of the vessels, which will favour the progress of the injection. When the vessels are sufficiently filled, which may be known by the swelling of them, and by the resistance the mercury meets with, the afflant passes a ligature about the vessel and ties it above the puncture before the anatomist withdraws the injection-pipe.\n\nThe method of injecting the larger trunks or thoracic duct with the coarse injection is exactly similar to that already described for the fangiferous vessels. Mr. Sheldon, however, recommends the use of some pipes of a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> invented by himself. The improvement consists in shaping the ends of the pipes like a pen; taking care to make the edges and point blunt, to avoid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> the vessel when we introduce them. Thus much larger tubes than those commonly\nInjection only in use may be admitted; and there is no occasion to make any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> near the extremity of these small pipes to prevent the thread from slipping off; for this will certainly hinder us from inserting pipes of such diameter as might otherwise be done.\n\nHaving thus shown the method of injecting the lymphatics, our author next proceeds to describe the method of dissecting and preparing them either for immediate demonstration, or for preservation for any length of time. In the dissection, great care is requisite, on account of the exquisite thinness of their coats; but if this should happen by accident, it will then be necessary to introduce the pipe at the ruptured part; and having secured it above and below with ligatures, to fill it again as before directed. Our author recommends, for the purpose of dissection, such knives as are made use of by the Germans and French in tracing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a>. They must be made thin in the blade like lancets, and not much larger. A variety of different shaped blades, some single and others <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> edged, will be necessary for various parts of the body; the fault of the common dissecting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a> being that they are too thick in the blade, which makes them soon blunt, and occasions the trouble of perpetual grinding, which is not the case with those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> recommended. A sharp-pointed forceps is necessary, in order to lay fast hold of the smallest portion of cellular substance; but they ought not to be so sharp as to endanger the puncturing of the vessels; nor should they by any means be bowed or stiff in the spring, to prevent the fingers of the operator from being wearied in the operation. They should also be made in such a manner as to hold large as well as small portions of reticular substance. For dissections of this kind, fine-pointed scissors and lancets fixed in handles are sometimes necessary; and it is frequently of use to plunge the parts into water, in order to loosen the reticular membrane connected with the outside of the coats of the vessels; by which means they may be dissected more easily, and with less danger of wounding them. The blood may be extracted by frequently changing the water. After being injected with quicksilver, the parts should not be allowed to remain long in the water, because the volatile alkali formed by putrefaction is apt to change the colour of the mercury.\n\nThe dissection being performed, the preparation is then to be preserved either in a wet or dry state, according to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. Preparations of the larger parts, as the trunk or extremities, should be preserved dry; and to dry them effectually, they should be exposed to a free current of air, but not to the rays of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>; and the vessels should be displayed in their natural situation. When fully dried, they ought then to be varnished over with transparent spirit or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPAL\">copal</a> varnish: which will not only preserve them from insects, but render them more beautiful, and the vessels more conspicuous. They should then be inclosed in glass cases, where they are to be placed in a horizontal position, and handled as little as possible.\n\nTo make preparations of the thoracic duct, we must in the first place fill the aorta, vena cava superior, and vena azygos or intercostalis, with coarse injection; then fill, with the same, the vessels below the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> crus or little muscle of the diaphragm. The duct is sometimes prepared with quicksilver; but Mr Sheldon recommends to anatomists to make drawings of any thing new or remarkable in their preparations of the thoracic lymphatic vessels with quicksilver; as most of those specimens, particularly such as are dried, become at last totally useless by reason of the drying of the vessels and the escape or blackening of the mercury; or from the varnish growing more and more opaque with age. The quicksilver injection, however, in some cases is very useful. Thus, for instance, if we wish to demonstrate the valves in the thoracic duct, or any other large absorbent vessel, we need only inject the vessels with quicksilver, dissect and dry them, then cut them open, and let the mercury run out: after which the valves will appear by making sections in the coats of the vessels. This may be done still better by varnishing the vessels three or four times before the sections are made; because the varnish will strengthen the sides of the vessel. In wet preparations the valves in the cavities of these parts may likewise be demonstrated by opening them; or by inverting the vessels and suspending them in proof malt-spirits. Thus the valves that cover the terminations of the thoracic duct on the inside of the angle formed between the jugular and subclavian veins on the left side, and those which terminate the lymphatics on the right side of the neck, arm, and lungs, may be beautifully demonstrated. Specimens of the lacteal vessels, of the absorbents of the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, diaphragm, kidneys, &c., may be kept wet or dry, according to the particular nature of the preparation or view of the anatomist. Some preparations are the better for being dried and afterwards immersed in phials full of oil of turpentine; by which means the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> will be rendered transparent, the vessels distinctly seen, and the vessels appear extremely beautiful. The only disadvantage of this method is, that the parts on which the vessels pass, do not at all preserve their natural bulk by reason of their shrinking up; and as the wet preparations are free from this inconvenience, Mr Sheldon does not hesitate at afflicting them a decided superiority over the dry ones.\u2014Sometimes it is necessary to fix the preparations upon stiff <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> or pasteboard, on account of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> after being injected with mercury. The paper or pasteboard on which they are fastened ought to be of various colours, according to the nature of the preparation, in order to form a proper ground for showing the lymphatic vessels. Such small preparations as are preserved in spirits, or oil of turpentine, may be kept in bottles well closed with stoppers; and the larger in common preparation glasses. Our author describes a simple method of stopping the mouths of these preparation glasses, by which means the stopper is rendered nearly as durable as the glass itself. \"In order to execute it, let the anatomist take care to have the upper surface of his bottles made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, by desiring the workmen at the glass-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> to flatten them in the making. This they will easily do in forming the round ones, but the flat bottles are attended with considerable difficulty. The right way to make them, I believe, would be to blow them in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOULDS\">moulds</a> of various sizes; the workman should likewise form the bottoms of the bottles perfectly flat, that they may stand upright and steady.\" Bottles of this form being provided for the larger preparations, we grind the upper surface of them on a plain plate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, about a quarter of an inch thick, and two feet in diameter; first with fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMERY\">emery</a> and water,\nInjection, ter, then with powdered rotten <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTTY\">putty</a> first wet with water and at last dry; so that the surface may be reduced to an exact horizontal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>, and of as fine a polish as plate-glass. This will soon be done, as the manoeuvre requires but little dexterity; and the anatomist should be provided with a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of these glasses prepared as above directed. To the top of each bottle a piece of plate-glass, cut by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMOND\">diamond</a>, is to be adapted so as completely to cover, but not project over, the edge of the bottle. When these two smooth surfaces are put upon each other, with a drop of water between, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> of cohesion is so considerable, that it requires great force to separate them.\n\nMany preparations of the lymphatics, and other parts preserved in bottles, do not require any strings to suspend them; particularly when fixed on plateboard or paper; such as require suspension should be tied to strings fixed to the preparation below, and to small holes drilled in the substance of the glass at the bottom of the neck; or to small bits of glass that may be fixed on the inside of the same part. The preparation is thus suspended in limpid proof malt-spirit, the bottle being almost completely filled; the upper and polished surface of the bottle, and the plate of glass, are to be wiped clean and dry; a drop of solution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> arabic is to be put on the polished surface of the bottle, the top strongly and steadily pressed upon it, so as to bring the two surfaces into as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> contact as possible; after which the bottle is to be placed in a cool <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIRY\">airy</a> place to dry. A piece of wet ox-bladder, freed from fat, and soaked in water till it becomes mucilaginous, is then to be placed over the top, the air pressed out from between it and the glass; after which it must be tied with a packthread dipped in the solution of gum arabic. The bladder being cut off neatly under the last turn of the thread, is then to be dried, the string taken cautiously off, and the top and neck painted with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of lamp-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> mixed with japanners <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> size; this soon dries, and leaves a fine smooth glossy surface, from which the dirt can at any time be readily wiped off as from a mirror. By this method large bottles are as easily and effectually secured as small ones; and it is found to answer as well as the hermetical sealing of glasses, which in large vessels is altogether impracticable. If the bottoms have any inequalities which prevent them from standing steady, they may be easily made perfectly flat by grinding them with emery on the plate above-mentioned. The tops, if well gummed, will even remain perfectly fixed on the glasses without the bladder; though in the common upright ones it may be advisable to put it on as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>. Our author informs us, that since his making this discovery, he has used glass faucets; with flat tops gummed on. In these vessels the preparations, by reason of their horizontal posture, appear to great advantage. Thus he has exhibited very early abortions in their membranes, and some other preparations that cannot be suspended or viewed conveniently in the perpendicular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. Some very delicate preparations, particularly those intended to be viewed with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MICROSCOPE\">microscope</a>, those of the ampullae lacteae of Lieberk\u00fchn, and of the valves of the absorbers, may be preserved either in spirits or dry in tubes closed in the manner just mentioned, and will appear to great advantage. Some of the dry ones may also be advantageously placed in square <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> boxes, made of pieces of plate or white glass neatly gummed together, with narrow slips of white or coloured paper, and the objects may be conveniently viewed in this manner. With respect to the stopper bottles, which are very convenient for holding small preparations, our author advises the stoppers to be perfectly well ground; that they pass rather lower down than the neck of the bottle for the convenience of drilling two holes obliquely through the inferior edge of the substance of the stopper, opposite to each other, for the convenience of fixing threads to hold the subject; for if the threads pass between the neck and stopper, a space will be left; or if the stopper be well ground, the neck of the bottle will be broken in endeavouring to press it down. On the other hand, if any space be left, the thread, by its capillary attraction, will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> from capillary attraction, raise the spirits from the bottle, and cause <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>, which will likewise take place from the chink between the stopper and neck.","sp":276,"ep":283},{"h":"INJUNCTION","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">Law</a>, a writ generally grounded upon an interlocutory order <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHANCERY\">chancery</a> or exchequer, sometimes to give possession to the plaintiff, for want of the defendant's appearance; sometimes to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s ordinary court, and sometimes to the court-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a>, to stop proceedings in a cause, upon suggestion made, that the rigour of the law, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, is against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, that the complainant is not able to make his defense in these courts, for want of witnesses, &c. or that they are erroneously, denying him some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> advantage.

Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEWIS\">Lewis</a> hath discovered its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> from some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> authors. \"Pliny and Vitruvius (says he) expressly mention the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOOT\">soot</a>, or what we now call <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>-black, and the composition of writing-ink from lamp-black and gum. Dioscorides is more particular, setting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the proportions of the two ingredients, viz. three ounces of the foot to one of the gum. It seems the mixture was formed into cakes or rolls; which being dried in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, were occasionally tempered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; as the cakes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> ink are among us for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>.\"\n\nIn Mr Delaval's Treatise on Colours, p. 37, he acquaints us, that with an infusion of galls and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> filings, he had not only made an exceedingly black and durable ink, but by its means, without the addition of any acid, dyed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> and woollen cloth of a good and lasting black. This kind of ink, however, though the colour is far superior to that of any other, has the inconvenience of being very easily discharged, either by the smallest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of any acid, or even by simple water; because it does not penetrate the paper in such a manner as is necessary to preserve it from the instantaneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the acid or of the water. During the action of the infusion of galls upon the iron in making this kind of ink, a very considerable effervescence takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, and a quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is discharged, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of which has not yet been examined.\n\nThe materials usually employed for the making of ink are, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> green vitriol, or copperas and galls; but almost all of them are deficient in durability, which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of such importance, that Dr Lewis hath thought the subject of ink-making not unworthy of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. From experiments made by that author, he infers, that the decay of inks is chiefly owing to a deficiency of galls; that the galls are the most perishable ingredient, the quantity of these, which gives the greatest blackness at first (which is about equal parts with the vitriol), being insufficient to maintain the colour: that, for a durable ink, the quantity of galls cannot be much less than three times that of the vitriol; that it cannot be much greater without lessening the blackness of the ink: that by diminishing the quantity of water, the ink is rendered blacker and more durable; that distilled water, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>-water, and hard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>-water, have the same effects: that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> wine produces a deeper black colour than water; that the colour produced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a> is deeper than that by wine; that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>-spirit extracts only a reddish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> tinge; that the last-mentioned tincture sinks into, and spreads upon, the paper; and hence the impropriety of adding spirit of wine to ink, as is frequently directed, to prevent moulding or freezing; that other astringents, as oak-bark, bittern, floe-bark, &c. are not so effectual as galls, nor give so good a black, the colour produced by most of these, excepting oak-bark, being greenish; that the juice of floes does not produce a black colour with martial vitriol; but that, nevertheless, the writing made with it becomes black, and is found to be more durable than common ink: that inks made with saturated solutions of iron, in nitrous, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a>, or acetic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>, in tartar, or in lemon juice, were much inferior to the ink made with martial vitriol: that the colour of ink is depraved by adding quicklime, which is done with an intention of destroying any superabundant acid which may be supposed to be the cause of the loss of the colour of ink: that the best method of preventing the effects of this superabundant acid is probably by adding pieces of iron to engage it; and that this conjecture is confirmed by an instance the author had heard, of the great durability of the colour of an ink in which pieces of iron had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> immersed: and lastly, that a decoction of logwood used instead of water, sensibly improves both the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> and deepness of the black, without disposing it to fade. The same author observes, that the addition of gum-arabic is not only useful, by keeping the colouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> suspended in the fluid, but also by preventing the ink from spreading, by which means a greater quantity of it is collected on each stroke of the pen. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">Sugar</a>, which is sometimes added to ink, is found to be much less effectual than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a>, and to have the inconvenience of preventing the drying of the ink. The colour of ink is found to be greatly injured by keeping the ink in vessels made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, and probably of any other metal, excepting iron, which the vitriolic acid can dissolve.\n\nThe foregoing experiments point out for the best proportions of the ingredients for ink. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of green vitriol, one part of powdered logwood, and three parts of powdered galls. The best menstruum appears to be vinegar or white wine, though for common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> water is sufficient. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the ink be required to be of a full colour, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUART\">quart</a>, or at most three pints, of liquor, may be allowed to three ounces of galls, and to one ounce of each of the other two ingredients. Half an ounce of gum may be added to each pint of the liquor. The ingredients may be all put together at once in a convenient vessel, and well shaken four or five times each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. In 10 or 12 days the ink <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be fit for use, though it will improve by remaining longer on the ingredients. Or it may be made more expeditiously, by adding the gum and vitriol to a decoction of galls and logwood in the menstruum. To the ink, after it has been separated from the feculencies, some coarse powder of galls, from which the fine dust has been sifted, together with one or two pieces of iron, may be added, by which its durability will be secured.\n\nIn some attempts made by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> to endow writing ink with the great durability of that of the ancients, as well as the properties which it has at present; he first thought of using animal glues, and then of oily matters. \"I mixed both lamp-black (says he) and ivory-black with solution of gum-arabic, made of such consistence as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> to flow sufficiently from the pen. The liquors wrote of a fine black colour; but when...\"\nwhen dry, part of the colour could be rubbed off, especially in moist <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> dipped in water washed it away entirely.\n\n\"I tried solutions of the animal-glues with the same effect. Ifinglals or full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLUE\">glue</a> being the most difficultly dissoluble of these kinds of bodies, I made a decoction of it in water, of such strength that the liquor concreted into a jelly before it was quite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>; with this jelly, kept fluid by sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, I mixed some ivory-black: <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> drawn with this mixture on paper bore rubbing much better than the others, but were discharged without much difficulty by a wet pencil.\n\n\"It was now suspected, that the colour could not be sufficiently fixed on paper without an oily cement. As oils themselves are made miscible with watery <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> by the intervention of gum, I mixed some of the softer painters <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a>, aftermentioned, with about half its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of a thick mucilage of gum-arabic, working them well together in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a> till they united into a smooth uniform <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>: this was beaten with lamp-black, and some water added by little and little, the rubbing being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till the mixture was diluted to a due consistence for writing. It wrote freely, and of a full brownish black colour: the characters could not be discharged by rubbing, but water washed them out, though not near so readily as any of the foregoing. Instead of the painters varnish or boiled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, I mixed raw linseed oil in the same manner with mucilage and lamp-black; and on diluting the mixture with water, obtained an ink not greatly different from the other.\n\n\"Though these oily mixtures answered better than those with simple gums or glues, it was apprehended that their being dischargeable by water would render them unfit for the purposes intended. The only way of obviating this imperfection appeared to be, by using a paper which should admit the black liquid to sink a little into its substance. Accordingly I took some of the more finking kinds of paper, and common paper made damp as for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a>; and had the satisfaction to find, that neither the oily nor the simple gummy mixtures spread upon them so much as might have been expected, and that the characters were as fixed as could be desired, for they could not be washed out without rubbing off part of the substance of the paper itself.\n\n\"All these inks must be now and then stirred or shaken during the time of use, to mix up the black powder, which settles by degrees to the bottom: those with oil must be well shaken also, though not used, once a-day, or at least once in three or four days, to keep the oil united with the water and gum; for, if once the oil separates, which it is apt to do by standing at rest for some days, it can no longer be mixed with the thin fluid by any agitation. But though this imperfect union of the ingredients renders these inks less fit for general use than those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> employed, I apprehend there are many occasions in which these kinds of inconveniences will not be thought to counterbalance the advantage of having writings which we may be assured will be as lasting as the paper they are written upon. And indeed the inconvenience may be in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> obviated by using cotton in the inkstand, which, imbibing the fluid, prevents the separation of the black powder diffused through it.\n\n\"All the inks, however, made on the principle we are now speaking of, can be discharged by washing, unless the paper admits them to sink into its substance. The ancients were not insensible of this imperfection; and sometimes endeavoured to obviate it, according to Pliny, by using vinegar instead of water, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERING\">tempering</a> the mixture of lamp-black and gum. I tried vinegar, and found it to be of some advantage, not as giving any improvement to the cement, but by promoting the sinking of the matter into the paper. As this washing out of the ink may be prevented by using a kind of paper easy enough to be procured, it is scarce to be considered as an imperfection; and indeed, on other kinds of paper, it is an imperfection only so far as it may give occasion to fraud, for none of these inks are in danger of being otherwise discharged than by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>. The vitriolic inks themselves, and those of printed books and copperplates, are all dischargeable; nor can it be expected of the ink-maker to render writings secure from frauds.\n\n\"But a further improvement may yet be made, namely, that of uniting the ancient and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> inks together; or using the common vitriolic ink instead of water, for tempering the ancient mixture of gum and lamp-black. By this method it should seem that the writings would have all the durability of those of former times, with all the advantage that results from the vitriolic ink fixing itself in the paper. Even where the common vitriolic mixture is depended on for the ink, it may in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> be improved by a small addition of the ancient composition, or of the common Indian ink which answers the same purpose: when the vitriolic ink is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILUTE\">dilute</a>, and flows so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> from the pen, that the fine strokes, on first writing, are scarcely visible, the addition of a little Indian ink is the readiest means of giving it the due blackness. By this admixture it may be presumed also that the vitriolic ink will be made more durable, the Indian ink in some measure covering it, and defending it from the action of the air. In all cases, where Indian ink or other similar compositions are employed, cotton should be used in the inkstand, as already mentioned, to prevent the settling of the black powder.\"\n\nSince the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of printing much less attention than formerly has been paid to the making of ink, so that now the art seems to be in a great measure lost. This will appear from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of some ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a> with the writings of modern times. It being of the utmost importance, however, that public records, wills, and other valuable papers, which cannot admit of being printed, should be written with ink of a durable quality, this inattention seems to have been very culpable, and a restoration of the method of making writing ink a very valuable acquisition. \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> (says Mr Attle) of paying greater attention to this matter may readily be seen, by comparing the rolls and records that have been written from the 15th century to the end of the 17th, with the writings we have remaining of various writings from the 5th to the 12th centuries. Notwithstanding the superior antiquity of the latter, they are in excellent preservation; but we frequently find the former, though of more modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a>, so much defaced that they are scarcely legible.\"\n\nOur author agrees with Dr Lewis in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that\nthat the ancient inks were composed of foot or ivory black instead of the galls, copperas, and gums, which form the composition of ours. Besides their black inks, however, the ancients used various other colours, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> and silver, purple, &c. Green ink was frequently used in Latin manuscripts, especially in the latter ages; and it was frequently employed in signatures by the guardians of the Greek emperors till their wards were of age. Blue or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> ink was seldom used except in manuscripts; but (says Mr Attle) \"the yellow has not been much in use, as far as we can learn, these 600 years.\" Some kinds of characters, particularly the metallic, were burnished. Wax was used by the Latins and Greeks as a varnish, but especially by the former, and particularly in the 9th century. It continued a long time in vogue.\n\nA treatise upon inks was published by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> Canliarius professor of medicine at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a>; of which an edition was printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> in 1660. It is divided into six parts. The first treats of inks made from pyrites, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>; the second of such as are made from metals and calces; the third from foot and vitriol; the fourth of the different kinds of inks used by the librarii or book-writers, by printers, and engravers; likewise of staining or writing upon marble, flucco, or scaliola, and of encatolic modes of writing; also of liquids for painting or colouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> or woollen cloth; restoring inks that had been decayed by time; together with many methods of effacing writing, restoring decayed paper, and different modes of secret writing. The fifth treats of writing inks made in different countries from gums, woods, the juices of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, &c., as well as of different kinds of varnishes. The sixth treats of the different methods of extracting vitriol, and the chemical uses of it.\n\nWeckerus de Secretis, a treatise printed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASIL\">Basil</a> in 1612, contains a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of curious particulars concerning ink. He gives also receipts for making gold and silver inks, composed both with these metals and without them; directions for making inks for secret writing, and for defacing them; though in this last part there are many particulars bordering too much on the marvellous.\n\nIn the Philosophical Transactions for 1787, Dr Blagden gives some account of a method of restoring decayed inks so as to render them legible. His experiments originated from a conversation with Mr Attle already quoted, on the question whether the inks make eight or ten centuries ago, and which are found to have preserved their colour very well, were made of the same materials now employed or not? In order to decide the question, Mr Attle furnished the doctor with several manuscripts on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARCHMENT\">parchment</a> and vellum from the 9th to the 15th centuries inclusively. Some of these were still very black; others of different shades, from a deep yellowish brown to a very pale yellow, in some parts to faint that it could scarcely be seen. This was tried with simple and phlogisticated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALKALIES\">alkalies</a>, the mineral acids, and infusion of galls. From these experiments it appeared that the ink anciently employed was of the same nature as at present: the letters turned of a reddish or yellowish brown with alkalies became pale, and were at length obliterated by the dilute mineral acids. The drop of acid liquor, which had been put upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>, changed to a deep blue or green on the addition of phlogisticated alkalies; with an infusion of galls, in some cases the letters acquired a deep tinge, in others a slight one. \"Hence says the doctor it is evident, that one of the ingredients was iron, which there is no reason to doubt was joined with the vitriolic acid; and the colour of the more perfect MSS. which in some was a deep black, and in others a purplish black, together with the restitution of that colour in those which had lost it by the infusion of galls, sufficiently proved that another of the ingredients was astringent matter, which from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> appears to have been that of galls. No trace of a black pigment of any sort was discovered; the drop of acid, which had completely extracted a letter, appearing of an uniform pale and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERRUGINOUS\">ferruginous</a> colour, without an atom of black powder, or other extraneous matter floating in it.\"\n\nAs this account differs very materially from the former extracted from Mr Attle's writings, so the reason given for the continuance of the colour differs so little. This, according to Dr Blagden, \"seems to depend very much on a better preparation of the material upon which the writing was made, namely the parchment or vellum; the blackest letters being generally those which had sunk into it the deepest. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of effervescence was commonly to be perceived when acids were in contact with the surface of these old vellums. I was led, however, to suspect, that the ancient inks contained rather a less proportion of iron than the more modern; for, in general, the tinge of colour produced by the phlogisticated alkali in the acid laid upon them, seemed less deep; which, however, might depend in part upon the length of time they have been kept; and perhaps more gum was used in them, or they were walked over with some kind of varnish, though not such as gave any glofs.\"\n\nAmong the specimens with which our author was favoured by Mr Attle, there was one which differed very materially from the rest. It was said to be a manuscript of the 15th century: the letters were of a full engraving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, angular without any fine strokes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and very black. None of the chemical solvents above mentioned seemed to produce any effect. Most of them seemed rather to make the letters blacker, probably by cleaning the surface; and the acids, after having been rubbed strongly upon the letters, did not strike any deeper tinge with the phlogisticated alkali. Nothing could obliterate these but what took off part of the vellum; when small rolls of a dirty matter were to be perceived. \"It is therefore unquestionable (says the doctor) that no iron was used in this ink; and, from its resistance to the chemical solvents, as well as a certain clotted appearance in the letters when examined closely, and in some places a slight degree of glofs, I have little doubt that they were formed of a footy or carbonaceous powder and oil, probably something like our present printers' ink; and am not without suspicion that they were actually printed.\"\n\nOn examining this MS. more fully, our author was convinced that it was really a part of a very ancient printed book. In considering the methods of restoring the legibility of decayed writings, our author observes, that perhaps one of the best may be to join phlogisticated alkali with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CALX\">calx</a> of iron which remains; because\ncaus\u00e8 the precipitate formed by these two substances greatly exceeds that of the iron alone. On this subject Dr Blagden disagrees with Mr Bergmann; but to bring the matter to a test, the following experiments were made.\n\n1. The phlogisticated alkali was rubbed in different quantities upon the bare writing. This, in general, produced little effect; though, in a few instances, it gave a bluish tinge to the letters, and increased their intensity; \"probably (says the doctor) where something of an acid nature had contributed to the diminution of their colour.\" 2. By adding, besides the alkali, a dilute mineral acid to the writing, our author found his expectations fully answered; the letters then changing quickly to a very deep and beautiful blue. It is but of little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> whether the acid or phlogisticated alkali be first added; though upon farther consideration the doctor inclined to begin with the alkali. The reason is, that when the alkali is first put on, the colour seems to spread less, and thus not to hurt the legibility of the writing so much as would otherwise be done. His method is to spread the alkali thin over the writing with a feather, then to touch it as gently as possible upon or nearly over the letters with the diluted acid by means of a feather or bit of stick cut to a blunt point. The moment that the acid liquor is applied, the letters turn to a fine blue, beyond comparison stronger than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> trace of the letter; and by applying a bit of blotting-paper to soak up the superfluous liquid, we may in a great measure avoid the staining of the parchment: for it is this superfluous liquor which, absorbing part of the colouring matter from the letters, becomes a dye to whatever it touches. Care ought, however, to be taken not to allow the blotting paper to come in contact with the letters, because the colouring matter may easily be rubbed off while soft and wet. Any one of the three mineral acids will answer the purpose effectually. Dr Blagden commonly uses the marine. But whichever of the three is used, it ought to be diluted so far as not to be in danger of corroding the parchment; after which the degree of strength seems not to be a matter of great nicety.\n\nAnother method of restoring the legibility of old writings is by wetting them with an infusion of galls in white wine: but this is subject to the same inconvenience with the former, and is besides less efficacious. The doctor is of opinion that the acid of the galls by itself would be better for the purpose than the infusion of the whole substance of them; and he thinks also that a preferable kind of phlogisticated alkali might be prepared either by purifying the common kind from iron as much as possible, or by making use of the volatile alkali instead of the fixed. Mr Aftle mentions a method of restoring the legibility of decayed writings; but says that it ought not to be hazarded lest a suspicion of deceit should arise.\n\nA method has been proposed of preventing ink from decaying by washing over the paper to be written upon with the colouring matter of Prussian blue, which will not deprave it in colour, or any other respect. By writing upon it with common ink afterwards, a ground of Prussian blue is formed under every stroke; and this remains strong after the black has been decayed by the weather, or destroyed by acids. Thus the ink will bear a larger proportion of vitriol at first, and will have the advantage of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> blacker when first written.\n\nIndian Ink, a valuable black for water-colours, brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a> and other parts of the East Indies, sometimes in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> rolls, but more commonly in small quadrangular cakes, and generally marked with Chinese characters. Dr Lewis, from experiments made on this substance, hath shown that it is composed of fine lamp-black and animal glue: and accordingly, for the preparation of it, he desires us to mix the lamp-black with as much melted glue as is sufficient to give it a tenacity proper for being made into cakes; and these when dry, he tells us, answered as well as those imported from the East Indies, both with regard to the colour and the freedom of working. Ivory black, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a> blacks, levigated to a great degree of fineness, answered as well as the lamp-black; but in the flake in which ivory-black is commonly sold, it proved much too gritty, and separated too hastily from the water.\n\nPrinting Ink, is totally different from Indian ink, or that made use of in writing. It is an oily composition, of the consistence of an ointment: the method of preparing it was long kept a secret by those whose employment it was to make it, and who were interested in concealing it; and even yet is but imperfectly known. The properties of good printing ink are, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> clean and easily, without daubing the types, or tearing the paper; to have a fine black colour; to wash easily off the types; to dry soon; and to preserve its colour, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> brown. This last, which is a most necessary property, is effectually obtained by setting fire to the oil with which the printing ink is made for a few moments, and then extinguishing it by covering the vessel (a). It is made to wash easily off the types, by using <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a> as an ingredient; and its working clean depends on its having a proper degree of strength, which is given by a certain addition of rosin. A good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a>, however, depends on the proportion of the ingredients to each other; for if too much soap is added, the ink will work very foul, and daub the types to a great degree. The same thing will happen from using too much black, at the same time that both the soap and black hinder the ink from drying; while too much oil and rosin tear the paper, and hinder it from washing off.\u2014The following receipt has been found to make printing ink of a tolerable good quality. \"Take a Scots pint of linseed oil, and set it over a pretty brisk fire in an iron or copper vessel capable of holding three or four times as much. When it boils strongly, and emits a thick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>, kindle it with a piece of paper, and immediately take the vessel off the fire. Let the oil burn for about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>; then extinguish it by covering the vessel; after it has grown\n\n(a) This is mentioned by Dr Lewis in his Philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">Commerce</a> of Arts; but he seems not to have been acquainted with the method of giving it the other necessary properties.\ngrown pretty cool, add two pounds of black rosin, and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of hard soap cut into thin slices. If the oil is very hot when the soap is added, almost the whole mixture will run over the vessel. The mixture is then to be set again over the fire; and when the ingredients are thoroughly melted, a pound of lampblack, previously put through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAWN\">lawn</a> sieve, is to be stirred into it. The whole ought then to be ground on a marble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, or in a levigating mill.\n\nThough the above receipt is greatly superior to any that hath been hitherto published, all of which are capitally deficient in not mentioning the necessary ingredients of rosin and soap; yet it must be acknowledged, that ink made in this manner is inferior in point of colour, and is likewise more apt to daub the types and make an indistinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>, than such as is prepared by some of those who make the manufacture of this commodity their employment; so that either a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> in the proportion of the ingredients, a nicety in the mixture, or some additional ingredient, seems necessary to bring it to the requisite perfection.\n\n**Ink for the rolling Press**, is made of lintseed oil burnt in the same manner as that for common printing ink, and then mixed with Frankfort black, and finely ground. There are no certain proportions which can be determined in this kind of ink; every workman adding oil or black to his ink as he thinks proper, in order to make it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>.\u2014Some, however, mix a portion of common boiled oil, which has never been burnt; but this must necessarily be a bad practice, as such oil is apt to go through the paper; a fault very common in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a>, especially if the paper is not very thick. No soap is added; because the ink is not cleared off from the copperplates with alkaline ley as in common printing, but with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a> dipped in oil.\n\nInk is also an appellation given to any coloured liquor used in writing. Different kinds of these inks may be prepared by the directions given under the article **Colour-Making**.\n\n**Sympathetic Ink**, a liquor with which a person may write, and yet nothing appear on the paper after it is dry, till some means are used, as holding the paper to the fire, rubbing it over with some other liquor, &c.\n\nThese kinds of ink may be divided into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> classes, with respect to the means used to make them visible; viz. 1. Such as become visible by puffing another liquor over them, or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> them to the vapour of that liquor. 2. Those that do not appear so long as they are kept <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>, but soon become visible on being exposed to the air. 3. Such as appear by freezing or setting some very fine powder of any colour over them. 4. Those which become visible by being exposed to the fire. 5. Such as become visible by heat, but disappear again by cold or the moisture of the air. 6. Those which become visible by being wetted with water. 7. Such as appear of various colours.\n\nI. The first class contains four kinds of ink, viz. solutions of lead, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISMUTH\">bismuth</a>, gold, and green vitriol, or sulphate of iron. The first two become visible by the contact of sulphurous liquids or fumes. For the first, a solution of common sugar of lead in water answers very well. With this solution write with a clean pen, and the writing when dry will be totally invisible; but if it be wetted with a solution of bepar sulphuris, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORPIMENT\">orpiment</a>, dissolved by means of quicklime; or exposed to the strong vapours of these solutions, the writing will appear of a brown colour, more or less deep according to the strength of the sulphurous fume. By the same means the solution of nitrate of bismuth will appear of a deep black.\n\nThe sympathetic ink prepared from gold depends on the property by which that metal precipitates from its solvent on the addition of a solution of tin. Write with a solution of gold in nitro-muriatic acid, and let the paper dry gently in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>; nothing will appear for the first seven or eight hours. Dip a pencil in the solution of tin, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> it lightly over the invisible characters, they will immediately appear, of a purple colour.\n\nCharacters written with a solution of green vitriol, will likewise be invisible when the paper is dry; but if wetted with an infusion of galls, they will immediately appear as if written with common ink. If, instead of this infusion, a solution of an alkaline prussiate be used, the writing will appear of a deep blue.\n\nII. To the second class belong the solutions of all those metals which are apt to attract <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a> from the air, such as lead, bismuth, silver, &c. The sympathetic ink of gold already mentioned belongs also to this class; for if the characters written with it are long exposed to the air, they become by degrees of a deep violet colour, nearly approaching to black. In like manner, characters written with a solution of nitrate of silver are invisible when newly dried, but being exposed to the sun, appear of a gray colour like slate. To this class also belong solutions of sugar of lead, nitrates of copper and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>, acetate of iron, and muriate of tin. Each of these has a particular colour when exposed to the air; but they corrode the paper.\n\nIII. The third class of sympathetic inks contains such liquids as have some kind of glutinous viscoity, and at the same time are long in drying; by which means, though the eye cannot discern the characters written with them upon paper, the powders strewed upon them immediately adhere, and thus make the writing become visible. Of this kind are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, the juices of some vegetables, weak solutions of the deliquescent salts, &c.\n\nIV. This class, comprehending all those that become visible by being exposed to the fire, is very extensive, as it contains all those colourless liquids in which the matter dissolved is capable of being reduced, or of reducing the paper, into a sort of charcoal by a small heat. Sulphuric acid diluted with as much water as will prevent it from corroding the paper makes a good ink of this kind. Letters written with this fluid are invisible when dry, but instantly on being held near the fire appear as black as if written with the finest ink. Juice of lemons or onions, a solution of sal-ammoniac, green vitriol, &c. answer the same purpose.\n\nV. The fifth class comprehends only a solution of muriate of cobalt; for the properties of which, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a>, No. 1668, p. 627.\n\nVI. This class comprehends such inks as become visible when characters written with them are wetted with water. They are made of all such substances as deposit a copious sediment when mixed with water, dissolving only imperfectly in that fluid. Of this kind are\nInk-stones are dried <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>, sugar of lead, vitriol, &c. We have therefore only to write with a strong solution of these salts upon paper, and the characters will be invisible when dry; but when we apply water, the small portion of dried <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> cannot again be dissolved in the water. Hence the insoluble part becomes visible on the paper, and shows the characters written in white, gray, brown, or any other colour which the precipitate affumes.\n\nVII. Characters may be made to appear of a fine crimson, purple, or yellow, by writing on paper with solution of muriate of tin, and then paling over it a pencil dipped in a decoction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COCHINEAL\">cochineal</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRAZIL\">Brazil</a>-wood, logwood, yellow wood, &c.\n\nInk Stones, a kind of small round stones, of a white, red, gray, yellow, or black colour, containing a quantity of native martial vitriol, whence they derive the property of making ink, and from thence their name. They are almost entirely soluble in water, and besides their other ingredients, contain also a portion of copper and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a>.","sp":283,"ep":289},{"h":"INLAND","t":"a name for any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> at a distance from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>.\n\nInland <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">Navigation</a>.

Our colleges of municipal or common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> professors and students, are called inns: the old English word for houses of noblemen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>, and others of extraordinary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, being of the same signification with the French word hotels.\n\nInns of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">Court</a> are so called, as some think, because the students there are to serve and attend the courts of judicature; or else, because anciently these colleges received none but the sons of noblemen, and better sort of gentlemen, who were here to be qualified to serve the king in his court; as Fortescue affirms. And, in his time, he says, there were about 2000 students in the inns of court and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHANCERY\">chancery</a>, all of whom were filii nobilium, or gentlemen born. But this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> has gradually fallen into disuse; so that in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, Sir Edward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COKE\">Coke</a> does not reckon above 1000 students, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> at present is very considerably less; for which Judge Blackstone assigns the following reasons. 1. Because the inns of chancery, being now almost totally filled by the inferior branches of the profession, are neither commodious nor proper for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> of gentlemen of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>; so that there are very rarely any young students entered at the inns of chancery. 2. Because in the inns of court all sorts of regimen and academical superintendence, either with regard to morals or studies, are found impracticable, and therefore entirely neglected. Lastly, because persons of birth and fortune, after having finished their usual courses at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a>, have seldom leisure or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> sufficient to enter upon a new scheme of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> at a new place of instruction; wherefore few gentlemen now resort to the inns of court, but such for whom the knowledge of practice is absolutely necessary in such as are intended for the profession.\n\nOur inns of court, justly famed for the production of men of learning in the law, are governed by masters, principals, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENCHERS\">benchers</a>, stewards, and other officers; and have public halls for exercises, readings, &c., which\nwhich the students are obliged to attend and perform for a certain number of years, before they can be admitted to plead at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> have not, however, any judicial authority over their members; but instead of this they have certain orders among themselves, which have by consent the force of laws. For <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> offences persons are only excommunicated, or put out of commons; for greater, they lose their chambers, and are expelled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>; and when once expelled out of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, they are never received by any of the others. The gentlemen in these societies may be divided into benchers, outer-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRISTERS\">barristers</a>, inner-barristers, and students.\n\nThe four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> inns of court, are the Inner Temple and Middle Temple, heretofore the dwelling of the Knights <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEMPLARS\">Templars</a>, purchased by some professors of the common law about 300 years ago; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINCOLN\">Lincoln</a>'s Inn and Gray's Inn, anciently belonging to the earls of Lincoln and Gray. The other inns are the two Sergeants Inns.\n\nInns of Chancery were probably so called, because anciently inhabited by such clerks as chiefly studied the forming of writs, which regularly belonged to the curitors, who are officers of chancery.\n\nThe first of these is Thavies Inn, begun in the reign of Edward III. and since purchased by the society of Lincoln's Inn. Beside this, we have New Inn, Symond's Inn, Clement's Inn, Clifford's Inn, anciently the house of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Clifford; Staple Inn, belonging to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> of the staple; Lion's Inn, anciently a common inn with the sign of the lion; Furnival's Inn, and Bernard's Inn.\n\nThese were heretofore preparatory colleges for younger students; and many were entered here, before they were admitted into the inns of court. Now they are mostly taken up by attorneys, solicitors, &c.\n\nThey all belong to some of the inns of court, who formerly used to send yearly some of their barristers to read to them.","sp":289,"ep":290},{"h":"INNATE IDEAS","t":"those supposed to be stamped on the mind, from the first moment of its existence, and which it constantly brings into the world with it: a doctrine which Mr Locke has taken great pains to refute.\n\nINNERKEITHING.

Dr Ruffel informs us in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. lviii. p. 142, that no mention is made of it by any of the ancient Arabian medical writers that are known in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>; and the physicians who are natives in and about <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a> assert, that nothing is to be found regarding it in any of those of a more modern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a>. He farther says, that he engaged some of his learned Turkish friends to make inquiry; but they did not discover any thing on this subject of inoculation either in the writings of physicians, historians, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> poets. Until the beginning of the 18th century, all the accounts we have of inoculating the smallpox are merely traditional. The silence on this subject, observed amongst writers in the countries where the practice obtained, Dr Ruffel supposes, with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, to be owing to the physicians there never countenancing or engaging in it. It is also remarkable, that before Pylarini's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> in 1701, nor yet for several years after, this practice is not noticed by any of the most inquisitive travellers. On this Dr Ruffel very justly observes, that customs, the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> in distant countries, are often the least apt to attract the observation of travellers, who, engaged in other pursuits, must be indebted to accident for the knowledge of such things as the natives seldom talk of, upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> that they are known to all the world.\n\nThe first accounts we have in the learned world concerning inoculation, are from two Italian physicians, viz. Pylarini and Timoni, whose letters on the subject may be seen in the Phil. Trans. abridged, vol. v. p. 370, &c. The first is dated A.D. 1701; the next is dated A.D. 1713. Whether our inquiries are extended abroad or confined to our own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, inoculation hath been practised under one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> or other time immemorial; in Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> and its adjacent isles we have well authenticated accounts, extending farther backward than any from the continent. Dr Williams of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAVERFORDWEST\">Haverfordwest</a>, who wrote upon inoculation in 1725, proves, that it had been practised in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, though in a form somewhat different, time out of mind. Mr Wright, a surgeon,\nInoculation in the same place, says, that buying the smallpox is both a common practice, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> standing in that neighbourhood. He says, that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEMBROKESHIRE\">Pembrokeshire</a> there are two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> villages near the harbour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILFORD\">Milford</a>, more famous for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> than any other, viz. St Ithmael's and Marloes. The old inhabitants of these villages say, that it hath been a common practice; and that one William Allen of St Ithmael's, who in 1722 was 90 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, declared to some persons of good sense and integrity, that this practice was used all his time; that he well remembered his mother telling him, that it was a common practice all her time, and that she got the smallpox that way; so that at least we go back 160 years or more.\n\nIn the Highlands of Scotland and some of the adjacent isles, Dr Alexander Monro senior informs us, that the custom through ages past hath been, to put their children to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> with those who laboured under a favourable smallpox, and to tie <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-WORSTED\">worsted</a> threads about their children's wrists, after having drawn them through variolous pustules.\n\nAccording to the result of Dr Ruffell's inquiries, the Arabians assert, that the inoculation of the smallpox has been the common custom of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, and that they have no doubt of its being as ancient as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> itself. It is remarkable, that buying the smallpox is the name universally applied in all countries to the method of procuring the disease: it is true that there are other terms; but in Wales and Arabia, as well as many other countries, this is the usual appellation. From the sameness of the name, and the little diversity observable in the manner of performing the operation, it is probable that the practice of inoculation in these countries was originally derived from the same source. From its extensive spread, it is probably of great antiquity too.\n\nIn the year 1717, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">Lady</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> Wortley Montague, wife of the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> at Constantinople, had her son inoculated there at the age of five years; he had but few pustules, and soon recovered. In April 1721, inoculation was successfully tried on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> condemned criminals in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, by permission of his majesty. In 1722, Lady Mary Wortley Montague had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of five years old inoculated in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>; soon after which, the children of the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> that had not had the smallpox were inoculated with success; then followed some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, and the practice soon prevailed. And here we date the commencement of inoculation under the direction of art.\n\nFrom the example of the royal family in England, the practice was adopted in Germany, particularly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANOVER\">Hanover</a>, and its adjacent countries.\n\nAfter Mr Maitland had succeeded with those he had inoculated in and about London, he introduced the practice into Scotland in the year 1726.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a> soon followed the example of the British. Russia lately engaged one of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> promoters and improvers of this art. And now there are not many countries that do not more or less practise it.\n\nDifferent Modes of Inoculation. The practice of inoculation having obtained in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the world, it may be grateful, at least to curiosity, to have a general account of the different modes that are and have been adopted in that practice.\n\nInoculation with the blood of variolous patients hath been tried without effect; the variolous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> only produces the variolous disease.\n\nThe application of the variolous matter takes place in a sensible part only; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> of the virus is such, that the smallest atom, though imperceptible to any of our senses, conveys the disease as well as the largest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>. Hence the most obvious method is the prick of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a> or the point of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANCET\">lancet</a> dipped in the matter of a variolous pustule.\n\nCotton or thread is used, that is previously rubbed with powdered variolous scabs; this thread is drawn with a needle through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTIS\">cutis</a>, but not left in. This is the method in some parts of the East Indies. The Indians <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> the thread on the outside of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, between any of the fingers, or between the forefinger and thumb. The Thesalian women inoculate in the forehead and chin.\n\nSome abrade the scarf-skin, and rub in the powdered dry scabs which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> from the pustules of patients with the smallpox.\n\nMany of the Greek women make an oblique puncture with a needle, on the middle of the top of the forehead, on each cheek, the chin, each metacarpus, and each metatarsus; then drop in each a little of the pus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> taken warm from a patient, and brought in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a>'s bosom. Others in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> make several little wounds with a needle in one, two, or more places, in the skin, till some drops of blood exude; then the operator pours a drop of warm pus fresh from a pustule, and mixes it with the blood as it issues out; then the wound is covered by some with a bandage, by others with half a walnut shell placed with its concave side over each orifice.\n\nThe Chinese convey a pellet of variolated cotton, with the addition of a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MUSK\">musk</a>, into the nostrils of the patient; they collect dry pustules, and keep them in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORCELAIN\">porcelain</a> bottle well corked; and when they inoculate, they mix a grain of musk with three or four grains of the dry scales, and roll them in cotton. This method may be called inodoration.\n\nAbout <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a>, in the East Indies, the person who intends to be inoculated, having found a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> where there is a good fort of the smallpox, goes to the bed of the sick person, if he is old enough; or if a child, to one of his relations, and speaks to him as follows: \"I am come to buy the smallpox.\" The answer is, \"Buy if you please.\" A sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> is accordingly given, and one, three, or four pustules, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> must always be odd, and not exceeding five, extracted whole, and full of matter. These are immediately rubbed on the skin of the outside of the hand between the forefinger and the thumb; and this suffices to produce the disease. The same custom obtains in Algiers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUNIS\">Tunis</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIPOLI\">Tripoli</a>, and other countries.\n\nVery similar to the custom among the people about Bengal, &c., is that in Arabia, where on some flethly part they make several punctures with a needle imbued in variolous matter, taken from a pustule of a favourable kind. Here they buy the smallpox too, as follows: the child to be inoculated carries a few raisins, dates, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>-plums, or such like; and showing them to the child from whom the matter is to be taken, asks how many pocks he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> give in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a>? The bargain being made, they proceed to the operation; but this buying, though still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, is not thought necessary.\nnecessary to the success of the operation. The Arabs say that any flabby part is proper; but generally they infert the matter between the fore-finger and thumb on the outside of the hand.\n\nThe Georgians infert the matter on the fore-arm.\n\nThe Armenians introduce the matter on the two thighs. In Wales the practice may be termed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFRACTION\">infraction</a> of the smallpox. There some of the dry pustules are procured by purchase, and are rubbed hard upon the naked arm or leg.","sp":291,"ep":293},{"h":"INQUISITION","t":"in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Rome, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a> in several Roman Catholic countries, erected by the popes for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> of heretics.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> was founded in the 12th century by Father Dominic and his followers, who were sent by Pope Innocent III. with orders to excite the Catholic princes and people to extirpate heretics, to search into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, and to transmit a faithful account thereof to Rome. Hence they were called inquisitors; and this gave birth to the formidable tribunal of the inquisition, which was received in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> and the dominions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, except the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a> and the Low Countries.\n\nThis diabolical tribunal takes cognizance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a>, Judaism, Mahometanism, sodomy, and polygamy; and the people stand in so much fear of it, that parents deliver up their children, husbands their wives, and masters their servants, to its officers, without daring in the least to murmur. The prisoners are kept for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, till they themselves turn their own accusers, and declare the cause of their imprisonment; for they are neither told their crime nor confronted with witnesses. As soon as they are imprisoned, their friends go into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">mourning</a>, and speak of them as dead, not daring to solicit their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a>, lest they should be brought in as accomplices. When there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> shadow of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> against the pretended criminal, he is discharged, after suffering the most cruel tortures, a tedious and dreadful imprisonment, and the loss of the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his effects. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> against the prisoners is pronounced publicly, and with extraordinary solemnity. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, they erect a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a> capable of holding 3000 persons; in which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> a rich altar, and raise seats on each side in the form of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMPHITHEATRE\">amphitheatre</a>.

The papers or boards\nmight be taken in during the night, or when it rained.\nThe sugar should be coloured with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a>, or other\nsubstance, thereby to mark it as a substance to be\navoided by curious idlers.\n\n2. We are informed that a person in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILADELPHIA\">Philadelphia</a> em-\nployed brimstone in the following manner. Having\ncleared all round the roots of trees infested with cater-\npillars or other insects, he threw some flour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIM\">brim</a>-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> round the roots, and covered it with a thin\nsprinkling of fine mould, that it might not be blown\naway by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, yet so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> might operate\nthrough, and cause the brimstone to fumigate. Thus\nhe destroyed the caterpillars. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> he found\nsufficient for 200 trees. In that hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> the sun\nmay\nInsects may perhaps have that effect; but it scarcely will in this. He also employed sulphur in the following manner to drive insects from tall trees. He split the end of a pole, and put in the slit some matches, let them on fire, and held them under the parts of the trees chiefly affected. A pole thus armed, he found, would answer for three or four trees. Brimstone thus mixed with damp straw, and set on fire, for instance, in hop-ground infested with the fly, might be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> to drive away the fly.\n\nThe itch is supposed to proceed from a very small insect which nettles under the skin, and proceeds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> farther into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>; and is therefore attended with no dangerous consequences. Brimstone made into an ointment with hogs-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-LARD\">lard</a> is a sure remedy.\n\nSheep are liable to an eruption on the skin, known by the name of the scab. The brimstone, when added to the mercurial ointment recommended for that disorder in the Transactions of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, vol. vii. p. 90, might perhaps render the application more efficacious and less dangerous.\n\n3. The natives of hot countries are taught by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, that an unctuous covering on their bodies prevents the bites of mosquitoes and all gnats. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> inhabitants in such countries are not sufficiently careful in preventing the least stagnant water near their dwellings, in which the mosquitoes are bred; even in the waste water thrown out they are produced. Dr Franklin, by a careful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to this circumstance, guarded his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> in Philadelphia from such insects: one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> seeing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of mosquitoes in his library, he found on inquiry, that one of his servants had taken the cover off a tub placed near his window for receiving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>-water. On such an occasion the remedy is easy, viz. shutting the room up for the day, so that the mosquitoes cannot come at any water, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> they die. Though this caution may seem trifling to us who live in a mild climate, it is far otherwise in hot countries.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">Oil</a> being known to be most efficacious in destroying insects, may not the use of it be extended to the destruction of worms in the bowels of horses, where they may occasion the violent pain they seem sometimes to suffer? If the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> was for some time kept fasting, and a large quantity of oil, suppose a pint, was given, if worms are the cause, the oil may in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> kill them.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">Flowers</a>, leaves, and fruit, on plants, are known to be devoured by caterpillars. These are destroyed by oils, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> the lateral pores by which they breathe. For this purpose it is advised, that, on the approach of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, a cloth dipped in train oil be laid on such parts of the tree in which there is the least appearance of them.\n\nWe are informed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of the Society of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">Agriculture</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, that oil of turpentine, when applied to animals which were covered with insects, destroyed the insects without hurting the animal. The author tried it on several trees, mixed with fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> so as to incorporate them well, then adding water, still stirring them carefully till the whole was brought to some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of fluidity. In this mixture he dipped branches of fruit-trees on which there were insects, and hereby destroyed not only the eggs but also the insects, without hurting the leaves. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> may be got off by washing, or the first heavy shower. From these experiments the author thinks, that oil of turpentine may with equal efficacy be employed for killing various kinds of lice on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> animals.\n\nWe are informed, in the Transactions of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, vol. v. p. 45, that Mr Winter, among other experiments on turnip-feed, steeped the seed 24 hours in a sufficient quantity of train oil. He then drained the oil from the feed, which he mixed with a quantity of fine sifted earth, and immediately sowed it in drills. When the plants began to appear on the surface, the ground was fown with foot. He found that feed steeped in lintseed oil answered equally well. The turnips the least injured by the fly were those that grew from seed steeped as above, which grew so luxuriantly as to produce rough leaves several days <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> to the most flourishing of any of his other experiments, and were the better enabled to withstand the fly's attack. The leaves of these turnips were of a darker green, and appeared twice as thick in bulk and luxuriancy than the other turnips, and were a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> larger. The seed was drilled an inch and a half deep, and at a foot distance in the rows. Train oil is apt to kill the leaves of plants which have been injured by insects, but lintseed oil has not that effect, though equally destructive to the insects. The train oil seems to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> both as an oil, and by its disagreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> it prevents insects approaching it. In this respect it may be successfully used to prevent field mice or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMIN\">vermin</a> preying on acorns, chestnuts, or other seeds steeped in it before they are fown.\n\nWhen thus giving directions for preventing the fly on turnips, a late experiment should be mentioned, by the disclosing of which a person gained a considerable reward. His secret was, running a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROLLER\">roller</a> over the ground early in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEW\">dew</a> remained on the ground, on the first appearance of the fly. The dew entangled the flies so much, that they could not make their escape, and were therefore crushed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. As the roller may leave the surface of the earth too hard, some very properly advise to fix some boughs of elder in a gate or hurdle, to be drawn over the field; and if the boughs had been before fumigated with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> of tobacco, or tincture of saltpeter, the success would be the surer. The most certain method of preventing the hurt done by the fly is to raise the plants in a nursery, and at a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> to transplant them, being carried to the ground in a wheel-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARROW\">barrow</a> filled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a> softened with water so as to admit the plants. This method will secure their more speedy growth. In the nursery the attack of the fly may be prevented by sprinkling foot or quicklime on the ground. The utility of transplanting turnips is evident by the practice of transplanting the turnip-rooted cabbage. They who are discouraged from this practice by the expense attending it, do not reflect that the hoeing is prevented, and the plants grow the better, being fed in fresh earth.\n\n3. Before proceeding to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the use of the last means mentioned, viz. tobacco, for destroying insects in turnips, it may be proper to mention an experiment made by Mr Green, of her majesty's flower-garden at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEW\">Kew</a>. He contrived a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of bellows, similar to that employed in recovering people seemingly drowned. It has\nInsects have a cavity in the nozzle, in which some tobacco is put, with a live coal over it. The bellows being then worked, the tobacco is set on fire, and the smoke is directed to any particular spot. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> was fond of having the mokrofe in her dressing-room, but was prevented having it on account of the green insects which constantly adhere to that plant. To remedy this inconvenience, Mr Green had a box made large enough to contain a pot in which a plant of the mokrofe grew. In one end of the box was a hole, to admit the nozzle of the bellows; the bellows was worked, and the smoke was received into the box. When the tobacco was consumed, the nozzle was withdrawn, and a cork being put into the hole, the box thus remained till morning, when the insects were all laid dead on the earth. Being swept off, the plant was in a state fit for a dressing-room. Many plants thus infected with insects may be too large, or otherwise so placed as not to be put into a box. In this case it occurred to the writer of these observations, that being sprinkled with an infusion of tobacco in water might in some degree answer the same purpose. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> he found it answered, and he thus freed other plants of their insects. He also used it on trees of easy access with advantage. Train oil is so inimical to tender plants or leaves, that it destroys them if insects have in the least hurt them; whereas the infusion, instead of killing the leaves, promoted a fresh vegetation.\n\nFruit trees often become the prey of insects. Those against a wall, or in espaliers, being easily come at, much of the mischief may be prevented by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> off the leaves so soon as they are observed to be curled; for then fresh eggs are laid on them, probably by butterflies. If sprinkled with the infusion of tobacco, it will prevent their coming to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. After the fruit is formed, the infusion must not be used, lest the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and smell may remain. The fellifers are then the proper remedies, which ladies may employ as amusement, and may thereby prevent fruit to their friends of their own preserving. A lye of the ash of plants sprinkled on the leaves may have a good effect, as also on other pot-herbs, which are often the prey of caterpillars. As many insects, besides those bred on the leaves or in the walls, may destroy the fruit, the sugar with the corrosive sublimate, as already described, may be laid in the way of other insects, to which it will prove a speedy death. Diligent inspection into their retreats is the most certain means of preventing the loss sustained by snails. Ants are prevented rising up the trees, by laying round the roots powdered chalk, or any other substance which by entangling their feet prevents their crawling it. Care should be taken to destroy their nests everywhere near the garden.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-HOPS\">Hops</a> are now become an article of so great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, that it deserves our particular attention. Early in its growth, when the vines begin to ascend the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> fly preys on its leaves, frequently in such numbers as, by destroying the leaves, to interrupt the vegetation, much of the food of plants being absorbed by the leaves. The infusion of tobacco destroys them, or at least drives them away so effectually, that a plant almost totally stripped of its leaves has put out fresh leaves after the use of it. If care be not taken, they will again <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> on the fresh leaves. As the flies lodge on the lower side of the leaves, they are protected from storms of rain, and therefore the infusion must be driven upwards by a forcing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>. As it is said that the expense of tobacco is too great, perhaps lime-water, or even water by itself, driven strongly against the leaves, might drive them away. The labour attending such experiments in a large plantation discourages others, without reflecting, that, if such means are used early, the flies may more easily be got rid of.\n\nFree ventilation is undoubtedly beneficial to all plants; and hence perhaps the particular advantages of drilling corn in rows a little distant. If alleys somewhat larger than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> were made in the plantations of hops, there might be sufficient spaces left where the alleys <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> one another to admit of setting damp straw, or other materials mixed with brimstone, foot, &c., on fire. Smoke itself is said to prevent the fly; and if it, it will still act more powerfully when mixed with such materials. It has been observed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a>, that the hops grow naturally among heaps of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> or fragments of rocks. They therefore advise to cover the ground round their roots with stones, which will prevent the insects laying their eggs near the roots in the ground, where they lay them to be protected during the winter. The stones will also preserve moisture at the roots during the summer. A rope cannot be drawn across a plantation of hops, as it can across a field of corn, in case of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILDEW\">mildew</a>. Here water to wash off the clammy juice that entices and feeds insects seems to be the only remedy. The plantation being well ventilated, may at least prevent the frequency of it. The forcing pump will most effectually wash off this exudation.\n\nCruelty to Insects. It does not appear upon what principle of reason and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> it is, that mankind have founded their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> over the lives of every creature that is placed in a subordinate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of being to themselves. Whatever claim they may have in right of food and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SELF_DEFENCE\">self-<a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> (to which ought we to add the purposes of the naturalist, explained above?) did they extend their privilege no farther than those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> would reasonably carry them, numberless beings might enjoy their lives in peace, who are now hurried out of them by the most wanton and unnecessary cruelties. It is surely difficult to discover why it should be thought less inhuman to crush to death a harmless insect, whose single offence is that he eats that food which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> has prepared for his sustenance, than it would be were we to kill any bulky creature for the same reason. There are few tempers so hardened to the impressions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, as not to shudder at the thought of the latter; and yet the former is universally practised without the least check of compassion. This seems to arise from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> of supposing, that every creature is really in itself contemptible, which happens to be clothed with a body infinitely disproportionate to our own, not considering that great and little are merely relative terms. But the inimitable Shakespeare would teach us, that\n\n---\n\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> beetle that we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-TREAD\">tread</a> upon,\nIn corporal suff'rance, feels a pang as great\nAs when a giant dies.\n\nAnd indeed there is every reason to believe that the sensations of many insects are as exquisite as those of creatures of far more enlarged dimensions, perhaps even more...\nmore so. The milipede, for instance, rolls itself round upon the slightest touch, and the snail draws in its horns upon the least approach of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>. Are not these the strongest indications of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>? and is it any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of ours, that we are not therefore induced to treat them with a more sympathizing tenderness?\n\nMontaigne remarks, that there is a certain claim of kindness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> which every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of creatures has a right to from us. It is to be regretted that this general maxim is not more attended to in the affair of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, and pressed home upon tender minds in its full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> and latitude. We are far, indeed, from thinking, that the early delight which children discover in tormenting flies, &c., is a mark of any innate cruelty of temper, because this turn may be accounted for on other principles; and it is entertaining unworthy notions of the Deity, to suppose he forms mankind with a propensity to the most detestable of all dispositions: but most certainly, by being unrestrained in sports of this kind, they may acquire by habit what they never would have learned from nature, and grow up into a confirmed inattention to every kind of suffering but their own. Accordingly the supreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of judicature at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a> thought an instance of this sort not below its cognizance, and punished a boy for putting out the eyes of a poor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> that had unhappily fallen into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>.\n\nIt might be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, therefore, it should seem, in order to awaken as early as possible in children an extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of humanity, to give them a view of several sorts of insects as they may be magnified by the assistance of glasses, and to show them that the same evident marks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> and goodness prevail in the formation of the minutest insect, as in that of the most enormous Leviathan: that they are equally furnished with whatever is necessary, not only to the preservation, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of their beings in that state of existence which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a> has assigned them; in a word, that the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of their respective organs distinctly proclaims them the objects of the divine benevolence, and therefore that they justly ought to be so of ours.","sp":294,"ep":297},{"h":"INSERTION","t":"in Anatomy, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> conjunction of the vessels, tendons, fibres, and membranes of the body with some other parts.","sp":297,"ep":297},{"h":"INSINUATION","t":"* denotes a cunning and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVERT\">covert</a> way of creeping into any person's favour.\n\n**INSINUATION of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">Will</a>**, among civilians, is the first production of it, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the leaving it with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a>, in order to its probate.

Simon's doctrine of direction.\n\nTheological writers have enumerated several kinds of inspiration; such as an inspiration of superintendency, in which God does so influence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the mind of any person, as to keep him more secure from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in some various and complex discourse, than he would have been merely by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of his natural faculties; plenary superintendent inspiration, which excludes any mixture of error at all from the performance so superintended; inspiration of elevation, where the faculties <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in a regular, and, as it seems, in a common manner, yet are raised to an extraordinary degree, so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> shall, upon the whole, have more of the true sublime or pathetic, than natural genius could have given; and inspiration of suggestion, when the use of the faculties is superseeded, and God does, as it were, speak directly to the mind, making such discoveries to it as it could not otherwise have obtained, and dictating the very words in which such discoveries are to be communicated, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they are designed as a message to others. It is generally allowed that the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a> was written by a superintendent inspiration; for without this the discourses and doctrines of Christ could not have been faithfully recorded by the evangelists and apostles; nor could they have assumed the authority of speaking the words of Christ, and evinced this authority by the actual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of miraculous powers: and besides, the sacred writings bear many obvious internal marks of their divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a>, in the excellence of their doctrines, the spirituality and elevation of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, the majesty and simplicity of their style, the agreement of their various parts, and their efficacy on mankind; to which may be added, that there has been in the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, from its earliest ages, a constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRADITION\">tradition</a>, that the sacred books were written by the extraordinary assistance of the Spirit, which must at least amount to superintendent inspiration. But it has been controverted whether this inspiration extended to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> circumstance in their writings, so as to be in the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> plenary. Jerome, Grotius, Erasmus, Epiphanes, and many others, maintain that it was not; whilst others contend, that the emphatical manner in which our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> speaks of the agency of the Spirit upon them, and in which they themselves speak of their own writings, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> justify our believing that their inspiration was plenary, unless there be very convincing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> brought on the other side to prove that it was not: and if we allow, it is said, that there were some errors in the New Testament, as it came from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the apostles, there may be great danger of subverting the main purpose and design of it; since there will be endless room to debate the importance both of facts and doctrines.\n\nAmong the Heathens, the priests and priestesses were said to be divinely inspired, when they gave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORACLES\">oracles</a>.\u2014The poets also laid claim to it; and to this end they always invoked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSES\">Muses</a> at the beginning of any great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>.\n\nInspiration, in Physic, is understood of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, by which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is admitted within the lungs; in which sense, inspiration is a branch of respiration, and stands opposed to Exspiration.\n\nThis admission of the air depends immediately on its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> or elasticity, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> when the cavity of the breast is enlarged by the elevation of the thorax and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a>, and particularly by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the diaphragm downwards; so that the air does not enter the lungs, because they are dilated; but those dilate, because the air enters within them.

Such in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> is the instinct of sucking exerted immediately after birth; and such in the inferior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> is the instinct by which insects invariably deposit their eggs in situations most favourable for hatching and affording nourishment to their future progeny. These operations are necessary for the preservation of the individual and the continuation of the kind; but neither the infant nor the insect knows that they are necessary: they both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> without having any end in view, and act uniformly without instruction and without experience.\n\nThe actions of the inferior animals are generally directed by instinct; those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> by reason. This at least is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> with respect to men in a state of civilization: in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> state they are probably little less the slaves of instinct than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a> themselves.\n\nConcerning human instincts, indeed, philosophers differ widely in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>; some maintaining that man is endowed with a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of instincts than any species of brutes; whilst others deny that in human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> there is any power or propensity at all which can properly be called instinctive.\n\nThis diversity of opinion may easily be traced to its source. There are not many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> thinkers in the world. The greater part even of those who are called philosophers, implicitly adopt the opinions of certain matters whose authority they deem sufficient to supply the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of argument; and having chosen their respective guides, each maintains with zeal what his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> taught, or is supposed to have taught. When Locke so successfully attacked the doctrine of innate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> and innate principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, he was thought by many to have overturned at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> all innate principles whatever; to have divested the human mind of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, affection, and instinct; and to have left in it nothing but the powers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a>, and intellect. Such, we are persuaded, was not his intention; nor is there anything in his immortal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> which, when interpreted with candour, appears to have such a tendency.\n\nIn our opinion, great part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">Essay</a> on Human Understanding has been very generally misinterpreted. Much of its merit, however, was soon discovered; and mankind, finding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> disfigured by the barbarous jargon of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>, and built upon a few self-evident principles, implicitly embraced every opinion advanced, or which they supposed to be advanced, by the illustrious author; especially <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> that opinion was contrary to any part of the scholastic system which had so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> been employed to perplex the understanding and to veil absurdity. Hence arose many philosophers of eminence both at home and abroad; who maintained, as they imagined, upon the principles of Locke, that in the human mind there are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> instincts, but that every thing which had been usually called by that name is resolvable into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>. This doctrine was attacked by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHAFTESBURY\">Shaftesbury</a>, who introduced into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of mind, as faculties derived from nature, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, a sense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>, and a sense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a>; and these he considered as the tests of speculative truth and moral rectitude. His lordship's principles were in part adopted by Mr Hutcheson of Glasgow, who published a system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MORAL_PHILOSOPHY\">moral philosophy</a>, founded upon a sense or instinct, to which he gave the name of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MORAL_SENSE\">moral sense</a>; and the undoubted merit of his work procured him many followers.\n\nMen generally run from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> to another. It being now discovered, or at least supposed, that the human mind is endowed with instinctive principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> of philosophers soon afterwards arose, who maintained with much vehemence that it is likewise endowed with instinctive principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a>; and who built a system of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a>, if such it may be called, upon a number of innate, distinct, and independent senses. The rise of this sect is well known. Berkeley and Hume had adopted Locke's doctrine reflecting the origin of our ideas; and had thence deduced consequences supposed to be dangerous in themselves, but which, it was thought, could not be denied without refusing the principles from which they were inferred. The foundation of the instinctive system being thus laid, the system itself was rapidly carried to a height far beyond what seems to have been the intention of its excellent author; and reason was well nigh banished from the regions of philosophy. For such a proceeding it is not difficult to assign the cause. The instinctive scheme requires much less labour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> than the systems of Locke and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>; for upon the principles of it, when carried to its utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, every phenomenon in human nature is thought to be sufficiently accounted for, by supposing it.\n\n(a) As nothing is of greater importance in the philosophy of mind than accurate definitions, it may not be improper to observe, that through the whole of this article the word spontaneous is to be taken in the sense in which it is used in the following extracts from Hales's Origin of Mankind: \"Many analogical motions in animals, though I cannot call them voluntary, yet I see them spontaneous: I have reason to conclude, that these are not simply <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a>.\" \"The sagacities and instincts of brutes, the spontaneousness of many of their motions, are not explicable, without supposing some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> determinate power connected to and inherent in their spirits, of a higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a> than the bare <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> modification of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>.\" If this be attended to, our definition of instinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be found perfectly consonant to that which has been given by the author of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">Ancient</a> Metaphysic. \"Instinct (he says) is a determination given by Almighty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">Wisdom</a> to the mind of the brute, to act in such or such a way, upon such or such an occasion, without intelligence; without knowledge of good or ill, and without knowing for what end or purpose he acts.\"\nIn the effect of a particular instinct implanted in the mind for that very purpose. Hence in some popular works of philosophy we have a detail of so many distinct internal senses, that it requires no small strength of memory to retain their very names: besides the moral sense, we have the sense of beauty, the sense of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFORMITY\">deformity</a>, the sense of honour, the hoarding sense, and a thousand others which it is needless here to mention.\n\nThis new system, which converts the philosophy of mind into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, or rather into a collection of facts and anecdotes, though it has made a rapid progress, is not yet universally received. It has been opposed by many speculative men, and by none with greater skill than Dr Priestley; who maintains, with the earliest admirers of Locke, that we have from nature no innate sense of truth, nor any instinctive principle of action; that even the action of sucking in new-born <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> is to be accounted for upon principles of mechanism; and that the desire of the senses is merely association.\n\nWhilst men, eminent for candour as well as for science, have thus been disputing the limits between instinct and reason in the human mind, and endeavouring to ascertain the actions which result from each, two writers of name, treating of that subject, have lately advanced opinions, which, if admitted as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a>, must render the dispute henceforth ridiculous, and put an end forever to all moral inquiries. Mr Smellie, in a work which he calls The Philosophy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">Natural History</a>, affirms, that between instinctive and rational motives no distinction exists, but that the reasoning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> itself is the necessary result of instinct; and Dr Reid, in his Essays on the Active Powers of Man, by attributing to instinct the action of breathing, seems to confound that principle with mere mechanism.\n\nThat reason, instinct, and mechanism, are all essentially different from one another, has hitherto been universally allowed; and it appears not to be a talk of much difficulty to point out in what respect each of them differs from the other two. Actions performed with a view to accomplish a certain end are called rational actions, and the end in view is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> to their performance. Instinctive actions have a cause, viz. the internal impulse by which they are spontaneously performed; but they cannot be said to have a motive, because they are not done with any view to consequences. Actions automatic have likewise a cause; but that cause is not internal impulse, but mere mechanism, by which they are performed without any spontaneity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a>. Thus, a man gives <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a> in order to relieve a person from want; he performs a grateful action as a duty incumbent on him; and he fights for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> in order to repel its enemies. Each of these actions is performed from a motive, and therefore they are all rational actions. An infant is impelled to suck the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, but he knows not that it is necessary for his preservation; a couple of young savages go together, for the first time, without any view to offspring or any determinate idea of enjoyment. These actions have no motive, and therefore are not rational; but as they are performed by a spontaneous exertion of the agents, they are not to be attributed to mere mechanism; they are therefore instinctive actions. A man breathes without any motive, without any spontaneous exertion of his own, and that as well when he is asleep as when he is awake. The action of breathing therefore is neither rational nor instinctive, but merely automatic or mechanical. All this seems to be very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>.\n\nTo talk of the motives of actions performed by instinct, in an argument intended to prove that between reason and instinct there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>, is either to beg the question or to pervert <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. If the author of the Philosophy of Natural History chooses to call the impulse which prompts the infant to suck by the name of motive, he only uses an English word improperly; if it be his intention to affirm that such a motive is not totally and essentially different from that which prompts a man to give charity or to fight for his country, he affirms what all mankind know to be false (B).\n\nHaving thus ascertained what we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> by instinct, we shall now proceed to inquire, Whether or not there be any instinctive principles in man? But in order to proceed upon sure grounds, it will be proper to consider, in the first place, such actions of the inferior animals as are generally allowed to be instinctive: for an attempt has lately been made to prove, that even these actions are the offspring of reason influenced by motives; and that instinct, as we have defined it, is a mere imaginary principle, which has no existence either in man or brute.\n\n(B) The author of Ancient Metaphysics, whose learned work contains more good sense on this subject than any other book which we have seen, thus distinguishes between reason and instinct: \"With respect to the mere animal, it is evident, that he pursues nothing but what is conducive either to the preservation of the animal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> or to the continuation of the kind. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> which the intellectual mind pursues, is the fair and the handsome; and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> consists in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> of these. And though it pursue also what is useful and profitable for the being and well-being of the animal life, yet it is for the sake, not of the animal life itself, but of the \u03c4\u03bf \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03c2 or beautiful; which therefore is the ultimate object of its pursuit in all things.\n\n\"Another material difference in practice betwixt the animal and intellectual mind is, that every action of intellect proceeds from an opinion formed concerning what is good or ill, beautiful or the contrary, in the action. When we do so, we are said to act from will, which is always determined by some opinion formed of the kind I have mentioned: whereas, when we act from mere appetite or inclination, without deliberation or opinion formed, we act as the brute does always; for he has no will, but is prompted to action by natural impulse, or \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, as the Greeks call it.\n\n\"A third very material difference is, that intellect, in all its operations, proposes ends, and devises means to accomplish these ends; whereas the instinct of the brute proceeds without consideration either of ends or means.\"\nIt has been said that caterpillars, when shaken off a tree in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, instantly turn round towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> and climb up, though they had never formerly been on the surface of the ground. This is a striking instance of instinct. On the tree, and not upon the ground, the caterpillar finds its food. If therefore it did not turn and climb up the trunk it would inevitably perish; but surely the caterpillar knows not that such an exertion is necessary to its preservation; and therefore it acts not from motives, but from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> impulse. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEE\">bee</a> and the beaver are endowed with an instinct which has the appearance of foresight. They build magazines, and fill them with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>; but the foresight is not theirs. Neither bees nor beavers know anything of futurity. The solitary wasp digs holes in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, in each of which she deposits an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>. Though she certainly knows not that an animal is to proceed from that egg, and fill its cells, if possible, that this animal must be nourished with other animals, she collects a few small green <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>, which she rolls up in a circular form, and fixes in the hole in such a manner that they cannot move. When the wasp-worm is hatched, it is simply stored with the food which nature has destined for its support. The green worms are devoured in succession; and the number deposited is exactly proportioned to the time necessary for the growth and transformation of the wasp-worm into a fly; when it issues from the hole, and is capable of procuring its own nourishment. This instinct of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a>-wasp is the more remarkable, that she feeds not upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> herself. Birds of the same species, unless when restrained by peculiar circumstances, uniformly build their nests of the same materials, and in the same form and situation, though they inhabit very different climates; and the form and situation are always exactly suited to their nature, and calculated to afford them shelter and protection. When danger, or any other circumstance peculiar to certain countries, renders a deviation from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> form or situation of nests necessary, that deviation is made in an equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, and in the very same manner, by all the birds of one species; and it is never found to extend beyond the limits of the country where alone it can serve any good purpose. When removed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> from their eggs, birds return to them with haste and anxiety, and shift them so as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> them equally; and it is worthy of observation, that their haste to return is always in proportion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>. But do birds reason, and all of the same species reason, equally well, upon the nature and extent of danger, and upon the means by which it can best be avoided? Have birds any notion of equality, or do they know that heat is necessary for incubation? No: in all these operations men recognize the intentions of nature; but they are hid from the animals themselves, and therefore cannot operate upon them as motives.\n\nOf the instinct of animals we shall give one instance more in the elegant and perspicuous language of Dr. Reid. \"Every manufacturing art among men (says that able writer) was invented by some man, improved by others, and brought to perfection by time and experience. Men learn to work in it by long practice, which produces a habit. The arts of men vary in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> and in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, and are found only in those men who have been taught them. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> of animals differ from those of men in many striking particulars. No animal of the species can claim the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>; no animal ever introduced any new improvement, or any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> from the former practice; every one of the species has equal skill from the beginning, without teaching, without experience, and without habit; every one has its art by a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a>. I do not mean that it is inspired with the principles or rules of the art, but with the ability of working in it to perfection, without any knowledge of its principles, rules, or end. The work of every animal is indeed like the works of nature, perfect in its kind, and can bear the most critical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the mechanic or the mathematician; of which a honeycomb is a striking instance.\n\n\"Bees, it is well known, construct their combs with remarkable cells on both sides, fit both for holding their storeable in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a> and for rearing their young. There are in them only three possible figures of the cells, which can make them all equal and similar, without any useless surfaces. These are the equilateral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, and the regular hexagon. Of the three, the hexagon is the most proper, both for convenience and strength. Bees, as if they knew this, make their cells regular hexagons. As the combs have cells on both sides, the cells may either be exactly opposite, having partition against partition, or the bottoms of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CELL\">cell</a> may rest upon the partitions between the cells on the other side, which will serve as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUTTRESS\">buttress</a> to strengthen it. The last way is the best for strength; accordingly the bottom of each cell rests against the point where three partitions meet on the other side, which gives it all the strength possible. The bottom of a cell may either be one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>, perpendicular to the side partitions; or it may be composed of several planes, meeting in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> in the middle point. It is only in one of these two ways that all the cells can be similar without losing room. And, for the same intention, the planes, of which the bottom is composed, if there be more than one, must be three in number, and neither more nor fewer. It has been demonstrated, that by making the bottoms of the cells to consist of three planes meeting in a point, there is a saving of material and labour no way inconsiderable. The bees, as if acquainted with these principles of solid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>, follow them most accurately; the bottom of each cell being composed of three planes, which make obtuse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> with the side partitions and with one another, and meet in a point in the middle of the bottom; the three angles of this bottom being supported by three partitions on the other side of the comb, and the point of it by the common intersection of these three partitions. One instance more of the mathematical skill displayed in the structure of a honeycomb deserves to be mentioned. It is a curious mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBLEM\">problem</a>, at what precise angle the three planes which compose the bottom of a cell ought to meet, in order to make the greatest possible saving of material and labour. This is one of those problems belonging to the higher parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, which are called problems of maxima and minima. The celebrated Mr. Laurin resolved it by a fluxionary calculation, which is to be found in the Transactions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, and determined precisely the angle required. Upon the most exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENSURATION\">mensuration</a> which the subject could admit, he\nhe afterwards found, that it is the very angle in which the three planes in the bottom of the cell of a honeycomb do actually meet.\n\n\"Shall we ask here, Who taught the bees the properties of solids, and to resolve problems of maxima and minima? If a honeycomb were a work of human art, every man of common sense would conclude, without hesitation, that he who invented the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> must have understood the principles on which it was constructed. We need not say that bees know none of these things. They work most geometrically without any knowledge of geometry; somewhat like a child, who by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the handle of an organ makes good music without any knowledge of music. The art is not in the child, but in him who made the organ. In like manner, when a bee makes its combs so geometrically, the geometry is not in the bee, but in that great Geometrician who made the bee, and made all things in number, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>.\"\n\nWe have given a full detail of the structure of a honeycomb, because it is an effect of instinct which cannot be confounded with the operations of reason. The author of *The Natural History of Animals*, justly offended with that theory which treats of instinctive motives, which represents the human mind as a bundle of instincts, and of which the object seems to be to degrade mankind to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of brutes, has very laudably exerted his endeavours to detect its weaknesses, and to expose it to contempt. But in avoiding one extreme, he seems to have run into the other; and whilst he maintains the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of his own species, he almost raises the brutes to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of men. \"It is better (he says) to share our rights with others than to be entirely deprived of them.\" This is certainly true; and no good man will hesitate to prefer his theory to that of his antagonist; but we see no necessity for adopting either; the phenomena may be accounted for without degrading reason to the level of instinct, or elevating instinct to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of reason.\n\nWe shall readily allow to Locke (c), that some of the inferior animals seem to have perceptions of particular truths, and within very narrow limits the faculty of reason; but we see no ground to suppose that their souls; but natural operations are performed with a view to convey their consequences; and therefore cannot persuade ourselves, from their conduct, that these operations are the result of a train of reasoning in the mind of the animal.\n\nHe acknowledges indeed, that their reasoning and thinking powers are remarkably deficient when compared with those of men; that they cannot take so full\n\n(c) \"For if they have any ideas at all, and are not mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a>, as some would have them, we cannot deny them to have some reason. It seems as evident to me, that some of them do, in certain instances, reason, as that they have senses; but it is only in particular ideas, just as they received them from the senses. They are the best of them tied up within those narrow bounds, and have not, as I think, the faculty to enlarge them by any kind of abstraction.\" *Essay on Human Understanding*, Book ii, chap. xi.\n\nThis is in part a just observation, and serves to account for many phenomena which later writers have derived from instinct. The author of *The Philosophy of Natural History* had \"a cat that frequented a closet, the door of which was fastened by a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> latch. A window was situated near the door. When the door was shut, the cat gave herself no uneasiness. As soon as she tired of her confinement, she mounted on the sole of the window, and with her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAW\">paw</a> dexterously lifted the latch and came out.\" This practice, which we are told <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for years, must have been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of what Locke calls reasoning in particular ideas. It could not be the effect of instinct; for instinct is adapted only to a state of nature, in which cats have neither latches to lift nor doors to open; and as it is not said that the animal attempted to lift the latches of other doors, we are not authorized to infer that this particular action was the consequence of reasoning in ideas enlarged by abstraction: the cat had repeatedly seen one door opened by an exertion which she was capable of imitating. Yet that animals have no power of enlarging their ideas, is a position, of the truth of which, though it is advanced by Locke, we are by no means confident. It is well known that crows feed upon several kinds of shell-fish when within their reach; and that they contrive to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the shell by raising the fish to a great height, and letting it drop upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> or a rock. This may perhaps be considered as pure instinct directing the animal to the proper means of acquiring its food. But what is to be thought of the following fact, which was communicated to us by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> whose veracity is unquestioned, and who, being totally unacquainted with the theories of philosophers, has of course no favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> to support? In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> of the year 1791, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of crows made their nest in a tree, of which there are several planted round his garden; and in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>-walks he had often been amused by witnessing furious combats between them and a cat. One morning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> raged more fiercely than usual, till at last the cat gave way and took shelter under a hedge, as if to wait a more favourable opportunity of retreating to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>. The crows continued for a short time to make a threatening noise; but perceiving that on the ground they could do nothing more than threaten, one of them lifted a stone from the middle of the garden and perched it on a tree planted in the hedge, where she sat watching the motions of the enemy of her young. As the cat crept along under the hedge, the crow accompanied her by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> from branch to branch and from tree to tree; and when at last she ventured to quit her hiding-place, the crow, leaving the tree, and hovering over her in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, let the stone drop from on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> on her back. That the crow on this occasion reasoned, is self-evident; and it seems to be little less evident, that the ideas employed in her reasoning were enlarged beyond those which she had received from her senses. By her senses, she may have perceived, that the shell of a fish is broken by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>; but could her senses inform her, that a cat would be wounded or driven off the field by the fall of a stone? No: from the effect of the one fall preserved in her memory, she must have inferred the other by her power of reasoning.\na review of the past, nor look forward with so penetrating an eye to the future; that they do not accumulate observation upon observation, or add the experience of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> to that of another; that their manners do not vary nor their customs fluctuate like ours; and that their arts always remain the same, without degeneracy and without improvement. \"The crow (he observes) always builds its nest in the same way; every hen treats her young with the same measure of affection; even the dog, the horse, and the furtiveous elephant, seem to act rather mechanically than with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>. From such hasty observations as these, it has been inferred (he says), that the brutes are directed in their actions by some mysterious influence, which impels them to employ their powers unintentionally in performing actions beneficial to themselves, and suitable to their nature and circumstances.\"\n\nAnd are these observations indeed hasty? And is this inference ill founded? To us the matter appears quite otherwise. If the arts of brutes and other animals have always remained the same without degeneracy, and without improvement; and if they be at the same time the result of reasoning, they must either be so perfect that they cannot be improved, or so imperfect that they cannot degenerate. That the structure of a honeycomb is imperfect, no man has ever imagined. We have seen, that, as far as we are capable of discerning the end which it is intended to serve, it is the most perfect structure possible: and therefore, if it be the result of the reasoning of the bee, the author must retract his assertion reflecting the extent of the reasoning and thinking powers of inferior animals; and instead of saying that they are remarkably deficient when compared with those of men, affirm that they are infinitely more perfect. No human art has yet arrived at such perfection as that it might not be improved; no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a> has ever built a town, or constructed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">magazine</a>, which he could mathematically demonstrate to be of the very best possible form for the end intended, and so absolutely perfect as to be incapable of improvement.\n\nBut the same author proceeds to affirm, that \"the laws of analogical reasoning do not justify the idea that the brutes act, on any occasion, absolutely without design.\" Nay, he says, it seems more probable, \"that the inferior animals, even in those instances in which we cannot distinguish the motives which actuate them, or the views with which they proceed, yet act with design, and extend their views, if not a great way, yet at least a certain length forward; than that they can be upon any occasion, such as in rearing of their young, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> nests, &c., actuated merely by feeling, or overruled by some mysterious influence, under which they are nothing but insensible instruments.\" This last phrase is ambiguous. If by insensible instruments it be meant that the brutes are considered by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> for instinct as mere machines without the faculties of sensation and spontaneity, the author is combating a phantom of his own creation; for we believe an opinion so absurd is not now maintained by any man, (see BRUTE.) But if by insensible instruments be meant such instruments as act spontaneously without being conscious of the end to which their actions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, he appears not only to be egregiously mistaken in his conjecture reflecting the design of brutes, but also to have advanced an hypothesis contradictory and inconsistent.\n\nIf it be true, that the inferior animals act with de Maintaining-sign, even in those instances in which we cannot distinguished, and distinguish their motives, their views may indeed exist but a little way when compared with infinity; but certainly they extend farther than ours; for there is no useless work of man constructed with such skill, but that, after it is finished, another man of equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> will be able to distinguish the general design of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>. But if the inferior animals, on all occasions, act with design, we should be glad to know the design of the bees in forming the cells of their combs in the manner which we have so largely described. Do these little animals indeed know that a comb, consisting on both sides of hexagonal cells, with the bottom of each composed of several planes meeting in a certain solid angle, and so formed as that the bottom of a cell on the one side shall rest upon the partitions between the cells on the other side, is in all respects the most proper both for holding their stores of honey and for rearing their young? And do they likewise know, that its excellence arises from the precise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> and position of the cells, by which there is a very considerable saving of labour and materials, whilst the comb at the same time has the greatest possible strength, and the greatest possible capacity? If they know all this, and act with a view to these ends, it must indeed be confessed that bees are rational creatures, and that their thinking and reasoning powers far surpass those of men; for they have from the earliest ages made discoveries in the higher mathematics, which there is reason to believe were altogether unknown to the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> till the beginning of the present century, and which at this moment are beyond the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a>-tenths of mankind in the most enlightened nation on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. If this be a conclusion too absurd to be admitted, there is no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALTERNATIVE\">alternative</a> but either to suppose that by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> structure of their cells the bees have some other end in view, which we cannot distinguish; or to acknowledge that they are overruled by some mysterious influence, under which they are nothing but spontaneous agents, unconscious of the end to which their operations tend. Which of these conclusions is the most rational, we will not offer such an insult to the understanding of our readers, as to suppose the meanest of them capable of entertaining a doubt. That a honeycomb is constructed with design, we must readily admit; but the design is not in the bees, but in the Creator of the bees, who directs their operations to their own good, by what the author with great propriety terms a mysterious influence (D).\n\nBut he thinks it an unanswerable argument in supposition to it.\n\n(d) Though this way of acting is undoubtedly mysterious, \"yet it should not appear extraordinary even to a man who is not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, as we see examples of it daily in our own species: For a man under the direction of another of superior understanding, will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> means to accomplish an end, without having any idea of either...\"\nport of his theory, that in the performance of those actions, in which animals are said to be guided by unerring instinct, different individuals display different modes of conduct; and in his opinion, to talk of instinctive principles which admit of improvement, and accommodate themselves to circumstances, is merely to introduce new terms into the language of philosophy; for he affirms, that no such improvement or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> to circumstances can ever take place without a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of ideas and a deduction of inferences. It is probable that the author here alludes to those animals which, in their most important operations, are known to act differently in different countries. Thus the ostrich in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENEGAL\">Senegal</a>, where the heat is excessive, neglects her eggs during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, but sits upon them in the night. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good Hope, however, where the degree of heat is less, the ostrich, like other birds, sits upon her eggs both day and night. In countries infested with monkeys, many birds, which in other climates build in bushes and clefts of trees, suspend their nests upon slender twigs, and thus elude the rapacity of their enemies.\n\nIt may be thought, that a determination of the mind of the brute to act so variously upon different occasions, can hardly be conceived without judgment or intelligence. But before our author had so confidently affirmed that such accommodation to circumstances can never take place without a comparison of ideas and a deduction of inferences, he would have done well to consider how nature acts in other organized bodies, such as the vegetable. We see that a vegetable, reared in the corner of a dark cellar, will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> itself towards the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> which comes in at the window; and if it be made to grow in a flower-pot, with its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> downwards, it will turn itself into the natural position of a plant. Can it be supposed, that the plant, in either case, does what it does from any judgment or opinion that it is bent, and not from a necessary determination of its nature? But, further, to take the case of bodies unorganized, how shall we account for the phenomena which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a> exhibits to us? When one body unites with another, and then, upon a third being presented to it, quits the first, and unites itself with it, shall we suppose that this preference proceeds from any predilection or opinion that it is better to cleave to the one than to the other, from any comparison of ideas or deduction of inferences? Or shall we not rather say, that it proceeds from an original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of nature impressed upon it by that Being who mediately or immediately directs every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> atom in the universe? And if so, why may not instinct be an original determination of the mind of the animal, of which it is part of the nature or essence to accommodate itself to certain circumstances, on which depends the preservation of the individual, or the continuation of the kind? Indeed it cannot be otherwise, if we have defined instinct properly; for no man ever supposed, that when animals work instinctively, they act for no purpose. It is only affirmed that the purpose is not known to them. It is known, however, to the Author of instinct; who knows likewise that the same purpose must in different climates be promoted by different means, and who accordingly determines the operations of animals of the same species to be different under different circumstances.\n\nBut though we cannot agree with this author when he affirms that no accommodation to circumstances can ever take place without a comparison of ideas, we readily admit that no faculty which is capable of improvement by observation and experience can in propriety of speech be termed instinct. Instinct being a positive determination given to the minds of animals by the Author of nature for certain purposes, must necessarily be perfect when viewed in connection with those purposes; and therefore to talk, as Mr. Smellie does, of the improvement of instinct, is to perplex the understanding by a perversion of language. There is not, however, a doubt, but that reason may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> the works of instinct, and so far alter or improve them as to render them subservient to other purposes than those for which they were originally and instinctively performed. It was thus in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> that man at first learned many of the most useful arts of life.\n\n\"Thy arts of building from the bee receive;\n\"Learn of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOLE\">mole</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLOUGH\">plough</a>, the worm to weave;\n\"Learn of the little nautilus to fail,\n\"Spread the thin oar, and catch the driving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALE\">gale</a>.\"\n\nBut the arts thus adopted by men are no longer the works of instinct, but the operations of reason influenced by motives. This is so obviously and undeniably true, that it has compelled the author last mentioned to confess, in that very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> which treats of instincts improvable by experience, that \"what men or brutes learn by experience, though this experience be founded on instinct, cannot with propriety be called instinctive knowledge, but knowledge derived from experience and observation. Instinct (he says) should be limited to such actions as every individual of a species exerts without the aid either of experience or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>.\" This is a very just distinction between instinct and experience; but how to reconcile it with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> principle of the author's theory we know not. It would certainly be a very arduous task; but it is a task from which we are happily relieved, as his theory and ours have little resemblance.\n\nHaving thus proved, we hope to the satisfaction of our readers, that there is such a principle as instinct in the inferior animals, and that it is essentially different from human reason; let us return to our own species, and inquire whether there be any occasions upon which man acts intuitively, and what those occasions are. This is a question of some difficulty, to which a complete and satisfactory answer will perhaps never be given, and to which we have not the vanity to think that such an answer will be given by us. The principle of affection (to be explained afterwards under the article Metaphysics) operates so powerfully in man, and at so early a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of life, that in many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> it seems to be impossible to distinguish the effects of either; and indeed, in my opinion, by far the greater part of mankind are destined by God and nature to be governed in that way.\" Ancient Metaphysics, vol. iii. p. 352.\nof habit from the operations of nature. Yet there are a few cases immediately connected with the preservation of the individual and the propagation of the kind, in which by a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> these things may be distinguished. We have already given an instance in the sucking of a child, which we believe to be an operation performed by instinct. Dr Priestley, however, thinks differently: \"The action of sucking (says he), I am confident, from my own observations, is not natural, but acquired.\" What observations they were which led him to this conclusion he has not told us, and we cannot imagine; but every observation which we ourselves have made, compels us to believe that an attempt to suck is natural to children. It has been observed by the author of the Philosophy of Natural History, that the instinct of sucking is not excited by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> peculiar to the mother, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, or to any other substance; for that infants suck indiscriminately every thing brought into contact with their mouths. He therefore infers, that the desire of sucking is innate, and coeval with the appetite for air. The observation is certainly just: but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of Dr Priestley's may object to the inference; for \"in sucking and swallowing our food, and in many such instances, it is exceedingly probable (says the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a>), that the actions of the muscles are originally automatic, having been placed by our Maker, that at first they are stimulated and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> mechanically whenever their action is requisite.\" This is certainly the case with respect to the motion of the muscles in the action of breathing; and if that action be of the same kind and proceed from the very same cause with the action of sucking, and if a child never show a desire to suck but when something is brought into contact with its mouth, Dr Priestley's account of this operation appears to us much more satisfactory than that of the authors who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> it to instinct.\n\nBut the actions of breathing and sucking seem to differ essentially in several particulars. They are indeed both performed by means of air; but in the former, a child for many months exerts no spontaneous effort, whilst a spontaneous effort seems to be absolutely necessary for the performance of the latter. Of this indeed we could not be certain, were it true that infants never exhibit symptoms of a wish to suck, but when something is actually in contact with their mouths; for the mere act of sucking then might well be supposed to be automatic and the effect of irritation: But this is not the case. A healthy and vigorous infant, within ten minutes of its birth, gives the plainest and most unequivocal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of a desire to suck, before any thing be brought into actual contact with its mouth. It stretches out its neck, and turns its head from side to side apparently in quest of something: and that the object of its pursuit is something which it may suck, every man may satisfy himself by a very convincing experiment. When an infant is thus stretching out its neck and moving its head, if any thing be made to touch any part of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>, the little creature will instantly turn to the object, and endeavour by quick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> motions from side to side to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> it with its mouth, in the very same manner in which it always seizes the breast of its nurse, till taught by experience to distinguish objects by the sense of sight, when these alternate motions, being no longer useful, are no longer employed. If this be not an instance of pure instinct, we know not what it is. It cannot be the result of association or mechanism; for when the stretching of the neck takes place, nothing is in contact with the child's mouth, and no association which includes the act of sucking can have been formed. Associations of ideas are the consequences of simultaneous impressions frequently repeated; but when the child first declares, as plainly as it could do were it possessed of language, its wish to suck, it has not received a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> with which that wish can possibly be associated.\n\nWere Dr Priestley to weigh these facts, of the truth of which we are certain, we doubt not that his well-known candour would make him retract the assertion, that all the actions which Dr Reid and others refer to instinct, are either automatic or acquired. The greater part of those actions, as well as of the apparently instinctive principles of belief, we have no doubt are acquired: but we are persuaded that a child sucks its nurture as a bee builds its cell, by instinct; for upon no other hypothesis can we account for the spontaneous efforts exerted in both these operations: and we think it no disgrace to our species, that in some few cases we should act from the same principle with the inferior creation, as nothing seems more true than that,\n\n\u2014Reason raise o'er instinct as we can;\nIn this 'tis God that works, in that 'tis man.\n\nWe have said, that, in the savage state, the sexes go together for the first time by instinct, without any view to offspring, and perhaps with no determinate idea of enjoyment. This opinion, we believe, has been generally maintained; but it is controverted by Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARTLEY\">Hartley</a>. \"Here (says he) we are to observe, first, that when a general pleasurable state is introduced, either by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> impressions or by associated influences, the organs of generation must sympathize with this general state, for the same reasons as the other parts do. They must therefore be affected with vibrations in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a>, which rise above indifference, into the limits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, from youth, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, grateful aliment, the pleasures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, ambition, and sympathy, or any other cause which diffuses grateful vibrations over the whole system.\u2014Secondly, as these organs are endowed with a greater degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> than the other parts, from their make, and the peculiar structure and disposition of their nerves, whatever these be, we may expect that they should be more affected by those general pleasurable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of the nervous system than the other parts.\u2014Thirdly, the dilution of the cells of the vesiculae seminales and of the sinuses of the uterus, which take place about the time of puberty, must make these organs more particularly irritable then.\" His fourth observation reflects a state widely different from that of nature, and therefore is nothing to the purpose: but his fifth is, that \"the particular shame which regards the organs of generation, may, when considered as an associated circumstance, like other pains, be so far diminished as to fall within the limits of pleasure, and add considerably to the sum total.\"\n\nTo this excellent and able writer we may allow the truth of these observations (though some of them might certainly be controverted); and yet deny his conclusion, that \"they are sufficient to account for the general...\"\ngeneral desires which are observable in young persons, and that those desires are of a factitious nature.\" For supposing every thing which he mentions to take place by mere mechanism and association; that the organs of generation are irritated, and certain cells and sinuses distended; the only inference which can be fairly drawn from such premises is, that at the age of puberty young men and women must from these causes experience certain feelings and wants which they knew not before; but purely mechanism and association cannot teach them the use of the organs of generation, or point out the only means by which their new feelings can be gratified; and therefore, as we see these means invariably pursued by all animals rational and irrational, without experience and without instruction, we must refer the mutual desire of the sexes to a higher principle than mere mechanism and association; and that principle can be nothing but instinct.\n\nBesides these, we think the action of eating may be attributed to instinct. It is certainly performed by a spontaneous exertion of the proper organs; and that exertion is first made at a time of life when we have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of the end which it serves to accomplish, and therefore cannot be influenced by motives. It must indeed be confessed, that the first act of chewing is performed by a child, not for the purpose of masticating food, but to quicken the operation of nature in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>; and perhaps it may be said, that the pleasing sensation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>, which is then first experienced, and afterwards remembered, prompts the child to continue at intervals the exertion of chewing after all his teeth are cut; so that though the act of eating is not performed with a view to the mastication of food or the nourishment of the body, it may yet be performed, not from any instinctive impulse, but merely from an early and deep-rooted association. But in answer to this it is sufficient to ask, Who taught the infant that the act of chewing would quicken the operation of nature in the cutting of teeth? Not reason, surely, nor experience; for an infant knows nothing of teeth or the manner in which they grow; and if it be granted, that for this purpose it was originally impelled by some internal and mysterious influence to perform the act of chewing, we are not inclined to deny that the operation may be continued for other purposes by means of association.\n\nIn human works, though laboured on with pain,\nA thousand movements scarce one purpose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a>;\nIn God's, one finger can its end produce,\nYet serves to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> too some other use.\n\nThis is found philosophy confirmed by observation and daily experience; but though in the works of God, one principle produces many consequences, and though perhaps there is not a principle which falls under our cognizance more fruitful than that of association, yet if it be not sufficient to account for the first act of chewing, we cannot refer to it alone as to the source of that operation. Should it be said, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a> of an infant are at the period of cutting teeth so irritable, that the moment any thing is applied to them the jaws perform a motion merely automatic, which we mistake for the spontaneous effect of instinct; still we would ask, What prompts the child to apply every thing to its mouth? Does the irritation of the gums contract the muscles of the arm? By a bigot for mechanism this might be said, were it true that the arm of an infant, like a piece of clock-work, is always so regularly moved as to bring its hand directly into contact with its gums: but this is far from being the case; an infant makes many unsuccessful efforts to reach its mouth, and does not accomplish its purpose till after repeated trials. Perhaps it may be alleged (for when men adopt a favourite hypothesis they will allege anything in its support), that infants are taught to carry things to their mouths by the pleasing sensation received from the application of their nurse's breasts, and continue the practice from habit and association. But it is certain that they do not begin this practice till teeth are forming in their gums; and then they use such things as they themselves carry to their mouths very differently from the breasts of their nurse: they constantly chew and bite their rattles, though they very seldom bite their nurses. As this practice cannot be begun from a principle of association, so it appears to us that it cannot be continued upon such a principle. Were the sensation experienced by an infant when chewing a hard substance a pleasing sensation, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> of the pleasure might as a motive prompt it to repeat the operation; but it is obvious, that by pressing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, through which a tooth is making its way, against anything hard, the infant must experience a painful sensation; and therefore the influence which impels it to continue this operation, must be something more powerful than pleasure or pain.\n\nThese three actions, then, by which infants suck, by which they chew their food, and by which mankind be other are propagated, have undeniably their origin in instincts. There may be many other human actions which it is which derive their origin from the same source; but impossible in a state of civil society it is very difficult, if not to distinguish them from the effects of early <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> or habit.\n\nSuch, however, is the present impatience of that labour without which effects cannot be traced to their causes, that every phenomenon in human nature, which to former philosophers would have occasioned difficulty, is now thought to be sufficiently accounted for by referring it to some instinct as its particular cause; and he who can provide himself with a sufficient number of these instincts, for the reality of which he offers no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, seats himself in the philosopher's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DREAMS\">dreams</a> that he is debating a system of science, whilst he is only retailing a collection of anecdotes. A philosopher of this school has lately carried the doctrine recently of instinctive principles so far, as to attribute the superiority of man over the other animals, chiefly to the great number of instincts with which his mind is endowed; and among these he reckons (not, we believe, as characteristic of our species in contradistinction to other animals, but as part of the instinctive bundle in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>-ness of which our superiority consists) \"the voiding of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URINE\">urine</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCREMENT\">excrement</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SNEEZING\">sneezing</a>, retraction of the muscles upon the application of any painful stimulus, the moving of the eyelids and other parts of the body.\" These (he says) are effects of original instincts, and essential to the existence of young animals. With this writer instinct is sometimes represented as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> into futurity, and acting upon motives which have hitherto been considered as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of reason and the characteristic of man.\nInstinct man; here the same instinct is confounded with irritation and mechanism; and if this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of philosophizing continue in fashion, we shall not be surprised to find men, beasts, birds, and vegetables, considered by some other writer as nothing more than different species of the same genus of beings, that are all actuated by the great and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> principle of instinct. If sneezing and the retraction of the muscles upon the application of any painful stimulus be actions of instinct, there cannot be a doubt, upon the received principles of philosophy, but that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of the leaves of the sensitive plant upon the application of any stimulus proceeds likewise from instinct: nay, a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> must be endowed with instinct; for it too retracts upon the application of the painful stimulus of fire. All these are evidently similar effects produced by the same or similar causes; for in the operations of sneezing and retracting the muscles upon any painful application, there is not the least spontaneous exertion on our part, no co-operation of mind more than in the contraction of the leather and the plant. With respect to the voiding of urine and excrement, it is obvious, that at first these operations are performed without any effort of spontaneity; and that a voluntary power over the muscles which are subservient to them is very gradually acquired. Urine and excrement irritate the bladder and guts, which are supplied with branches of the same nerves that supply the abdominal muscles. But it is well known that the irritation of one branch of a nerve brings on a contraction of the muscles which are supplied by the other branches. Urine and excrement therefore are evidently expelled by the mechanical contraction of the organs of excretion; and to attribute these evacuations to instinct, is equally absurd as to say, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> or any other fluid substance pent up in a vessel, and pressed equally on all sides, makes its escape by instinct through the easiest passage. It is difficult to guess what the author means by the instinctive motion of the eyelids and other parts of the body. There is a motion of the eyelids which is voluntary, and another which is involuntary. The former proceeds from some motive, to exclude too great a glare of light, or to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> the eye against a foreseen mischief, and is therefore the result of reason as distinguished from instinct: the latter is obviously the effect of association, which took place in early infancy and produced a habit. Infants for several days after birth do not wink with their eyes upon the approach of one's hand or any other substance; but after having experienced pain from too much light or any other thing which hurts the eye, and that pain having at first produced an automatic motion of the eyelids, the motion comes in time to be so closely associated with its cause, that the very appearance of the latter produces the former. In all this there is no instinct, nor anything which resembles instinct: in the one case, the motion of the eyelids is in the strictest sense voluntary and rational; and in the other, it is either automatic or the effect of habit.\n\n\"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of light (says the same writer) is exhibited by infants at a very early period. I have remarked evident symptoms of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> on the third day after birth. When children are farther advanced, marks of the various passions generally appear. The passion of fear is discoverable at the age of two months. It is called forth by approaching the hand to the child's eye, and by any sudden motion or unusual noise.\" It has likewise been said, that \"an infant may be put into a fright by an angry countenance, and soothed again by smiles and blandishments;\" and \"that all these are causes of pure instinct.\" In reply to which, we scruple not to assert with Dr Priestley, that an infant (unless by an infant be meant a child who has a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of experience, and of course has made many observations on the connections of things) \"is absolutely incapable of terror. I am positive (says he), that no child ever showed the least symptom of fear or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> till he had actually received hurts and had felt pain; and that children have no fear of any particular person or thing, but in consequence of some connection between that person or thing and the pain they have felt. If any instinct of this kind were more necessary than another, it would be the dread of fire. But everybody must have observed, that infants show no sign of any such thing; for they will as readily put their finger to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> as to any thing else, till they have been burned. But after some painful experience of this kind, their dread of fire, though undeniably the effect of association, becomes as quick and as effectual in its operations as if it were an original instinctive principle.\" We moreover do not hesitate to say, with the same great philosopher, that if it were possible always to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> and terrify a child with a placid countenance, so as never to affume that appearance but in those circumstances, and always to soothe him with what we call an angry countenance, this connection of ideas would be reversed, and we should see the child frightened with a smile and delighted with a frown. In fact, there is no more reason to believe that a child is naturally afraid of a frown, than that he is afraid of being in the dark; and of this children certainly discover no sign, till they have either found something disagreeable to them in the dark, or have been told that there is something dreadful in it.\n\nThe truth of these observations is so obvious, that we doubt not but they will carry conviction to the mind of every reader. For though it should be granted, that so early as on the third day after birth children exhibit symptoms of uneasiness upon the sudden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of light, it would by no means follow that the love of light is in them instinctive. Light operates upon the eye by contact, and communicates to the infant a sensation of touch. If that sensation be pleasant, the child must necessarily feel some degree of uneasiness upon its removal, just as a full grown man must feel uneasy upon being deprived of any positive pleasure. But is sensation, or pleasure, or the removal of pleasure, pure instinct? No, surely.\n\nThus difficult is it to say in many cases what actions have their origin in instinct, and what are merely the effects of early association. But we think it may be safely affirmed, that no action, whether of man or brute, which is deliberately performed with a view to consequences, can with any propriety be said to proceed from instinct; for such actions are the effect of reason influenced by motives. Deliberation and instinct are obviously <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a>. To say with the author of the Philosophy of Natural History, \"that, when we are stimulated...\"\nInstructed by a particular instinct, instead of instantly obeying the impulse, another instinct arises in opposition, creates hesitation, and often totally extinguishes the original motion to action. It is either to affirm what is apparently not true, or it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> perversion of language. Motives opposed to each other may create hesitation, and a powerful motive may counterbalance a feeble instinct; but of two or more instincts operating at the same time, and opposing each other, we have no conception. Instinct, if we choose to speak a language that is intelligible, means a certain impulse under the direction of Supreme Wisdom; and it is very little probable that such wisdom should give opposite impulses at the same instant. In the natural works of animals, which are confessedly under the influence of instinct, we perceive no symptoms of deliberation; but every one, when not interrupted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> violence, proceeds without hesitation in the direct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, to an end of which the animal itself knows nothing. The same would be the case with man were he under the guidance of instinct; and it is vain to say that the instinct of fear is daily counteracted by ambition and resentment, till it be proved that fear, ambition, and resentment, are really instincts. Of this, however, the author seems to have no doubt. Indeed his work is so liberally stored with these principles, so useful to every man who wishes to acquire the name of a philosopher without the labour of investigation, that not only fear, ambition, and resentment, but even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a>, respect for eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, avarice, hope, envy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>, and sympathy, are all, in his opinion, instincts simple or modified. The origin of fear we have already seen when examining the instincts said to exhibit themselves in early infancy: let us try if we cannot trace some other individuals of this numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> to the same source of early affections.\n\nThe case then seems to be as follows. We first perceive or suppose some real good, i.e., some instincts to promote our happiness, in those things which we love or desire. Hence we annex to those things the idea of pleasure; with which they come, in time, to be so closely associated in our minds, that they cannot ever after present themselves without bringing that idea along with them. This association likewise often remains even after that which first gave rise to it is quite forgotten, or perhaps does not exist. An instance or two will make this very clear. No man can be born a lover of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>; for in a state of nature money exists not: no man therefore can be born with our author's instinct of avarice, directed in the manner which the most common acceptation of that word denotes. Yet how many men are there in the world, who have as strong a desire for money as if that desire were innate and instinctive; who account so much money so much happiness; and who make the mere possession of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> and silver, without any thought or design of using them, the ultimate end of all their actions? This is not because the love of money is born with them, for that is impossible; but because they first perceive a great many advantages from the possession of money, whence they conceive a pleasure in having it. Hence they desire it, endeavour to obtain it, and feel an actual pleasure in obtaining and possessing it. Then, by dropping the intermediate steps between money and happiness, they join money and happiness immediately together, and content themselves with the fantastic pleasure of having it; making that which was at first pursued only as means, be to them an ultimate end, in which consists their happiness or misery. The same might be observed concerning the thirst after knowledge, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>, ambition, and most of the various pursuits of life. These are at first entered upon with a view to some farther end, but at length become habitual exercises; with which the idea of pleasure is so closely associated, that we continue the pursuit after the reason from which it was at first begun has entirely vanished from our minds. Hence also we may account for another of our author's modified instincts, the almost diabolical feeling of envy. Mr Locke observes, that there are some men entirely unacquainted with this passion. His observation we believe to be a just one; for most men that are used to reflection, remember the time when they were first under its influence; and though they did not, it is a thing very little likely that the benevolent Author of nature should have implanted in the human mind even the seeds of an instinct, which, in the emphatic language of the Rambler, \"is mere unmixed and genuine evil.\" Envy is that pain which arises in the mind upon observing the success or prosperity of others; not however of all others indefinitely, but only of those with whom, upon some account or other, the envious person has once had a rivalry. But of such a feeling the origin is obvious; for when two or more persons are competitors for the same thing, the success of the one necessarily tends to the detriment of the other: hence the success of the one rival is in the mind of the other closely associated with pain or misery; and this association remaining after the rivalry which occasioned it has ceased, the person in whose mind envy is thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a>, always feels pain at the success of his rival even in affairs which have no relation to the original competition. Thus it is, that we are apt to envy those persons who refuse to be guided by our judgments, or persuaded by our arguments: For this is nothing else than a rivalry about the superiority of judgment; and we take a secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a>, both to let the world see, and in imagining ourselves, that in perspicuity and strength of judgment we have no superior.\n\nThough the principle of association will be more fully explained in another place, there is one observation which must not be omitted here; it is, that we do not always, nor perhaps for the most part, make these associations ourselves, but learn them from others in very early life. We annex happiness or misery to certain things or actions, because we see it done by our parents or companions; and acquire principles of action by imitating those whom we esteem, or by being told, by those in whom we have been taught to place confidence, that such conduct will promote our happiness, and that the reverse will involve us in misery. Hence the son too often inherits both the vices and the virtues of his father as well as his estate; hence national virtues and vices, dispositions and opinions; and hence too it is, that habits formed before the period of distinct remembrance are so generally mistaken for natural instincts.\n\nFrom the whole then of this investigation, we think ourselves warranted to conclude, that there is an essential difference between mechanism and instinct, and between both and reason; that mankind perform actions automatic by actions.\nThe primary schools, one of which is established in every district, where children are taught the arts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, the elements of French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a>, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a> and geometry, &c. 2.

The condition of possessing property was required by 19 Geo. II. c. 37, to prevent ships from being fraudulently destroyed when insured above their value; and to discourage a practice which had become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>, of converting policies to the purpose of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> wagers. In transactions of this kind, as the insured had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> property, and could claim no indemnification for partial damage; so the insurers, having lost their wager by the ship's being lost, could claim no abatement, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> was saved: accordingly, the policies contained clauses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> or no interest, free from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a>, and without benefit of salvage. All such policies are declared invalid.\n\nThis restriction does not extend to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIVATEERS\">privateers</a>, nor to ships trading to the Spanish or Portuguese plantations.\n\nInsurances are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> made as interest shall appear; and it is incumbent on the insured to prove the value of his property. The value of the goods may be proved by the invoices; and the coquet must be produced, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> required, to instruct that the goods were actually shipped. It is admitted to value the ship at prime cost and charges, deducting the freights that have been drawn since purchased, if the proprietors choose to stand to that rule; but they are not restricted to it. Sometimes the value of the ship or goods is expressed in the policy; and this value must be admitted, although it be higher than the true one: but it is incumbent on the insured to prove that he had property at stake; and, if the property be trifling in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of the sum insured, the insurance <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be set aside, as an evasion of the statute.\n\nExpected profits, and bounty on the whale fishery, if specified in the policy, may be insured.\n\nWhen the value is less than the sum insured, the owners may claim a return of premium for the excess.\n\nIf there be several policies on the same subject, of different dates, the earliest one is valid, and the others must be vacated. If they be of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a>, they must be vacated in equal proportions.\n\nWhen a policy is vacated, in whole or in part, the underwriters have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to retain \u00bd per cent. for their trouble.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of a cargo intended for A, but afterwards sent to B, both expected it, and insured, and B claimed for the value on its being lost. The underwriters answered, that it was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> insurance, and they ought only to pay their proportion. Judgment was\nInsurance was given, finding them liable for the whole, and reserving to them any demand competent against the underwriters who insured for A.\n\nFraudulently to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> away or destroy a ship insured above its value, is felony.\n\n2. If the ship does not proceed on the voyage, or if, being warranted to depart with convoy, it departs without convoy, the insurance must be vacated.\n\nIf the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of a trading voyage be uncertain, the longest one in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> is described in the policy, and it is agreed that part of the premium shall be returned, if the voyage be shortened. In like manner, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, when insurance is made without condition of convoy, it is agreed that part of the premium be returned in case it fail with convoy.\n\nWhen a ship is warranted to depart with convoy, it is understood from the usual place of convoy (e.g., the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWNS\">Downs</a>), and it is insured till it arrive there.\n\nThe common proof of failing with convoy is the production of failing orders; but, if a ship be prevented by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> from receiving the failing orders, other proof may be admitted.\n\nA ship was insured from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALIFAX\">Halifax</a>, warranted to sail from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTSMOUTH\">Portsmouth</a> with convoy. The convoy had failed before the ship arrived there, and the underwriters declined to insure it, without convoy, for the rest of the voyage. They were found liable to return part of the premium, retaining only in proportion to the accustomed rate from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> to Portsmouth. This decision seems to establish the following principle, that, when the voyage performed is only part of that described in the policy, and when the risk can be proportioned, the underwriters are bound to return part of the premium, though there be no agreement for that purpose.\n\nBut, if a ship, insured only against the hazards of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, be taken by the enemy, the insured have no right to claim a return of premium, though the capture happen soon, under pretence that little sea-hazard was incurred.\n\nIf a ship deviates from the voyage described in the policy, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, it sets aside the insurance. An intention to deviate is not sufficient to set it aside; there must be an actual deviation; and, even in that case, the insurers are liable for damages sustained before deviation.\n\nIt is no deviation to go out of the way to the accustomed place of convoy, nor to the nearest place where necessary repairs may be had. Deviation, for the purpose of smuggling, if without the knowledge of the owners, does not set aside the insurance, nor when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> is forced by the crew to return.\n\nIn insurance to the East Indies, and home, the insurers are understood to take the risk of detention in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and of country voyages.\n\n3. Insurance of prohibited goods, against the risk of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZURE\">seizure</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, is unlawful, and invalid. The insurers, insured, brokers, and all accessories, are liable to the fine of \u00a3500.\n\n4. If the insured have any information of more than common danger, they must reveal every such circumstance to the insurers, otherwise the policy is set aside.\n\nThis rule is established for the preservation of good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>; and there are several strong decisions in support of it. If a ship be spoke to leaky at sea, or if there be a report of its being lost, these circumstances must be communicated to the insurers. Even the concealment of a false report of loss invalidates the insurance; and, if the ship be afterwards lost, though in a different manner, the insured will recover nothing. In a voyage from Carolina to London, another ship had failed ten days after that which was insured, and arrived <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> days before the insurance was made; and the concealment of this circumstance, though the fact was not proved to the satisfaction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a>, was considered as sufficient to set it aside. Also, during the continuance of the American war, a ship being insured from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>, without confederating on the voyage, failed for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, and was taken by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> privateer. The insurers refused to pay, because the hazardous destination was concealed; and it was only upon proof of the insured being equally ignorant of it that they were found liable.\n\nBut the insured are not obliged to take notice of general perils, which the insurers are understood to have in contemplation; dangerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>, West <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> hurricanes, enterprises of the enemy, and the like.\n\nInsurance is not set aside by a mistake in the name of the ship or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, or the like.\n\nInsurance may be made on an uncertain ship; on any ship that the goods may be loaded on; on any ship that A shall sail in from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a>. In this last case, the policy is not transferred to a ship which A goes on board during the voyage.\n\nSecondly, If a ship be insured at and from a port, the insurance commences immediately if the ship be there, or at its arrival there. If it be damaged when preparing for a voyage, the insurers are liable; but not if the voyage be laid aside for several years, with consent of the owners. Insurance from a port commences when the ship breaks ground; and, if it set sail, and be driven back and lost in the port, the insurers are liable.\n\nInsurance on goods generally continues till they be landed; but, if they be sold after the ship's arrival, and freight contracted to another port, the insurance is concluded. Goods sent on board another ship or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> are not at the risk of the insurer; but goods sent ashore in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> are.\n\nInsurance on freight commences when the goods are put on board.\n\nGoods from the East Indies, insured to Gibraltar, and to be relifted from thence to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, were put on board a store-ship at Gibraltar, to wait an opportunity of relifting, and were lost: The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of putting goods aboard a store-ship being proved, the insurers were found liable.\n\nLoss of sails ashore, when the ship is repairing, is comprehended within the insurance. What is necessarily understood, is insured, as well as what is expressed; the essential means, and intermediate steps, as well as the end. Ships performing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-QUARANTINE\">quarantine</a> are at the risk of the insurer.\n\nThirdly, The insurers are liable for a total loss when the subject perishes through any of the perils insured against. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRATRY\">Barratry</a>, though it properly signifies running away with the ship, extends to any kind of fraud in\nInsurance against detention of princes does not extend to ships that are seized for transgressing the laws of foreign countries.\n\nThe insurers are also liable for a total loss, when damage is sustained, and the remaining property abandoned or veiled in the insurers.\n\nIf a ship be stranded, or taken, and kept by the enemy, or detained by any foreign power, or seized for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of the government, the proprietors have a right to abandon.\n\nBut, if a ship be taken by the enemy, and be retaken, or makes its escape, before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> against the insurers; have the insured a right to abandon, or must they only claim for the damages sustained as an average loss? There are opposite decisions, according as the circumstances of the case were strong. When the ship was long detained, the goods perishable, the voyage entirely lost, or so disturbed, that the pursuit of it was not worth the freight, or when the damage exceeds half the value of the thing, they have been found entitled to abandon; Gos against Withers, 2 Burrow, 683.). But, if the voyage be completed with little trouble or delay, they are not entitled; (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a> against Mendez, 2 Burrow, 1198.).\n\nThe insured cannot claim, as for a total loss, on an offer to abandon, when the loss is, in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, only partial; for, if this were permitted, they might devolve the loss occasioned by bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a> on the insurers.\n\nAnd, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, the insured have their option to abandon, or not. They may retain their property if they please, and claim for an average loss; and they must make their option before they claim.\n\nIf the goods be so much damaged, that their value is less than the freight, the insurers are accountable as for a total loss.\n\nThe insurers are liable for general average, when the property is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with contribution; and for particular average, when the property is damaged, or part of it destroyed.\n\nIf the damage be sustained through the fault of the ship, the owners of the goods may have recourse, either against the master or insurers; and, if the insurers be charged, they stand in the place of the owners, and have recourse against the master.\n\nIn order to prevent the insurers from being troubled with frivolous demands for average, it is generally stipulated, that none shall be charged under 5 per cent., or some other determined rate; and corn, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>, fruit, fish, and like perishable goods, are warranted free from average, unless general, or the ship be stranded.\n\nIn order to encourage every effort to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> the ship, the insurers are liable for charges laid out with that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, although the subject perish. Thus, they may be charged with more than the sum insured.\n\nIn case of goods being damaged, the proportion of the sum insured, for which the underwriters are liable, is regulated by the proportion of the prices which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> and damaged goods fetch at the port of destination. The prime cost of the goods is not considered, nor the necessity of immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of damage. Although the damaged goods fell above prime cost, the insurers are liable.\n\nFourthly, If a ship be lost, and the crew saved, the loss is proved by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> of the crew.\n\nIf damage be sustained, the extent is proved by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the subject damaged, at the ship's arrival; and the cause by the evidence of the crew.\n\nIf the ship be stranded, evidence must be taken at the place where stranded.\n\nDocuments of loss must be laid before the underwriters, with all convenient speed; and, if these be sufficiently clear, the loss should be immediately settled. The underwriters generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> their notes at a month or six weeks date for their proportions.\n\nIf a ship be not heard of for a certain time, it is presumed lost; and the underwriters are liable to pay the sums insured, the property being abandoned to them in the event of the ship's return. Six months are allowed for a voyage to any part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, a year to America, and two years to the East Indies.\n\nBy the ordinance of Hamburgh, if a ship be three months beyond the usual time of performing a voyage, the underwriters may be desired to pay 92 per cent. on an abandon. If they decline it, they are allowed 14 months more, and then they must pay the full value.\n\nA ship insured against the hazards of the sea, but not against the enemy, if never heard of, is presumed lost at sea.\n\nFifthly, In order that the manner of settling losses may be understood, we must explain what is meant by covering property. We mentioned already, that insurances for greater sums than the insured had really at stake, were contrary to law; but some latitude is allowed in that respect; for if the owner were to insure no more than the exact value of his property, he would lose the premium of insurance, and the abatement, if any was agreed on.\n\nFor example, if he has goods on board to the value of 100l. and insures the same at 5 per cent. to abate 2 per cent. in case of loss; then, if a total loss happen, he recovers 98l. from the insurers, of which 5l. being applied to replace the premium, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a> sum saved is only 93l.; but, if the value on board be only 93l. and the sum insured 100l. he would be fully indemnified for the loss; and his property, in that case, is said to be covered.\n\nTo find how much should be insured to cover any sum, subtract the amount of the premium and abatement (if any) from 100l. As the remainder is to 100l., so is the value to the sum which covers it.\n\nIn case of a total loss, if the sum insured be not greater than that which covers the property, the insurers must pay it all. If greater, they pay what covers the property, and return the premium on the overplus.\n\nPartial losses are regulated by this principle, that whereas the owner is not fully indemnified, in case of a total loss, unless he covers his property, therefore he should only be indemnified for a partial loss in the same proportion; and, if it be not fully insured, he is considered as insurer himself, for the part not covered, and must bear a suitable proportion of the loss. Therefore the value of the property is proved, and the sum required to cover it computed. If that sum be all insured, the underwriters pay the whole damage; if only part be insured, they pay their share, which is computed by the following rule: As the sum which covers the property is to the sum insured, so is the whole damage to the\nInsurance, the part for which the insurers are liable.\u2014For example, if the value of the property be \u00a3360l., the sum insured \u00a3300l., the premium 8 per cent. and abatement 2 per cent.; then the sum which should be insured to cover the property is \u00a3400l.; and, if damage be sustained to the extent of \u00a3200l., the owners will recover \u00a3150l.\n\nIf a voyage is insured out and home, the premium outward must be considered as part of the value on the homeward property, and the sum necessary to cover it computed accordingly. For example, to insure \u00a3100l. out and home, at 5 per cent. each voyage, abatement 2 per cent., we compute thus:\n\n\\[ \\frac{93}{100} : \\frac{L.100}{L.107} : \\frac{10}{6}, \\text{to be insured outward, premium on } L.107 : \\frac{10}{6} \\text{ outwards, at 5 per cent. } L.5 : \\frac{7}{6} : \\frac{6}{3} : \\frac{100}{100} : \\frac{L.105}{L.105} : \\frac{7}{6} : \\frac{L.113}{L.113} : \\frac{6}{6}, \\text{to be insured home; the premium on which is } L.5 : \\frac{13}{6} : \\frac{6}{6}; \\text{and, if the ship be lost on the homeward voyage,} \\]\n\nFrom the sum insured home \\( L.113 \\) 6 0\nSubtract the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCOUNT\">discount</a>, 2 per cent. 2 5 3\n\nSum for which the insurers are liable \\( L.111 \\) \u2014 9\n\nInsurance out \\( L.5 \\) 7 6\nInsurance home \\( 5 \\) 13 3\n\nCovered property \\( L.100 \\) \u2014 \u2014\n\nII. Insurance against Fire. There are several offices in Britain for this purpose, of which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">Sun</a> fire-office is the most considerable. Insurances are divided into common, hazardous, and doubly hazardous, according to the nature of the subject insured. When the sum insured is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, there is a higher premium per cent. demanded; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, papers, jewels, pictures, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, are not comprehended. If a subject be wrong described, in order that it may be insured at a lower premium, the policy is void. The benefit of a policy is transferred, by indorsement, to the representatives of the person in whose favour it was made; and it may be transferred to other houses when the insured changes his habitation. If insurance be made on the same subject in different offices, it must be specified, by indorsement, on the policy; and, in case of loss, the offices pay proportionally. The insurers pay all expenses in attempting to extinguish fire, or save goods, though not successful. If the value of a subject be insured in part, and damage be sustained, the insurers pay the whole, if it does not exceed the sum insured.\n\nIII. Insurance of Debts. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOMRY\">Bottomry</a>.\n\nIV. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of Insurance for Lives, when the person dies, a sum of money becomes payable to the person on whose behalf the policy of insurance was granted. One of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> insurance-offices of this kind, is that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMICABLE\">Amicable</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> for a perpetual insurance, kept in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERGEANT\">Sergeant</a>'s-inn, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">Fleet</a>-street, London.\n\nThis society at Sergeant's-inn requires an annual payment of \u00a31 from every member during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, payable quarterly. The whole annual income hence arising is equally divided among the nominees, or heirs, of such members as die every year; and this renders the dividends among the nominees, in different years, more or less, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of members who have happened to die in those years. But this society engages that the dividends shall not be less than \u00a3150l. to each claimant, though they may be more.\u2014None are admitted whose ages are greater than 45, or less than 12; nor is there any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of contribution allowed on account of difference of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>.\u2014This society has subsisted ever since 1706, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> and usefulness are well established. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, however, is liable to several objections. First, it is evident, that regulating the dividends among the nominees, by the number of members who die every year, is not equitable; because it makes the benefit which a member is to receive to depend, not on the value of his contribution, but on a contingency; that is, the number of members that shall happen to die the same year with him. Secondly, its requiring the same payments from all persons under 45, is also not equitable; for the payment of a person admitted at 12 ought not to be more than half the payment of a person admitted at 45. Thirdly, its plan is so narrow, as to confine its usefulness too much. It can be of no service to any person whose age exceeds 45. It is likewise by no means properly adapted to the circumstances of persons who want to make assurances on their lives for only one year, or a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of years. For example: the true value of the assurance of \u00a3150l. for five years, on the life of a person whose age is 39, may be found, by the first rule, to be nearly three guineas per annum, supposing interest at 3 per cent. and the probabilities of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> life, as they are given in Dr Halley's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">Table</a> of Observations. But such an assurance could not be made in this society without an annual payment of \u00a31. Neither is the plan of this society at all adapted to the circumstances of persons who want to make assurances on particular survivorships. For example: a person possessed of an estate or salary, which must be lost with his life, has a person dependent upon him, for whom he desires to secure a sum of money payable at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>. But he desires this only as a security against the danger of his dying first, and leaving a wife, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a>, without support. In these circumstances he enters himself into this society; and, by an annual payment of \u00a31, entitles his nominee at his death to \u00a3150l. In a few years, perhaps, his nominee happens to die; and having then lost the advantages he had in view, he determines to forfeit his former payments, and to withdraw from the society. The right method, in this case, would have been to have taken from such a person the true value of the sum assured, \"on the supposition of non-payment, provided he should survive.\" In this way he would have chosen to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> with the society; and had he done this, he would have paid for the assurance (supposing interest at 3 per cent.) his age 30, the age of his nominee 30, and the values of lives as given by M. de Moivre) \u00a31. 8s. in annual payments, to begin immediately, and to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> duration of his own life, and the life of his nominee.\n\nThe Equitable Society for Assurances on Lives and Survivorships, which meets at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACKFRIARS\">Blackfriars</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">Bridge</a>, is one of the most important of the kind. It was established in the year 1762, in consequence of proposals made, and lectures recommending the design, which had been read by Mr Dodson, author of the Mathematical Repository. It affords any sums or reverendary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNUITIES\">annuities</a>, on any life or lives, for any number of years, as well as for the whole continuance of the lives;\nInsurance, in any manner that may be best adapted to the views of the persons assured. For instance, any persons who depend on incomes which must be lost when they die, or who are only tenants for life in estates, may, if they want to borrow money, be enabled to give sufficient security, by affixing such sums as they want to borrow, and affixing the policy. In the same way clergymen, and others who hold places of profit, having families whose subsistence depends on the continuance of their lives; such as enjoy annuities for the lives of others; any person entitled to an estate, legacy, &c., after another person, provided he survives; husbands may provide annuities for their wives, if they leave them widows; parents may, by affixing the lives of their children, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a>, till they attain a given age, secure for them, should they live till that age, sums necessary for apprenticeships, &c.; persons apprehensive of being left without support in old age, may here purchase annuities, if willing to wait for the commencement of the payment of these till they are 55 or 60 years of age.\n\nIn fine, there are no kinds of assurances on lives and survivorships, which this society does not make, following the rules given by the best mathematical writers on life annuities, particularly Mr Simson's. In order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> such a profit as may render it a permanent benefit to the public, and enable it to bear the expenses of management, it takes the advantage of making its calculations at so low an interest as 3 per cent. and from tables of the probabilities and values of lives in London, where, as in all great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, the rate of human mortality is much greater than it is in common among mankind.\n\nThis society, finding in the month of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1777, that their affairs were in a flourishing condition, came to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to reduce their annual premiums one-tenth; and they adopted new tables in the year 1782, founded on the probabilities of life at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHAMPTON\">Northampton</a>, instead of those which were framed from the London bills of mortality. It was afterwards thought proper to make an addition, for greater security, of 15 per cent. to the true value of the assurances, as calculated from the table of mortality at Northampton. To make a suitable recompense to the assured for the payments they had formerly made, which had been greater than the new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">rates</a> required, an addition of 11. 10s. was made to their claims for every premium they had paid. The result of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> was, that in 1785 the business of the society was nearly doubled, the sums assured amounting to 720,000l. In consequence of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>, the society took off the 15 per cent. charged on premiums in 1782, and added 11. per cent. more to the assured's claims, for every payment made before the 1st of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1786. Business still increasing, they made another addition of 11. per cent. in 1791; and in the subsequent year a farther addition of 21. per cent. by which the claims of such as assured in 1770 came to be more than doubled, and those of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> date were still higher. By such integrity and consequent increase of business, the sums assured amounted, on the 31st of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1792, to the astonishing sum of three millions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>; and exactly three years after, they amounted to about one million more.\n\nThe rates of assurance, as reduced to their real values in 1786, according to which all business is now transacted, are the following:\n\n| Age | One year | Seven years | Whole life |\n|-----|----------|-------------|------------|\n|     | \u00a3 s. d.  | \u00a3 s. d.      | \u00a3 s. d.    |\n| 15  | 17       | 11          | 21         |\n| 20  | 7        | 3           | 9          |\n| 25  | 10       | 7           | 12         |\n| 30  | 13       | 3           | 14         |\n| 35  | 16       | 4           | 18         |\n| 40  | 20       | 8           | 24         |\n| 45  | 26       | 8           | 30         |\n| 50  | 31       | 10          | 34         |\n| 55  | 36       | 12          | 38         |\n| 60  | 41       | 14          | 42         |\n| 65  | 46       | 16          | 46         |\n\nThe other offices in London for the assurances of lives are,\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">Exchange</a> Assurance, which was empowered to assure lives by virtue of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> date the 29th of April 1721; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> Society was established in 1792, for assuring lives and annuities; and the Pelican Life Office was instituted in 1797, which makes a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of assurance, by way of endowment for daughters, when they have attained the age of 21 years.\n\nRe-Insurance is a second contract, made by any insurer, to transfer the risk he has engaged for to another.

It may not be amiss here to inquire upon what grounds this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> does really stand.\n\nThe enemies to interest in general make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> distinction between that and usury, holding any increase of money to be indefensibly usurious. And this they ground as well on the prohibition of it by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of Moses among the Jews, as also upon what is laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, That money is naturally barren; and to make it breed money is preposterous, and a perversion of the end of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a>, which was only to serve the purposes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a>, and not of increase. Hence the school-divines have branded the practice of taking interest, as being contrary to the divine law both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> and revealed; and the canon law has prohibited\nthe taking any the least increase for the loan of money as a mortal sin.\n\nBut, in answer to this, it may be observed, that the Mosaic precept was clearly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a>, and not a moral, precept. It only prohibited the Jews from taking usury from their brethren the Jews; but in express words permitted them to take it of a stranger: which proves that the taking of moderate usury, or a reward for the use, for so the word signifies, is not malum in se, since it was allowed where any but an Israelite was concerned. And as to Aristotle's reason, deduced from the natural barrenness of money, the same may with equal force be alleged of houles, which never breed houles; and twenty other things, which nobody doubts it is lawful to make profit of, by letting them to hire. And though money was originally used only for the purposes of exchange, yet the laws of any state may be well justified in permitting it to be turned to the purposes of profit, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the convenience of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> (the great end for which money was invented) shall require it. And that the allowance of moderate interest tends greatly to the benefit of the public, especially in a trading <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> appear from that generally acknowledged principle, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> cannot subsist without mutual and extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>. Unless money therefore can be borrowed, trade cannot be carried on; and if no premium were allowed for the hire of money, few persons would care to lend it; or at least the rate of borrowing at a short warning (which is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of commerce) would be entirely at an end. Thus, in the dark ages of monkish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> and civil tyranny, when interest was laid under a total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERDICT\">interdict</a>, commerce was also at its lowest ebb, and fell entirely into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the Jews and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOMBARDS\">Lombards</a>: but when men's minds began to be more enlarged, when true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> revived, commerce grew again into credit; and again introduced with itself its inseparable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>, the doctrine of loans upon interest.\n\nAnd, really, considered abstractedly from this its use, since all other conveniences of life may be either bought or hired, but money can only be hired, there seems no greater impropriety in taking a recompense or price for the hire of this, than of any other convenience. If one borrow tools to employ in a beneficial trade, it is but equitable that the lender should have a proportion of the gains. To demand an exorbitant price is equally contrary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a>, for the loan of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, or the loan of a sum of money: but a reasonable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> for the temporary inconvenience which the owner may feel by the want of it, and for the hazard of his losing it entirely, is not more immoral in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> than it is in the other. And indeed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> prohibition of lending upon any, even moderate interest, introduces the very inconvenience which it seems meant to remedy. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of individuals will make borrowing unavoidable. Without some profit by law, there will be but few lenders; and those principally bad men, who will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> through the law, and take a profit; and then will endeavour to indemnify themselves from the danger of the penalty, by making that profit exorbitant. Thus, while all degrees of profit were discomfited, we find more complaints of usury, and more flagrant instances of oppression, than in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> times when money may be easily had at a low interest. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> distinction must therefore be made between a moderate and exorbitant profit; to the former of which we usually give the name of interest, to the latter the truly odious appellation of usury: the former is necessary in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CIVIL_STATE\">civil state</a>; if it were but to exclude the latter, which ought never to be tolerated in any well regulated society.\u2014For, as the whole of this matter is well summed up by Grotius, \"if the compensation allowed by law does not exceed the proportion of the hazard run, or the want felt, by the loan, its allowance is neither repugnant to the revealed nor to the natural law: but if it exceeds those bounds, it is then oppressive usury; and though the municipal laws may give it impunity, they never can make it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a>.\"\n\nWe see, that the exorbitance or moderation of interest, for the money <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENT\">lent</a>, depends upon two circumstances; the inconvenience of parting with it for the present, and the hazard of losing it entirely. The inconvenience to individual lenders can never be estimated by laws; the rate therefore of general interest must depend upon the usual of general inconvenience. This results entirely from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of specie or current money in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>: for, the more specie there is circulating in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, the greater superfluity there will be, beyond what is necessary to carry on the business of exchange and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> concerns of life. In every nation, or public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>, there is a certain quantity of money thus necessary; which a person well skilled in political <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a> might perhaps calculate as exactly as a private banker can the demand for running cash in his own shop: all above this necessary quantity may be spared, or lent, without much inconvenience to the respective leaders; and the greater this national superfluity is, the more numerous will be the lenders, and the lower ought the rate of the national interest to be; but where there is not enough, or barely enough, circulating cash to answer the ordinary uses of the public, interest will be proportionably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>; for lenders will be but few, as few can submit to the inconvenience of lending.\n\nSo also the hazard of an entire loss has its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> in the regulation of interest: hence, the better the security, the lower will the interest be; the rate of interest being generally in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> ratio, formed out of the inconvenience and the hazard. And as, if there were no inconvenience, there should be no interest but what is equivalent to the hazard; so, if there were no hazard, there ought to be no interest, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> only what arises from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> inconvenience of lending. Thus, if the quantity of specie in a nation be such, that the general inconvenience of lending for a year is computed to amount to three per cent, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> that has money by him will perhaps lend it upon good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> security at five per cent, allowing two for the hazard run; he will lend it upon landed security, or mortgage, at four per cent, the hazard being proportionably less; but he will lend it to the state, on the maintenance of which all his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> depends, at three per cent, the hazard being none at all.\n\nBut sometimes the hazard may be greater than the rate of interest allowed by law will compensate. And this gives rise to the practice, 1. Of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOMRY\">bottomry</a>, or respondentia. 2. Of policies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSURANCE\">insurance</a>. See BOTTOMRY, and INSURANCE.\nUpon the two principles of inconvenience and hazard, compared together, different nations have at different times established different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">rates</a> of interest. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> at one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> allowed centumlinea, one per cent. monthly, or twelve per cent. per annum, to be taken for common loans; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTINIAN\">Justinian</a> reduced it to trientes, or one-third of the as or centumlinea, that is four per cent.; but allowed higher interest to be taken of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>, because there the hazard was greater. So too Grotius informs us, that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> the rate of interest was then eight per cent. in common loans, but twelve to merchants. Our law establishes one standard for all alike, where the pledge or security itself is not put in jeopardy; left, under the general pretence of vague and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">indeterminate</a> hazards, a door should be opened to fraud and usury; leaving specific hazards to be provided against by specific insurances, or by loans upon respondebuntia or bottomry. But as to the rate of legal interest, it has varied and decreased for 200 years past, according as the quantity of specie in the kingdom has increased by accretions of trade, the introduction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>-credit, and other circumstances. The statute 37 Hen. VIII. c. 9., confirmed interest to ten per cent. and so did the statute 13 Eliz. c. 8. But as, through the encouragements given in her reign to commerce, the nation grew more wealthy; so, under her successor, the statute 21 Jac. I. c. 17., reduced it to eight per cent.; as did the statute 12 Car. II. c. 13., to six; and lastly, by the statute 12 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANN\">Ann</a>. stat. 2. c. 16., it was brought down to five per cent. yearly, which is now the extremity of legal interest that can be taken. But yet, if a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> which carries interest be made in a foreign country, our courts will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the payment of interest according to the law of that country in which the contract was made. Thus Irish, American, Turkish, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> interest, have been allowed in our courts to the amount of even 12 per cent. For the moderation or exorbitance of interest depends upon local circumstances; and the refusal to enforce such contracts would put a stop to all foreign trade. And, by stat. 14 Geo. III. c. 79., all mortgages and other securities upon estates or other property in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> or the plantations, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> interest not exceeding five per cent. shall be legal; though executed in the kingdom of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>: unless the money lent shall be known at the time to exceed the value of the thing in pledge; in which case also, to prevent usurious contracts at home under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of such foreign securities, the borrower shall forfeit treble the sum so borrowed.\n\nFor the method of computing interest, see Arithmetic, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. iv. p. 645; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALGEBRA\">Algebra</a>, sect. xx. p. 658.","sp":315,"ep":317},{"h":"INTERIM","t":"a name given to a formulary, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> kind of confession of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, obtruded upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a> after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUTHER\">Luther</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> V. when he had defeated their forces; so called because it was only to take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the interim (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>) till a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> should have decided all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> in dispute between the Protestants and Romanists.

The Egyptians preserved theirs with the resin of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEDAR\">cedar</a>, with aromatic spices, and with salt. These people often kept such mummies, or at least their effigies, in their houses; and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> entertainments they were introduced, that by reciting the great actions of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> they might be better excited to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>. See <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNERAL_RITES\">FUNERAL <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">RITES</a>.\n\nThe Greeks, at first, had probably not the same veneration for the dead as the Egyptians. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMPEDOCLES\">Empedocles</a>, therefore, in the eighty-fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OLYMPIAD\">Olympiad</a>, restored to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> Pontia, a woman of Argirgentum, who was about to be interred. But this people, in proportion as they grew civilized, becoming more enlightened, perceived the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of establishing laws for the protection of the dead.\n\nAt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> required that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> person should be interred before the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>; and in the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the cities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> a funeral did not take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> till the fifth or seventh. When a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> appeared to have breathed his last, his body was generally washed by his nearest relations, with warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> mixed with wine. They afterwards anointed it with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>; and covered it with a dress <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> made of fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of the Egyptians. This dress was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> at Messina, Athens, and in the greater part of the cities of Greece, where the dead body was crowned with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPARTA\">Sparta</a> it was of a purple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, and the body was surrounded with olive leaves. The body was afterwards laid upon a couch in the entry of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, where it remained till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of the funeral. At the magnificent obsequies with which Alexander honoured Hephaestion, the body was not burned until the tenth day.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, in the infancy of their empire, paid as little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to their dead as the Greeks had done. Acilius Aviola having fallen into a lethargic fit, was supposed to be dead; he was therefore carried to the funeral pile; the fire was lighted up; and though he cried out he was still alive, he perished for want of speedy assistance. The praetor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMIA\">Lamia</a> met with the same fate. Tubero, who had been praetor, was saved from the funeral pile. Aesclepiades a physician, who lived in the time of Pompey the Great, about one hundred and twenty years before the Christian era, returning from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>-house, observed near the walls of Rome a grand convoy and a crowd of people, who were in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">mourning</a> afflicting at a funeral, and showing every exterior sign of the deepest grief. Having asked what was the occasion of this concourse, no one made any reply. He therefore approached the pretended dead body; and imagining that he perceived signs of life in it, he ordered the bystanders to take away the flambeaux, to extinguish the fire, and to pull <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the funeral pile. A kind of murmur on this arose throughout the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>. Some said that they ought to believe the physician, while others turned both him and his profession into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a>. The relations, however, yielded at length to the remonstrances of Aesclepiades; they consented to defer the obsequies for a little; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> was, the restoration of the pretended dead person to life. It appears that these examples, and several others of the like nature, induced the Romans to delay funerals longer, and to enact laws to prevent precipitate interments.\n\nAt Rome, after allowing a sufficient time for mourning, the nearest relation generally closed the eyes of the deceased; and the body was bathed with warm water, either to render it fitter for being anointed with oil, or to reanimate the principle of life, which might remain suspended without manifesting itself. Proofs were afterwards made, to discover whether the person was really dead, which were often repeated during the time that the body remained exposed; for there were persons appointed to visit the dead, and to prove their situation. On the second day, after the body had been washed a second time, it was anointed with oil and balm. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUXURY\">Luxury</a> increased to such a pitch in the choice of foreign perfumes for this purpose, that under the consulship of Licinius Cratius and Julius Caesar, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> forbade any perfumes to be used except such as were the production of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>. On the third day the body was clothed according to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> and condition. The robe called the praetexta was put upon magistrates, and a purple robe upon consuls; for conquerors, who had merited triumphal honours, this robe was of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> tissue. For other Romans it was white, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> for the lower classes of the people. These dresses were often prepared at a distance, by the mothers and wives of persons still in life. On the fourth day the body was placed on a couch, and exposed in the vestibule of the house, with the visage turned towards the entrance, and the feet near the door; in this situation it remained till the end of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>. Near the couch were lighted wax-tapers, a small box in which perfumes were burnt, and a vessel full of water for purification, with which those who approached the body befriended themselves. An old man, belonging to those who furnished everything necessary for funerals, sat near the deceased, with some domestics clothed in black. On the eighth day the funeral rites were performed; but to prevent the body from corrupting before that time, salt, wax, the resinous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> of the cedar, myrrh, honey, balm, gypsum, lime, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASPHALTITES\">asphaltites</a> or bitumen of Judea, and several other substances, were employed. The body was carried to the pile with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> uncovered, unless wounds or the nature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> had rendered it loathsome and disgusting. In such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> a mask was used, made of a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLASTER\">plaster</a>; which has given rise to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of funera larvata, used in some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> authors. This was the last method of concealment which Nero made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of, after having caused Germanicus to be poisoned; for the effect of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> had become very sensible by livid spots and the blackness of the body; but a shower of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> happening to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, it washed the plaster entirely away, and thus the horrid crime of fratricide was discovered.\n\nThe Turks have, at all times, been accustomed to wash the bodies of their dead before interment; and as their ablutions are complete, and no part of the body escapes the attention of those who assist at such melancholy ceremonies, they can easily perceive whether\nInterment one be really dead or alive, by examining, among other methods of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, whether the sphincter ani has lost its power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> this muscle remains still contracted, they warm the body, and endeavour to recall it to life; otherwise, after having washed it with water and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>, they wipe it with linen cloths, wash it again with rose-water and aromatic substances, cover it with a rich dress, put upon its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAP\">cap</a> ornamented with flowers, and extend it upon a carpet placed in the vestibule or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a> at the entrance of the house.\n\nIn the primitive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> the dead were washed and then anointed; the body was wrapped up in linen, or clothed in a dress of more or less value according to circumstances, and it was not interred until after being exposed and kept some days in the house. The custom of clothing the dead is preserved in France only for princes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICS\">ecclesiastics</a>.\n\nIn other countries, more or less care is taken to prevent sudden interments. At Geneva, there are people appointed to inspect all dead bodies. Their duty consists in examining whether the person be really dead, and whether one died naturally or by violence. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>, as well as at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENOA\">Genoa</a>, it is usual not to bury the dead till three days have expired. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, people carry their precautions much farther, and delay the funeral's longer. And in England bodies generally remain unburied three or four days.\n\nPremature Interment. Notwithstanding the customs above recited; still, in many places, and on many occasions in all places, too much precipitation attends this last office; or if not precipitation, a neglect of due precautions in regard to the body. In general, indeed, the most improper treatment that can be imagined is adopted, and many a person made to descend into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> before he has sighed his last breath. The histories related by Hildanus, by Camerarius, by Horilius, by Macrobius in his Somnium Scipionis, by Plato in his Republic, by Valerius Maximus, and by a great many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> authors, leave us no doubt respecting the dangers and misconduct of such precipitation. It must appear astonishing that the attention of mankind has been after all so little raised by an idea the most terrible that can be conceived on this side of eternity. If nature recoils from the idea of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, with what horror must she start at the thought of death anticipated, precipitated by inattention\u2014a return of life in darkness, dilution, and despair\u2014then death repeated under agonies unspeakable! To revive nailed up in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COFFIN\">coffin</a>! The brain can scarce sustain the reflection in our coolest safest moments.\n\nAccording to present usage, as soon as the semblance of death appears, the chamber of the sick is deserted by friends, relatives, and physicians; and the apparently dead, though frequently living, body, is committed to the management of an ignorant and unfeeling nurse, whose care extends no farther than laying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMBS\">limbs</a> straight, and securing her accustomed perquisites. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>-clothes are immediately removed, and the body is exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. This, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, must extinguish any spark of life that may remain, and which, by a different treatment, might have been kindled into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>; or it may only continue to refresh it, and the unhappy person afterwards revive amidst the horrors of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the end of a weak life and interment; the commencement of death, is so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a>, and the uncertainty of the signs of the latter is so well established both by ancient and modern authors who have turned their attention to that important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, that we can scarcely suppose undertakers capable of distinguishing an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> from a real death. Animals which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a> during winter show no signs of life; in this case, circulation is only suspended: but were it annihilated, the vital spirit does not so easily lose its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> as the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a> of the body; and the principle of life, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> survives the appearance of death, may re-animate a body in which the action of all the organs seems to be at an end. But how difficult is it to determine whether this principle may not be revived? It has been found impossible to recall to life some animals suffocated by mephitic vapours, though they appeared less affected than others who have revived. Coldness, heaviness of the body, a leaden livid colour, with a yellowness in the visage, are all very uncertain signs: Mr Zimmerman observed them all upon the body of a criminal, who fainted through the dread of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> which he had merited. He was shaken, dragged about, and turned in the same manner as dead bodies are, without the least signs of respiration; and yet at the end of 24 hours he was recalled to life by means of volatile alkali.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTOR\">director</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COACH\">coach</a>-office at Dijon, named Colinet, was supposed to be dead, and the news of this event was spread through the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>. One of his friends, who was desirous of seeing him at the moment when he was about to be buried, having looked at him for a considerable time, thought he perceived some remains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> in the muscles of the face. He therefore made an attempt to bring him to life by spirituous liquors, in which he succeeded; and this director enjoyed afterwards for a long time that life which he owed to his friend. This remarkable circumstance was much like those of Empedocles and Asclepiades. These instances would perhaps be more frequent, were men of skill and abilities called in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of sudden death, in which people of ordinary knowledge are often deceived by false appearances.\n\nA man may fall into a syncope, and may remain in that condition three or even eight days. People in this situation have been known to come to life when deposited among the dead. A body belonging to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAEN\">Caen</a> appeared to have breathed its last; he was carried into the hall where the dead were exposed, and was wrapped up in a piece of canvas. Some time after, recovering from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETHARGY\">lethargy</a>, he recollected the place in which he had been deposited, and crawling towards the door knocked against it with his foot. This noise was luckily heard by the sentinel, who soon perceiving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the canvas called for assistance. The youth was immediately conveyed to a warm bed, and soon perfectly recovered. Had his body been confined by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> bandages or ligatures, he would not have been able, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, to make himself be heard: his unavailing efforts would have made him again fall into a syncope, and he would have been thus buried alive.\n\nWe must not be astonished that the servants of an hospital should take a syncope for a real death, since, even the most enlightened people have fallen into errors of\nDr John Schmid relates, that a young girl, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, after being afflicted for some weeks with a violent cough, was all of a sudden freed from this troublesome malady, and appeared to be in perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>. But some days after, while playing with her companions, this child fell down in an instant as if struck by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>. A death-like pallor was diffused over her face and arms; she had no apparent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a>, her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a> were sunk, and she showed no signs of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> when shaken or pinched. A physician, who was called, and who believed her to be dead, in compliance with the repeated and pressing request of her parents, attempted, though without any hopes, to recall her to life; and at length, after several vain efforts, he made the soles of her feet be firmly rubbed with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a> dipped in strong pickle. At the end of three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> she was observed to sigh; she was then made to swallow some spirituous liquor; and she was soon after restored to life, much to the joy of her disconsolate parents.\u2014A certain man having undertaken a journey, in order to see his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>, on his arrival at his house found him dead. This news affected him so much, that it brought on a most dreadful syncope, and he himself was supposed to be in the like situation. After the usual means had been employed to recall him to life, it was agreed that his body should be dissected, to discover the cause of so sudden a death; but the supposed dead person overhearing this proposal, opened his eyes, started up, and immediately betook himself to his heels.\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Espanola, prime minister to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> II., was not so fortunate; for we read in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of Amelot de la Houllai, that he put his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a> with which he was opened in order to be embalmed. In short, almost every one knows that Vesalius, the father of anatomy, having been sent for to open a woman subject to hysterics, who was supposed to be dead, he perceived, on making the first incision, by her motion and cries, that she was still alive; that this circumstance rendered him so odious, that he was obliged to fly; and that he was so much affected by it, that he died soon after.\u2014On this occasion, we cannot forbear to add an event more recent, but no less melancholy. The abbe Prevost, so well known by his writings and the singularities of his life, was seized with a fit of the apoplexy, in the forest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHANTILLY\">Chantilly</a>, on the 23d of October 1763. His body was carried to the nearest village, and the officers of justice were proceeding to open it, when a cry which he sent forth affrightened all the assistants, and convinced the surgeon that the abbe was not dead; but it was too late to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> him, as he had already received the mortal wound.\n\nEven in old age, when life seems to have been gradually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> to a close, the appearances of death are often fallacious. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a> in Cornwall, more than 80 years of age, who had been a considerable time declining, took to her bed, and in a few days seemingly expired in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>. As she had often desired not to be buried till she had been two days dead, her request was to have been regularly complied with by her relations. All that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> her looked upon her as dead, and the report was current through the whole place; nay, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> of the town actually wrote to his friend in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Scilly that she was decease. But one of those who were paying the last kind office of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> to her remains, perceived some warmth about the Interm. middle of the back; and acquainting her friends with it, they applied a mirror to her mouth; but, after repeated trials, could not observe it in the least alarmed; her under jaw was likewise fallen, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> phrase is; and, in short, she had every appearance of a dead person. All this time she had not been stripped or dried; but the windows were opened, as is usual in the chambers of the deceased. In the evening the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> seemed to increase, and at length she was perceived to breathe.\n\nIn short, not only the ordinary signs are very uncertain, but we may say the same of the stiffness of the limbs, which may be convulsive; of the dilation of the pupil of the eye, which may proceed from the same cause; of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a>, which may equally attack some parts of a living body; and of several others. Haller, convinced of the uncertainty of all these signs, proposes a new one, which he considers as infallible. \"If the person (says he) be still in life, the mouth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> immediately shut of itself, because the contraction of the muscles of the jaw will awaken their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRRITABILITY\">irritability</a>.\" The jaw, however, may be deprived of its irritability though a man may not be dead. Life is preserved a long time in the passage of the intestines. The sign pointed out by Dr Fothergill appears to deserve more attention: \"If the air blown into the mouth (says this physician) passes freely through all the alimentary channel, it affords a strong presumption that the irritability of the internal sphincters is destroyed, and consequently that life is at an end.\" These signs, which deserve to be confirmed by new experiments, are doubtless not known to undertakers.\n\nThe difficulty of distinguishing a person apparently dead from one who is really so, has, in all countries where bodies have been interred too precipitately, rendered it necessary for the law to assist humanity. Of several regulations made on this subject, we shall quote only a few of the most recent; such as those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARRAS\">Arras</a> in 1772; of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANTUA\">Mantua</a> in 1774; of the grand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUSCANY\">Tuscany</a> in 1775; of the fenechauffee of Sivrai, in Poitou, in 1777; and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METZ\">Metz</a> in the same year. To give an idea of the rest, it will be sufficient to relate only that of Tuscany. By this edict, the grand duke forbids the precipitate interment of persons who die suddenly. He orders the magistrates of health to be informed, that physicians and surgeons may examine the body; that they may use every endeavour to recall it to life, if possible, or to discover the cause of its death; and that they shall make a report of their procedure to a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a>. On this occasion, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a> of health orders the dead not to be covered until the moment they are about to be buried, except so far as decency requires; observing always that the body be not closely confined, and that nothing may compress the jugular veins and the carotid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTERIES\">arteries</a>. He forbids people to be interred according to the ancient method; and requires that the arms and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> should be left extended, and that they should not be folded or placed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>-wise upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>. He forbids, above all, to press the jaws one against the other; or to fill the mouth and nostrils with cotton, or other stuffing. Lastly, he recommends not to cover the visage with any kind of cloth until the body is deposited in its coffin.\nWe shall conclude this article by adjoining, from Dr Hawes's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">Address</a> to the Public on this subject, a few of the cases in which this fallacious appearance of death is most likely to happen, together with the respective modes of treatment which he recommends.\n\nIn apoplectic and fainting fits, and in those arising from any violent agitation of mind, and also when opium or spirituous liquors have been taken in too great a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, there is reason to believe that the appearance of death has been frequently mistaken for the reality. In these cases, the means recommended by the Humane Society for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">Recovery</a> of Drowned Persons should be persevered in for several hours; and bleeding, which in similar circumstances has sometimes proved pernicious, should be used with great caution. (See the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DROWNING\">DROWNING</a>.) In the two latter instances it will be highly expedient, with a view of counteracting the soporific effects of opium and spirits, to convey into the stomach, by a proper tube, a solution of tartar emetic, and by various other means to excite vomiting.\n\nFrom the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of children carried off by convulsions, and the certainty arising from undoubted facts, that some who have in appearance died from that cause have been recovered; there is the greatest reason for concluding, that many, in consequence of this disease, have been prematurely numbered among the dead; and that the fond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a>, by neglecting the means of recalling life, has often been the guiltless executioner of her own offspring. To prevent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of such dreadful mistakes, no child, whose life has been apparently extinguished by convulsions, should be confined to the grave till the means of recovery above recommended in apoplexies, &c., have been tried; and, if possible, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of some skilful practitioner of medicine, who may vary them as circumstances shall require.\n\nWhen fevers arise in weak habits, or when the cure of them has been principally attempted by means of depletion, the consequent debility is often very great, and the patient sometimes sinks into a state which bears so close an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> to that of death, that there is reason to suspect it has too often deceived the bystanders, and induced them to send for the undertaker when they should have had recourse to the succours of medicine. In such cases, volatiles, eau de luce for example, should be applied to the nose, rubbed on the temples, and sprinkled often about the bed; hot flannels, moistened with a strong solution of camphorated spirit, may likewise be applied over the breast, and renewed every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an hour; and as soon as the patient is able to swallow, a teaspoonful of the strongest cordial should be given every five minutes.\n\nThe same methods may also be used with propriety in the smallpox when the pustules sink, and death apparently ensues; and likewise in any other acute diseases, when the vital functions are suspended from a similar case.","sp":317,"ep":321},{"h":"INTERMITTENT","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> INTERMITTING, Fever; such fevers as go off and soon return again, in opposition to those which are continual.

An interval in music, therefore, is properly the difference between the number of vibrations produced by one sonorous body of a certain magnitude and texture, and of those produced by another of a different magnitude and texture in the same time.\n\nIntervals are divided into consonant and dissonant. A consonant interval is that whose extremes, or whose highest and lowest sounds, when simultaneously heard, coalesce in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>, and produce an agreeable sensation called by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Kames a tertium quid. A dissonant interval, on the contrary, is that whose extremes, simultaneously heard, far from coalescing in the ear, and producing one agreeable sensation, are each of them plainly distinguished from the other, produce a grating effect upon the senses, and repel each other with an irreconcilable hostility.

As there are always regular troops in its neighbourhood, there is a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a>, a plentiful market, and more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> and business stirring than could have been expected in such a remote <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> in the neighbourhood is remarkably well cultivated; and its produce clearly shows that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> are not defective. The salmon-fishery in the Nevis is very considerable, and is let to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> fishmongers. Some branches both of the woollen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a> manufacture, are also carried on here; and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>, there is a great proportion of inland trade. But besides all this, Inverness is a port with 20 creeks dependent upon it, part on the Murray frith to the east, and part on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of the town, reaching even the fourth border of the county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAITHNESS\">Caithness</a>. Inverness has several good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>; and an academy was erected some years ago on an extensive and liberal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>. The inhabitants speak the Erse and English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> promiscuously. On an eminence near the town are the remains of a castle, where, according to some historians, the famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACBETH\">Macbeth</a> murdered Duncan his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> guest.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INVERNESS_SHIRE\">Inverness-Shire</a>,\nInverness-Shire, a county of Scotland, bounded on the north by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROSS_SHIRE\">Ross-shire</a>; on the east by the shires of Nairne, Murray, and Aberdeen; on the south, by those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERTH\">Perth</a> and Argyle; and on the west, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATLANTIC_OCEAN\">Atlantic ocean</a>. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> from north to south is above 50 miles; from east to west about 80.\u2014The northern part of this county is very mountainous and barren. In the district of Glenelg are seen the ruins of several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> circular buildings, similar to those in the Western Isles, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUTHERLAND\">Sutherland</a>, and Ross-shires; concerning the uses of which antiquarians are not agreed. In their outward appearance, they are round and tapering like glass-houses. In the heart of the wall, which is perpendicular within, there are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> galleries going quite round and connected by stairs. These ascend toward the top, which is open. They are all built of stone, without lime <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a> of any kind. They have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> opening outward, except the doors and the top; but there are several in the inside, as windows to the galleries. From Bernera <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRACKS\">barracks</a>, in this district, proceeds the military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to Inverness.\n\nThis county is nearly divided by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, so that by means of the Caledonian canal uniting Loch Ness, Loch Oich, Loch Lochy, and Lochiel or Loch Eil, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be opened between the eastern and western seas. This great undertaking is now (1807) going forward. In this tract, Fort George, Fort Augustus, and Fort William, form what is called the Chain of Forts across the island. By means of Fort George on the east, all entrance up the strait towards Inverness is prevented; Fort Augustus curbs the inhabitants midway; and Fort William is a check to any attempts in the west. Detachments are made from all these garrisons to Inverness, Bernera barracks opposite to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">Isle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SKYE\">Skye</a>, and Castle Duart in the Isle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULL\">Mull</a>.\n\nThe river Ness, upon which the capital of the shire is situated, is the outlet of the great lake called Loch Ness. This beautiful lake is 22 miles in length, and for the most part one in breadth. It is screened on the north-west by the lofty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> of Urquhart and Meall-fourvonny, and bordered with coppices of birch and oak. The adjacent hills are adorned with many extensive forests of pine; which afford shelter to the cattle, and are the retreat of flags and deer. There is much cultivation and improvements on the banks of Loch Ness; and the pasture-grounds in the neighbouring valleys are excellent.\u2014From the south, the river Fyers descends towards this lake. Over this river there is built a stupendous bridge, on two opposite rocks; the top of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> is above 100 feet from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the water. A little below the bridge is the celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">Fall</a> of Fyers, where a great body of water darts through a narrow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAP\">gap</a> between two rocks, then falls over a vast precipice into the bottom of the chasm, where the foam rises and fills the air like a great cloud of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>.\n\nLoch Oich is a narrow lake, stretching about four miles from east to west. It is adorned with some small wooded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, and is surrounded with ancient trees. Near this is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> seat of Glenary, surrounded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> woods of full grown fir, which extend <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> or ten miles along the banks of the river Gary. The waters of Loch Oich flow through Loch Ness into the eastern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>.\u2014Loch Lochy transmits its waters in an opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, this being the highest part of the vast flat tract that here stretches from sea to sea. This extensive lake is above ten miles in length, and from one to two in breadth. From the west, the waters of Loch Arrok descend into this lake. Out of it runs the river Lochy, which about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> below its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> from the lake receives the Spean, a considerable river, over which there is a magnificent bridge, built by General Wade, about two miles above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> where it falls into the Lochy. These united streams traversing the plains of Lochaber, after a course of five or six miles, fall into Loch Eil.\n\nA few miles to the south-east of Loch Lochy is Glenroy or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a>'s Vale. The north-east end of this valley opens on Loch Spey. A small river palisades along the bottom of the vale, accompanied by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> road. On the declivity of the mountains, about a mile from the river, on either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, are seen several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> roads of great antiquity. On the north-west side, five of these roads run parallel and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> by each other. On the opposite side are three other roads exactly similar. These roads are 30 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, all perfectly horizontal, and extend eight or nine miles in length. Their delineation or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> has baffled the conjectures of antiquaries.\u2014Not far from Fort Augustus soars the pointed summit of Ben Nevis, which is esteemed the highest mountain in Britain, rising more than 4300 feet above the level of the sea.\u2014In the districts of Moydart, Arisaig, Morer, and Knoydart, there are numerous bays and creeks, along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, many of which might be excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> stations.\n\nThe southern part of this county is very mountainous, and is supposed to be the most elevated ground in Scotland. From its numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a> many streams descend toward both seas. In the extensive district called Badenoch lies Loch Spey, the source of the great river Spey, which proceeding eastward with an increasing stream, enters the shire of Murray at Rothesmurchus, after having expanded into a fine lake. Not far from this is seen the lofty top of Cairngorm; a mountain celebrated for its beautiful rock-crystals of various tints. These are much esteemed by lapidaries; and some of them, having the lustre of fine gems, bring a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> price. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMESTONE\">Limestone</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>-ore, and some traces of different minerals, are found in the county, but no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> have yet been worked with much success. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> and lakes afford abundance of salmon and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TROUT\">trout</a>. The extensive plains which surround the lakes are in general fertile; and the high grounds feed many sheep and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> cattle, the rearing and selling of which forms the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> trade of the inhabitants.\u2014By the present spirited exertions of the gentlemen in this populous county, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> and the industry of the inhabitants have of late been greatly increased; and to facilitate the communication with other parts, application has been made to parliament for leave to levy a tax on the proprietors of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> for improving the roads and erecting bridges in this extensive shire. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONALTY\">commonalty</a> in the high parts of the county and on the western shore speak Gaelic; but the people of fashion in Inverness and its vicinity use the English language, and pronounce it with remarkable propriety.\nThe following is a view of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of the different parishes in the county at two different periods.*\n\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">Parish</a>     | Population in 1755 | Population in 1790\u20141798 |\n|------------|--------------------|-------------------------|\n| Abernethy  | 1670               | 1769                    |\n| Alvie      | 1021               | 1011                    |\n| Arderfer   | 428                | 1298                    |\n| Bolekine   | 1961               | 1741                    |\n| Conveth or Kiltarlity | 1964 | 2495                    |\n| Cromdale   | 3063               | 3000                    |\n| Croy       | 1901               | 1552                    |\n| Daviot     | 2176               | 1697                    |\n| Durris     | 1520               | 1365                    |\n| Glenelg    | 1816               | 2746                    |\n| Inverness  | 9730               | 10,527                  |\n| Kilmanivaig| 2995               | 2400                    |\n| Kilmaille  | 3093               | 4031                    |\n| Kilmoreck  | 2830               | 2318                    |\n| Kingussie  | 1900               | 1083                    |\n| Kirkhill   | 1360               | 1570                    |\n| Laggan    | 1460               | 1512                    |\n| Moy        | 1693               | 1813                    |\n| Petty      | 1643               | 1518                    |\n| Urquhart   | 1943               | 2355                    |\n\nContinental part: 46,167\n\n| Islands     | Population         |\n|-------------|--------------------|\n| Bracadale   | 1907               |\n| Diurinish   | 2368               |\n| Kilmuir     | 1572               |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTREE\">Portree</a>     | 1385               |\n| Sleat       | 1250               |\n| Snizort     | 1627               |\n| Strath      | 943                |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRY\">Barry</a>       | 1150               |\n| South Uist  | 2209               |\n| North Uist  | 1909               |\n| Harris      | 1969               |\n\nTotal islands: 18,489\n\nTotal: 65,636\n\nIncrease: 9323","sp":324,"ep":326},{"h":"INVERSE","t":"is applied to a manner of working the rule of three.

All that Mr Pennant could\ndiscover here were only certain slight remains, built\nin a ridged form and arched within, but the inscrip-\ntions lost.

The place is in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>-\nner filled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>-stones, but so overgrown with\nweeds, that few or none are at present to be seen, far\nless any inscriptions read. Here also stands the chapel\nof St Oran, the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> begun by Columba, which\nthe evil spirits would not suffer to stand till some hu-\nman victim was buried alive; for which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> Oran\noffered himself, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> grave-stone is near the\ndoor. In this chapel are tombs of several chiefs, &c.\nA little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-west of the door is the pedestal of a\ncros: on it are certain stones that seem to have been\nthe supports of a tomb. Numbers who visit this island\nthink it incumbent on them to turn each of these\nthrice round, according to the course of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>.\nThey are called *Glacha-braith,* for it is thought that the\nbraith, or end of the world, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not arrive till the pe-\ndaffal on which they stand is worn through. Origi-\nnally (says Mr Sacheverel) here were three noble globes\nof <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> marble, placed on three stone bases, and these\nwere turned round; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYNOD\">synod</a> ordered them and\n60 croses to be thrown into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. The present\nstones are probably substituted in place of these globes.\nThe precinct of these tombs was held sacred, and en-\njoyed the privileges of a girth or sanctuary. These\nplaces of retreat were by the ancient Scotch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, not\nto shelter indiscriminately every offender, as was the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> in more bigoted times in Catholic countries; for\nhere all atrocious criminals were excluded; and only\nthe unfortunate delinquent, or the penitent sinner,\nwas shielded from the instant stroke of rigorous ju-\nstice. A little to the north of this inclosure stands\nthe cathedral, built in form of a cros, 115 feet long\nby 23, the transept 70 feet: the pillars of the choir\nhave their capitals <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with scripture and other\nhistories; and near the altar are the tombs of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">ab</a>-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOTS\">bots</a> and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a>. A fragment remains of the altar-\nstone of white marble veined with gray. This\nchurch is ascribed to Maldwin in the 7th century; but\nthe present structure is far too magnificent for that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>.\nMost of the walls are built of red <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a> from the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUN\">Nun</a>'s island in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>. Two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> walls of a cov-\nered way about 12 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> and 10 wide, reach from\nthe south-east corner to the sea. In the church-yard is\na fine cros of a single piece of red granite, 14 feet high,\n22 inches broad, and 10 inches thick. Near the south-\neast end is Mary's chapel. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONASTERY\">monastery</a> is behind\nthe chapel; of which only a piece of the cloisters re-\nmains, and some sacred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> stones in a corner, on\nwhich contracts and alliances were made and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a>\nsworn. East of it was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABBOT\">abbot</a>'s gardens and of-\nfices. North of this was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of the bishop of\nthe isles after the separation of Man from them. This\nsee was endowed with 13 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>; several of which were\nfrequently taken away by the chieftains. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of\nSoder, which some explained Soter, Zaling, \"the name\nof Christ, or Soder, an imaginary town,\" is really de-\nrived from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a> into the north-\nern islands or Norderseys (i.e. all to the north of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">Ad</a>-\nnamurchan point), and the Southern or Sudereys;\nwhich last being the most important, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of Man\nretained both titles.\n\nOther ruins of monastic buildings and offices may be\ntraced, as well as some druidical sepulchral remains.\nSeveral abbeys were derived from this, which with the\nisland was governed by an abbot-prebiter, who had\nrule even over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a>. The place where Columba\nlanded is a pebbly beach, where a heap of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> re-\nprefents the form of his ship. Near it is a hill with a\ncircle of stones called *Cnoc-nar aingeal,* or \"the hill of\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGELS\">angels</a>,\" with whom the saint held conference; and on\nMichaelmas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> the inhabitants coursed their horses\nround it, a remain of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of bringing them there\nto be blest. In former times, this island was the\nplace where the archives of Scotland and many valuable\nold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MANUSCRIPTS\">manuscripts</a> were kept. Of these most are suppo-\nsed to have been destroyed by the Reformation; but\nmany, it is said, were carried to the Scotch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a> at\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUAY\">Douay</a> in France, and it is hoped some of them may\nstill be recovered.

After they had enjoyed for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> their freedom and independence, they were made tributary to the power of Lydia by Croesus.

Here are also several almshouses, three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a>, and a convenient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEY\">key</a> and customhouse. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of Charles II.'s charter, the town is governed by two bailiffs, a recorder, 12 portmen, of whom the bailiffs are two, a town-clerk, two coroners, and 24 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>-council. The bailiffs and 4 of the portmen are justices of the peace. The town enjoys a great many privileges, as palling fines and recoveries, trying criminals, and even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> and capital causes among themselves, settling the affix of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, wine, and beer. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a> freeman is obliged to serve on juries out of the town, or bear any office for the king, except that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a>, or to pay tolls or duties in any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. They have an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRALTY\">admiralty</a> jurisdiction beyond Harwich on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSEX\">Essex</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, and on both sides the Suffolk coast, by which they are entitled to all goods <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> on shore. The bailiffs even hold an admiralty-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> beyond Landguard-fort. By a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> in King Edward III.'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, it appears that the town had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>-duties for all goods coming into Harwich-haven. They claim a right also to all waifs and strays, &c. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> of the town are chiefly woollen and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> cloth. It has still a considerable foreign trade.\n\nThe tide rises pretty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, and brings great ships irrefleble, within a small distance of the town. They export a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of corn to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, and sometimes to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>. Formerly, they had a great trade in shipbuilding; but that having declined, they now send great quantities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> to the king's yard at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHATHAM\">Chatham</a>. It has several great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAIRS\">fairs</a> for cattle, cheese, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>; and is admirably situated for the trade to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENLAND\">Greenland</a>, because the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> that carries them out of the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> carry them to Greenland. It is worth remarking, that it is one of the best places in England for persons in narrow circumstances, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> rent being easy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> cheap and plentiful, the passage by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> to London, &c., convenient, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of the place good.

The Irish historians pretend to very great antiquity. According to them, the island was first inhabited about 322 years after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>. At Origin of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> Partholansus the son of Scara landed in Mun-the Irish after the 14th of May with 1000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, and some according women, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>. This voyage he had undertaken on account of his having killed his father and mother in his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. The same historians inform us, that a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a> broke out in Ireland during the reign of Partholansus, which had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> existence when he came into the island, with many other particulars not worth mentioning; but the most surprising circumstance is, that about 300 years after the arrival of this Grecian colony, all of them perished by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>, not a single person remaining to tell the fate of the rest; in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, it is wonderful how the catastrophe should have been known.\n\nAfter the extinction of this first colony, Ireland remained a perfect wilderness for 30 years; when another colony arrived from the east, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of one Nemedius. He set sail from the Euxine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> with 30 transports, each manned with 40 heroes; and\nIreland, at last arrived on the coasts of Ireland, after a very tedious and strange <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>. During his reign also many lakes were formed in the country, which had no existence before; the most material circumstance, however, was an unsuccessful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> in which he was engaged with some African pirates, who in the end enslaved his people. The victors proved such inapplicable tyrants, that the Irish found themselves under a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of quitting the island altogether. They embarked on board a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> of 1150 ships, under the command of three grandsons of Nemedius, viz., Simon Breac, To Chath, and Briatan Maoil. The first returned to Greece, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> sailed to the northern parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, and the third landed in the north of Scotland, and from him the island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> is said to have taken its name, and the Welsh their origin.\n\nAbout 216 years after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Nemedius, the descendants of Simon Breac returned from Greece into Ireland. They were conducted by five princes of great reputation, who divided the island into five kingdoms, nearly equal in size. These kingdoms were called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUNSTER\">Munster</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEINSTER\">Leinster</a>, Connacht, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEATH\">Meath</a>, and Ulster; and the subjects of these kings are called by the Irish historians Firbolgs.\n\nThe Firbolgs were in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time expelled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> totally subdued, after the loss of 100,000 men in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, by the Tuath de Dananns, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> of necromancers, who came from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTICA\">Attica</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOEOTIA\">Boeotia</a>, and Achaia, into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>, from Denmark to Scotland, and from Scotland to Ireland. These necromancers were so completely skilled in their art, that they could even restore the dead to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, and bring again into the field those warriors who had been slain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> before. They had also some curiosities which possessed a wonderful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>. These were a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, a spear, a cauldron, and a marble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a>; on which last were crowned first the kings of Ireland, and afterwards those of Scotland. But neither the powerful virtues of these Danish curiosities, nor the more powerful spells of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGIC\">magic</a> art, were able to preserve the Tuath de Dananns from being subdued by the Gadelians when they invaded Ireland.\n\nThe Gadelians were descended from one Gathelus, from whom they derived their name. He was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, and intimately acquainted with Moses the Jewish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a>. His mother was Scotia, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARAOH\">Pharaoh</a>, by Niul the son of a Scythian monarch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> with Nimrod. The Gadelians, called also Scots, from Scotia above-mentioned, conquered Ireland about 1300 B.C., under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBER\">Heber</a> and Heremon, two sons of Milesius <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, from whom were descended all the kings of Ireland <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the English conquest, and who are therefore styled by the Irish historians, princes of the Milesian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>.\n\nFrom this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> the Irish historians trace a gradual refinement of their countrymen from a state of the grossest barbarity, until a monarch, named Ollam Fodla, established a regular form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, erected a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> seminary of learning, and instituted the Fer, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIENNIAL\">triennial</a> convention of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> kings, priests, and poets, at Feamor or Tarah in Meath, for the establishment of laws and regulation of government. But whatever were the institutions of this monarch, it is acknowledged that they proved insufficient to withstand the wildness and disorder of the times. To Kinnab, one of his successors, the annalists give the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of reviving them, besides that of regulating Ulster, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>, and adorning it with a stately <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> at Eamannia near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMAGH\">Armagh</a>. His immediate successor, called Hugony, is still more celebrated for advancing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> of reformation. It seems, that from the earliest origin of the Irish nation, the island had been divided into the five provincial kingdoms above-mentioned, and four of these had been subject to the fifth, who was nominal monarch of the whole island. These four, however, proved such obstinate disturbers of the peace, that Hugony, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> their power, parcelled out the country into 25 dynasties, binding them by oath to accept no other monarch but one of his own family. This precaution proved ineffectual. Hugony himself died a violent death, and all his successors for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of ages were assassinated, scarcely with one exception.\n\nAbout 100 B.C. the pentarchal government was restored, and is said to have been succeeded by a considerable revolution in politics. The Irish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARDS\">bards</a> had for many ages dispensed the laws, and the whole nation submitted to their decisions; but as their laws were exceedingly obscure, and could be interpreted only by themselves, they took occasion from thence to oppress the people, until at last they were in danger of being totally exterminated by a general insurrection. In this emergency they fled to Convocar-Mac-Nefia, the reigning monarch, who promised them his protection in case they reformed; but at the same time, in order to quiet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> complaints of his people, he employed the most eminent among them to compile an intelligible, equitable, and distinct, body of laws, which were received with the greatest joy, and dignified with the name of celestial decrees. These decisions seem to have produced but very little reformation among the people in general. We are now presented with a new series of barbarities, murders, factions, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a>; and in this disordered situation of affairs it was, according to the Irish historians, that the chieftain mentioned by Tacitus addressed himself to Agricola, and encouraged him to make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> on Ireland. This scheme happened not to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> the views of the Roman general at that time, and therefore was not adopted; and so confident are these historians of the strength of their country even in its then disturbed state, that they treat the notion of its being subdued by a Roman legion and some auxiliaries (the force proposed to Agricola) as utterly extravagant; acquainting us at the same time, that the Irish were so far from dreading a Roman invasion, that they failed to the affluence of the Piets, and having made a successful incursion into South Britain, returned home with a considerable booty.\n\nIn the same state of barbarity and confusion the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of Ireland <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till the introduction of Christianity by St Patrick, about the middle of the fifth century. This missionary, according to the adversaries of the Irish antiquity, first introduced letters into Ireland, and thus laid the foundations of a future civilization. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> for that antiquity maintain, that the Irish had the knowledge of letters, and had made considerable progress in the arts, before the time of St Patrick: though they allow,\nthat he introduced the Roman character, in which his copies of the Scripture and liturgies were written. To enter into the dispute would be contrary to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>. It is sufficient to observe, that, excepting by some of the Irish themselves, the history already given is generally reckoned entirely fabulous, and thought to have been invented after the introduction of Christianity. An origin of the Irish nation has been found out much nearer than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, Greece, or Egypt; namely, the island of Britain, from whence it is now thought that Ireland was first peopled. A dispute hath arisen concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> from whence the first emigrants from Britain set sail for Ireland. The honour of being the mother-country of the Irish hath been disputed between the North and South Britons. Mr Macpherson has argued strenuously for the former, and Mr Whitaker for the latter. For an account of their dispute, however, we must refer to the works of these gentlemen. Mr Whitaker claims the victory, and challenges himself the honour of being the first who clearly and truly demonstrated the origin of the Irish.\n\nThe name of Ireland, according to Mr Whitaker, is obviously derived from the word *Iar* or *Eir*, which in the Celtic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> signifies \"west.\" This word was sometimes pronounced *Iver*, and *Hiver*; whence the names of *<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRIS\">Iris</a>*, *Ierna*, *Juverna*, *Iverna*, *Hibernia*, and *Ireland*; by all of which it hath at some time or other been known.\n\nAbout 350 B.C., according to the same author, the Belgae crossed the channel, invaded Britain, and seized the whole extended line of the southern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVONSHIRE\">Devonshire</a>. Numbers of the former inhabitants, who had gradually retired before the enemy, were obliged at last to take shipping on the western coast of England, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> over into the uninhabited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of Ireland. These were afterwards joined by another body of Britons driven out by the Belgae under Divitius, about 100 B.C. For two centuries and a half afterwards, these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> were continually reinforced with fresh swarms from Britain; as the populousness of this island, and the vicinity of that, invited them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in the one, or the bloody and successive wars in Britain during this period naturally induced them to relinquish the other: and the whole circuit of Ireland appears to have been completely peopled about 150 years after Christ: and as the inhabitants had all fled equally from the dominion of the Belgae, or for some other cause left their native country, they were distinguished among the Britons by one general and very apposite name, viz. that of *Scutes* or *Scots*, \"the wanderers, or refugees.\"\n\nMr Whitaker also informs us, \"that in the times of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> Ireland was inhabited by 18 tribes; by one upon the northern and three on the southern shore, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> upon the western, six on the eastern, and one in the centre.\n\n\"Along the eastern coast, and the Vergilian or internal ocean, were ranged the Dumnii, the Voluntii, and the Eblani, the Caucii, the Menapii, and the Coriondii. The first inhabited a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the two counties of Antrim and Down, extending from Fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, the most northerly extremity of the island, to Ifannum Promontorium, or the point of Ardglass haven, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of Down; and, having the Logia or Lagan, which falls into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARRICKFERGUS\">Carrickfergus</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>, within their possessions, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUNUM\">Dunum</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol8.html#article-DOWNPATRICK\">Downpatrick</a> for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>. The Voluntii possessed the coast from the point of that haven to the river Buvinda or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOYNE\">Boyne</a>, the remainder of Down, the breadth of Armagh, and all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUTH\">Louth</a>; having the Vindurus or Carlingford river in their dominions, and the town of Laberus near the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVA\">Deva</a> (Atherden in the county of Louth) for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>. And the Eblani reached from the Boyne to the Lebusius, Leuvi, or Liffy; residing in East Meath, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a> county which is to the north of this river; and acknowledging <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIOLANUM\">Mediolanum</a>, Eblana, or Dublin, for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> town. The Caucii spread from the Liffy to the Letrim, the Oboca of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>; had the rest of Dublin county, and such parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WICKLOW\">Wicklow</a> as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in the north of the latter; and owned Dunum or Rath-Downe for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a>. The Menapii occupied the coast betwixt the Letrim and Cancarne-point, all the rest of Wicklow, and all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEXFORD\">Wexford</a> to the point; their chief town, Menapia, being placed upon and to the east of Modona, Slanus, or Slane. And the Coriondii inhabited at the back of the Caucii and Menapii, to the west of the Slane and Liffy, and in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KILDARE\">Kildare</a> and all Catherlogh; being limited by the Boyne and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARROW\">Barrow</a> on the west, the Eblani on the north, and the Brigantes on the south.\n\n\"Upon the southern shore and along the verge of the Cantabrian ocean, lay the Brigantes, the Vodiea, and the Ibernii. The first owned the rest of Wexford and all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATERFORD\">Waterford</a>: extending to the Blackwater, Avonmore, or Dabrona, on the fourth-west; having the great mouth of the Barrow with their territories, and Brigantia, Waterford, or some town near it, for their chief city; and giving name of Brigas to the Suir or Swire, their liminary stream on the north, and the appellation of Bergie to their own part of the county of Wexford. The Vodiea possessed the shire of Corke from the Blackwater to the Ban, the river of Kinfaile, and the Dobonia or Dubana of the ancients; and affixed the name of Vodium Promontorium to the point of Balycotton island. And the Ibernii inhabited the remainder of Corke, and all that part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KERRY\">Kerry</a> which lies to the fourth-east of Dingle found; having Rufina or Ibaune for their capital, the Promontorium Aufrinum or Milen-Head about the middle of their dominions, and the river Ibermus or Dingle found for their northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a>; and leaving their names to the three divisions of Ibaune, Beare, and Iveragh.\n\n\"Upon the western shore of the island, and along the Great Britannic or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATLANTIC_OCEAN\">Atlantic ocean</a>, were the Lucanii or Lucenii, the Velaborii, and the Cangani, the Aterii, the Nagnatae, the Hardinii, and Venenicii. The Lucanii inhabited the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> that lies along the river Ibermus or Dingle found, and perhaps some adjoining parts of Kerry. The Velaborii ranged along the small remainder of the latter, and over the whole of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIMERICK\">Limerick</a> to the Senus or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHANNON\">Shannon</a>; having the Durus or Calheen flowing through their dominions, and Regia, Limerick or some town near it, for their metropolis. And the latter was probably that city near Limerick, the site of which is still famous, and retains the appellation of Cathair, or the fortress; and where the remains of streets, and other marks of a town, may yet be traced. The Cangani lived in the county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLARE\">Clare</a>:\nClare: Macolicum near the Shannon, perhaps Feakle or Melic, being their principal town; a headland in the bay of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALWAY\">Galway</a>, near Glaniny, being denominated Benjannum Promontorium; and the adjoining isles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARRAN\">Arran</a> called Infulae Cangane. The Auterii were settled in the county of Galway; winding along the deep recesses of the Sinus Auboa or bay of Galway; stretching towards the north as far as the Libinius, or the river that bounds the thire in that part; and possesting the small portion of Mayo which lies to the south of it. And these were subject to Auterium, anciently Aterith, and now Athenree; and have left their name to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of Athenree. The Nagnatae occupied the rest of the large county of Mayo, all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLIGO\">Sligo</a> and all Roscommon, all Letrim as far as Logh Allin on the south-east, and all Fermanagh, to Ballyhannon and Logh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERNE\">Erne</a>; being bounded by the Rhebus or river of Ballyhannon, and the lake Rhebus or Logh Erne; having a deep bay, called Magnus Sinus, that curves along Mayo, Sligo, and Letrim counties; and acknowledging Nagnat, Necmaht, or Alnecmaht, the town of the Nagnatae, for their capital. And the Hardini and Venicii were confederated together under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of the Venician Nation, extended from Ballyhannon to the North-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a>, and possessed all Donnegalle, except the two whole divisions of Raphoe and Enis-Owen, and the eastern part of Killmacrenen. The Venicii lay along the immediate margin of the shore, giving name to the Promontorium Venicum or Cape <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">Horn</a>, and to the Insula Venicia or North Arran island. And their metropolis Rheba was seated upon the lake Rhebus, and in the country of the Hardini on the south-east.\n\nUpon the northern shore and along the margin of the Deucalidonian ocean, were only the Robogdii; inhabiting the rest of Donnegalle, all Derry, and all Antrim to the Fair-Head, and the Damii; and giving their own name to the former and the division of Raphoe. And they had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a> Vidua or Shipharbour, Arigta or Logh Swilly, Darabouna or Logh Foile, and Banna, or Ban, in their territories; and acknowledged Robogdium, Robog, or Raphoe, for their chief city.\n\nThe central regions of the island, all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRONE\">Tyrone</a>, the remainder of Fermanagh and Letrim, all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONAGHAN\">Monaghan</a>, and the rest of Armagh; all Cavan, all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONGFORD\">Longford</a>, and all West-Meath; all the King's and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN_S_COUNTY\"><a class=\"xref</a>\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a>'s county, all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KILKENNY\">Kilkenny</a>, and all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIPPERARY\">Tipperary</a>; were planted by the Scoti. The Shannon, Logh Allin, and Logh Erne, were their great boundaries on the west; the Barrow, Boyne, and Logh Neagh, on the east; the Swire and Blackwater on the south; and a chain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> on the north. And the two greatest of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> were Rheba, a city seated, like the Rheba of the Venicians, upon the lake and river Rhebus, but on a different part of them, and somewhere in the north of Cavan; and Ibernia, a town placed a little to the east of the Shannon, and somewheres in the county of Tipperary.\"\n\nBut whether we are to receive as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> the accounts given by Mr Whitaker, those of the Irish annalists, or any other, it is certain that, till little more than a century ago, Ireland was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of confusion and slaughter. The Irish historians acknowledge this, as we have already seen. Very few of their monarchs escaped a violent death. The histories of their kings indeed amount to no more than this, viz. that they began to reign in such a year, reigned a certain number of years, and were slain in battle by the valiant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> who succeeded to the throne. The introduction of Christianity seems to have mended the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> very little, or rather not at all. The same wars between the chiefs continued; and the same murders and treacheries took place among the inhabitants, till they were invaded by the Danes or Normans, about the end of the eighth century. At this time, we are told, the Danes that the monarchical power was weak, by reason of the factious and assuming disposition of the inferior dynasties; but that the evils of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> had considerably subsided by the respect paid to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and learning. The first invasions of the Danes were made in small parties for the sake of plunder, and were repelled by the chieftain whose dominions were invaded. Other parties appeared in different parts of the island, and terrified the inhabitants by the havoc they committed. These were in like manner put to flight, but never failed to return in a short time; and in this manner was Ireland harassed for the space of 20 years, before the inhabitants thought of putting an end to their intestine contentions, and uniting against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> enemy. The northern pirates, either by force or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a>, gradually obtained some small settlements on the island; till at length Turgesius, or Turgesius, a warlike Norwegian, landed with a powerful armament in the year 815. He divided his fleet and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, in order to strike terror in different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>. His followers plundered, burned, and massacred, without mercy, and persecuted the clergy in a dreadful manner on account of their religion. The Danes already settled in Ireland, flocked to the standard of Turgesius, who thus was enabled to seat himself in Armagh, from which he expelled the clergy, and seized their lands. The Irish, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, were infatuated by their private quarrels; till at last, after some ill-conducted and unsuccessful efforts, they sunk into a state of abject submission, and Turgesius was proclaimed monarch of the whole island in 845.\n\nThe new king proved such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>, that he soon became intolerable. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> was formed against him; and he was seized by Melachline prince of Meath, in a time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> peace. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> insurrection ensued; the Danes were massacred or dispersed; their leader condemned to death for his cruelties, and drowned in a lake. The foreigners, however, were not exterminated, but the remains of them were allowed to continue on the island as subjects or tributaries to some particular chieftains. A new colony soon arrived, but under pretence of peaceable intentions, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of enriching the country by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>. The Irish, through an infatuated policy, suffered them to become masters of Dublin, Limerick, Waterford, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> places, which they enlarged and fortified with such works as had till then been unknown in Ireland. The Danes did not fail to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of every opportunity of enlarging their territories, and new wars quickly ensued. The Irish were sometimes victorious, and sometimes not; but were never able to drive out their enemies, so that they continued to be a very distinguished and powerful sept, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a>, in Ireland. The wars with the Danes were no sooner\nIreland at an end, than the natives, as usual, turned their arms against each other. The country was harassed by the competitions of the chiefs; laws and religion lost their influence, and the most horrid licentiousness and immorality prevailed. Thus the whole island seemed ready to become a prey to the first invader, when an attempt was made upon it by Magnus king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a>. This attempt miscarried through his own rashness; for, having landed without opposition, he advanced into the country without the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>. The consequence of this was, that he was surrounded and cut to pieces with all his followers. His death, however, proved of little benefit to Ireland; the same disorders which had gradually reduced the kingdom to a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> weakness, still continued to operate, and to facilitate the success of the English invasion, which happened in the reign of Henry II.\n\nThe first motives which induced this monarch to think of an expedition against Ireland are not well known. It was supposed that he had been provoked by some affront which the Irish princes had given to the French; but, whatever might be in this, it is certain that the design was conceived soon after he ascended the throne; and his flatterers soon furnished him with sufficient reasons for considering the Irish as his subjects. It was affirmed that they had originally possessed themselves of their country by permission of Gurguntius a British king; and that, as descendants of the Britons, they were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> and rightful subjects of the English monarch. It was also suggested, that the renowned King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARTHUR\">Arthur</a>, Egfred the Northumbrian prince, and Edgar one of the Saxon kings of England, had all led their armies into Ireland, and there made valuable acquisitions, which their successor was in honour bound to recover and maintain. All these suggestions, however, or whatever else had occurred to himself, seemed yet insufficient to Henry; and therefore he took the most effectual method to injure his reputation, namely, by an application to the pope. To him he represented, that the inhabitants of Ireland were sunk into the most wretched state of corruption, both with regard to morals and religion; that Henry, zealous for the honour and enlargement of God's kingdom, had conceived the pious design of erecting it in this unhappy country; was ready to devote himself and all his powers to this meritorious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>; implored the benediction of the pontiff; and requested his permission and authority to enter Ireland to reduce the disobedient and corrupt, to eradicate all sin and wickedness, to instruct the ignorant, and spread the blest influence of the gospel in all its purity and perfection; promising at the same time to pay a yearly tribute to St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> from the land thus to be reduced to his obedience, and to the holy see. Adrian, the reigning pope, rejoiced at this application which tended so much to the advancement of his own power. A bull was therefore immediately formed, conformable to the most sanguine wishes of Henry, which was sent to England without delay, together with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a>, the token of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTITURE\">investiture</a> as rightful sovereign of Ireland. But whatever inclination the king of England or the pope might at this time (A.D. 1156) have for the subjection of Ireland, the fluctuation of the English affairs obliged him to defer it for some time.\n\nThe state of Ireland, as we have already observed, was at this time extremely favourable for an invasion. The monarch enjoyed little more than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TITULAR\">titular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> being harassed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a>, and opposed by powerful rivals. A number of chieftains who assumed the title that time and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of royalty, paid a precarious tribute to their superior, and united, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they were disposed to unite, with him, rather as his allies than his subjects. In Ulster, the family of the northern Hi-Nial, as it was called, exercised a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> jurisdiction over the counties now called Tyrone, Derry, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DONEGAL\">Donegal</a>. They also claimed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> of supremacy over the lords of Fermanagh, Antrim, and Argial, which included the counties of Armagh, Monaghan, Louth, and some adjacent districts; while Dunleve, prince of Uladh (now Down), disputed the superiority of this family, and affected an independent state. In Munster reigned the descendants of Brien, a famous sovereign of former times, impatient to recover the honours of their family; but at last, being confined by powerful rivals to the territory of North Munster, they were obliged to leave the family of Mac Arthy foreseigns of Desmond, the southern division. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONNAUGHT\">Connaught</a>, the princes known by the name of O'Connor were acknowledged foreseigns of the eastern territory. Ternan O'Ruare, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> and restless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> chief, had the supremacy in Breffney, containing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEITRIM\">Leitrim</a>, and some adjacent districts. Meath, or the southern Hi-Nial, was subject to the family of Clan-Colman, Murchard O'Malachlyn, and his successors. Leinster, divided into several principalities, was subject to Dermot, a fierce, haughty, and oppressive tyrant. His father had governed with great cruelty. Seventeen of his vassal lords had been either put to death, or had their eyes put out, by his order in one year; and Dermot seemed to inherit too great a portion of the same temper. His stature and bodily strength made him admired by the inferior orders of his subjects; and these he was careful to protect and favour. His donations and endowments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> houses recommended him to the clergy; but his tributary chieftains felt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> and tyranny, and to them his government was extremely odious.\n\nThe chief competitors for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> of monarch of Ireland, in the mean time, were, the heirs of the two houses of O'Connor, and the northern Hi-Nial. Torlogh O'Connor was in possession; but he was not generally recognized, and was opposed by his rival O'Lochlan; notwithstanding which, he maintained his dignity with magnificence and vigour, till a decisive victory gained by him over O'Brien raised O'Lochlan's jealousy to such, that he obliged him in a convention of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> to allow him the sovereignty of the northern division. In consequence of this partition, it was resolved to transfer the territory of O'Ruarc to a person more inclined to the interests of the two sovereigns. An expedition was accordingly undertaken; O'Ruarc was surprised, defeated, and driven from his dominions. Dermot, who had conceived an unlawful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for Dervorghal, the wife of O'Ruarc, took the opportunity of her husband's distresses to carry her off in triumph. O'Ruarc conceived the most implacable resentment against Dermot; and therefore applying himself to Torlogh, promised an inviolable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>; and prevailed on him not only to reinstate him\nhim in his possessions, but to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> the insult offered by Dermod, and to restore his wife. By means of such a powerful ally, O'Ruarc found frequent opportunities of harassing his antagonist till the death of Torlogh, which happened in 1156, upon which O'Lochlain succeeded to the sovereignty. Dermod was the first to acknowledge the authority of this new sovereign, by whose means he hoped to be able to revenge himself on O'Ruarc. He soon found, however, that he had acted too precipitately. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a>, having treacherously feigned and put out the eyes of Dan's prince of Down, the neighbouring chieftains took arms, in order to secure themselves from his barbarity. O'Lochlain was defeated and killed; upon which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a> devolved on Roderic the son of the late Torlogh O'Connor.\n\nThe new prince had acquired the reputation of valour, and was determined to establish this reputation by some remarkable exploit in the beginning of his reign. Having therefore engaged in his service the Oldmen, or descendants of the Danes, he marched against Dermod as the chief partisan of his fallen rival. The king of Leinster was seized with the utmost consternation; and in despair set fire to his own town of Ferns, lest the enemy should have the satisfaction of spoiling it. Roderic still advanced, attended by O'Ruarc, Dermod's implacable enemy, and soon overran the whole province. All the inferior lords at once acknowledged Roderic's authority. Dermod was deposed, as a man utterly unworthy of his station; another of his family was raised to the throne; and the unfortunate prince, finding it impossible to stay with safety in Ireland, embarked with 60 of his followers for England, and soon arrived at the port of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a>, with a design to solicit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> from King Henry.\n\nIn England, Dermod's character was unknown, and he was regarded as an injured prince driven from his throne by an injurious confederacy. The clergy received him as the benefactor of their order, and entertained him in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONASTERY\">monastery</a> of Augustines with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a>. Having learned that Henry was then in Aquitain, he immediately went thither, and in a very abject manner implored his assistance, promising to acknowledge him as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEGE\">liege</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a>, and to hold his dominions, which he was thus confident of regaining, in vassalage to Henry and his heirs.\n\nThough nothing could be more flattering to the ambition of the king of England than this servile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, yet the situation of his own affairs rendered it impossible for him at that time to reap from it any of the advantages with which it flattered him. He therefore dismissed the Irish prince with large presents, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> of credence addressed to all his subjects: notifying his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> and protection granted to the king of Leinster; and declaring, that whosoever within his dominions should be disposed to aid the unfortunate prince in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> of his kingdom, might be assured of his free licence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> favour.\n\nDermod returned to England highly pleased with the reception he had met with; but notwithstanding the king's letter, none of the English seemed to be disposed to try their fortunes in Ireland. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> elapsed without any prospect of succours, so that Dermod began to despair. At last, however, he prevailed, with great promises, Richard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEPSTOW\">Chepstow</a>, or, as it was formerly called, Strigul, a nobleman of considerable influence in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, but of broken fortune, to assist him with a considerable force to be transported next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> into Ireland. Overjoyed at this first instance of success, he advanced into South Wales, where, by venturers the influence of the bishop of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>'s, he procured to follow many other friends. Robert Fitz-Stephen, a brave land and experienced officer, covenanted with him to engage in his service with all his followers, and Maurice Fitz-Gerald his maternal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a>; while Dermod, on his part, promised to cede to the two principal leaders, Fitz-Stephen and Fitz-Gerald, the entire dominion of the town of Wexford, with a large adjoining territory, as soon as by their assistance he should be reinstated in his rights.\n\nThe Irish prince having now accomplished his purpose, set sail for Ireland in the winter of 1169, and recovered a small part of his dominions even before the arrival of his new allies; but being attacked with a superior force by his old enemies Roderic and O'Ruarc, he found himself obliged to feign submission till the English allies came to his assistance. The expected succours arrived in the month of May 1170, in a creek called the Bann, near the city of Wexford. Robert Fitz-Stephen commanded 35 knights, 60 men in armour, and 300 archers. With these came Harvey of Mountmorris, nephew to Earl Richard. He had no military force along with him; but came solely with a view of discovering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the country, and reporting it to his uncle. Maurice of Pendergait commanded 10 knights and 200 archers; and thus the English force, which was to contend with the whole strength of Ireland, amounted to no more than 600 men.\n\nTrifling as this assistance may seem, it nevertheless changed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of affairs almost instantaneously. Numbers of Dermod's subjects who had abandoned him in his distress, now flocked to his standard. Wexford was immediately attacked, and surrendered in a few days; Fitz-Stephen and Fitz-Gerald were jointly invested with the lordship of this city and its domain; and Harvey of Mountmorris was declared lord of two considerable districts on the coast. After three or four weeks spent in feasting and rejoicing, a new expedition was undertaken against the prince of Offory (a district of Leinster), who had not only revolted from Dermod, but put out the eyes of one of his sons, and that with such cruelty, that the unhappy youth expired under the operation. The allied army was now increased to 3000 men, who were opposed by the prince of Offory at the head of 5000, strongly entrenched among woods and morasses. By the superior conduct of the English troops, however, the Irish were decoyed from their advantageous situation, and thus were entirely defeated. The English were for keeping the field till they had totally reduced their enemies: but Dermod, accustomed only to ravage and plunder, contented himself with destroying the country; and a sudden reverse of fortune seemed ready to take place. The prince of Offory, though defeated, still appeared in arms, and only waited for an opportunity of again opposing the enemy in the field. Maurice Pendergait also joined him with his whole troop, being provoked by Dermod, who had refused him leave to return to Wales. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFECTION\">defection</a>, however, was in part supplied by the arrival\nIreland. arrival of Fitz-Gerald with 10 knights, 30 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>-\nmen, and 100 archers. Pendergast in a short time re-\npenting of his new alliance, and retired into Wales; so\nthat the prince was obliged to make his submission to\nDermot, which the latter with some reluctance ac-\ncepted.\n\nIn the mean time, Roderic, having settled all his\nother affairs, advanced against the allies with a pow-\nerful army. Dermot was thrown into despair; but en-\ncouraged by Fitz-Stephen, he encamped in a very\nstrong situation, where he was soon besieged by Roderic.\nThe latter, however, dreading the valour of the Eng-\nlish, condescended to treat first with them, and then\nwith Dermot, in order to detach them from the inte-\nrests of each other: but as this proceeded evidently\nfrom fear, his offers were rejected by both parties;\nupon which he began to prepare for battle: but at the\nvery time when the engagement should have com-\nmenced, either through the suggestions of his clergy, or\nof his own fears, Roderic entered into a new negotiation;\nwhich at last terminated in a peace. The terms were,\nthat Dermot should acknowledge the supremacy of\nRoderic, and pay him such service as the monarchs of\nIreland had usually received from inferior princes;\nand as a security for his faithful performance of this\narticle, he delivered up his favourite son as an hostage\nto Roderic: but in order to establish this accommoda-\ntion on the firmest basis, the latter obliged himself to\ngive his daughter in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> to the young prince as\nsoon as Leinster should be reduced, and the peace of the\nisland effectually restored. By a secret article, Dermot\nengaged to dismiss the British forces immediately after\nthe settlement of his own province, and in the mean\ntime not to bring over any further reinforcements from\nEngland.\n\nThus ended the first British expedition into Ireland,\nthe consequences of which were so little dreaded at that\ntime by the natives, that their historians, though they\ndwell upon the principal wars and contests in other\nparts of the island, speak of the settlement of the\nWelshmen in Leinster with a careless indifference. But\nthough the settlement of this colony seemed very little\nalarming to the generality, it could not escape the ob-\nservation of discerning persons, that a man of Dermot\u2019s\ncharacter would not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> keep his treaties; and that\non the first emergency he would have recourse to his\nformer allies, who thus would establish themselves more\nand more, till at last they would reduce the country\nentirely under their subjection. These reflections, if\nany such were then made, were in a short time verified.\nDermot was scarce settled in his own dominions, when\nhe began to aspire at the sovereignty, and form\nschemes for dethroning Roderic. He applied to Fitz-\nStephen and Fitz-Gerald; by whom he was again di-\nrected to apply to Richard earl of Chepstow, more\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> known by the name of Strongbow, on ac-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> of his feats of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHERY\">archery</a>. Richard was very much\ninclined to accept of his invitation; but thought it in-\ncumbent upon him first to obtain the consent of King\nHenry. The king, however, did not incline that his\nsubjects should make conquests for themselves in any\nother country, and therefore dismissed Richard with an\nequivocal answer; but the latter being willing to un-\nderstand his sovereign\u2019s words in the most favourable\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, immediately set about the necessary preparations\nfor his expedition. In May 1171, Raymond le Gros,\nRichard\u2019s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> friend, and the near relation of\nFitz-Stephen and Fitz-Gerald, landed at a place called\nDondonalp, near Waterford, with 10 knights and 70\narchers; and along with them came Harvey of Mount-\nlith, accompanied by a small train. The English imme-\ndiately intrenched themselves, and erected a temporary\nfort for themselves; which proved a very necessary pre-\ncaution; for the natives, justly attributing this new\ndebarcation to the practices of Dermot, instantly\nformed a tumultuous army, and marched to expel the\ninvaders. The English prepared to meet them; but\nwhen they perceived the great superiority of the enemy,\nthey thought proper to retire to their fort. Here,\nhowever, they must have been totally cut off; had they\nnot luckily collected a numerous herd of cattle from\nthe neighbouring country for their subsistence. These\nthey drove with fury among the Irish, who were thus\nput into the utmost confusion. The invaders seized\nthe favourable moment; and, falling upon their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIS\">dis</a>-\nordered enemies, put them to flight, and drove great\nnumbers of them into the sea, where they perished.\nSeventy prisoners were taken, all of them principal ci-\ntizens of Waterford; who, though they offered large\nsums for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RANSOM\">ransom</a>, and even that the city should be\ndelivered up to the English, were all barbarously put to\ndeath. This success and cruelty so intimidated the\nIrish, that they suffered these merciless invaders to\nmaintain their station unmolested, and wait for the ar-\nrival of their associates.\n\nRichard in the mean time having assembled his va-\nllals, led them through Wales, where he was joined by\ngreat numbers of other adventurers; but, when just\non the point of embarking, was surprised by a positive\ncommand from the king, to desist from his intended\nenterprise, on pain of forfeiture of his lands and ho-\nnours. He was now, however, too much interested\nin his scheme to retract; and therefore pretended to\ndisbelieve the authenticity of the royal mandate. On\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVE\">eve</a> of the feast of St Bartholomew, he landed at\nWaterford with 200 knights and 1200 infantry, all with\na choler and well appointed soldiers. They were im-\nmediately joined by Raymond and his troop; and the\nnext day it was resolved to make an attempt upon\nWaterford. The city was taken by storm, and a\ndreadful massacre ensued; to which the cruel Dermot\nhad the merit of putting an end. The marriage of\nRichard with Eva, the daughter of Dermot, was fo-\nlemnized without delay, and a scene of joy and festivi-\nty succeeded the calamities of war.\n\nA new expedition was now undertaken against\nDublin; the inhabitants of which had either manifest-\ned some recent disaffection to Dermot, or had never\nbeen thoroughly forgiven for their old defection. Ro-\nderic advanced against the allied army with a formi-\ndable body, consisting, as is said, of 30,000 men; but,\nfearing to come to a general engagement, he\ncontented himself with some slight skirmishes; after\nwhich, great part of his vassals forced him to dismiss\nthem, and Dublin was left to its fate. The inhabitants\nwere treated very severely; however, a considerable\nbody of them, with Hesulph their governor, had the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> some vessels lying in the har-\nbour, and made their escape to the northern islands.\nEarl Richard was now invested with the lordship of\nDublin;\nDublin; and appointed Milo de Cogan, a brave English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a>, his governor; while he himself, in conjunction with the forces of Dermot, overran the country of Meath, committing everywhere the most horrid cruelties. Roderic, in the mean time, unable to oppose them in the field, sent deputies to Dermot, commanding him to retire, and putting him in mind that his son was in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, and must answer with his life for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> of those treaties which his father made so little scruple to violate. Natural affection, however, had very little place in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> of Dermot. He expressed the utmost indifference about his son; and, with the greatest arrogance, claimed the sovereignty of all Ireland; Roderic, provoked at this answer, cut off the young prince's head.\n\nThis piece of impotent cruelty served only to make the king odious to his own subjects, while Dermot and his English allies committed everywhere the greatest devastations, and threatened to subdue the whole island. This indeed they would probably have accomplished, had not the extraordinary success of Strongbow alarmed King Henry; who, fearing that he might render himself totally independent on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of Britain, issued his royal edict, strictly forbidding any English vessel from passing into Ireland with men, arms, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>; and commanding all his subjects at that time resident in Ireland, of whatever rank or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, to return to their country before the ensuing feast of Easter, on pain of forfeiting their lands, and being declared traitors.\n\nOur adventurers were plunged into the greatest distress by this peremptory edict. They now found themselves cut off from all supplies in the midst of their enraged enemies, and in danger of being forsaken by those who had attached themselves to them during their success. Raymond was dispatched with a most submissive message to the offended monarch; but before he received any favourable answer, everything was thrown into confusion by the death of Becket*, so that the king had neither leisure nor inclination to attend to the affairs of Ireland. About the same time the death of Dermot their great ally seemed almost to give a finishing stroke to the English affairs. An universal defection took place among their associates; and before they had time to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> any proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a>, Hefculph, who had formerly escaped from Dublin, appeared before that city with a formidable body of troops armed after the Danish manner. A furious attack ensued; which at last ended in the defeat and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a> of Hefculph, who was immediately put to death. This danger, however, was soon followed by one still greater. Roderic had formed a powerful confederacy with many of the Irish chieftains, and the kings of the northern isles, in order to extirpate the English totally from the island. The harbour of Dublin was blocked up by a fleet of 30 ships from the northern isles; while the confederated Irish took their stations in such a manner as to surround the city, and totally cut off all supplies of provisions. In two months' time the English were reduced to great straits. On the first alarm, Richard had sent for assistance to Fitz-Stephen; who having weakened his own force, in order to serve the earl, the people of Wexford had risen and besieged Fitz-Stephen in his fort called Carrig, near that city. A messenger now arrived, informing Strongbow that his friend was in the utmost danger, and must <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into the hands of his enemies if not assisted within three days; upon which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of war was called, in order to deliberate on the measures necessary to be pursued in this desperate emergency. It was soon resolved to enter into a treaty with Roderic upon any terms that were not totally servile or opprobrious. Laurence prelate of Dublin was appointed to carry the terms; which were, that Richard proposed to acknowledge Roderic as his sovereign, and to hold the province of Leinster as his vassal, provided he would raise the siege. Laurence soon returned with an answer, probably of his own framing; namely, that Dublin, Waterford, Wexford, and all the forts possessed by the British, should be immediately given up; and that the earl and his associates should depart with all their forces by a certain day, leaving every part of the island free from their usurpations, and absolutely renouncing all their pretended claims. On these conditions they were to be spared; but the least reluctance or delay would determine the besiegers to storm the city.\n\nThese terms, though they contained nothing insolent or unreasonable, considering the present situation of the English, were yet intolerable to our indignant adventurers. After some time spent in silence, Milo de Cogan, suddenly starting up, declared his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to die bravely rather than submit to the mercy of barbarians. The spirit of desperate valour was instantly caught by the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>; and it was resolved to risk their whole fortune on one desperate effort, by falling out against the enemy, and to make their attack upon that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> where Roderic himself commanded. Accordingly, having persuaded a body of the townsmen to take part in this desperate enterprise, they marched out against their enemies, who they expected nothing less than such a sudden attack. The besiegers were secure and careless, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> or order; in consequence of which, they were unable to sustain the furious assault of the English. A terrible slaughter ensued, and the Irish instantly fled in the greatest confusion; their monarch himself escaping only by mixing half naked with the crowd. The other chieftains who were not attacked caught the panic, and broke up their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPS\">camps</a> with precipitation; while the victors returned from the pursuit to plunder, and among other advantages, gained as much provision as was sufficient to support them for a whole year.\n\nStrongbow being thus relieved from his distresses, committed the government of Dublin to Milo de Cogan, while he proceeded immediately to Wexford, in order to relieve Fitz-Stephen; but in this he was disappointed; for that brave officer, having often repulsed his enemies, was at last treacherously deceived into submission and laid in irons. Strongbow, however, continued to advance; and was again attacked by the Irish, whom he once more defeated. On his arrival at Wexford, he found it burnt to the ground; the enemy having retired with Fitz-Stephen and the rest of the prisoners to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HOLY_ISLAND\">Holy Island</a>, a small island in the middle of the harbour, from whence they sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPUTATION\">deputation</a>, threatening to put all the prisoners to death if the least attempt was made to molest them in their present situation. The earl then proceeded to Waterford, and from thence to Ferns; where he for some time exercised a regal authority, rewarding his friends and punishing his enemies.\nA more important object, however, soon engaged his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. The king of England, having settled his affairs as well as he could, now determined to conquer Ireland for himself. A summons was instantly dispatched to Earl Richard, expressing the greatest resentment at his presumption and disobedience, and requiring his immediate presence in England. The earl found himself under the necessity of obeying; and having made the best dispositions the time would permit for the security of his Irish possessions, embarked for England, and met the king at Newnham near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GLOUCESTER\">Gloucester</a>. Henry at first affected great displeasure; but soon allowed himself to be pacified by a surrender of the city of Dublin, and a large territory adjacent, together with all the maritime towns and forts acquired by Strongbow: while on his part he consented that the earl should have all his other possessions granted in perpetuity, to be held of the king and his heirs. The other adventurers made their peace in a similar manner; while the Irish chieftains, instead of uniting in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of their country, only thought how to make the most of the approaching invasion, or at least how to avert the threatened evils from their own particular districts. They <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the power of their own sovereign on the point of total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a>; and they saw it with indifference, if not with an envious and malignant satisfaction. Some were even ready to prevent their invader, and to submit before he appeared on the coast. The men of Wexford, who had possessed themselves of Fitz-Stephen, resolved to avert the consequences of their late perfidy and cruelty, by the forwardness of their zeal for the service of the king of England, and the readiness of their submissions. Their deputies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> themselves at Henry's feet; and, with the most passionate expressions of obedience, humbly intreated that he would accept them as his faithful vassals, ready to resign themselves, their lands, and possessions, to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> disposal. \"They had already (they said) endeavoured to approve their zeal by feigning Robert Fitz-Stephen, a traitor to his sovereign, who had lately entered their territory by force of arms, without any due warrant or fair pretence, had slaughtered their people, seized their lands, and attempted to establish himself independent of his liege lord.\u2014They kept him in chains, and were ready to deliver him to the disposal of his sovereign.\"\u2014The king received them with expressions of the utmost grace and favour; commended their zeal in repelling the unwarrantable attempts of Fitz-Stephen; declared that he should soon inquire into his crimes, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-WRONGS\">wrongs</a> they had sustained, and inflict condign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> for every offence committed by his undutiful subjects.\u2014Thus were the Irishmen dismissed in the utmost joy and exultation; and the artifice of Henry, while it inspired these men with dispositions favourable to his interests, proved also the most effectual means of saving Fitz-Stephen from their cruelty.\n\nHenry, having completed the preparations necessary for his expedition, embarked at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILFORD\">Milford</a> with several of his barons, 400 knights, and about 4000 soldiers, on board a fleet of 240 sail. He landed at Waterford on the feast of St Luke in October 1172; with a professed design not to conquer, but to take possession of a kingdom already his own, as being granted him by the pope. Most of the Irish indeed seemed to be of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, and therefore submitted without the least reluctance. Strongbow set them an example, by making a formal surrender of Waterford, and doing homage to the king for the territory of Leinster. Fitz-Stephen was delivered up, with many accusations of tyranny and injustice. He was at first sent to prison; but soon purchased his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, by surrendering Wexford, and doing homage for the rest of his possessions to the king. The prince of Desmond was the first Irish chieftain who submitted. On the very day after the king's arrival, he attended his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, resigned his claim to the city of Cork, did him homage, and stipulated to pay a tribute for the rest of his territory. An English governor and garrison were immediately appointed to take possession of his capital; and the king displayed his power and magnificence by marching to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LISMORE\">Lismore</a>, where he chose a situation and gave the necessary orders for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> a fort. The prince of Thomond next submitted and did homage. He was followed by the princes of O'Byrne, Decies, and all the inferior chiefs of Munster.\n\nThe king, after having provided for the security of all his newly acquired territories, and put garrisons in the cities of Limerick, Cork, Waterford, and Wexford, proceeded to take possession of Dublin, which had been surrendered by Strongbow. The neighbouring lords took the opportunity of submitting as he advanced. O'Carroll of Argail, a chieftain of great consequence, repaired to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>, and engaged to become his tributary; and even O'Rourke, whom Roderic had made lord of a considerable part of Meath, voluntarily submitted to the new sovereign.\n\nRoderic, though surprised at the defection of so many of his allies, still determined to maintain his own full holds dignity, and at least preserve his province of Connaught, seeing he could no longer call himself monarch of the whole island. With this design he entrenched himself on the banks of the Shannon; and now, when disencumbered from a crowd of faithless and discontented followers, he appears to have acted with a spirit and dignity becoming his station. Hugh de Lacy and William Fitz-Andelin were commissioned by the king to reduce him; but Roderic was too strong to be attacked with any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> of success by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> from the English army; and he at least affected to believe, that his situation was not yet so totally desperate as to reduce him to the necessity of resigning his dignity and authority, while his own territory remained inviolate, and the brave and powerful chiefs of Ulster still kept retired in their own districts without any thoughts of submission. Henry in the meantime attempted to attach the Irish lords to his interest by elegant and magnificent entertainments, such as to them appeared quite astonishing. Some historians pretend that he established the English laws in all those parts which had submitted to his jurisdiction; but this must appear extremely improbable, when we consider how tenacious a rude and barbarous people are of their ancient laws and customs. The Irish lords had been accustomed to do homage to a superior; and they had made no submission to Henry which they had not formerly done to Roderic, and probably thought their submission to the king of England more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> than that to their Irish monarchs; and it cannot be supposed, that a wise and politic monarch, such as Henry\nHenry undoubtedly was, should form at once such an extravagant scheme as altering the laws of a great number of communities, none of which he had subdued by force of arms. By his transactions both with the natives and adventurers, however, Henry had attained the absolute dominion of several maritime cities and their dependencies; so that he had both a considerable number of real subjects, and a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of territory, in the island. To these subjects indeed Henry granted the English laws; and gave the city of Dublin by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a> to the inhabitants of Bristol, to be held of him and his heirs, with the same liberties and free customs which they enjoyed at Bristol, and throughout all his land. And, by another charter, executed soon after, he confirmed to his burgesses of Dublin all manner of rights and immunities throughout his whole land of England, Normandy, Wales, and Ireland, wherever they and their effects shall be, to be fully and honourably enjoyed by them as his free and faithful subjects. And as it was not easy to induce his English subjects immediately to settle in these maritime towns, he permitted the Olmten to take possession of Waterford; and to them he granted a particular right of denization, whereby they were invested with the rights and privileges of free subjects, and for the future to be governed by the laws of his realm. For the better execution of these new laws, the king also made a division of the districts now subject to him into shires or counties; which was afterwards improved and enlarged, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the English settlements and the circumstances of the country required. Sheriffs were appointed both for the counties and cities, with itinerant judges, and other ministers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, and officers of state, and every appendage of English government and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>. To complete the whole system, a chief governor, or representative of the king, was appointed. His business was to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> the royal authority, or such parts of it as might be committed to him in the king's absence; and, as the present state of Ireland, and the apprehensions of war or insurrections, made it necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against sudden accidents, it was provided, That in case of the death of any chief governor, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a>, chief justice, and chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">baron</a>, keeper of the rolls, and king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERGEANT\">sergeant</a> at law, should be empowered, with consent of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a> of the land, to elect a successor, who was to exercise the full power and authority of this office, until the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> should be further known.\n\nBut while Henry was thus regulating the government of his new dominions, he received the unwelcome news, that two cardinals, Albert and Theodine, delegated by the pope, had arrived in Normandy the year before, to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> into the death of Becket; that having waited the king's arrival until their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a> was exhausted, they now summoned him to appear without delay, as he would avert the dreadful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCOMMUNICATION\">excommunication</a>, and preserve his dominions from a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERDICT\">interdict</a>. Such denunciations were of too great consequence to admit of his longer stay in Ireland; he therefore ordered his forces and the officers of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a> to embark without delay, referring three ships for the conveyance of himself and his immediate attendants. Having therefore but a short time to secure his Irish interests, he addressed himself to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> English adventurers, and by grants and promises laboured to detach them from Strongbow, and to bind them firmly to himself. To make amends for what he had taken from Fitz-Stephen, he granted him a considerable district in the neighbourhood of Dublin, to be held by knight's service; at the same time entrusting the maritime towns to his own immediate dependants. Waterford was committed to Humphrey de Bohun, Robert Fitz-Bernard, and Hugh de Gundville, with a train of 20 knights. In Wexford were stationed William Fitz-Andelm, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HASTINGS\">Hastings</a>, and Philip de Braos, with a like number of attendants. Hugh de Lacey had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> of all the territory of Meath, where there was no fortified place, and where, of consequence no particular reservation was necessary, to be held of the king and his heirs, by the service of 50 knights, in as full a manner as it had been enjoyed by any of the Irish princes. He also constituted him lord governor of Dublin, with a guard of 20 knights. Robert Fitz-Stephen and Maurice Fitz-Gerald were appointed his coadjutors, with an equal train; and these, with others of the first adventurers, were thus obliged, under the pretence of an honourable employment, to reside at Dublin, subject to the immediate inspection of De Lacey, in whom Henry seems to have placed his chief confidence. Lands were assigned in the neighbourhood of each city for the maintenance of the knights and soldiers. Orders were given to build a castle in Dublin, and fortresses in other convenient places; and to John de Courcy, a baron distinguished by his enterprising genius and abilities for war, was granted the whole province of Ulster, provided he could reduce it by force of arms.\n\nHenry was no sooner gone, than his barons began to contrive how they might best strengthen their own interests, and the Irish how they might best shake off the yoke to which they had so readily submitted. De Lacey parcelled out the lands of Meath to his friends and adherents, and began to erect forts to keep the old inhabitants in awe. This gave offence to O'Ruarc, who still enjoyed the eastern part of this territory as a tributary prince. He repaired to Dublin, in order to obtain redress from Laeey for some injuries real or pretended; but, as the parties could not come to an agreement, another conference was appointed on a hill called Taragh. Both parties came with a considerable train of armed followers; and the event was a scuffle, in which O'Ruarc and several of his followers were killed, and which served to render the English not a little odious to the natives.\n\nThe spirit of disaffection had soon after an opportunity of showing itself on the rebellion of King Henry's sons, of which an account is given under the article ENGLAND, No 121, et seq. The king had been obliged to weaken his forces in Ireland, by withdrawing several of his garrisons. The soldiers who remained were also discontented with their general Hervey of Mountmorris, on account of his severity in discipline, and restraining them from plunder, to which they imagined themselves entitled on account of the deficiencies of their pay. Raymond le Gros, the second in command, was much more beloved by the soldiery; and to such a height had the jealousies between the commanders arisen, that all effectual opposition...\nposition to the Irish chieftains was prevented; and the event might have been fatal to the English interest, had not Henry found out a remedy. He summoned Earl Richard to attend him at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROUEN\">Rouen</a> in Normandy, and communicated his intentions of committing the affairs of Ireland to his sole direction. The earl expressed the utmost readiness to serve his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>; but observed, that he had already experienced the envy and malignity of his secret enemies; that if he should appear in such a distinguished character as that of the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a> in Ireland, their insidious practices would be renewed, and his conduct misrepresented.\u2014He therefore requested that a colleague might be appointed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>; and recommended Raymond as a person of approved loyalty and abilities, as well as highly acceptable to the soldiery. The king replied, with an affected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of regard and confidence, that he had his free consent to employ Raymond in any service he should deem necessary, not as a colleague, but as an assistant; but that he relied entirely on the earl himself, and implicitly trusted every thing to his direction. To reward his services, he granted him the town of Wexford, together with a fort erected at Wicklow; and then dismissed him with the most gracious expressions of favour.\n\nThe earl landed at Dublin, where he was received with all the respect due to the royal commission. He signified the king's pleasure, that Robert Fitz-Bernard, with the garrison of Waterford, should instantly embark and repair to Normandy; that Robert Fitz-Stephen and Maurice Pendergaff should attend the service of their sovereign in England; and, agreeably to the king's instructions, took on him the custody of the cities of Dublin, Waterford, and Wexford. Hugh de Lacey and Milo de Cogan were, with the other lords, commanded to repair to England for the service of the king; by which the earl's forces were considerably weakened, and he soon found himself under the necessity of appointing Raymond to the chief command. The new general proved successful in some enterprises against the rebellious Irish; but having presumed upon his merits to demand in marriage Basilia the earl's sister, Richard refused his consent, and Raymond retired into Wales.\n\nThus the supreme command again devolved upon Hervey of Mountmorris; who, being sensible that his character had suffered much from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with that of Raymond, determined to emulate his successes by some bold attempt against the rebels. A detachment of 400 of his men, however, had the misfortune to be surprised and cut off by the enemy; and this success served as a signal for a general revolt. Several of the Leinster chieftains, who had lately made their submissions, and bound themselves to the service of King Henry, now openly disclaimed all engagements. Even Donald Kavanagh, son to the late King Dermot, who had hitherto adhered to the English in their greatest difficulties, now declared against them, and claimed a right to the kingdom of Leinster; while Roderic, on his part, was active in uniting the princes of Ulster, the native lords of Meath, and other chiefs, against their common enemy. This produced the immediate recall of Raymond; and Richard no longer refused his consent to the marriage with his sister, which was solemnized immediately on Raymond's arrival. The very next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, the bridegroom was obliged to take the field against Roderic, who had committed great devastations in Meath. By the vigorous conduct of the English commander, however, he was not only prevented from doing farther mischief, but at last convinced of the folly of resistance; and Roderic therefore determined to make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> submission. Yet, to King conscious of his dignity, he declined to submit to Henry subject; and therefore, instead of treating with Earl Richard, he sent deputies directly to the king. The deputies were, Catholicus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-TUAM\">Tuam</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABBOT\">abbot</a> of St Brandan, and Master Lawrence as he is styled, chancellor to the king of Connaught.\n\nThe terms of this submission, by which Henry became sole monarch of Ireland, were as follow: Roderic consented to do homage and pay tribute, as liege-man to the king of England; on which condition he was allowed to hold the kingdom of Connaught, as well as his other lands and sovereignties, in as ample a manner as he had enjoyed them before the arrival of Henry in Ireland. His vassals were to hold under him in peace, as long as they paid their tribute and continued faithful to the king of England; in which Roderic was to enforce their due obedience, and for this purpose to call to his affluence the English government, if necessary. The annual tribute to be paid was every tenth merchantable hide, as well from Connaught as from the rest of the island; excepting those parts under the immediate dominion of the king of England and his barons, viz. Dublin and Meath with their appurtenances, Wexford and all Leinster, and Waterford with its lands, as far as Dungarvan inclusive; in all which districts Roderic was not to interfere, nor claim any power or authority.\u2014The Irish who had fled from these districts were to return, and either pay their tribute, or perform the services required by their tenures, at the option of their immediate lords; and, if refractory, Roderic, at the requisition of their lords, was to compel them to return. He was to take hostages from his vassals, such as he and his liege-lord should think proper; and on his part to deliver either these or others to the king, according to the royal pleasure. His vassals were to furnish hawks and hounds annually to the English monarch; and were not to detain any tenant of his immediate demesnes in Ireland, contrary to his royal pleasure and command. This treaty was solemnly ratified in a grand council of prelates and temporal barons, among whom we find the archbishop of Dublin one of the subscribing witnesses. As metropolitan of Leinster, he was now become an English subject, and was probably summoned on this occasion as one obliged to attend, and who had a right to assist in the king's great council. It is also observable, that Henry now treated with Roderic not merely as a provincial prince, but as monarch of Ireland. This is evidently implied and supposed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>; although his monarchical powers and privileges were little more than nominal, frequently disregarded and opposed by the Irish toparchs. Even by their submissions to Henry, many of them in effect disavowed and renounced the sovereignty of Roderic; but now his supremacy seems to be indubitably acknowledged, that the present submission might appear virtually the submission of all the subordinate princes, and thus the king\nIreland. king of England be invested with the sovereignty of the whole island. The marks of sovereignty, however, were no more than homage and tribute; in every other particular the regal rights of Roderic were left inviolate. The English laws were only to be enforced in the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a>: and, even there, the Irish tenant might live in peace, as the subject of the Irish monarch; bound only to pay his quota of tribute, and not to take arms against the king of England.\n\nBut though the whole island of Ireland thus became subject to the king of England, it was far from being settled in tranquillity, or indeed from having the situation of its inhabitants mended almost in any degree. One great occasion of disturbance was, that the English laws were confined only to those parts which had been subdued by force of arms: while the chieftains that had only submitted to pay tribute, were allowed to retain the ancient Irish laws within the limits of their own jurisdictions. By these old Irish laws, many crimes accounted capital with us, such as robbery, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a>, &c., might be compensated by a sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>. Hence it happened, that very unequal punishments were inflicted for the same offence. If one Englishman killed another, he was punished with death; but if he killed an Irishman, he was punished only by a fine. If an Irishman, on the other hand, killed an Englishman, he was certainly punished with death: and as in times of violence and outrage, the crime of murder was very frequent, the circumstance just mentioned tended to produce an implacable hatred between the original inhabitants and the English. As the Irish laws were thus more favourable to the barbarity natural to the tempers of some individuals, many of the English were also tempted to lay aside the manners and customs of their countrymen altogether, and to associate themselves with the Irish, that, by becoming subject to their laws, they might thus have an opportunity of gratifying their brutal inclinations with less controul than formerly; and in process of time, these degenerate English, as they were called, proved more bitter enemies to their countrymen than even the Irish themselves.\n\nAnother cause of the distresses of Ireland was, the great power of the English barons, among whom Henry had divided the greatest part of his Irish dominions. The extent of their authority only inflamed them with a desire for more; and, instead of contributing their endeavours to increase the power of their sovereign, or to civilize the barbarous people over whom they were placed, they did every thing in their power to counteract and destroy each other. Henry himself, indeed, seems to have been infected with a very fatal jealousy in this respect; for, though the abilities and fidelity of Raymond had abundantly manifested themselves, the king never could allow himself to continue him in the government of the island: and the consequence of degrading him never failed to be a scene of uproar and confusion. To these two reasons we must likewise add another: namely, that in those parts of the kingdom where the Irish chieftains enjoyed the sovereignty, they were at full liberty to make war upon each other as formerly, without the least restraint. This likewise induced many of the English to degenerate, that they might have an opportunity of sharing the plunder got by these petty wars; so that, on the whole, the island was a perpetual scene of horror, almost unequalled in the history of any country.\n\nAfter the death of Earl Richard, Raymond was immediately elected to succeed him; but was superseded by the king, who appointed William Fitz-Andelm, a nobleman allied to Raymond, to succeed in his place. The new governor had neither inclination nor abilities to perform the task assigned to him. He was of a rapacious temper, sensual and corrupt in his manners; and therefore only studied to enrich himself. The native Irish, provoked by some depredations of the English, commenced hostilities: but Fitz-Andelm, instead of repelling these with vigour in the beginning, treated the chieftains with affected courtesy and flattery. This they had sufficient discernment to see, and to despise; while the original adventurers had the burden of the whole defence of the English pale, as the English territories were called, thrown upon them, at the same time that the bad conduct of the governor was the cause of perpetual disorders. The consequence of this was, that the lords avowed their hatred of Fitz-Andelm: the followers were mutinous, ill-appointed, and unpaid: and the Irish came in crowds to the governor with perpetual complaints against the old adventurers, which were always decided against the latter; and this decision increased their confidence, without lessening their disaffection.\n\nIn this unfavourable state of affairs, John de Courcy, a bold adventurer, who had as yet reaped none of the benefits he expected, resolved to undertake an expedition against the natives, in order to enrich himself with their spoils. The Irish at that time were giving no offence; and therefore pleaded the treaty lately concluded with King Henry: but treaties were of little avail, when put in competition with the necessities of an indigent and rapacious adventurer. The consequence was, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> of war was kindled through the whole island. The chieftains took advantage of the war with the English, to commence hostilities against each other. Desmond and Thomond, in the southern province, were distracted by the jealousies of contending chiefs, and the whole land was wasted by unnatural and bloody quarrels. Treachery and murder were revenged by practices of the same kind, in such a manner as to perpetuate a succession of outrages the most horrid and the most disgraceful to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>. The northern province was a scene of like enormities; though the new English settlers, who were considered as a common enemy, ought to have united the natives among themselves. All were equally strangers to the virtues of humanity; nor was religion, in the form it then assumed, capable of restraining these violences in the least.\n\nIreland was thus in a short time reduced to such a state, that Henry perceived the necessity of recalling Fitz-Andelm, and appointing another governor. He was recalled accordingly; and Hugh de Lacy appointed to succeed him. He left his government without being regretted, and is said by the historians of those times to have done only one good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> during the whole course of his administration. This action was nothing more important, than the removing of a relic, called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">staff</a> of St. Patrick, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> of Armagh to that of Dublin; probably that it might be...\nbe in greater safety, as the war raged violently in Ulster. De Lacey, however, was a man of a quite different disposition, and every way qualified for the difficult government with which he was invested; but at the same time, the king, by investing his son John with the lordship of Ireland, gave occasion to greater disturbances than even those which had already happened. The nature of this lordship hath been much disputed; but the most probable opinion is, that the king's son was now to be invested with all the rights and powers which had formerly belonged to Roderic, who was allowed the title of king of Ireland. It doth not appear, indeed, that Henry had any right to deprive Roderic of these powers, and still less had he to dispose of any of the territories of those chieftains who had agreed to become his tributaries; which nevertheless he certainly did, and which failed not to be productive of an immediate war with these chiefs.\n\nThe new governor entered on his office with all that spirit and vigour which was necessary; but being misrepresented to the king by some factious barons, he was in a short time recalled, and two others, totally unfit for the government, appointed in his room. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> was soon corrected, and Lacey was replaced in three months. The same jealousy which produced his first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a>, soon produced a second; and Philip de Braola, or Philip of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORCESTER\">Worcester</a> as he is called, a man of a most avaricious disposition, was appointed to succeed him. This governor behaved in such a manner, that his superstitious subjects expected every moment that the vengeance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> would fall upon him, and deliver them from his tyranny. His power, however, was of short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>; for now Prince John prepared to exercise the authority with which his father had invested him in Ireland. He was attended by a considerable military force; his train was formed of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of gallant Normans in the pride of youth; but luxurious, insolent, and followed by a number of Englishmen, strangers to the country they were to visit, desperate in their fortunes, accustomed to a life of profligacy, and filled with great expectations of advantage from their present service. The whole assembly embarked in a fleet of 60 ships; and arrived at Waterford after a prosperous voyage, filling the whole country with the greatest surprize and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a>.\n\nThe young prince had not yet arrived at the years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a>; nor indeed, from his subsequent conduct, doth it appear that his disposition was such as qualified him in the least for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> dignity to which he was raised. The hardly Welshmen who first migrated into Ireland, immediately waited upon him to do him homage; but they were disagreeable to the gay courtiers, and to the prince himself, who minded nothing but his pleasures. The Irish lords were at first terrified by the magnificent representation of the force of the English army; and being reconciled to submission by the dignity of the prince's station, hastened in crowds to Waterford to do him homage. They exhibited a spectacle to the Norman courtiers, which the latter did not fail to treat with contempt and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a>. The Irish lords, with uncoated attire, thick bushy beards, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> standing on end, advanced with very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>; and, according to their own notions of respect, offered to kiss the young prince. His attendants stepped in, and prevented this horrid violation of decency by thrusting away the Irishmen. The whole assembly burst into peals of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAUGHTER\">laughter</a>, pulled the beards, and committed several other indignities on the persons of their guests; which were immediately and fiercely resented. The chieftains left the court, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> with indignation; and meeting others of their countrymen halting to do homage to the prince, they informed them of the reception they themselves had met with. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> was instantly formed to extirpate the English, and the revolt of the whole nation flew to arms; while John and his courtiers, instead of opposing the enemy, employed themselves in harrying and oppressing those who were under their immediate jurisdiction. The country was therefore overrun by the barbarians, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a> entirely neglected, and a dreadful famine threatened to follow the calamities of war.\n\nThis terrible devastation had continued for eight months before the king was fully acquainted with it. He then determined to recall his son; but was at a loss whom he should name for his successor. Lacey had been murdered by an Irish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEASANT\">peasant</a>, and the king was at last obliged to have recourse to John de Courcy, whose boisterous valour seemed now to be absolutely necessary to prevent the English from being totally exterminated. The new governor was obliged at first to suppress the league, and began their usual hostilities against Courcy; each other, he was at last enabled to maintain the authority of the English government, and to support their acquisitions in Ireland, though not to extend them.\n\nIn this situation were the affairs of Ireland when Miserable Henry II. died, and was succeeded by his son Richard I. The new king was determined on an expedition to the holy land, which left him no leisure to attend to the affairs of Ireland. John, by virtue of the powers granted him by his father, took upon him the management of Irish affairs; and immediately degraded De Courcy from his government, appointing in his place Hugh de Lacey the younger. De Courcy, provoked at this indignity, retired into Ulster, where he was immediately engaged in a furious war with the natives, and at last almost entirely detached himself from the English government. The greatest confusion ensued: Hugh de Lacey was recalled from his government, and William Petit earl marshal of England appointed in his place. Petit's administration proved more unfortunate than that of any of his predecessors. Confederacies everywhere took place against the English; the latter were everywhere defeated, their towns taken; and their power would certainly have been annihilated, had not the Irish, as usual, turned their arms against each other.\n\nIn this desperate situation matters continued during the whole reign of King Richard, and part of the reign of John, while the difficulties of the country were increased by the dissensions and disaffection of the English lords, who aspired at independency, and made war upon each other like Irish chieftains. The prudent conduct of a governor named Melet Fitz-Henry, how better never, at last put an end to these terrible commotions; and about the year 1228, the kingdom was more quiet than it had been for a long time before. In 1210, John came over to Ireland in person with an army,\narmy, with a design, as he said, to reduce his refractory nobles to a sense of their duty. More than 25 Irish chiefs waited upon him immediately to do him homage; while three of the English barons, Hugh and Walter de Lacy and William de Braofa, fled to France. The king, at the desire of his Irish subjects, granted them, for their information, a regular code and charter of laws, to be deposited in the exchequer of Dublin, under the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>. For the regular and effectual execution of these laws, besides the establishment of the king's courts of judicature in Dublin, there was now made a new and more ample division of the king's lands of Ireland into counties, where sheriffs, and many other officers, were appointed. These counties were, Dublin, Meath, Kildare, Argail, now called Louth, Kilkenny, Wexford, Waterford, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary; which marks the extent of the English dominions at this time as confined to a part of Leinster and Munster, and to those parts of Meath and Argail which lie in the province of Ulster as now defined. Before his departure, the king gave liberty to John de Grey, bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWICH\">Norwich</a>, whom he appointed governor, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COIN\">coin</a> money of the same weight with that of England; and which, by royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a>, was made current in England as well as Ireland.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> governor is said to have managed affairs so happily, that during the violent contests between John and his barons, Ireland enjoyed an unusual degree of tranquillity. We are not to imagine, however, that this unhappy country was at this or indeed any other period, till the end of Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>'s reign, perfectly free from disorders, only they were confined to those districts most remote from the English government. In 1219, the commotions were renewed, through the insuperable ambition and contentions of the English barons, who despised all control, and oppressed the inhabitants in a terrible manner. The disorders in England during the reign of Henry III. encouraged them to despise the royal authority; they were ever the secret enemies, and sometimes the avowed adversaries, of each other; and in many places where they had obtained settlements, the natives were first driven into insurrections by their cruelty, and then punished with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> cruelty for their resistance. The English laws, which tended to punish the authors of these outrages, were scorned by an imperious aristocratic faction, who, in the frenzy of rapine and ambition, trampled on the most salutary institutions. In 1228, a remonstrance was presented to the king against this dangerous neglect and suspension of the laws; which he answered by a mandate to the chief governor, directing that the whole body of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, knights, free tenants, and bailiffs of the several counties, should be convened; that the charter of English laws and customs received from King John, and to which they were bound by oath, should be read over in their presence; that they should be directed for the future strictly to observe and adhere to these; and that proclamation should be made in every county of Ireland, strictly enjoining obedience, on pain of forfeiture of lands and tenements. How little effect was produced by this order, we may learn from another, dated in 1246; where the barons are commanded, for the peace and tranquillity of the land, to permit it to be governed by the laws of England.\n\nNothing indeed can be conceived more terrible than the state of Ireland during the reign of Henry III., depravation of people of all ranks appear to have been sunk in the lowest degree of depravity. The powerful English lords not only subverted the peace and security of the people, by refusing to admit the salutary laws of their own country, but behaved with the utmost injustice and violence to the natives who did not enjoy the benefits of the English constitution. The clergy appear to have been equally abandoned with the rest: nor indeed could it be otherwise; for through the partialities of Henry himself, the neglected, the worthless, and the depraved among the English clergy, found refuge in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Ireland. What were the manners of these clergy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> appear from the following petition of a widow to King Edward I.\n\n\"Margaret le Blunde, of Cashel, petitions our lord the king's grace, that she may have her inheritance which she recovered at Cloonmell before the king's judges, &c., against David Macmackerway bishop of Cashel.\n\n\"Item, the said Margaret petitions redress on account that her father was killed by the said bishop.\n\n\"Item, for the imprisonment of her grandfather and mother, whom he shut up and detained in prison until they perished by famine, because they attempted to seek redress for the death of their son, father of your petitioner, who had been killed by the said bishop.\n\n\"Item, for the death of her six brothers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SISTERS\">sisters</a>, who were starved to death by the said bishop, because he had their inheritance in his hands at the time he killed their father.\n\n\"And it is to be noted, that the said bishop had built an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a> in the city of Cashel, on the king's lands granted for this purpose, which he hath filled with robbers, who murder the English, and depopulate the country; and that when the council of our lord the king attempts to take cognizance of the offence, he fulminates the sentence of excommunication against them.\n\n\"It is to be noted also, that the said Margaret has five times crossed the Irish sea. Wherefore, the petitions for God's sake, that the king's grace will have compassion, and that she may be admitted to take possession of her inheritance.\n\n\"It is further to be noted, that the aforesaid bishop hath been guilty of the death of many other Englishmen besides that of her father; and that the aforesaid Margaret hath many times obtained writs of our lord the king, but to no effect, by reason of the influence and bribery of the said bishop.\n\n\"She further petitions, for God's sake, that she may have costs and damages, &c.\"\n\nMatters continued in the same deplorable state during the reign of Edward I., with this additional grievance, that the kingdom was infested by invasions of the Scots. The English monarch indeed possessed all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARD\">ward</a> that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and valour which were necessary to have reduced the island to a state of tranquillity; but his project of conquering Scotland left him but little leisure to attend to the distracted state of Ireland. Certain it\nIreland, however, that the grievous distresses of that country gave him great uneasiness; so that he transmitted his mandate to the prelates of Ireland, requiring them to interpose their spiritual authority for composing the public disorders. About the same time, the Irish who lay contiguous to the English, and who dwelt among them, presented a petition to the king, offering to pay him 8000 marks, upon condition that they were admitted to the privileges of English subjects. To this petition he returned a favourable answer; but his good intentions were defeated by the licentious nobility, who knew that these laws would have circumcised their rapacious views, and controll'd their violence and oppression. Petitions of the same kind were several times repeated during this reign, but as often defeated; though some means were used for the peace of the kingdom, such as the frequent calling of parliaments, appointing sheriffs in some new counties, &c.\n\nThese means were not altogether without effect. They served to give some check to the disorders of the realm, though by no means to terminate or subdue them. The incursions of the natives were repressed, and the English lords began to live on better terms with each other; and, in 1311, under Edward II., the most powerful of them were reconciled by the marriage of Maurice and Thomas Fitz-John, afterwards the heads of the illustrious houses of Desmond and Kildare, to two daughters of the earl of Ulster. But just at this happy period, when the nation seemed to have some prospect of tranquillity, more dreadful calamities than any hitherto related were about to take place. The Scots had just recovered their liberty under Robert Bruce, and were now in no danger of being again enslaved by a foreign power. Edward, the king's brother, as a recompense for his services, demanded a share of the royal authority. This was refused by Robert, and Edward was for the present satisfied by being declared <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> apparent to the crown. But the king, wisely considering the necessity of finding out some employment for a youth of such an aspiring and ambitious disposition, pointed out to his brother the island of Ireland, the conquest of which would be easy, on account of the distracted state in which it almost always was, and which would make him an independent sovereign. This proposal was eagerly embraced by Edward, and every thing necessary for the expedition immediately got ready. On the 25th of May 1315, he landed on the north-eastern coast of Ireland with 6000 men, to assert his claim to the sovereignty of this kingdom. The Irish lords of Ulster, who had invited and encouraged him to this enterprise, were now prepared to receive their new monarch, flocked with eagerness to his standard, and prepared to wreak their vengeance on the common enemy. Their progress was marked by desolation and carnage. The English settlers were slaughtered, or driven from their possessions, their castles levelled with the ground, and their towns set on fire. The English lords were neither prepared to resist the invasion, nor sufficiently united among themselves. The consequence was, that the enemy for some time met with no interruption. An intolerable scarcity of provisions, however, prevented Bruce from pursuing his advantages; and though his brother landed in Ireland with a powerful army, the famine prevented him from being of any essential service. The forces which he left behind him, however, proved of considerable advantage; and by means of this reinforcement, he was enabled to take the city of Carrickfergus.\n\nThe terrible devastations committed by Bruce and his associates, now induced some English lords to enter into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> to defend their possessions, and repel the invaders. For this purpose, they raised a considerable body of forces; which coming to an engagement with Fedlim prince of Connaught, one of Bruce's principal allies, entirely defeated and killed him with 8000 of his men. This defeat, however, had very little effect on the operations of Bruce himself. He ravaged the country to the walls of Dublin, traversed the district of Offaly, and penetrated into Munster, destroying every thing with fire and sword. The English continued to augment their army, till at last it amounted to 30,000 men; and then Bruce, no longer able to oppose such a force, found it necessary to retire into the province of Ulster. His retreat was effected with great difficulty; and during the time of his inactivity, the distresses of his army increased to such a degree, that they are said to have fed upon the bodies of their dead companions. At last an end was put to the sufferings and the life of this adventurer in the battle of Dundalk, in 1318, where he was defeated and killed by the English under Sir Robert <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRMINGHAM\">Birmingham</a>. A brave English knight, named Maupas, had rushed forward to encounter Bruce himself, and both antagonists had killed each other; the body of Maupas being found, after the battle, stretched upon that of Bruce. The king of Scotland had been advancing with powerful succours to his brother; but Edward, confident of victory, refused to wait his arrival; and Robert, on hearing of his brother's death, instantly retired.\n\nThe defeat of the Scottish invaders did not put an end to the disturbances of this unhappy country. The contentions of the English with one another, of the Irish with the English, and among themselves, still kept the island in a state of the utmost barbarity and confusion. An attempt was made indeed, in the reign of Edward II., to establish an university in Dublin; but for want of proper encouragement the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> for some time languished, and then expired amidst the confusion and anarchy of the country. The reign of Edward III. proved not much more favourable than preceding times had been. He was too much taken up with the idea of conquering France, to pay much regard to the interests of Ireland. The unhappy people, indeed, sensible of their own miseries, petitioned the king to admit all his subjects in Ireland to a participation of the English laws; but the petition being delivered as usual to the chief governor, and laid before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, it was either clandestinely defeated or openly rejected. A new scene of tumult and bloodshed immediately ensued; which at last produced an order from the king, prohibiting all Irishmen, or Englishmen married and having estates in Ireland, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> any public office whatever.\u2014This, instead of having a tendency to promote peace, made the disorder much greater than before; and at last produced a remonstrance from the states met at Kilkenny, in which they grievously complain not only\nIreland. of the disorders of the kingdom, but also of the conduct of the king himself in the edict above-mentioned; and to this remonstrance the king thought proper to give a gracious and condescending answer, in order to procure from Ireland the succours he wanted in his expedition against France.\n\nIt is not to be supposed, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> promises, unassisted by any vigorous exertion, could make the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in the state of a kingdom involved in so much misery. The disorders, however, at last became insupportable to the inhabitants themselves; and a parliament was summoned in 1368, the result of which was the famous statute of Kilkenny. The preamble to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> recites, that the English had become more Irish in their language, names, apparel, and manner of living; had rejected the English laws, and submitted to those of the Irish, with whom they had united by marriage-alliance, to the ruin of the commonwealth.\n\n\u2014It was therefore enacted, that marriage, nurture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a>, &c., with the Irish, should be considered and punished as high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a>.\u2014Again, if any man of English race shall use an Irish name, the Irish language, or the Irish apparel, or any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of the Irish, the act provides, that he shall forfeit lands and tenements, until he hath given security in the court of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHANCERY\">chancery</a> to conform in every particular to the English manners; or if he have no lands, that he shall be imprisoned till the like security be given. The Brehon law was pronounced to be a pernicious custom and innovation lately introduced among the English subjects; and it was therefore ordained, that in all their controversies they should be governed by the common law of England; and that whoever should submit to the Irish jurisdiction should be adjudged guilty of high treason. As the English had been accustomed to make war or peace with the bordering Irish at pleasure, they were now expressly prohibited from levying war without special warrant from the state.\u2014It was also made highly penal for the English to permit their Irish neighbours to graze their lands, to present them to ecclesiastical benefices, or to receive them into monasteries or religious houses; to entertain their bards, who perverted their imaginations by romantic tales; or their news-tellers, who seduced them by false reports.\u2014It was made felony to impose or cease any forces upon the English subject against his will. And as the royal liberties and franchises were become sanctuaries for malefactors, express power was given to the king's sheriffs to enter into all franchises, and there to apprehend felons and traitors.\u2014Lastly, because the great lords, when they levied forces for the public service, acted with partiality, and laid unequal burdens upon the subjects, it was ordained that four wardens of the peace in every county should adjudge what men and armour every lord or tenant should provide.\u2014The statute was promulgated with particular solemnity; and the spiritual lords, the better to enforce obedience, denounced an excommunication on those who should presume to violate it in any instance.\n\nThis statute, it is evident, could not tend to promote the peace of the kingdom. This could only have been done by removing the animosity between the native Irish and English; but so far was the statute of Kilkenny from having any tendency of this kind, that it manifestly tended to increase the hatred between them. During the whole of this reign, therefore, the state of the Irish government continued to be greatly disordered and embroiled. The English interest gradually declined; and the connections of the king's subjects with the original inhabitants, occasioned by their vicinity and necessary intercourse, in despite of all legal injunctions, obliged the king to relax the severity of the statutes of Kilkenny, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> where they proved impracticable, or oppressive in the execution. The perpetual hostility, however, in which the different parties lived, proved an effectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> to the introduction of those arts which contribute to the comfort and refinement of mankind. Even foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> could not venture into such a dangerous country without particular letters of protection from the throne. The perpetual succession of new adventurers from England, led by interest or necessity, served only to inflame dissension, instead of introducing any essential improvement. Lawyers sent from England were notoriously insufficient, if not corrupt; and, as such, had frequently been the objects of complaint. The clergy were a mean grovelling race, totally influenced by the crown. Even prelates were commonly made the inferior agents of government in collecting forces, and raising war against the Irish enemy; but were not to be enticed into this service, except by remittances from the exchequer. Attendance in parliament they dreaded as the greatest hardship; and either recurred to mean excuses to avert the penalty of absence, or sued to the king to be exempted by patent from contributing or attending to those laws by which they were to be governed.\n\nIn this deplorable situation the kingdom continued Power till the time of Henry VII, who laid the foundation of the future civilization of the Irish, as he also did of the English nation. This he effected by enacting some very salutary laws, and appointing faithful and active governors to see them put in execution. Of these governors Sir Edward Poyning contributed more than any other to the tranquillity of the state. During his administration was enacted the law known by the name of Poyning's Law, and which henceforth became the subject of much political debate. The purport of it was, Poyning's That no parliament should be held in that island without first giving notice to the king of England, and acquainting him with the acts to be passed in that parliament; neither should any act passed, or any parliament held, without the approbation of the king and council, be deemed valid. Thus was the power of the turbulent barons greatly broken; and the governor, not having it in his power to assemble parliaments when he pleased, became a person of much less consequence. The whole Irish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a> also became dependent on that of England, and hath ever since continued to be so.\n\nFrom this time we may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a> the revival of the English power in Ireland; which from the Scottish war in the time of Edward II, had gradually declined into a miserable and precarious state of weakness. The authority of the crown, which had at last been despised, insulted, and rejected, even in the English territory, was restored and confirmed, and the rebellious vigorously opposed and suppressed. The feigning of the British crown over the whole body of the Irish, which\nIreland in former reigns seemed to have been totally forgotten, was now formally claimed and affected, and some of the most ferocious chieftains by their marriage-connections became the avowed friends of the English power. An ignominious tribute, called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> Rent, was indeed still paid to some chieftains; but their hostilities were opposed and chastised, and even in their own districts they were made to feel the superiority of English government.\n\nDuring the reign of Henry VIII., the Irish affairs were neglected; and the disorders, which had only been checked, and never thoroughly eradicated, returned as usual. They were further promoted by the innovations in religion which the king introduced, and which were exceedingly disagreeable both to English and Irish. The Reformation, however, continued to make some progress, though slowly, during the reign of Edward VI. and even in the reign of Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>; for as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a> did not reach thither, many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a> fled to Ireland in order to avoid the queen's cruelty. The machinations of the Spaniards against Queen Elizabeth excited the Irish to fresh insurrections. The king of Spain, indeed, not only encouraged the natives in these insurrections, but actually sent over troops to assist them in driving out the English altogether. This they had well effected; but the Spaniards, upon seeing an army of Irish defeated by a handful of their enemies, were so much provoked that they surrendered all the places they had made themselves masters of, and even offered to assist the English in reducing the rebels; though it was not thought proper to accept of their assistance. The consequence of this was, that the Irish, abandoned by these allies, were unable to carry on the war; and the grand rebel O'Neal of Tirowen, or Tyrone, after much treachery, evasion, and many pretended submissions, was at last obliged to submit in good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a>. He fell upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a> before the deputy, and petitioned for mercy with an air and aspect of distress. He subscribed his submission in the most ample manner and form. He implored the queen's gracious commiseration; and humbly sued to be restored to his dignity, and the state of a subject, which he had justly forfeited. He utterly renounced the name of O'Neal, which he had assumed on account of the great veneration in which it was held among the Irish. He abjured all foreign power, and all dependency except on the crown of England; resigned all claim to any lands except such as should be conferred upon him by letters patent; promising at the same time to assist the state in abolishing all barbarous customs and establishing law and civility among his people. The lord deputy, on the part of the queen, promised a full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> to him and all his followers; to himself the restoration of his blood and honours, with a new patent for his lands, except some portions reserved for certain chieftains received into favour, and some for the use of English garrisons.\n\nNo insurgent now remained in this kingdom who had not obtained or sued for mercy. Many, indeed, were driven by necessity to the continent, and earned a subsistence by serving in the armies of Spain; and thus a race of Irish exiles was trained to arms, filled with a malignant resentment against the English. Thus, the honour of reducing all the enemies of the crown of England in this island, after a continued contest for 440 years, was referred to the arms of Elizabeth. The ghastliness of famine and desolation was now somewhat enlivened by the restoration of tranquillity. Indeed, from the most authentic accounts, the prices of provisions were so high, that considering the value of money at that time, it is surprising how the inhabitants could subsist. From an account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">rates</a> of provisions taken by the mayor of Dublin in 1622, it appears, That wheat had risen from 3s. to 9s. the quarter; barley-malt from 10s. to 43s. the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a>; oat-malt from 5s. to 22s. the barrel; pease from 5s. to 40s. the peck; oats from 3s. 4d. to 20s. the barrel; beef from 26s. 8d. to 8l. the carcass; mutton from 3s. to 26s. the carcass; veal from 10s. to 20s. the carcass; a lamb from 12l. to 6s.; a pork from 8s. to 20s.\n\nUnder James I. Ireland began to assume a quite different appearance. That monarch valued himself upon promoting the arts of peace, and made it his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> to civilize his barbarous Irish subjects. By repeated conspiracies and rebellions, a vast tract of land had been ceded to the crown in five northern counties, Tyrconnel, now called Donegal, Tyrone, Derry, Fermanagh, Cavan, and Armagh, amounting to about 500,000 acres; a tract of country covered with woods, where rebels and banditti found a secure refuge, and which was destined to lie waste without the timely interposition of government. James resolved to dispose of these lands in such a manner as might introduce all the happy consequences of peace and cultivation. He caused surveys to be taken of the several counties where the new settlements were to be established; described particularly the state of each; pointed out the situations proper for the erection of towns and castles; delineated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> of the Irish chieftains, the manner in which they should be treated, the temper and circumstances of the old inhabitants, the rights of the new purchasers, and the claims of both; together with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-IMPEDIMENTS\">impediments</a> to former plantations, and the methods of removing them.\n\nAt his instance it was resolved, that the persons to whom lands were assigned should be either new undertakers from Great Britain, especially from Scotland, or servitors, as they were called; that is, men who had for some time served in Ireland, either in civil or military offices; or old Irish chieftains or captains. Among the last were included even those Irish who had engaged in the rebellion of Tyrone, and still harboured their secret discontent. To gain them, if possible, by favour and lenity, they were treated with particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a>. Their under-tenants and servants were allowed to be of their own religion; and, while all the other planters were obliged to take the oath of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a>, they were tacitly excepted. The servitors were allowed to take their tenants either from Ireland or Britain, provided no Popish recusants were admitted. The British undertakers were confined to their own countrymen.\n\nIn the plantations which had been formerly attempted, the Irish and English had been mixed together, from a fond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> that the one would have learned civility and industry from the other. But <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> had now discovered, that this intercourse served only to make the Irish envy the superior comforts of their\ntheir English neighbours, and to take the advantage of a free access to their houses to steal their goods and plot against their lives. It was therefore deemed necessary to plant them in separate quarters; and in the choice of these situations, the errors of former times were carefully corrected. The original English adventurers, on their first settlement in Ireland, were captivated by the fair appearance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> and open districts. Here they erected their castles and habitations; and forced the old natives into the woods and mountains, their natural fortresses. There they kept themselves unknown, living by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> of their kine, without husbandry or tillage; there they increased to incredible numbers by promiscuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>; and there they held their assemblies, and formed their conspiracies without discovery. But now the northern Irish were placed in the most open and accessible parts of the country, where they might lie under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> inspection of their neighbours, and be gradually habituated to agriculture and the mechanic arts. To the British adventurers were assigned places of the greatest strength and command; to the servitors, stations of the greatest danger, and greatest advantage to the crown: but as this appeared a peculiar hardship, they were allowed guards and entertainment, until the country should be quietly and completely planted.\n\nThe experience of ages had shown the inconvenience of enormous grants to particular lords, attended with such privileges as obstructed the administration of civil government; and even in the late reign, favourite undertakers had been gratified with such portions of land as they were by no means able to plant. But, by the present scheme, the lands to be planted were divided in three different proportions; the greatest to consist of 2000 English acres, the least of 1000, and the middle of 1500. One half of the eleventh lands in each county was assigned to the smallest, the other moiety divided between the other proportions; and the general distributions being thus ascertained, to prevent all disputes between the undertakers, their settlements in the respective districts were to be determined by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a>. Estates were assigned to all, to be held of them and their heirs. The undertakers of 2000 acres were to hold of the king in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPITE\">capite</a>; those of 1500, by knights service; those of 1000, in common socage. The first were to build a castle, and inclose a strong court-yard or bawn as it was called, within four years; the second, to finish an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> and bawn within two years; and the third, to inclose a bawn; for even this rude <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of fortification was accounted no inconsiderable defence against an Irish enemy. The first were to plant upon their lands, within three years, 48 able men of English or Scottish birth, to be reduced to 20 families; to keep a demesne of 600 acres in their own hands; to have four free farmers on 120 acres each; six lease-holders, each on 100 acres; and on the rest, eight families of husbandmen, artificers, and cottagers. The others were under the like obligations proportionally. All were, for five years after the date of their patents, to reside upon their lands either in person, or by such agents as should be approved by the state, and to keep a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of arms for their defence. The British and servitors were not to alienate their lands to mere Irish, or to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEMISE\">demise</a> any portions of them to such persons as should refuse to take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a> to government; they were to let them at determined rents, and for no shorter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> than 21 years or three lives. The houses of their tenants were to be built after the English fashion, and united together in towns or villages. They had power to erect manors, to hold courts-baron, and to create tenures. The old natives, whose tenures were granted in fee-simple, to be held in socage, were allowed the like privileges. They were enjoined to let their lands at certain rents, and for the like terms as the other undertakers; to take no Irish exactions from their inferior tenants, and to oblige them to forfeit their old Scythian custom of wandering with their cattle from place to place for pasture, or creaghting as they called it; to dwell in towns, and conform to the English manner of tillage and husbandry. An annual rent from all the lands was reserved to the crown for every 65 English acres, six shillings and eight pence from the undertakers, ten shillings from servitors, and 13 shillings and four pence from Irish natives. But for two years they were exempt from such payments, except the natives, who were not subject to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of transportation. What gave particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to this undertaking, was the capital part which the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> was persuaded to take in it. The corporation accepted of large grants in the county of Derry; they engaged to expend L. 20,000 on the plantation, to build the cities of Derry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLERAIN\">Colerain</a>, and stipulated for such privileges as might make their settlements convenient and respectable. As a competent force was necessary to protect this infant plantation, the king, to support the charge, instituted the order of baronets, an hereditary dignity, to be conferred on a number not exceeding 200; each of whom, on passing his patent, was to pay into the exchequer such a sum as would maintain 30 men in Ulster, for three years, at 8d. daily pay.\n\nBut scarcely had the lands been allotted to the different patentees, when considerable portions were reclaimed by the clergy as their rightful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>. And so far had the estates of the northern bishoprics been embarrassed, both by the usurpations of the Irish lords, and the claims of patentees, that they scarcely afforded a competent, much less an honourable, provision for men of worth and learning, while the state of the parochial clergy was still more deplorable. Most of the northern churches had been either destroyed in the late wars or had fallen to ruin: the benefices were small, and either shamefully kept by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> in the way of commendam or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEQUESTRATION\">sequestration</a>; or filled with ministers as scandalous as their income. The wretched flock was totally abandoned; and for many years divine service had not been used in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a>-church of Ulster, except in cities and great towns. To remedy these abuses, and to make some proper provision for the instruction of a people immersed in lamentable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a>, the king ordained, that all ecclesiastical lands should be restored to their respective fees and churches, and that all lands should be deemed ecclesiastical from which bishops had in former times received rents or pensions: that compositions should be made with the patentees for the site of cathedral churches, the residences of bishops and dignitaries, and other church-lands which were not intended to be conveyed to them; who were to receive equivalents if they compounded freely,\nfreely; or else to be deprived of their patents as the king was deceived in his grant, and the possessions restored to the church. To provide for the inferior clergy, the bishops were obliged to resign all their impropriations, and relinquish the tythes paid them out of parishes, to the respective incumbents; for which ample recompense was made out of the king's lands. Every proportion allotted to undertakers was made a parish, with a parochial church to each. The incumbents, besides their tythes and duties, had glebe-lands assigned to them of 60, 90, or 120 acres, according to the extent of their parishes. To provide for a succession of worthy pastors, free-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCHOOLS\">schools</a> were endowed in the principal towns, and considerable grants of lands conferred on the university of Dublin, which had been re-established by Queen Elizabeth, together with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOWSON\">advowson</a> of six parochial churches, three of the largest, and three of the middle proportion in each county.\n\nSuch was the general scheme of this famous northern plantation, so honourable to the king, and of such consequence to the realm of Ireland. Its happy effects were immediately perceived, although the execution by no means corresponded with the original idea. Buildings were slowly erected; British tenants were difficult to be procured in sufficient numbers; the old natives were at hand, offered higher rents, and were received into those districts from which it was intended to exclude them. In this particular, the Londoners were accused of being notoriously delinquent. They acted entirely by agents; their agents were interested and indolent, and therefore readily countenanced this dangerous intrusion of the natives: an error of which sufficient cause was afterwards found to repent. For the present, however, a number of loyal and industrious inhabitants was poured into the northern counties, considerable improvements made by the planters, and many towns created. To encourage their industry, and advance his own project, the king was pleased to incorporate several of these towns, so that they had a right of representation in the Irish parliament.\n\nThe only disturbance that now ensued was from the Popish party, who never could bear to see the Protestant religion established in preference to their own, while they had power to resist. After numberless ineffectual machinations and complaints, their fury broke out in a terrible massacre of the new English settlers in the year 1641*. The affairs of Britain were at that time in such confusion, that the rebellion could not be quelled in less than ten years; during which time the country was reduced to a most deplorable situation. It recovered again under Cromwell, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> II., and the short reign of James II. On the accession of William III., matters were once more thrown into confusion by an attempt made in favour of the exiled monarch, who came over thither in person, and whose bad success is related under the article BRITAIN, No. 309\u2014325. Since that time, Ireland hath recovered from the miserable situation to which it was so long reduced. As yet, however, it is far from being in such a flourishing state as either South or North Britain. One great obstacle to the improvement of the kingdom is the extreme poverty and oppression of the common people. The produce of the kingdom, either in corn or cattle, is not above two-thirds at most of what by good cultivation it might yield. The high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> throughout the southern and western parts are lined with beggars, who live in huts or cabins without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIMNEYS\">chimneys</a>, or any covering capable of defending the wretched inhabitants from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>. \"It is a scandal (says a judicious traveller, who lately visited Ireland) to the proprietors of this fertile country, that there is not the greatest plenty of good corn and hay in it; but some of the best land in the king's dominions is suffered to be torn in pieces, and cultivated in the vilest manner, by a set of abject miserable occupiers; who are absolutely no better than slaves to the despicable, lazy, and oppreive subordinated landlords.\"\n\nAnother cause consisted in the various restrictions Origin of which it had been thought proper to lay upon the Irish the Irish trade; and the constant and great preference given by discontented the most grievous discontented and distresses. On the part of England it was supposed, that as Ireland had meant for been subdued by force of arms, the inhabitants ought and again in every respect to be subject to the victorious state; and that the interest of the English ought on all occasions to be consulted, without regarding the inconveniences which might ensue to the Irish. A very different idea, however, was entertained by the Irish themselves, or at least by the patriotic party among them. They rejected all notions of dependence upon the British ministry and parliament; and though they did not scruple to acknowledge the king's right of conquest, they most positively denied that the British parliament had any authority whatever over them; and therefore looked upon the restrictions laid upon their trade as the most grievous and intolerable oppression.\n\nIn the year 1719, according to Mr Crawford, the cause of oppression and grievances of Ireland became altogether Sherlock insupportable. A cause relative to an estate, between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a> Heffer Sherlock and Maurice Anneley, was tried before the court of exchequer in Ireland. Here the latter obtained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> in his favour; but, on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a>, the sentence was reversed by the lords. Anneley appealed from them to the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEERS\">peers</a>; who having reversed the judgment of those of Ireland, he was put in possession of the estate in dispute. Sherlock appealed again to the Irish lords, and the matter became very serious. It was proposed to the consideration of the judges, Whether by the laws of the land an appeal lies from a decree of the court of exchequer in Ireland to the king in parliament in Britain? This question being determined in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>, Sherlock was again put in possession of the estate. A petition was some time after presented to the house by Alexander Burrowes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a> of Kildare, setting forth, \"That his predecessor in office had put Sherlock in possession of the premises; that, upon his entering into office, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INJUNCTION\">injunction</a>, agreeable to the order of the English peers, issued from the exchequer, requiring him to restore Maurice Anneley to the possession of the above-mentioned lands; and that, not daring to act in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> to the order of the house, he was fined. In consequence of this, being afraid lest he should be taken into custody, he durst not come in to pass his accounts; and for this he was peers fined 1200l.\" His conduct was applauded by the Irish lords, who commanded the fines imposed upon him to England.\nIreland be taken off; and in a short time after drew up a memorial to be presented to his majesty. In this they set forth, that having submitted to Henry II. as their liege lord, they had from him obtained the benefit of English law, with many other privileges, particularly that of having a distinct parliament. In consequence of this concession, the English had been encouraged to come over and settle in Ireland, where they were to enjoy the same privileges as in their own country. They farther insisted, that though the imperial crown of Ireland was annexed to that of Britain, yet being a distinct dominion, and no part of the kingdom of England, none could determine with regard to its affairs, but such as were authorized by its known laws and customs, or the express consent of the king. It was an invasion of his majesty's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a> for any court of judicature to take upon them to declare, that he could not by his authority in parliament determine all controversies between his subjects of this kingdom; or that, when they appealed to his majesty in parliament, they did not bring their cause before a competent judicature; and they represented, that the practice of appeals from the Irish parliament to the British peers was an usurped jurisdiction assumed by the latter; the bad consequences of which they pointed out very fully.\n\nThis representation being laid before his majesty in parliament, it was resolved, that the barons of exchequer in Ireland had acted with courage and fidelity, according to law, &c. and an address was presented to his majesty, praying him to confer on them some mark of his royal favour as a recompense for the injuries they had sustained from the Irish legislature. This was followed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> for the better securing the dependency of Ireland upon the crown of Great Britain. By this it was determined, \"That the house of lords of Ireland have not, nor of right ought to have, any jurisdiction to judge of, affirm, or reverse, any judgment, sentence, or decree, given or made in any court within the kingdom; and that all proceedings before the said house of lords, upon any such judgment or decree, are utterly null and void to all intents and purposes whatever.\" It was also determined in this bill, that \"the king's majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons of Great Britain in parliament assembled, hath, and of right ought to have, full power and authority to make laws and statutes of sufficient force and validity to bind the people of Ireland.\"\n\nThis bill was looked upon by the Irish to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to a total annihilation of their liberties; and they were still farther exasperated in the year 1724, by the patent granted to one Wood an Englishman to coin halfpence and farthings for the use of Ireland. In this affair Wood is said to have acted very dishonourably; insomuch that a threepenny piece of the halfpence he made were scarcely worth a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENNY\">penny</a>. Great quantities of this base coin were sent over; and it was used not only in change, but accounts were likely to be paid in it, so that dangerous consequences seemed ready to ensue. The Irish parliament, in an address to the king, represented that they were called upon by their country to lay before his majesty the ill consequences of Wood's patent, and that it was likely to be attended with a diminution of the revenue and the ruin of trade.\n\nThe same was set forth in an application made to his majesty by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-PRIVY_COUNCIL\">privy council</a>. In short, the whole nation seemed to unite their efforts in order to remedy an evil of such dangerous tendency, the effects of which already began to be felt.\n\nAmong the controversial pieces which appeared on Dr Swift in this occasion, those of Dr Swift were particularly distinguished. His Drapier's letters are to this day held in grateful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> by his countrymen; but he was in danger of fulfilling deeply in the cause. He Wood had been at particular pains to explain an argument used by the Irish on this occasion, viz. that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> money, being illegal, could not be forced upon the nation by the king, without exceeding the limits of his prerogative. Hence the opposite party took occasion to charge the Irish with a design of calling off their dependence on Britain altogether; but Swift having examined the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a> with freedom, pointed out the encroachments made by the British parliament on the liberties of Ireland; and asserted, that any dependence on England, except that of being subjects to the same king, was contrary to the law of reason, nature, and nations, as well as to the law of the land. This publication was so disagreeable to government, that they offered a reward of \u00a3500 for the discovery of the author; but as nobody could be found who would give him up, the printer was prosecuted in his stead; however, he was unanimously acquitted by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a> of his countrymen.\n\nThe Irish continued to be jealous of their liberties, while the British ministry seemed to watch every opportunity of encroaching upon them as far as possible. Apprehensions being entertained of a design upon Ireland by the partisans of the pretender in 1715, a vote of credit to government was passed by the house of commons to a considerable amount. This laid the foundation of the national debt of that kingdom, which was quickly augmented to several hundred thousand pounds; for discharge of which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> had been provided by administration. An attempt was made during the administration of Lord Carteret (who governed Ireland till 1730), to vest this fund in the hands of his majesty and of his heirs for ever, redeemable by parliament. This was opposed by the patriotic party, who insisted, that it was inconsistent with the public safety, and unconstitutional, to grant it longer than from secession to secession. In 1731 another attempt was made to vest the same in the crown for 21 years; but when the affair came to be debated, the strength of both parties was found to be equally balanced. Immediately before the vote, however, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> Tottingham having rode off on the occasion, arrived in the house, and determined the question against government.\n\nThe behaviour of Lord Chesterfield, who was made governor of Ireland in 1745, is highly extolled, on account of his moderation, and the favour he showed to the liberties of the people. As the apprehensions of government were then very considerable, on account of the rebellion which raged in Scotland, his lordship was advised to augment the military force of Ireland by 4000 men. Instead of this, however, he sent four battalions to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a>, and encouraged the volunteer associations which formed in different parts for the defence of their country. These battalions\nIreland, he replaced by additional companies to the regiments already on the establishment; by which means he saved a considerable expense to the nation, without augmenting the influence of the crown. The supplies asked by him were small, and raised in the most easy and agreeable manner to the people, expending the money at the same time with the utmost economy. There was even a saving, which he applied to the use of the public. It had been a custom with many of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a>-governors of Ireland to bestow reversionary grants, in order to purchase the affluence of friends in support of their measures. Lord Chesterfield, however, being convinced that this practice was prejudicial to the interest of the nation, put a stop to it; but the most remarkable part of his administration was the humanity with which he treated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMAN_CATHOLICS\">Roman Catholics</a>. Before his arrival, the Romish chapels in Dublin had been shut up; their priests were commanded by proclamation to leave the kingdom; and such as disobeyed had been subjected to imprisonment and other penalties. Lord Chesterfield, however, convinced that the affection is to be engaged by gentle usage, permitted them to exercise their religion without disturbance. The accusations brought against them of forming plots against government were disregarded; and so much was his moderation and uprightness in this respect applauded by all parties, that, during the whole time of his administration, the national tranquillity was not once interrupted by the smallest internal commotion. On his leaving the island, his butt was placed at the public expense in the cattle of Dublin.\n\nLord Chesterfield having left Ireland in the spring of 1746, the island continued to be governed by lords justices until the 13th of September, when William earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARRINGTON\">Harrington</a> came over with the powers of lord lieutenant. A contest in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of representatives for the city of Dublin this year called forth the abilities of Mr Charles Lucas, so much celebrated for his patriotic virtues. Having some years before been admitted a member of the common council, he resolved to exert himself in behalf of the privileges of his fellow-citizens. The powers of this city-corporation, as well as of others, had been changed by authority derived from an act in the time of Charles II.; and among other innovations, for the purpose of augmenting the influence of the crown, they deprived the commons of the power of choosing the city magistrates. This was now veiled in the board of aldermen; which being subject in the exercise of its jurisdiction to the approbation of the privy-council, was consequently dependent on government. Mr Lucas complained loudly of the injury; but as this law could not be altered, he set himself to inquire, whether encroachments, which could not be justified by law, had not been made on the rights of the citizens? Having satisfied himself, by searching diligently into ancient records, that his apprehensions were well founded, he published his discoveries, explained the nature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> resulting from them, and encouraged the people to take the proper steps for obtaining redress.\n\nThe consequence of this was a contest between the commons and aldermen, which lasted two years. The former struggled in vain to recover their lost privileges; but the exertions of Lucas in every stage of the dispute had rendered him so respectable among his countrymen, that on the death of Sir James Somerville he was encouraged to declare himself a candidate for a seat in parliament. This being highly agreeable to his wishes, he was elected accordingly; and distinguished himself not only by the boldness and energy of his speeches, but more especially by a number of addresses to his countrymen. In some of these he particularly considered the several branches of the constitution, and pointed out the encroachments of the British legislature. Government, alarmed at his boldness, determined to crush him by the hand of power; for which reason the most obnoxious paragraphs were extracted from his works, and made the foundation of a charge before parliament. The commons voted him an enemy to his country; and addressed the lord-lieutenant for an order to prosecute him by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTORNEY_GENERAL\">attorney-general</a>. The universal esteem in which he was held could not screen him from ministerial vengeance: he was driven from Ireland; but having spent some years in banishment, he was once more enabled, through the exertions of his friends, to present himself as a candidate for the city of Dublin. Being again elected, he continued to distinguish himself by the same virtuous principles for which he had been from the beginning so remarkable, and died with the character which he had preserved through life, of the incorruptible Lucas.\n\nIn the year 1753, a remarkable contest took place betwixt government and the Irish parliament relative to previous consent. As the taxes for defraying state expenses are imposed by the representatives of the previous people, it thence naturally follows, that they have a consent right to superintend the expenditure of them; and by an inspection of the journals of the house of commons, it appeared, that from the year 1692, they had exercised a right of calling for and examining the public accounts. When any surplus remained in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>, it was also customary to dispose of it by bill for the good of the public. In the year 1749, however, a considerable sum having remained in the treasury, the disposal of this money in future became an object to ministry. In 1751, it was intimated to parliament by the lord lieutenant, the duke of Dorset, that his majesty would graciously consent and recommend it to them, that such part of the money as then remained in the treasury should be applied to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of the national debt. As this implied a right inherent in his majesty to dispose of the money as he thought proper, the proposal was accounted an invasion of the privileges of the house of commons. No notice was therefore taken of the direction given by Dorset, but the bill was sent over to England as usual without any notice taken of his majesty's consent. In England, however, this very material alteration was made, and the word consent introduced into it. The commons at this time did not take any notice of such an essential alteration; but next year, on its being repeated, the bill was rejected. Government were now at the utmost pains to defend the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> they had adopted, and pamphlets were published in which it was justified on various grounds. The event at last, however, was, that his majesty by letter took the money which had been the subject of dispute out of the treasury.\n\nIn the year 1760 Ireland sustained an inconsiderable invasion by hostile invasion, the first that had been experienced in Ireland in the 1760s.\nIreland. the kingdom for 70 years. The armament consisted originally of five ships; one of 48 guns, two of 36, and two of 24; having on board 1270 land forces. They were commanded by the celebrated Thurot, whose reputation, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a> of a privateer, had advanced him to this dignity. The squadron, however, was driven by adverse winds to Gottenburgh; where having continued a few days, they fell fail for the place of their destination. On their arrival at the coast of Ireland, they were obliged to shelter themselves in Lough Foyle from a violent storm which again overtook them. The wind, however, having shifted, and continuing to blow tempestuously, they were obliged to keep out to sea. Two of the ships were thus separated from the rest by the violence of the storm, and returned to France; but the remaining three directed their course to the island of Ilay, where they anchored; and having repaired their damages, took in a supply of provisions, and thence sailed to Carrickfergus.\n\nIn the mean time, an officer belonging to the small number of troops at that time in Carrickfergus took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> on a rising ground, with an advanced party, to observe the motions of the enemy. A skirmish ensued between this party and Thurot's men, until the former, having expended all their ammunition, were obliged to retire into the town. Having vainly attempted to prevent the enemy from taking possession of it, the British troops shut themselves up in the castle, where they were soon obliged to capitulate, after having killed about 100 of their enemies, with the loss of only three on their own part. The French having plundered the town, fell on the 26th of February; and three days after were all taken by Captain Elliot, Thurot himself being killed in the engagement.\n\nSoon after the accession of George III., Ireland first began to be disturbed by a banditti who styled themselves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">White</a> Boys; and as these were generally of the Roman Catholic persuasion, the prejudices against that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> broke forth in the usual manner. A plot was alleged to have been formed against government; French and Spanish emigrants to have been sent over to Ireland, and actually to be employed to assist in carrying it into execution. The real cause of this commotion, however, was as follows: About the year 1739 the murrain broke out among the horned cattle in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUCHY\">duchy</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLSTEIN\">Holstein</a>, from whence it soon after spread through the other parts of Germany. From Germany it reached <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, from whence it was carried over to England, where it raged with great violence for a number of years. The mitigation of the penal laws against the papists about this time encouraged the natives of the south of Ireland to turn their thoughts towards agriculture, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> began to enjoy the necessaries of life in a comfortable manner. A foreign demand for beef and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a>, however, having become uncommonly great, by reason of the cattle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DITTO\">ditto</a> just mentioned, ground appropriated to grazing became more valuable than that employed in tillage. The cottars were everywhere dispossessed of their little possessions, which the landlords let to monopolizers who could afford a higher rent. Whole baronies were now laid open to pasturage, while the former inhabitants were driven desperate for want of subsistence. Numbers of them fled to the large cities, or emigrated to foreign countries, while those who remained took small spots of land, about an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a> each, at an exorbitant price, where they endeavoured if possible to procure the means of protracting a miserable existence for themselves and families. For some time these poor creatures were allowed by the more humane landlords the liberty of commonage; but afterwards this was taken away, in despite of justice and a positive agreement; at the same time, the payment of tythes, and the low price of labour, not exceeding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> in the days of Queen Elizabeth, aggravated the distresses of the unhappy sufferers beyond measure.\n\nIn such a situation, it is no wonder that illegal methods were pursued in expectation of redress. The people, covered with white shirts, assembled in parties at night, turned up the ground, destroyed bullocks, levelled the inclosures of the commons, and committed other acts of violence. These unavailing efforts were construed into a plot against the government; numbers of the rioters were apprehended in the counties of Limerick, Cork, and Tipperary, and some of them condemned and executed. In different places these unhappy wretches, instead of being looked upon as objects of compassion, were prosecuted with the utmost severity. Judge Afton, however, who was sent over to try them, executed his office with such humanity as did him the highest honour. A most extraordinary and affecting instance of this was, that on his return from Dublin, for above ten miles from Clonmell, both sides of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> were lined with men, women, and children; who, as he passed along, kneeled down and implored the blessing of heaven upon him as their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">guardian</a> and protector.\n\nIn the mean time, the violences of the White Boys continued, notwithstanding that many examples were made. The idea of rebellion was still kept up; and, without the smallest foundation, gentlemen of the first rank were publicly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with being concerned in it, inasmuch that some of them were obliged to enter bail, in order to protect themselves from injury. The Catholics of Waterford gave in a petition to Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol10.html#article-HERTFORD\">Hertford</a>, the governor in 1765, in behalf of themselves and brethren, professing their loyalty and obedience to government; but no effectual step was taken either to remove or even to investigate the cause of the disturbances.\n\nAbout two years after the appearance of the White Boys, a similar commotion arose in Ulster; which, however, proceeded in part from a different cause, and was of much shorter duration. By an act of parliament, the making and repairing of highways in Ireland was formerly a grievous imposition on the lower ranks of people. An housekeeper who had no horse was obliged to work at them six days in the year; and if he had a horse, the labour of both was required for the same space of time. Besides this oppression, the poor complained that they were frequently obliged to work at roads made for the convenience of individuals, and which were of no service to the public. Nor were these the only grievances of which the insurgents at this time complained: the tythes exacted by the clergy were said to be unreasonable, and the rent of lands was more than they could bear. In 1763, therefore, being exacerbated by a road promised to be made through a part of the county of Armagh, the inhabitants most immediately affected by it rose in a body, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECLA\">decla</a>-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> that they would make no more highways of the kind. As a mark of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a>, they wore oak branches in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-HATS\">hats</a>, from which circumstance they called themselves Oak-boys. The number of their partizans soon increased, and the insurrection became general through the counties of Armagh, Tyrone, Derry, and Fermanagh. In a few weeks, however, they were dispersed by parties of the military; and the public tranquillity was restored with the loss of only two or three lives. The road act, which had been justly found fault with, was repealed next session; and it was determined, that for the future the roads should be made and repaired by a tax to be equally assessed on the lands of the rich and poor.\n\nBesides these, another set of insurgents called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">Steel</a>-boys soon made their appearance, on the following account. The estate of an absentee nobleman happening to be out of lease, he proposed, instead of an additional rent, to take fines from his tenants. Many of those, who at that time possessed his lands, were unable to comply with his terms; while others who could afford to do so, insisted upon a greater rent from the immediate tenants than they were able to pay. The usual consequences of this kind of oppression instantly took place. Numbers being dispossessed and thrown destitute, were forced into acts of outrage similar to those already mentioned. One of these charged with felony was carried to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELFAST\">Belfast</a>, in order to be committed to the county gaol; but his associates, provoked by the outrage they had received, determined to relieve him. The design was eagerly entered into by great numbers all over the country; and several thousands, having provided themselves with offensive weapons, proceeded to Belfast in order to rescue the prisoners. To prevent this, he was removed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRACKS\">barracks</a> and put under the guard of a party of soldiers quartered there; but the Steel-boys pressed forward with a determination to accomplish their purpose by force, and some shots were actually exchanged between them and the soldiers. The consequences would undoubtedly have been fatal, had it not been for a physician of highly respectable character, who interposed at the risk of his life, and prevailed on those concerned to let the prisoner at liberty. The tumult, however, was not thus quelled. The number of insurgents daily increased, and the violences committed by them were much greater than those of the other two parties. Some were taken and tried at Carrickfergus, but none condemned. It was supposed that the fear of popular resentment had influenced the judges; for which reason an act was passed, enjoining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> of such prisoners for the future to be held in counties different from those where the crimes were committed. This breach of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> law of the constitution gave such offence, that though several of the Steel-boys were afterwards taken up and carried to the castle of Dublin, no jury would find them guilty. This obnoxious law was therefore repealed; after which some of the insurgents, being tried in their respective counties, were condemned and executed. Thus the commotions were extinguished; but as no methods were taken to remove the cause, the continued distresses of the people drove many thousands of them into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> in a very few years.\n\nIn the meantime a very material alteration had taken place in the constitution of the kingdom, with regard to the duration of parliaments. At an early period these had continued only for a year; but afterwards they were prolonged until the death of a sovereign, unless he chose to dissolve it sooner by an exercise of his prerogative. Thus, from the moment of their election, the commoners of Ireland were in a manner totally independent of the people and under the influence of the crown; and government soon availed itself of this power to bribe a majority to serve its own purposes. Various methods were thought of to remedy this evil; but all proved ineffectual until the year 1768, when, during the administration of Lord Townshend, a bill was prepared and sent over to England, by which it was enacted, that the Irish parliaments thenceforth should be held every seven years.\n\nIt was returned with the addition of one year; and Parliament ever since the parliaments of this country have been of Ireland octennial. During this session an attempt was made by the British ministry to infringe the rights of the octennial house of commons in a very material point. A money bill, which had not originated in Ireland, was sent money-bill over from Britain, but was rejected in a spirited manner. Its rejection gave great offence to the lord lieutenant, who repeatedly prorogued them till the year 1771.\n\nThe affairs of Ireland began now to draw towards that crisis which effected the late remarkable revolution in favour of the liberties of the people. The passing of the octennial bill had diminished, but not taken away, the influence of the crown; and the situation of affairs between Britain and America had inclined ministry to make the most of this influence they could. In 1773 Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARCOURT\">Harcourt</a>, at that time governor of Ireland, exerted himself so powerfully in favour of administration, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of opposition in parliament was almost entirely silenced. The difficulties, however, under which the whole nation laboured began state of Ireland to be so severely felt, that an address on the subject was presented by the commons to his excellency. In lord lieutenant they told him, that they hoped he would lay before the king the state of Ireland, restricted in its commerce from the short-fighted policy of former times, to the great injury of the kingdom, and the advantage of the rivals, if not of the enemies, of Great Britain. These hardships, they said, were not only unpatriotic, but unjust; and they told his excellency plainly, that they expected to be restored to some, if not to all their rights, which alone could justify them to their constituents for laying upon them so many burdens during the course of this session.\n\nThis representation to the lord lieutenant produced no effect; and Ireland for some years longer continued to groan under the burden of intolerable restrictions. These had principally taken place in the reign of Charles II. At this time it was enacted, that beef or live cattle should not be exported to England; neither were the commodities of Ireland to be exported to the American colonies, nor American goods to be imported to any port in Ireland without first unloading them in some part of England or Wales. All trade with Asia was excluded by charters granted to particular companies; and restrictions were imposed upon almost every valuable article of commerce sent to the different ports of Europe. Towards the end of King\nKing William's reign an absolute prohibition was laid on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a> of Irish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>. This restriction proved disadvantageous not only to Ireland, but to Great Britain herself. The French were now plentifully supplied by smuggling with Irish wool; and not only enabled to furnish woollen stuffs sufficient for their own consumption, but even to vie with the British in foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARKETS\">markets</a>. Other restrictions conspired to augment the national calamity, but that which was most sensibly felt took place in 1776. \"There had hitherto (says Mr Crawford) been exported annually to America large quantities of Irish linens; this very considerable source of national advantage was now shut up, under pretence of rendering it more difficult for the enemy to be supplied with the means of subsistence; but in reality, to enable a few rapacious English contractors to fulfil their engagements, an embargo, which continued, was in 1776 laid upon the exportation of provisions from Ireland, by an unconstitutional stretch of prerogative. Remittances to England, on various accounts, particularly for the payment of our forces abroad, were more than usually considerable. These immediate causes being combined with those which were invariable and permanent, produced in this country very calamitous effects. Black cattle fell very considerably in their value; notwithstanding that, customers could not be had. The price of wool was reduced in a still greater proportion. Rents everywhere fell; nor, in many places, was it possible to collect them. An universal stagnation of business ensued. Credit was very materially injured. Farmers were pressed by extreme necessity, and many of them failed. Numbers of manufacturers were reduced to extreme necessity, and would have perished, had they not been supported by public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARITY\">charity</a>. Those of every rank and condition were deeply affected by the calamity of the times. Had the state of the exchequer permitted, grants might have been made to promote industry, and to alleviate the national distress; but it was exhausted to a very uncommon degree. Almost every branch of the revenue had failed. From want of money the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a> law could not be carried into execution. We could not pay our forces abroad; and, to enable us to pay those at home, there was a necessity for borrowing \u00a350,000l. from England. The money which parliament was forced to raise, it was obliged to borrow at an exorbitant interest. England, in its present state, was afflicted with the wretched condition to which our affairs were reduced. Individuals there, who had estates in Ireland, were sharers of the common calamity; and the attention of individuals in the British parliament was turned to our situation, who had even no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> interest in this country.\"\n\nWhile things were in this deplorable situation, Earl Nugent, in the year 1778, undertook the cause of the Irish, by moving in parliament, that their affairs should be taken into consideration by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> of the whole house. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> being agreed to almost unanimously, it was followed by several others, viz. That the Irish might be permitted to export directly to the British plantations, or to the settlements on the coasts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, all goods being the produce and manufacture of the kingdom, excepting only wool, or woollen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>, &c. That all goods, being the produce of any of the British plantations, or of the settlements on the coast of Africa, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a> excepted, be allowed to be imported directly from Ireland to all places, Britain excepted. That cotton yarn, the manufacture of Ireland, be allowed to be imported into Great Britain. That glass manufactured in Ireland be permitted to be exported to all places, Britain excepted.\u2014With respect to the Irish sail cloth and cordage, it was moved, that they should have the same privilege as for the cotton yarn.\n\nThese motions having passed unanimously, bills for Petitions for the relief of Ireland were framed upon them accordingly. The trading and manufacturing towns of England, however, now took the alarm, and petitions against the Irish indulgence were brought forward from many different quarters, and numbers infructuous to oppose it. In consequence of this a warm contest took place on the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> of the bills. Mr Burke supported them with all the strength of his eloquence; and as the minister seemed to favour them, they were committed; though the violent opposition to them still continued, which induced many of their friends at that time to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> their cause.\n\nThough the efforts of those who favoured the cause of Ireland thus proved unsuccessful for the present, they renewed their endeavours before the Christmas vacation. They now urged, that, independent of all claims from justice and humanity, the relief of Ireland was enforced by necessity. The trade with British America was now lost for ever; and it was indispensably requisite to unite the remaining parts of the empire in one common interest and affection. Ireland had hitherto been pallive; but there was danger that, by driving her to extremities, she would cast off the yoke altogether; or, even if this should not happen, the tyranny of Britain would be of little advantage; as, on the event of a peace, the people would desert a country in which they had experienced such oppression, and emigrate to America, where they had a greater prospect of liberty. On the other hand, they insisted, that very considerable advantages must ensue to Britain by the emancipation of Ireland; and every benefit extended to that country would be returned with accumulated interest. The difficulties were at last summed up in a motion made by Lord Newhaven, in February 1769, that liberty should be granted to the Irish to import sugars from the West Indies. This was carried; but the petitioners of Glasgow and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a> having petitioned against it, it was again lost through the interference of the minister, who now exerted his influence against the relief he had formerly declared in favour of. Various other efforts, however, were made to effect the intended purpose; but nothing more could be obtained than a kind of compromise, by which Lord Gower pledged himself, as far as he could answer for the conduct of others, that, during the recess, some plan should be fallen upon for accommodating the affairs of Ireland to the satisfaction of all parties.\n\nIn the mean time the affairs of this country hastened to a crisis; which forced the British ministry to give that relief so long solicited, and which they often promised without any intention of performing their promises. As long as the affairs of the country were under consideration of the British parliament, the inhabitants...\nhabitants preserved some degree of patience; but, when they found themselves deserted by the minister, their discontent was inflamed beyond measure. The laws he had passed in their favour, viz. an allowance to plant tobacco, and a bill for encouraging the growth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEMP\">hemp</a>, were considered as mockery instead of relief, and it was now resolved to take such measures as should effectually convince the ministry that it was not their interest to tyrannize any longer. With this view, associations against the importation of British commodities, which had been entered into in some places before, now became universal throughout the kingdom; and such as presumed to oppose the voice of the people in this respect, had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> to find themselves exposed to public obloquy and contempt on that account. Thus the Irish manufacturers began to revive; and the people of Britain found themselves obliged seriously to take into consideration the relief of that country, and to look upon it as a matter very necessary to their own interest. To this also they were still more seriously disposed by the military associations, which had taken place some time before, and now assumed a most formidable appearance. These at first were formed by accidental causes. The situation of Britain, for some time, had not admitted of any effectual method being taken for the defence of Ireland. Its coasts had been insulted, and the trading ships taken by the French and American <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIVATEERS\">privateers</a>; nor was it at all improbable that an invasion might soon follow.\n\n\"The minister (says Mr Crawford) told us, that the situation of Britain was such as rendered her incapable of protecting us. The weakness of government, from the following circumstance, was strikingly obvious. The mayor of Belfast having transmitted a memorial to the lord lieutenant, setting forth the unprotected state of the coast, and requesting a body of the military for its defence, received for answer, that he could not afford him any other assistance than half a troop of dismounted horse and half a company of invalids.\"\n\nIn this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DILEMMA\">dilemma</a>, a number of the inhabitants of the town associated for the purpose of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SELF_DEFENCE\">self-defence</a>; and, on the same principle, a few volunteer companies were formed in different parts of the kingdom. These chose their own officers, purchased their own uniforms and arms, and, with the assistance of persons properly qualified, assembled regularly on the parade to acquire a knowledge in the military art. Their respectable appearance, and the zeal they showed in the service of their country, soon excited curiosity and attracted respect. Their number increased every day; and people of the first consequence became ambitious of being enrolled among them. As no foreign enemy appeared, against whom they might exercise their military prowess, these patriotic bands soon began to turn their thoughts towards a deliverance from domestic oppression. No sooner was this idea made known, that it gave new vigour to the spirit of volunteering; insomuch that, by the end of 1778, the military associations were thought to amount at least to 30,000 men. But, while thus formidable from their numbers, and openly avowing their intention to demand a restitution of their rights from the British ministry, they professed the utmost loyalty and affection to the king; and with regard to sobriety and decent demeanor, they were not only unexceptionable, but exemplary. Instead of exciting disorders themselves, they restrained every kind of irregularity, and exerted themselves with unanimity and vigour for the execution of the laws.\n\nThat such a body of armed men, acting without any command or support from government, should be an object of apprehension to ministry, is not to be wondered at. In the infancy of their associations indeed they might have been suppressed; but matters had been suffered to proceed too far; and, as they flood at present, all resistance was vain. As the volunteers could not be controlled, some attempts were made to bring them under the influence of the crown; but this being found impossible, ministry thought proper to treat them supplied with an appearance of confidence; and, accordingly, with arms orders were filled for supplying them with 16,000 infantry.\n\nThe Irish parliament, thus encouraged by the spirit the militia of the nation, and piqued by the difficulties arising from the diminished value of their estates, resolved to exert themselves in a becoming manner, in order to procure relief to their country. At their meeting in October 1779, an address to his majesty was drawn up; in which it was expressly declared, that \"it was not by temporary expedients, but by a free trade alone, that Ireland was now to be saved from impending ruin.\" When this address was carried up to the lord lieutenant, the streets of Dublin were lined with volunteers, commanded by the duke of Leinster, in their arms and uniform. But, though a general expectation of relief was now diffused, an anxious fear of disappointment still continued. If the usual supply was granted for two years, there was danger of the distresses continuing for all that time; and after it was granted, the prorogation of parliament might put a stop to the expected relief altogether. The people, however, were not now to be trifled with. As the court-party showed an aversion to comply with the popular measures, a mob rose in Dublin, who, among riotous acts of violence, pulled down the house of the Dublin attorney-general, and did their utmost to compel the members to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> their countenance to the matter in hand. When the point therefore came to be debated, some espoused the popular side from principle, others from necessity; so that on the whole a majority appeared in favour of it. A short money-bill was passed and transmitted to England; where, though very mortifying to the ministry, it palled also.\n\nOn the meeting of the British parliament in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>, the affairs of Ireland were first taken into consideration in the house of peers. The necessity of granting gainful relief to that kingdom was strongly set forth by the lord who introduced them. He said, the Irish, now parliament, conscious of possessing a force and consequence to which they had hitherto been strangers, had resolved to apply it to obtain the advantages of which the nation, by this spirited exertion, now showed themselves worthy. Had they for some time before been gratified in lesser matters, they would now have received with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>, what they would, as affairs stood at present, consider only as a matter of right. He then moved for a vote of censure on his majesty's ministers for their neglect of Ireland. This motion was rejected; but Earl Gower, who had now deferred the cause of ministry, declared, that there did not exist in his mind a single doubt that the vote of censure was not\nnot well founded. He added, in his own vindication, that early in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> he had promised that relief should be granted to Ireland, and had done everything in his power to keep his word; but that all his efforts had proved fruitless.\n\nIn the house of commons the minister found himself so hard pressed by the arguments of the minority, and the short money-bill from Ireland, that he was obliged to declare, than in less than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> he intended to move for a committee of the whole house to take the affairs of Ireland into consideration. On the 13th of December he accordingly brought forward his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a> in favour of this kingdom. The design of these was to repeal the laws prohibiting the exportation of Irish manufactures made of wool or wool flocks; to repeal as much of the act of 19th Geo. II. as prohibited the importation of glaas into Ireland, except of British manufacture, or the exportation of glaas from Ireland; and to permit the Irish to export and import commodities to and from the West Indies and the British settlements on the coast of Africa, subject to such regulations and restrictions as should be imposed by the Irish parliament.\n\nOn these propositions his lordship made several remarks by way of explanation. One object of them, he said, was to restore to Ireland the wool export and woollen manufacture. In 1692, from jealousy or some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a>, an address had been presented by the English parliament, recommending a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> between the two kingdoms; the terms of which were, that England should enjoy the woollen manufacture, and Ireland the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>, exclusively. But notwithstanding this agreement, it was certain, that England carried on the linen manufacture to as great extent as Ireland, while at the same time the former retained the monopoly of woollens. The first step taken, in consequence of this agreement, was to lay a heavy duty, equal to a prohibition, upon all wool and woollen exported; and when this act, which was but a temporary one by way of experiment, expired, the English parliament passed a similar one, and made it perpetual; by means of which and some others a total end was put to the woollen trade of Ireland.\n\nWith regard to the trade of Ireland, his lordship observed, that, upon an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> of the six years from 1766 to 1772, the export to Ireland was somewhat more than two millions; and, in the succeeding five years, from 1772 to 1778, about as much more: nearly one-half being British manufacture and produce; the other half certified articles, of which this country was the medium of conveyance. The native produce on an average, was somewhat more than 900,000l. but of this only 200,000l. were woollens. The woollen manufacture of Ireland therefore would long continue in a state of infancy; and though cloths had been manufactured sufficient for home consumption, yet it could hardly be expected that Ireland would rival Great Britain at the foreign markets, when, after the expense of land-carriage, freight, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INSURANCE\">insurance</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTORAGE\">factorage</a>, the latter was able to undersell Ireland in her own market on the very spot, even though aided by the low wages and taxes paid in the country.\n\nWith regard to the linen, his lordship observed, that however prosperous it might appear, yet still it was capable of great improvement. The idea of extending and improving the linen manufactures of Ireland originated from a pamphlet written by Sir William Temple; and this gave rise to the compact which had been referred to. But though this compact was now about to be dissolved, it was his opinion that the bounties on importing Irish linens ought not to be discontinued; because it appeared, that the British bounties had operated as a great encouragement to the Irish manufactures, at the same time that the sum appropriated to this purpose amounted to more than 13,000l.\n\nWith regard to the dissolution of the compact betwixt England and Ireland, he observed, that, as a more liberal spirit had now appeared on both sides of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, he hoped both kingdoms would be perfectly contented. Ireland would never be able to rival England in the fine woollen fabrics; but allowing the Irish to manufacture their own wool, would put an end to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRABAND\">contraband</a> trade with France; and it ought to be remembered, that whatever was an advantage to Ireland, must sooner or later be of singular advantage to Great Britain, and by the proposed regulations in their commercial connections, the two kingdoms would be put more upon an equality.\n\nWith regard to the glaas manufacture, his lordship likewise observed, that Ireland had been very injuriously treated. Before the act of 19th Geo. II. they had begun to make some progress in the lower branches of the glaas manufacture; but by that act they were not only prevented from importing any other glaas than what was of British manufacture, but also from exporting their own glaas, or putting it on a horse or carriage with a design to be exported. This act had been complained of in Ireland as a piece of great injustice, and it was the intention of his proposition to remove that grievance.\n\nWith regard to the third proposition, his lordship observed, that allowing Ireland a free trade to the colonies must be considered as a favour to that kingdom. Considering her even as an independent state, she could set up no claim to an intercourse with the British colonies. By every principle of justice, of the laws of nations, and the custom of the other European powers who had settlements and distant dependencies, the mother country had an exclusive right to trade with, and to forbid all others from having any intercourse with them. Were not this the case, what nation under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> would spend their blood and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> in establishing a colony, and protecting and defending it in its infant state, if other nations were afterwards to reap the advantages derived from their labour, hazard, and expense. But though Great Britain had a right to restrain Ireland from trading with her colonies, his lordship declared himself of opinion that it would be proper to allow her to participate of the trade. This would be the only prudent means of affording her relief; it would be an unequivocal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the candour and sincerity of Great Britain; and he had not the least doubt but it would be received as such in Ireland. Britain, however, ought not to be a sufferer by her bounty to Ireland; but this would be the case, should the colony trade be thrown open to the latter, without accompanying it with restrictions similar to those which were laid upon the British trade with them. An equal trade must include an equal share of duties and taxes;\ntaxes; and this was the only proper ground on which the benefits expected by the Irish nation could be either granted or refused.\n\nHaving made some other observations on the propriety of these measures, they were regularly formed into motions, and passed unanimously. In Ireland they were received with the utmost joy and gratitude by both houses of parliament. On the 20th of December the following resolutions were passed; viz. That the exportation of woollen and other manufactures from Ireland to all foreign places will materially tend to relieve its distresses, increase its wealth, promote its prosperity, and thereby advance the welfare of Britain, and the common strength, wealth, and commerce of the British empire: that a liberty to trade with the British colonies in America and the West Indies, and the settlements on the coast of Africa, will be productive of very great commercial benefits; will be a most affectionate mark of the regard and attention of Great Britain to the distresses of the kingdom; and will give new vigour to the zeal of his majesty\u2019s brave and loyal people of Ireland, to stand forth in support of his majesty\u2019s person and government, and the interest, the honour, and dignity of the British empire.\u201d\n\nThe same resolutions were, next day, passed in the house of peers.\n\nThe highest encomiums were now passed on Lord North. His exertions in favour of Ireland were declared to have been great and noble; he was styled \u201cthe great advocate of Ireland;\u201d and it was foretold, that he would be of glorious and immortal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> in that kingdom. But while these panegyrics were so lavishly made on the minister, the members in opposition, in the British parliament, were spoken of in very indifferent terms. It was said, that, while they thought the minister did not mean to go into the business of Ireland, they called loudly for censure against him for not doing it; but when it was found that he meant seriously to take their affairs into consideration, they had then safely seceded, and wholly forsook the interest of the kingdom. These censures were so loud, that by a member of the British house of commons wrote a letter to be communicated to his friends in Ireland, in which he represented, that however politic it might be to compliment the minister on the present occasion, it was neither very wise nor generous in the members of the Irish parliament to be so ready in bestowing invectives against their old friends in England. With regard to the minister, it was alleged, that until he was driven to it by the measures adopted in Ireland, his conduct had been extremely equivocal, dilatory, and indecisive. The minority had been justly incensed against him for having so grossly sacrificed the honour of the nation and the dignity of parliament as to refuse any substantial relief to the Irish, until their own exertions had made it appear that every thing which could be done for them by the British parliament was not a matter of choice but of necessity. The minority, it was said, had earnestly and repeatedly laboured to procure relief for the people of Ireland; and if they had now contented themselves with a silent acquiescence in the minister\u2019s propositions, it was only until they should know whether they would be satisfactory to the people of Ireland; and because what was now done, appeared to be more an act of state than of mere parliamentary deliberation and discussion.\n\nTo the propositions already mentioned, Lord North added three others. 1. For repealing the prohibition of exporting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> coin from Great Britain to Ireland, in favour of importing the prohibition to import foreign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-HOPS\">hops</a> into Ireland, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWBACK\">drawback</a> on the exportation of foreign hops. 2. For enabling his majesty\u2019s Irish subjects to become members of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a> company, and to export woollens in British or Irish bottoms to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVANT\">Levant</a>. In support of this last resolution his lordship urged, that it was necessary, because the exportation of woollens having been granted to Ireland, the Irish would naturally expect a share in the Turkey trade, which, as matters stood, was not possible, it having hitherto been a received opinion, that no Irishman could be elected a member of the Turkey company. Notwithstanding all the satisfaction, however, with which the news of these bills were received in Ireland, it was not long before thoughts of a different kind began to take place. It was suggested that a free trade could be but of little use, if held by a precarious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TENURE\">tenure</a>. The repeal of the obnoxious laws was represented as an act of necessity, not of choice, on the part of the British parliament. When that necessity, therefore, no longer existed, the same parliament might recall the benefits it had granted, and again fetter the Irish trade by restrictions perhaps more oppressive than before. To secure the advantages they now possessed, it was necessary that the kingdom should enjoy the benefits of a free constitution. For this the people looked up to the volunteer companies; and the idea of having such a glorious object in their power, augmented the numbers of those which had also been increased from other causes. They had now received the thanks of both houses of parliament, and thus had obtained the sanction of the legislature. Thus many who had formerly scrupled to connect themselves with a lawless body, made no scruple to enter their lists. Government also engaged several of their friends in the volunteer cause. New companies were therefore raised; but whatever might be the political sentiments of the officers, the private men were universally attached to the popular cause. The national spirit was likewise kept up by several patriotic publications, particularly the letters signed Owen Roe O\u2019Neill, which in an especial manner attracted the public attention; nor was the pulpit backward in contributing its part in the same cause.\n\nTo give the greater weight to their determinations, the volunteers now began to form themselves into battalions; and in a very short time they were all united in this manner, excepting a small number of companies, which, from accidental causes, continued separate. The newspapers were filled with resolutions from the several corps, declaring Ireland to be an independent kingdom, entitled by reason, nature, and compact, to all the privileges of a free constitution; that no power independent in the world, excepting the king, with the lords and commons of Ireland, had or ought to have power to make laws for binding the Irish; and that, in support of these rights and privileges, they were determined to sacrifice their lives and property.\n\nNotwithstanding all this zeal, however, the representatives\nIreland. Sentatives of the people in Ireland seem yet to have behaved in a very supine and careless manner, and to have been entirely obedient to the dictates of government. One of the house of commons declared in the month of April 1780, that \"no power on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, excepting the kings, lords, and commons of Ireland, had a right to make laws to bind the people.\" \"Every member in the house (says Mr Crawford), one excepted, acknowledged the truth of the proposition, either in express terms, or by not opposing it; and yet, however alluring it may appear, it was evident, that had the question been put, it would have been carried in the negative. The matter was compromised. The question was not put; and nothing relating to it was entered on the journals.\n\nThis inattention, or rather unwillingness, of the majority to serve their country, was more fully manifested in the case of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTINY\">mutiny</a> bill, which they allowed to be made perpetual in Ireland, though that in England had always been cautiously passed only from year to year. After it was passed, however, some of the zealous patriots, particularly Mr Grattan, took great pains to fet forth the bad tendency of that act. He observed, that standing armies in the time of peace were contrary to the principles of the constitution and the safety of public liberty; they had subverted the liberty of all nations excepting in those cases where their number was small, or the power of the sovereign over them limited in form, respect or other; but it was in vain to think of fetting bounds to the power of the chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>, if the people chose by a statute to bind themselves to give them a perpetual and irresistible force. The mutiny bill, or martial law methodized, was directly opposite to the common law of the land. It fet aside the trial by jury and all the ordinary steps of law; establishing in their stead a summary proceeding, arbitrary crimes and punishments, a secret sentence, and sudden executions. The object of this was to bring those who were subject to it to a state of implicit subordination, and render the authority of the sovereign absolute. The people of England, therefore, from a laudable jealousy on all subjects in which their liberty was concerned, had in the matter of martial law exceeded their usual caution. In the preamble to the mutiny act, they recited part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a> of right, \"that standing armies and martial law in time of peace, without the consent of parliament, are illegal.\" Having then stated the purity and simplicity of their ancient constitution, and fet forth the great principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNA_CHARTA\">magna <a cla</a>ss=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARTA\">charta</a>, they admitted a partial and temporary repeal of it: they admitted an army, and a law for its regulation, but at the same time they limited the number of the former, and the duration of both; confining the existence of the troops themselves, the law that regulated them, and the power that commanded them, to one year. Thus were the standing forces of England rendered a parliamentary army, and the military rendered effectually subordinate to the civil magistrate, because dependent on parliament. Yet the people of England considered the army, even thus limited, only as a necessary evil, and would not admit even of barracks, lest the folder should be still more alienated from the state of a subject; and in this state of alienation have a post of strength, which would augment the danger arising from his situation. When the parliament of Ireland proceeded to regulate the army, therefore, they ought to have adopted the maxims of the British constitution, as well as the rules of British discipline. But they had totally departed from the maxims and example of the English, and that in the most important concern, the government of the sword. They had omitted the preamble which declared the great charter of liberty; they had left the number of forces in the breast of the king, and under these circumstances they had made the bill perpetual.\n\nIt is probable that the bulk of the Irish nation did not at first perceive the dangerous tendency of the bill in question. The representations of Mr Grattan and others, however, soon opened their eyes, and a general dissatisfaction took place. This was much increased by two unsuccessful attempts in the house of commons; one to obtain an act for modifying Poyning's law; and the other for securing the independency of the judges. An universal disgust against the spiritless conduct of parliament now took place; and the hopes of the people were once more set on the volunteers.\n\nAs it became now somewhat probable that these companies might at last be obliged to assert the rights of their countrymen by force of arms, reviews were appointed. Several of these reviews took place in the course of summer 1780. The spectators in general were struck with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> of the fight; the volunteers became more than ever the objects of esteem and admiration, and their numbers increased accordingly. The reviews in 1781 exceeded those of the former year; and the dexterity of the corps who had associated more early was now observed to be greater than that of the rest. More than 5000 men were reviewed at Belfast, whose performances were fet off to peculiar advantage by the display of 13 pieces of cannon. They showed their alacrity to serve their country in the field, on a report having arisen that the kingdom was to be invaded by the combined fleets of France and Spain; and for their spirited behaviour on this occasion they received a second time the thanks of both houses of parliament.\n\nSuch prodigious military preparations could not but alarm the British ministry in the highest degree; and it was not to be doubted that the Irish volunteers would come to the same extremities the Americans had done, unless their wishes were speedily complied with. Still, however, it was imagined possible to suppress them, and it was supposed to be the duty of the lord lieutenant to do so. It was during the administration of the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUCKINGHAM\">Buckingham</a> that the volunteers had grown into such consequence; he was therefore recalled, and the earl of Carlisle appointed in his place. Though it was impossible for the new governor to suppress the spirit of the nation, he found it no difficult matter to obtain a majority in parliament. Thus every redress was for the present effectually denied. Neither the modification of Poyning's law, nor the repeal of the obnoxious parts of the mutiny bill, could be obtained. The volunteers, exasperated at this behaviour, resolved at once to show that they were resolved to do themselves justice, and were conscious that they had power to do so. At a meeting of the officers of the southern battalion of the Armagh regiment, com-\nmanded by the earl of Charlemont, the following resolutions were entered into December 28, 1781.\n\n1. That the most vigorous and effectual methods ought to be pursued for rooting corruption out from the legislative body.\n\n2. For this purpose a meeting of delegates from all the volunteer associations was necessary; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUNGANNON\">Dungannon</a>, as the most central town in the province of Ulster, seemed to be the most proper for holding such a meeting.\n\n3. That as many and lasting advantages might attend the holding such a meeting before the present session of parliament was much farther advanced, the 15th of February next should be appointed for it.\n\nThese resolutions proved highly offensive to the friends of government, and every method was taken to discourage it. On the appointed day, however, the representatives of 143 volunteer corps attended at Dungannon; and the results of their deliberation were as follows:\n\n1. It having been asserted, that volunteers, as such, cannot with propriety debate or publish their opinions on political subjects, or on the conduct of parliament, or public men, it was resolved unanimously, that a citizen, by learning the use of arms, does not abandon any of his civil rights.\n\n2. That a claim from any body of men, other than the king, lords, and commons of Ireland, to make laws to bind the people, is illegal, unconstitutional, and a grievance.\n\n3. Resolved, with one dissenting voice only, that the powers exercised by the privy council of both kingdoms, under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> or pretence of the law of Poyning, are unconstitutional and a grievance.\n\n4. Resolved unanimously, that the ports of this country are by right open to all foreign countries not at war with the king; and that any burden thereupon, or obstruction thereto, excepting only by the parliament of Ireland, are unconstitutional and a grievance.\n\n5. Resolved, with one dissenting voice only, that a mutiny bill, not limited in point of duration from session to session, is unconstitutional and a grievance.\n\n6. Resolved unanimously, that the independence of judges is equally essential to the impartial administration of justice in Ireland as in England, and that the refusal or delay of this right is in itself unconstitutional and a grievance.\n\n7. Resolved, with 11 dissenting voices only, that it is the decided and unalterable determination of the volunteer companies to seek a redress of these grievances; and they pledged themselves to their country, and to each other, as freeholders, fellow-citizens, and men of honour, that they would, at every ensuing election, support only those who had supported them, and would support them therein, and that they would use all constitutional means to make such pursuit of redress speedy and effectual.\n\n8. Resolved, with only one dissenting voice, that the minority in parliament, who had supported those constitutional rights, are entitled to the most grateful thanks of the volunteer companies, and that an address to the purpose be signed by the chairman, and published with the resolutions of the present meeting.\n\n9. Resolved unanimously, that four members from each county of the province of Ulster, eleven to be a quorum, be appointed a committee till the next general meeting, to act for the volunteer corps, and to call general meetings of the province as occasion requires.\n\n10. The committee being appointed, and the time of general meetings, and some other affairs of a similar nature settled, it was resolved unanimously, that the court of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a> having unjustly refused entry to certain Irish commodities, the delegates would not consume any wine of the growth of Portugal, and that they would use all their influence to prevent the use of the said wine, excepting what was then in the kingdom, until such time as the Irish exports should be received in the kingdom of Portugal.\n\n11. Resolved, with only two dissenting voices, that they hold the right of private judgment in matters of religion equally sacred in others as in themselves; and that they rejoiced in the relaxation of the penal laws against the Papists, as a measure fraught with the happiest consequences to the union and prosperity of the inhabitants of Ireland.\n\nWhile these proceedings took place at Dungannon, the ministry carried all before them in parliament. In party prevalent a debate concerning the exclusive legislative privileges vails except of Ireland, a law member, speaking of the arbitrary fines in acts of England, asserted, that \"power constituted parliament right;\" and a motion that the commons should be declared the representatives of the people was carried in the negative. These scandalous proceedings could not but hasten the ruin of their cause. The resolutions entered into at the Dungannon meeting were received throughout the kingdom with the utmost applause. A few days after, Mr Grattan, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a> has been Mr Grattan already taken notice of, moved in the house of commons <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAN\">tan</a>'s motion for a long and spirited address to his majesty, declaring for an the rights of the kingdom, and afflicting the principle claring the which now began to prevail, that Ireland could legally independent be bound by no power but that of the king, lords, and deny of commons of the country; though the British parliament Ireland had assumed such a power. This motion was at present rejected, rejected by a large majority; but their eyes were soon enlightened by the volunteers.\n\nThese having now appointed their committees of correspondence, were enabled to communicate their sentiments to one another with the utmost facility and quickness. An association was formed in the name of Declaration the nobility, representatives, freeholders, and inhabitants of the counties of Armagh, wherein they set forth lunteers to the necessity of declaring their sentiments openly re-that pur-specting the fundamental and undoubted rights of the people.\n\nThey declared, that, in every situation in life, and with all the means in their power, they would maintain the constitutional right of the kingdom to be governed only by the king and parliament of Ireland; and that they would, in every instance, uniformly and frenziedly oppose the execution of any statutes, excepting such as derived their authority from the parliament just mentioned; and they pledged themselves, in the usual manner, to support what they now declared with their lives and fortune.\n\nThis declaration was quickly adopted by all the other counties, and similar sentiments became universally avowed throughout the kingdom. The change in the British ministry in the spring of 1782 facilitated the wishes of the people. The duke of Portland, who Favourable came over as lord lieutenant in April that year, sent a message of welcome to parliament. He informed them that \"his majesty, being concerned to find that the duke discontented and jealousies were prevailing among his Port-loyal subjects in Ireland, upon matters of great weight land, and importance, he recommended it to parliament to take...\"\nIreland take the same into their most serious consideration, in order to such a final adjustment as might give mutual satisfaction to his kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland.\n\nMr Grattan's second attempt in parliament the address which had been rejected before. On the 16th of April he began a speech to this purpose with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PANEGYRIC\">panegyric</a> on the volunteers, and the late conduct of the people. The Irish, he said, were no longer a divided colony, but an united land, manifesting itself to the rest of the world in signal instances of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>. In the rest of Europe the ancient spirit was expired; liberty was yielded, or empire lost; nations were living upon the memory of past glory, or under the care of mercenary armies. In Ireland, however, the people by departing from the example of other nations, had become an example to them. Liberty, in former times and in other nations, was recovered by the quick feelings and rapid impulse of the populace. But in Ireland, at the present period, it was recovered by an act of the whole nation reasoning for three years on its situation, and then refusing itself by a settled tenor of right pervading the land. The meeting of the delegates at Dungannon was an original measure; and, like all of that kind, continued to be matter of surprise, until at last it became matter of admiration. Great measures, such as the meeting of the English at Runnymead, and of the Irish at Dungannon, were not the consequences of precedent, but carried in themselves both precedent and principle; and the public cause in both instances would infallibly have been lost had it been trusted to parliament. The meeting at Dungannon had resolved, that the claim of the British parliament was illegal; and this was a constitutional declaration. The Irish volunteers were associated for the preservation of the laws, but the conduct of the British parliament subverted all law. England, however, had no reason to fear the Irish volunteers; they would sacrifice their lives in her cause. The two nations formed a general confederacy. The perpetual annexation of the crown was a great bond, but magna charta was a greater. It would be easy for Ireland to find a king; but it would be impossible to find a nation who would communicate to them such a charter as magna charta; and it was this which made their natural connection with England. The Irish nation were too high in pride, character, and power, to suffer any other nation to make their laws. England had indeed brought forward the question, not only by making laws for Ireland the preceding session, but by enabling his majesty to repeal all the laws which England had made for America. Had she consented to repeal the declaratory law against America? and would she refuse to repeal that against Ireland? The Irish nation were incapable of submitting to such a dilution.\n\nMr Grattan now found his eloquence much more powerful than formerly. The motion which, during this very session, had been rejected by a great majority, was now agreed to after a short debate, and the address to his majesty prepared accordingly. In this, after thanking his majesty for his gracious message, and declaring their attachment to his person and government, they assured him, that the subjects of Ireland are a free people; that the crown of Ireland is an imperial crown, inseparably annexed to that of Britain, on which connection the interests and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of both nations essentially depend; but the kingdom of Ireland is distinct, with a parliament of its own: that there is no body of men competent to make laws to bind Ireland, except the king, lords, and commons thereof, nor any other parliament that hath any power or authority of any sort whatsoever, in this country, except the parliament of Ireland. They assured his majesty, that they humbly conceive, that in this right the very essence of their liberties did exist; a right which they, on the part of all Ireland, do claim as their birthright, and which they cannot yield but with their lives. They assured his majesty, that they had seen with concern certain claims advanced by the parliament of Great Britain, in an act intitled, \"For the better securing the dependency of Ireland,\" an act containing matter entirely irreconcilable to the fundamental rights of the nation. They informed his majesty, that they conceived this act, and the claims it advanced, to be the great and principal cause of the discontent and jealousies in the kingdom. They assured him, that his commons did most sincerely wish, that all the bills, which become law in Ireland, should receive the approbation of his majesty under the seal of Great Britain; but yet, that they conceived the practice of suppreffing their bills in the council of Ireland, or altering them anywhere, to be another just cause of discontent and jealousy. They further assured his majesty, that an act intitled, \"For the better <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> of his majesty's forces,\" being unlimited in duration, and defective in some other circumstances, was another just cause of jealousy and discontent. These, the principal causes of jealousies and discontent in the kingdom, they had submitted to his majesty, in humble expectation of redress; and they concluded with an assurance, that they were more confident in the hope of obtaining redress, as the people of Ireland had been, and were, not more disposed to share the freedom of England, than to support her in her difficulties, and to share her fate.\n\nTo this remarkable address a most gracious answer was given. In a few days the lord lieutenant made a useful speech to both houses; in which he informed them, that, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGNANIMITY\">magnanimity</a> of the king, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> of the British parliament, he was enabled to assure them, that immediate attention had been paid to their representations, and that the legislature of Britain had concurred in a resolution to remove the causes of their discontent, and were united in a desire to gratify every wish expressed in the late address to the throne; and that, in the mean time, his majesty was graciously disposed to give his royal assent to acts to prevent the suppreffion of bills in the Irish privy-council, and to limit the mutiny-bill to the term of two years.\n\nThe joy which now diffused itself all over the kingdom was extreme. The warmest addresses were presented not only to his majesty but to the lord lieutenant. The commons instantly voted 100,000l. to his majesty, to enable him to raise 20,000 men for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>; and soon after, 5000 men were likewise voted in the Irish establishment. The volunteers became in a peculiar manner the objects of gratitude and universal panegyric; but none was placed in so conspicuous\nous a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> as Mr Grattan. Addresses of thanks flowed in upon him from all quarters; and the commons addressed his majesty to give him \u00a35,000l. as a recompense of his services; for which they promised to make provision.\n\nThis request was also complied with; but still the jealousies of the Irish were not completely eradicated. As the intended repeal of the declaratory act was found to be simple, without any clause expressly relinquishing the claim of right, several members of the house of commons were of opinion, that the liberties of Ireland were not yet thoroughly secured. The majority, however, were of opinion, that the simple repeal of the obnoxious act was sufficient; but many of the nation at large differed in sentiments. Mr Flood, a member of the house, and a zealous patriot, now took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> in this matter; while Mr Grattan lost much of his popularity by espousing the contrary opinion. The matter, however, was to appearance finally settled by the volunteers, who declared themselves on Mr Grattan's side. Still some murmurs were heard; and it must be owned, that even yet the conduct of Britain appeared equivocal. An English law was passed, permitting importation from one of the West <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> islands to all his majesty's dominions; and of course including Ireland, though the trade of the latter had already been declared absolutely free. This was looked upon in a very unfavourable light. Great offence was also taken at a member of the English house of lords for a speech in parliament, in which he asserted, that Great Britain had a right to bind Ireland in matters of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> nature; and proposed to bring in a bill for that purpose. The public discontent was also greatly inflamed by some circumstances relating to this bill, which were particularly obnoxious. Lord Beauchamp, in a letter addressed to one of the volunteer corps, was at pains to show that the security of the legislative privileges obtained from the parliament of Britain was insufficient. The lawyers corps, also, who took the question into consideration, were of the same opinion; but the circumstance which gave the greatest offence was, that the chief justice in the English court of king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENCH\">bench</a> gave judgement in an Irish cause directly contrary to a law which had limited all such judgements to the first of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>. All these reasons of discontent, however, were removed on the death of the marquis of Rockingham, and the appointment of the new ministry who succeeded him. Lord Temple came over to Ireland, and his brother and secretary Mr Grenville went to England, where he made such representations of the discontent which prevailed concerning the insufficiency of the declaratory act, that Mr Townshend, one of the secretaries of state, moved in the house of commons for leave to bring in a bill to remove from the minds of the people of Ireland all doubts respecting their legislative and judicial privileges. This bill contained, in the fullest and most express terms, a relinquishment on the part of the British legislature of all claims of a right to interfere with the judgment of the Irish courts, or to make laws to bind Ireland in time to come. Thus the contest was at last ended; and ever since this kingdom has continued to flourish, and to enjoy the blessings of tranquillity and peace, free from every kind of restriction either on its commerce or manufactures, till the commencement of the rebellion in 1798.\n\nSome time after the above transaction, the commercial propositions of Mr Pitt were rejected by both houses of the Irish parliament; and in the latter end of the year 1788, very warm debates took place on the regency bill; but the sudden and unexpected recovery of his majesty put an end to this political contest. The question respecting the emancipation of the Roman Catholics was much agitated about this period, and the ministry rendered themselves still more popular by appointing Earl Fitzwilliam to succeed the marquis of Buckingham as lord lieutenant of Ireland. It is to be presumed, however, that the joy of the people on this occasion chiefly originated from the hope, that the bill for the Catholic emancipation, brought in by Mr Grattan on the 12th of February 1795, and another on the 14th of the same month, for the diminution of the national expenditure, would be allowed to pass. The bill in favour of Catholic emancipation was rejected on the 4th of May, by a majority of 71, which had a powerful tendency to increase the popular discontent. Of this disaffection the rulers of France determined to avail themselves, and fitted out a fleet for the invasion of Ireland, consisting of 18 sail of the line, 13 frigates, two 120 guns, with transports, and 25,000 men, which were under the command of General Hoche. This formidable armament sailed from Brest on the 10th of December 1796; but so tempestuous was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> that the fleet was dispersed; the squadron under the command of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADMIRAL\">Admiral</a> Bouvet returned to Brest on the 31st after reaching Bantry bay; a ship of the line and two frigates perished at sea; another French frigate was taken by the British, and a French ship of the line escaped, after fighting for some time against two British ships.\n\nIt was no doubt a fortunate circumstance for Britain, yet the internal anarchy and confusion of Ireland were still rapidly gaining ground. The members of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> of United Irishmen, instituted in the year 1791, professed to have no other objects in view than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> in parliament, and that the people of every religious profession should enjoy an equality of civil rights; but it was afterwards undeniably proved, that they anxiously wished to bring about a revolution, and establish a republican government, similar to that which then deluged France with blood. The members swore \"to obtain a complete reform in the legislature, on the principles of civil, political, and religious liberty; and never to inform, or give evidence, in any court, against any member of that or similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>.\" So plausible were these objects, that their numbers increased with astonishing rapidity, and their divisions and subdivisions were soon extended all over the kingdom. Many loyal subjects, afraid of the extension of Roman Catholic privileges, also formed associations under the title of Orangemen, in order to deprive Papists of arms; and they in their turn assumed the name of defenders: in consequence of which the most terrible outrages were committed on both sides. The United Irishmen still continued the most numerous; but the first\nIreland\n\nThe first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> between them and the French directory took place in 1795 through the medium of one Mr Lewins; and in the following year the invasion, already mentioned, was concerted on the frontiers of France, between Lord Fitzgerald, Arthur O'Connor, and General Hoche, the failure of which did not seem to intimidate the rebels. Arms continued to be distributed with secrecy among the members, and a correspondence with the French directory was still preserved.\n\nAs proceedings of such a nature were justly alarming to the British government, the Insurrection Act was passed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1796, by which magistrates were authorized to place the people under martial law; a measure no doubt justifiable from the alarming nature of the times; but it certainly had the effect of increasing the discontented, and was also productive of numerous acts of oppression. Yet such as were connected with the United Irishmen were guilty of actions equally atrocious. So fully convinced were they of ultimate success, that in December 1797 an executive directory was nominated for the government of the Irish republic, consisting of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, Mr A. O'Connor, Mr Oliver Bond, Dr McNiven, and Counsellor Emmet. With such consummate art was their conspiracy planned, and with such profound secrecy was it conducted, that there is great reason to believe it might have been carried into effect, had not Mr Reynolds made a discovery in March 1798, which led to the apprehension of the principal ringleaders, and Fitzgerald received a mortal wound while resisting the officers. This reverse of fortune did not prevent the nomination of another directory; but its fate was similar to the former, and information was given against them by a Captain Armstrong, who had entered into their society for the purpose of betraying them. John and Henry Sheares, two of the directors, were apprehended on the 21st of May 1798; Mr Neilon and a number more of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> on the 23rd, and the metropolis was proclaimed in a state of insurrection. The guards were made three times stronger than before; and the whole city might be considered as forming but one garrison. Dublin was thus delivered from the dreadful havoc and devastation premeditated by the rebels; but in the provinces of Leinster and Connaught, as well as in various other places, they appeared in formidable bodies, intercepted the mail coaches, and thus gave the signal for a general insurrection.\n\nIn their attack upon the town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAAS\">Naas</a>, on the 24th of May, they experienced a signal defeat from Lord Gosford at the head of the Armagh militia, and left 400 men dead on the field. General Dundas defeated a considerable body of the rebels near Kilcullen, and on the 25th Lord Roden vanquished another body of them about 400 strong, the leaders of whom were taken and executed. On the 26th they shared the same fate at Tallagh hill, when 350 of them were slain. They attacked the town of Carlow to the number of 1000, where they were defeated with the loss of 400 men; but as the inhabitants fired upon the king's troops, one half of the town was burnt in revenge. The rebels made an attack upon Kildare on the 29th, but the gallant conduct of Sir J. Duff and the troops under his command, made them soon retire with the loss of 200 men. In Wicklow and Wexford, however, the rebellion raged with the most dreadful fury; in the latter of which they were computed to have 15000 men on the 25th of May, when they surrounded and cut to pieces the North <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a> militia at Oulard, commanded by Colonel Foot and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">Major</a> Lombard. They attacked and carried the town of Enniscorthy, but with the loss of 400 men, and a party of the Meath militia fell into their hands on the 29th. The town of Wexford surrendered to them next day, when Harvey, Fitzgerald, and Colclough, who had been made prisoners on the 26th for treason, were instantly set at liberty, and Harvey was appointed their commander-in-chief. Having left a garrison in the town, the rebel commander marched on the 5th of June to attack New Ross, where Major-general Johnston obstinately defended the town for several hours, and at last forced the enemy to retreat with considerable loss. This defeat so exasperated the rebels, that they butchered 105 royalists whom they found in the jail of Wexford. Their attempt upon Gorey was ineffectual, as well as that upon Newton <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRY\">Barry</a> on the 3d of June, where Colonel Letrange defeated them with the loss of 500 men killed in the action. On the following day, however, the tide of fortune seemed to turn in their favour near Slievebary mountain, where the royal forces under Colonel Walpole were defeated with the loss of 54 men, and the commander himself was slain in the action. Encouraged by this success, they resolved to make an attack upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARKLOW\">Arklow</a>; but the grape-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> of General Needham made terrible havoc among them; yet their strong position near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">Vinegar</a> hill was still maintained by their main body, from which it was found impracticable to dislodge them before the 21st, when they were nearly surrounded by General Lake, with his troops in five columns, led into action by Generals Dundas, Johnson, Eustace, Duff, and Loftus. The carnage was terrible, as the rebels defended themselves with great obstinacy for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> and a half, and lost 13 pieces of cannon. The town of Wexford surrendered next day, and on the 26th Harvey and Colclough were apprehended on one of the Saltee islands, who were tried and executed, together with Keughe, the rebel governor of Wexford.","sp":344,"ep":375},{"h":"IRENAEUS","t":"St., a bishop of Lyons, was born in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> about the year 120.

This ingenious author calls that part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> body irritable, which becomes shorter upon being touched; very irritable, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it contracts upon a slight touch; and the contrary, if by a violent touch it contracts but little. He calls that a sensible part of the human body, which upon being touched transmits the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of it to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUTES\">brutes</a>, he calls those parts sensible, the irritation of which occasions evident signs of pain and disquiet in the animal. On the contrary, he calls that insensible, which being burnt, tore, pricked, or cut till it is quite destroyed, occasions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> sign of pain nor convulsion, nor any sort of change in the situation of the body. From the result of many cruel experiments he concludes, that the epidermis is insensible; that the skin is sensible in a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> than any other part of the body; that the fat and cellular membrane are insensible; and the muscular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> sensible, the sensibility of which he attributes rather to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NERVES\">nerves</a> than to the flesh itself. The tendons, he says, having no nerves distributed to them, are insensible. The ligaments and capsules of the articulations are also concluded to be insensible; whence Dr. Haller infers, that the sharp pains of the gout are not seated in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPSULE\">capsule</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a>, but in the skin, and in the nerves which creep upon its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> surface. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> are all insensible, says Dr. Haller, except the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>; and likewise the marrow. Under his experiments the periosteum and pericranium, the dura and pia mater, appeared insensible; and he infers, that the sensibility of the nerves is owing to the medulla, and not to the membranes. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTERIES\">arteries</a> and veins are held susceptible of little or no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>, except the carotid, the lingual, temporal, pharyngeal, labial, thyroidal, and the aorta near the heart; the sensibility of which is ascribed to the nerves that accompany them. Sensibility is allowed to the internal membranes of the stomach, intestines, bladder, ureters, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VAGINA\">vagina</a>, and womb, on account of their being of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> with the skin: the heart is also admitted to be sensible; but the lungs, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIVER\">liver</a>, spleen, and kidneys, are possessed of a very imperfect, if any, sensation. The glands, having few nerves, are endowed with only an obtuse sensation. Some sensibility is allowed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TUNICA\">tunica</a> choroidis and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IRIS\">iris</a>, though in a less degree than the retina; but none to the cornea. Dr. Haller concludes, in general, that the nerves alone are sensible of themselves; and that, in proportion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of nerves apparently distributed to particular parts, such parts possess a greater or less degree of sensibility.\n\nIrritability, he says, is so different from sensibility, that the most irritable parts are not at all sensible, and vice versa. He alleges facts to prove this position, and also to demonstrate, that irritability does not depend upon the nerves, which are not irritable, but upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> formation of the parts which are susceptible of it. Irritability, he says, is not proportioned to sensibility; in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of which, he observes, that the intestines, though rather less sensible than the stomach, are more irritable; and that the heart is very irritable, though it has but a small degree of sensation.\n\nIrritability, according to Dr. Haller, is the distinguishing characteristic between the muscular and cellular fibres; whence he determines the ligaments, periosteum, meninges of the brain, and all the membranes composed of the cellular substance, to be void of irritability. The tendons are unirritable; and though he does not absolutely deny irritability to the arteries, yet his experiments on the aorta produced no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a>. The veins and excretory ducts are in a small degree irritable, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALL\">gall</a>-bladder, the ductus choledochus, the ureters and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-URETHRA\">urethra</a>, are only affected by a very acid corrosive; but the lacteal vessels are considerably irritable. The glands and mucous sinuses, the uterus in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a>, the human matrix, and the genitals, are all irritable; as are also the muscles, particularly the diaphragm. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OESOPHAGUS\">oesophagus</a>, stomach, and intestines, are irritable; but of all the animal organs the heart is endowed with the greatest irritability. In general, there is nothing irritable in the animal body but the muscular fibres; and the vital parts are the most irritable. This power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, arising from irritations, is supposed\nto be different from all other properties of bodies, and probably resides in the glutinous mucus of the muscular fibres, altogether independent of the influence of the soul. The irritability of the muscles is said to be destroyed by drying of the fibres, congealing of the fat, and more especially by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of opium in living animals. The physiological system, of which an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> has been now given, has been adopted and confirmed by Caffell and Zimmermann, and also by Dr Brockleby, who suggests, that irritability, as distinguished from sensibility, may depend upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of nerves different from such as serve either for voluntary motion or sensation. This doctrine, however, has been controverted by M. le Cat, and particularly by Dr Whytt in his Physiological Essays.

These last have observed, that the East Indies, which abound in islands more than any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the world, are likewise, more annoyed with earthquakes, tempests, lightnings, volcanoes, &c. than any other part. Others again conclude, that islands are as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> as the world, and that there were some at the beginning; and among other arguments, support their opinion from Gen. x. 5, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of Scripture.\n\nVarenius thinks that there have been islands produced each of these ways. St Helena, Alcetion, and other steep rocky islands, he supposes to have become so by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>'s overflowing their neighbouring campaigns; but by the heaping up huge quantities of sand, and other terrestrial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, he thinks the islands of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZEALAND\">Zealand</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JAPAN\">Japan</a>, &c. were formed. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMATRA\">Sumatra</a> and Ceylon, and most of the East <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a> islands, he thinks, were rent off from the main land; and concludes, that the islands of the Archipelago were formed in the same way, imagining it probable that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEUCALION\">Deucalion</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a> might contribute towards it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> had a notion that Delos, and a few other islands, rose from the bottom of the sea; which, how fabulous soever it may appear, agrees with later observations. Seneca takes notice, that the island Thera rose thus out of the Aegean sea in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, of which the mariners were eye witnesses.\n\nIt is indeed very probable, that many islands have existed not only from the deluge, but from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> of the world; and we have undoubted proofs of the formation of islands in all the different ways above-mentioned. Another way, however, in which islands are frequently formed in the South sea, is by the coraline infects. On this subject there is a curious dissertation by Alexander Dalrymple, Esq. in the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1768, to which we refer the reader.

See Ice Island.\n\nFloating Islands. Histories are full of accounts of floating islands; but the greatest part of them are either false or exaggerated. What we generally see of this kind is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more than the concretion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> and more viscous matter floating on the surface of the water in cakes; and, with the roots of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, forming conglomerates of different sizes, which, not being fixed to the shore in any part, are blown about by the winds, and float on the surface. These are generally found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, where they are confined from being carried too far; and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of time, some of them acquire a very considerable size. Seneca tells us of many of these floating islands in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>; and some later writers have described not a few of them in other places. But, however true these accounts might have been at the time when they were written, very few proofs of their authenticity are now to be found; the floating islands having either disappeared again, or been fixed to the sides in such a manner as to make a part of the shore. Pliny tells us of a great island which at one time swam about in the lake Cutilia in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> of Reatinum, which was discovered to the old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> by a miracle; and Pomponius tells us, that in Lydia there were several islands so loose in their foundations, that every little accident shook and removed them.\n\nIsland (or Icelana) Crystal.

Spauhawm owes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> it now possesses to the great Shah Abas; who, after the conquest of the kingdoms of Lar and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORMUS\">Ormus</a>, charmed with the situation of this place, made it the capital of his empire, between the years 1620 and 1628. The mountains, with which this city is surrounded, defend it alike from the sultry heats of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> and the piercing winds of the winter season; and the plain on which it stands is watered by several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, which contribute alike to its ornament and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. Of these rivers, the Zenderoud, after being joined by the Mahmood, passes by Spauhawm; where it has three fine bridges over it, and is as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> as the Ispahan Scine at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>. The waters of these united streams are sweet, pleasant, and wholesome, almost beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>; as indeed are all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> found in the gardens belonging to the houses of Spauhawm. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of Spauhawm is very great; not less perhaps than 20 miles within the walls, which are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, poorly built, and so covered with houses and shaded with gardens, that in many places it is difficult to discover them. The Persians are wont to say, Spauhawm nigripetion, i.e. Spauhawm is half the world. Chardin says, that some reckon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of inhabitants at 1,000,000; but he did not look upon it as more populous than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, or containing more than 600,000. At a distance, the city is not easily distinguished; many of the streets being adorned with plantains, and every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> having its garden, the whole looks like a wood. The streets in general are neither broad nor convenient; there being three great evils which attend them: the first is, that being built on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEWERS\">sewers</a>, they are frequently broke up, which is very dangerous, considering that most people are on horseback; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> is, that there are many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELLS\">wells</a> or pits in them, which are not less dangerous; the third arises from the people's emptying all their ordure from the tops of their houses: this last, indeed, is in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> qualified by the dryness of the air, and by its being quickly removed by the peasants, who carry it away to dung their grounds. Some reckon eight, and others ten gates, besides posterns; but all agree that there is no difficulty of entering at any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> or night. The three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> suburbs annexed to it are, Abas-Abad, built by Shah Abas, and belonging to the people of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TAURIS\">Tauris</a>; Julfa, inhabited by a colony of Armenians, called by some New Julfa, to distinguish it from the ancient city of that name, situated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMENIA\">Armenia</a>, upon the Araxes, whence the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> inhabitants of New Julfa were brought; and Ghebr-Abad, or, as the Arabs pronounce it, Kebr-Abad, the street of the magians, occupied entirely by the professors of magism, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> of the ancient Persians. The river Zenderoud separates the city of Ispahan and Abas-Abad from Julfa and Ghebr-Abad. This city has suffered greatly since the commencement of the dreadful revolution in 1721; the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, till a few years ago, having been almost a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of blood, ravages, and confusion. A celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> traveller, who was on the spot, tells us, that the inhabitants of Julfa, not many years before the above revolution happened, amounted to 30,000 souls; had 13 churches, and above 100 priests; and paid the Persian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> 200 tomans yearly for the free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of their religion: that some of the streets were broad and handsome, and planted with trees, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a> and fountains in the middle; others narrow and crooked, and arched at top; others again, though extremely narrow, as well as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> and winding many ways, were of an incredible length, and resembled so many labyrinths: that, at a small distance from the town, there were public walks adorned with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>-trees on either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and ways paved with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, fountains, and cisterns: that there were above 100 caravanserais for the use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> and travellers, many of which were built by the kings and prime <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> of Persia: that, as little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> fell there, the streets were frequently full of dust, which rendered the city disagreeable during a considerable\nconsiderable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the summer; that the citizens, however, to make this inconvenience more tolerable, used to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> them when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> was warmer than usual; that there was a castle in the eastern part of the town, which the citizens looked upon as impregnable, in which the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, and most of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> stores, were said to be kept; that notwithstanding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a> and caravanserais were almost innumerable, there was not one public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a>; that most of the public buildings were rather neat than magnificent, though the great meydan or market-place, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> (which is three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> in circumference), and the alley denominated Toher bag adjoining to it, made a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> appearance; that the former contained the royal mosque; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> denominated kayserich, where all sorts of foreign commodities were exposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>; and the mint, styled by the Persians ferra-bhaneh, where the current money of the kingdom was coined; that, besides the native Persians, there were then in Isfahan above 10,000 Indians all supported by trade; 20,000 Georgians, Circassians, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARS\">Tartars</a> of Daghestan or Lefgees, with a considerable number of English, Dutch, Portuguese, and a few French; that the Capuchins, disfacedicated or barefooted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARMELITES\">Carmelites</a>, Jesuits, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMINICANS\">Dominicans</a>, and Austin friars, had likewise their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONVENTS\">convents</a> here, though they were unable to make any converts; and that there were above 100 mosques and public colleges. But since the fatal period above mentioned, the suburb of Jaffa was almost totally abandoned by the Armenians. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of Isfahan, twenty-three leagues long and as many broad, comprehending several districts, most of them formerly well peopled, appeared not many years ago little better than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a>; most of the inhabitants of that fertile and delightful tract being fled and dispersed. Multitudes of them had taken a precarious refuge in the mountains of Loristan, lying between Isfahan and Suffer, whose lands were left untilled, and their houses mouldered into ruins. In short, all the distresses of an unsuccessful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, or the invasion of a barbarous enemy, could not have plunged the people of Isfahan into greater misery than the victories of their tyrannical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> Nadir Shah, who seemed more solicitous to humble his own subjects than his enemies.

One great cause of the defeat which the Persians received here was the bad conduct of their monarch, who led his numerous forces into a narrow place, where they had not room to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>. Alexander was so much surprized when he first received the news that Darius was behind him, that he could scarcely believe it to be true; but when he was thoroughly satisfied of the fact, and that Darius had again passed the river Pinarus, he called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, wherein, without asking any body's advice, he only told them, that he hoped they would remember their former actions; and that they, who were always conquerors, were about to fight people who were always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a>. He further observed, that Darius seemed to be infatuated, since he had with such expedition quitted an open and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, where his numbers might have acted with advantage, to fight in a place inclosed, where the Macedonian phalanx might be well drawn up, and where his numbers could only incommode him. He then made the necessary dispositions for repassing the mountains, posted guards where he found them necessary, and then commanded his troops to refresh themselves, and to take their rest till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>.\n\nAt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> he began to repass the mountains, obliging his forces to move in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> order where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> was narrow, and to extend themselves as they had...\nIffus had more room; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> wing keeping always close to the mountain, and the left to the sea-shore. On the right there was a battalion of heavy-armed troops, besides the targeteers under the command of Nicanor the son of Parmenio. Next these, extending to the phalanx, were the corps of Ctenus and Perdiccas; and on the left the respective bodies commanded by Amyntas, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>, and Meleager. The foot appointed to support them were commanded by Craterus; but the whole left wing was committed to Parmenio, with strict orders not to decline from the sea-shore, lest the Persians should surround them. Darius ordered 20,000 foot and 30,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> to retire, finding that he already wanted room to draw up the rest. His first line consisted of 30,000 Greek mercenaries, having on their right and left 60,000 heavy-armed troops, being the utmost the ground would allow. On the left, towards the mountain, he posted 20,000 men, which, from the hollow situation of the place, were brought quite behind Alexander's right wing. The rest of his troops were formed into close and useless <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> behind the Greek mercenaries, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> in all of 60,000 men. When this was done, he suddenly recalled the horse who had retired, sending <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> on his right against the Macedonians commanded by Parmenio; and the rest he ordered to the left towards the mountain: but, finding them unserviceable there, he sent the greatest part of them to the right; and then took upon himself, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of the Persian kings, the command of the main body. As soon as Alexander perceived that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of the Persian horse was disposed against his left wing, he dispatched, with as much secrecy as he could, the Thessalian cavalry thither, and supplied their places on the right by some brigades of horse from the van, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>-armed troops. He also made such dispositions, that notwithstanding the mighty advantage of the hollow mountain, the Persians could not surround him. But, as these precautions had considerably weakened the centre of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, he ordered those advanced posts on the enemy's left, of which he was most apprehensive, to be attacked at the very beginning of the fight; and, when they were easily driven from them, he recalled as many troops as were necessary to strengthen his centre.\n\nWhen all things were in order, Alexander gave strict command, that his army should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> very slowly. As for Darius, he kept his troops fixed in their posts, and in some places threw up ramparts; whence the Macedonians rightly observed, that he thought himself already a prisoner. Alexander at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the right wing engaged first, and without any difficulty broke and defeated the left wing of Darius. But, endeavouring to pass the river Pinarus after them, his troops in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> losing their order, the Greek mercenaries fell upon them in flank, and made them fight, not only for victory, but for their lives. Ptolemy the son of Seleucus, and 120 Macedonians of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, were killed upon the spot. But the foot next to Alexander's right wing coming in feebly to its relief, fell upon the mercenaries in flank, amongst whom a dreadful carnage was made; they being in a manner surrounded by the horse and light-armed troops, which at first pursued the left wing, and the foot that now passed the river. The Persian horse on the right still fought gallantly; but, when they were thoroughly informed of the rout of their left wing and of the destruction of the Greek mercenaries, and that Darius himself was fled, they began to break, and betake themselves to flight also. The Thessalian cavalry pursued them close at the heels; and the narrow craggy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> incommode them exceedingly, so that vast numbers of them perished. As for Darius, he fled, soon after the left wing was broken, in a chariot with a few of his favourites: as far as the country was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> and open, he escaped well enough; but, when the roads became rocky and narrow, he quitted it, and mounting a horse, rode all the night: his chariot, in which were his cloak and his bow, fell into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of Alexander, who carried them back to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>.\n\nIn respect to the battle of Iffus, Diodorus informs us, that Alexander looked everywhere about for Darius; and, as soon as he discovered him, with his handful of guards attacked him and the flower of the Persian army which was about him; being as desirous of obtaining this victory by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> valour, as of subduing the Persian empire by the courage of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>. But when Oxathres, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> of Darius, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> Alexander's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, and how fiercely he fought to accomplish it, he threw himself, with the horse who were about him, between his brother's chariot and the enemy, where an obstinate fight was maintained, till the dead bodies rose like an entrenchment about the chariot of Darius. Many of the Persian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> were slain, and Alexander himself was wounded in the thigh. At last the horses in the chariot of Darius started, and became so unruly, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> himself was forced to take the reins; the enemy, however, pressed so hard upon him, that he was constrained to call for another chariot, and mounted it in great danger. This was the beginning of the rout, which soon after became general. According to this author, the Persians lost 200,000 foot, and 10,000 horse; the Macedonians 300 foot, and 150 horse.\n\nJustin informs us, that the Persian army consisted of 400,000 foot, and 100,000 horse. He says, that the battle was hard fought; that both the kings were wounded; and that the Persians still fought gallantly when their king fled, but that they were afterwards speedily and totally routed: he is very particular as to their loss, which he says amounted to 61,000 foot, 10,000 horse, and 40,000 taken prisoners; of the Macedonians he says there fell <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more than 130 foot, and 150 horse. Curtius says, that of the Persians there fell 100,000 foot, and 10,000 horse: of Alexander's army 504, he says, were wounded; 32 foot and 150 horse killed. That we may not suspect any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> in transcribers, his own observation confirms the fact: *Tantulo impendio ingens victoria fleuit*, \"So small was the cost of so great a victory.\"","sp":389,"ep":390},{"h":"ISTHMIA","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> **Isthmian Games**: one of the four solemn games which were celebrated every fifth year in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>.

It was called names, Saturnia from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SATURN\">Saturn</a>; who, being driven out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRETE\">Crete</a> by his son <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a>, is supposed to have taken refuge there. The names of Oenotria and Aufonia are borrowed from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> inhabitants the Oenotrians and Aufones; and that of Hesperia or Western was given it by the Greeks, from its situation with respect to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>. The name of Italia, or Italy, which in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> prevailed all over the rest, is by some derived from Italos, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of the Siculi; by others, from the Greek word Italos, signifying an ox; this country abounding, by reason of its rich pastures, with oxen of an extraordinary size and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>. All these names were originally peculiar to particular provinces of Italy, but afterwards applied to the whole country.\n\nThis country, like most others, was in ancient times divided into a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of petty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> and kingdoms. Afterwards when the Gauls settled in the western, and many Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a> in the eastern parts,\nItaly, it was divided, with respect to its inhabitants, into three great parts, viz. Gallia Cisalpina, Italy properly so called, and Magna Graecia. The most western and northern parts of Italy were in great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> peopled by the Gauls; and hence took the name of Galia, with the epithets of Cisalpina and Citerior, because they lay on the side of the Alps next to Rome; and Togata, with relation to the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOWN\">gown</a> or dress of which the inhabitants used; but this last epithet is of a much later <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a> than the former. This appellation was antiquated in the reign of Augustus, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of Italy into eleven provinces, introduced by that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. Hence it is that the name of Cisalpine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a> frequently occurs in the authors who flourished before, and scarce even in those who wrote after, the reign of Augustus. This country extended from the Alps and the river Varus, parting it from Transalpine Gaul, to the river Aelius; or, as Pliny <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> have it, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCONA\">Ancona</a>, in the ancient Picenum. On the north, it was divided from Rhaetia by the Alps, called Alpes Rhaeticae; and from Illyricum by the river Formio: but on this side, the borders of Italy were, in Pliny's time, extended to the river Arbia in Istria. On the south, it reached to the Ligurian sea, and the Apennines parting it from Etruria; so that under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> name of Cisalpine Gaul were comprehended the countries lying at the foot of the Alps, called by Pliny and Strabo the Subalpine countries, Liguria, Gallia Cispadana and Transpadana, Italy, properly so called, extended, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of the Adriatic, from the city of Ancona to the river Trento, now the Fortore; and on the Mediterranean, from the Macra to the Silanus, now the Sele. Magna Graecia comprised Apulia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUCANIA\">Lucania</a>, and the country of the Brutii. It was called Greece, because most of the cities on the coast were Greek colonies. The inhabitants gave it the name of Great, not as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it was larger than Greece, but merely out of ostentation, as Pliny informs us.\n\nAll these countries were inhabited by a great number of different nations settled at different times, and from many different parts. The names of the most remarkable of them were the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABORIGINES\">Aborigines</a>, or those whose origin was utterly unknown, and consequently were thought to have none; the Sabines, Hetrurians or Tuscani, the Umbri, Samnites, Campani, Apuli, Calabri, Lucani, the Brutii, and the Latins. From a colony of the latter proceeded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, who gradually subdued all these nations one after another, and held them in subjection for upwards of 700 years. All these nations were originally brave, hardy, temperate, and well skilled in the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>; and the Romans much more so than the rest. Their subjection to Rome, however, inured them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>; their oppression by the emperors broke their spirit; and the vast wealth which was poured into the country from all parts of the world, during the time of the Roman prosperity, corrupted their manners, and made them degenerate from their former valour. Of this degeneracy the barbarous nations of the north took the advantage to invade the empire in innumerable multitudes. Though often repelled, they never failed to return; and it was found necessary to take great numbers of them into the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>, in order to defend the empire against the rest of their countrymen.\n\nIn the year 476, the Heruli, presuming on the services they had done the empire, demanded a third part of the lands of Italy; and being refused, chose one by the He-odoacer, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of low birth, but of great valour and ruli- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, for their king; and having totally destroyed the remains of the Roman empire, proclaimed Odoacer king of Italy. The new monarch, however, did not think proper to alter the Roman form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, but suffered the people to be governed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>, consuls, &c., as before. He enjoyed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> in peace till the year 488, when Zeno, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> of Constantinople, being hard pressed by Theodoric king of the Ostrogoths, advised him to turn his arms against Odoacer, whom he could easily overcome, and thus make himself sovereign of one of the finest countries in the world.\n\nTheodoric accepted the proposal with great joy, invaded by and set out for Italy, attended by an infinite number of people, carrying with them their wives, children, effects, on waggons. Several Romans of great distinction attended him in this war; while, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, many of his countrymen chose to remain in Thrace, where they became a separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, and lived for a long time in amity with the Romans. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHS\">Goths</a>, being destitute of shipping, were obliged to go round the Adriatic. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> was performed in the depth of winter; and during the whole time, a violent famine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a> raged in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>. They were also opposed by the Gepidae and Sarmatians; but at last having defeated these enemies, and overcome every other obstacle, they arrived in Italy in the year 489. Theodoric advanced to the river Santius, now Zonzo, near Aquileia, where he halted for some time to refresh his troops. Here he was met by Odoacer at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of a very numerous army, but composed of many different nations commanded by their respective chiefs, and consequently without sufficient union or zeal for the common cause. Theodoric therefore gained an easy victory, cut many of his enemies in pieces, and took their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>. Odoacer retired to the plains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERONA\">Verona</a>, and encamped there at a small distance from the city; but Theodoric pursued him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>, and soon forced him to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> engagement. The Goths obtained another victory; but it cost them dear. Odoacer's men made a much better resistance than before, and great numbers fell on both sides. The victory, however, was so far decisive, that Odoacer was obliged to shut himself up in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAVENNA\">Ravenna</a>; so that Theodoric having now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> enemy to oppose him in the field, besieged and took several important places, and among the rest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAVIA\">Pavia</a>. At the same time, Tufa, commander in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of Odoacer's forces, deserted to the enemy with the greatest part of the troops he had with him, and was immediately employed in conjunction with a Gothic officer in pursuit of his sovereign. Odoacer had left that city, and was advanced as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FAENZA\">Faenza</a>, where he was closely besieged by Tufa; but the traitor, declaring again for his old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, joined him with all his troops, and delivered up several officers that had been appointed by Theodoric to serve under him. These were sent in irons to Ravenna; and Odoacer being joined by Frideric, one of Theodoric's allies, with a considerable body of troops, once more advanced against his enemies. He recovered all Liguria, took the city of\nItaly. Milan, and at last besieged Theodoric himself in Pavia. The Goths, having brought all their families and effects along with them, were greatly distressed for want of room; and must have undoubtedly submitted, if their enemies had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to agree among themselves. The quarrels of his followers proved the ruin of Odoacer. Theodoric finding that the enemy permitted the vigour of their operations, applied for succours to Alaric king of the Visigoths, who had settled in Gaul. As the Visigoths and Ostrogoths were originally one and the same nation, and the Visigoths had received among them some years before a great number of Ostrogoths under the conduct of Videmer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a>-german to Theodoric, the supplies were readily granted. The inaction of the enemy gave these succours time to arrive; upon which Theodoric instantly joined them, and marching against his enemies gave them a total overthrow. Odoacer again took refuge in Ravenna, but was closely besieged by Theodoric in 492. The siege lasted three years; during which Odoacer defended himself with great bravery, and greatly annoyed the besiegers with his fallacies. Theodoric, however, impatient of delay, leaving part of his army to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCKADE\">blockade</a> the city, marched with the rest against the strong holds which Odoacer had garrisoned. All these he reduced with little difficulty; and in 492 returned to the siege of Ravenna. The besieged were now reduced to great limits both by the enemy without and a famine within, the price of wheat being risen to fix pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> per bushel. On the other hand, the Goths were quite worn out with the fatigues of such a long siege; so that both parties being willing to put an end to the war, Odoacer sent John bishop of Ravenna to Theodoric with terms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>. Jornandes informs us, that Odoacer only begged his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>; which Theodoric bound himself, by a solemn oath, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> him: but Procopius says, that they agreed to live together on equal terms. This last seems very improbable; but whatever were the terms of the agreement, it is certain that Theodoric did not keep them; for having a few days after invited Odoacer to a banquet, he dispatched him with his own hand. All his servants and relations were massacred at the same time: except his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Arnulphus, and a few more, who had the good luck to make their escape, and retired beyond the Danube.\n\nTheodoric thus Theodoric became master of all Italy, and proclaimed took upon himself the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of king of that country, as king of Ita. Odoacer had done before; though, with a pretended ly, and uses deference to the emperor of Constantinople, he sent messengers asking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to assume that title after he had actually taken it. Having secured his new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> as well as he could by foreign alliances, Theodoric next applied himself to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEGISLATION\">legislation</a>, and enacted many salutary laws besides those of the Romans which he retained. He chose Ravenna for the place of his residence, in order to be near at hand to put a stop to the incursions of the barbarians. The provinces were governed by the same magistrates that had presided over them in the times of the emperors, viz., the consuls, correctors, and praefects. But besides these, he sent, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of the Goths, inferior judges, distinguished by the name of counts, to each city. These were to administer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, and to decide all controversies and disputes. And herein the policy of the Goths far excelled that of the Romans. For in the Roman times a whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> was governed by a consularius, a corrector, or a praefect, who resided in the chief city, and to whom recourse was to be had at a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> from the most remote parts; but Theodoric, besides these officers, appointed not only in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> cities, but in every small town and village, inferior magistrates of known integrity, who were to administer justice, and by that means <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> those who had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>-suits the trouble and expense of recurring to the governor of the whole province; no appeals to distant tribunals being allowed, but in matters of the greatest importance, or in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of manifest injustice.\n\nUnder the administration of Theodoric Italy enjoyed as great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> as had been experienced under the very best emperors. As he had made no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in the laws except that above mentioned; so he contented himself with the same tributes and taxes that had been levied by the emperors; but was, on all occasions of public calamity, much more ready to remit them than most of the emperors had been. He did not treat the natives as those of the other Roman provinces were treated by the barbarians who conquered them. These stripped the ancient proprietors of their lands, estates, and possessions, dividing them among their chiefs; and giving to one a province with the title of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a>, to another a frontier country with the title of marquis; to some a city with the title of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a>, to others a castle or village with the title of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARON\">baron</a>. But Theodoric, who piqued himself upon governing after the Roman manner, and observing the Roman laws and institutions, left every one in the full enjoyment of his ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>. As to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, though he himself, like most of his countrymen, professed the tenets of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARIUS\">Arius</a>, he allowed his subjects to profess the orthodox doctrine without molestation, giving liberty even to the Goths to renounce the doctrines in which they had been educated, and embrace the contrary opinions. In short, his many virtues, and the happiness of his subjects, are celebrated by all the historians of those times. The end of his reign, however, was fulfilled by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of the celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOETHIUS\">Boethius</a>, and his father-in-law Symmachus. They were both beheaded, Beheaded in Pavia, on an unjust suspicion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a>; and Boethius and Symmachus was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> put in execution when the king repented, and abandoned himself to the most pungent and dies of sorrow. The excess of his grief affected his understanding; griefing: for not long after, the head of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> fish being served up to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>, he fancied the head of the fish to be that of Symmachus threatening him in a ghastly manner. Hereupon, seized with horror and amazement, he was carried to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>-chamber, where he died in a few days, on the 2d of September 526.\n\nAfter the death of Theodoric, the kingdom devolved to Athalaric his grandson; who being at that time only eight years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, his mother Amalafuntha took upon her the regency. Her administration was equally upright with that of Theodoric himself; but the barbarians of whom her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> was composed, finding fault with the encouragement she gave to learning, forced the regent to abandon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> of her son. The latter thereupon plunged into all manner of wickedness, and behaved to his mother with the greatest arrogance; and, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a> finding themselves thus strengthened, at last commanded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> to retire from court.\n\nAmalafuntha,\nAmalasuntha, exerting her authority, seized three of the ringleaders of the sedition, whom she confined in the most remote parts of Italy. But these maintaining a secret correspondence with their friends and relations, never ceased to stir up the people against her; infomuch, that the queen, apprehending that the faction might in the end prevail, wrote to the emperor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTINIAN\">Justinian</a>, begging leave to take refuge in his dominions. The emperor readily complied with her request, offering a noble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> at Durazzo for her habitation; but the queen having in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time caused the three ringleaders to be put to death, and no new disturbances arising thereupon, she did not accept of the emperor's offer. In 533, Athalaric having contracted a lingering distemper by his riotous living and debaucheries, Amalasuntha, to avoid the calamities with which Italy was threatened in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of his death, formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of delivering it up to Justinian; but before her scheme was ripe for execution, Athalaric died. Upon which the queen took for her colleague one Theodotus her cousin; obliging him, however, to swear that he would foster her to enjoy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> her former power. This he very readily did, but soon forgot his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a>; and when she took the liberty to remind him of it, caused her to be feigned and confined in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of the lake Bolsena in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUSCANY\">Tuscany</a>. But as Theodotus had great reason to believe that this conduct would be resented by Justinian, he obliged her to write to him that no injury or injustice had been done her. Along with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> he sent one written by himself, and filled with heavy complaints against Amalasuntha. The emperor, however, was so far from giving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to what Theodotus urged against her, that he openly espoused her cause, wrote her a most affectionate letter, and assured her of his protection. But before this letter could reach her, the unhappy princess was strangled in the bath by the friends of those whom in the reign of her son she had deservedly put to death for raising disturbances in the state.\n\nOn the news of Amalasuntha's death, Justinian resolved upon an immediate war with the Goths; and, to facilitate the enterprise, used his utmost endeavours to induce the Franks to assist him. To his solicitations he added a large sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>; which last was very acceptable to his new allies. They promised to assist the emperor to the utmost of their power; but instead of performing their promise, while Justinian's arms were employed against the Goths, Thierri, the eldest son of Clovis, seized several cities of Liguria, the Alpes Cottiae, and great part of the present territory of Venice, for himself. Justinian, however, found sufficient resources in the valour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BELISARIUS\">Belisarius</a>, notwithstanding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFECTION\">defection</a> of his treacherous allies. This celebrated general was vested with the supreme command, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> authority. His instructions were to pretend a voyage to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a>, but to make an attempt upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>; and if he thought he could succeed in the attempt, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> there; otherwise to sail for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, without discovering his intentions. Another general, named Mundus, commander of the troops in Illyricum, was ordered to march into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DALMATIA\">Dalmatia</a>, which was subject to the Goths, and attempt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALONA\">Salona</a>, the better to open a passage into Italy. This he accomplished without difficulty, and Belisarius made himself master of Sicily sooner than he himself had expected. The island was reduced on the last of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 535; upon which Belisarius, without loss of time, passed over to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGGIO\">Reggio</a>, which opened its gates to him. From Reggio he pursued his march to Rome, the provinces of Abrutium, Lucania, Puglia, Calabria, and Samnium, readily submitting to him. The city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a> endured a siege; but Belisarius entered through an aqueduct, and gave it up to be plundered by his followers.\n\nTheodotus alarmed at these successes, and having neither capacity nor inclination to carry on the war, sent ambassadors to Justinian with proposals of peace. He agreed to renounce all pretensions to the island of Sicily; to send the emperor yearly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of gold weighing 300 pounds; and to supply him with 3000 men whenever he should think proper to demand them. Several other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> were contained in the proposal, which amounted to the owning of Justinian for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a>, and that he held the crown of Italy only through his favour. As he apprehended, however, that these offers might not yet be satisfactory, he recalled his ambassadors for further orders. They were now directed to inform Justinian, that Theodotus was willing to resign the kingdom to him, and content himself with a pension suitable to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. But he obliged them by an oath not to mention this proposal, till they found that the emperor would not accept of the other. The first proposals were accordingly rejected as they had supposed; upon which the ambassadors produced the second, signed by Theodotus himself, who in his letter to the emperor told him, among other things, that being unacquainted with war, and addicted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, he preferred his quiet to a kingdom. Justinian, transported with joy, and imagining the war already finished, answered the king in a most obliging manner, extolling his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>, and giving him besides what he demanded the greatest honours of the empire. The agreement being confirmed by mutual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a>, lands were assigned to Theodotus out of the king's domain, and orders were dispatched to Belisarius to take possession of Italy in his name.\n\nIn the mean time, a body of Goths having entered Dalmatia, with a design to recover the city of Salona, were encountered by an inferior army of Romans, commanded by the son of Mundus above mentioned. The Goths proved victorious; and the young general of the Romans was killed, and most of his army cut in pieces. Mundus marched against the enemy to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> the death of his son; but met with no better success, his troops being defeated, and he himself killed in the engagement. Upon this the Romans abandoned Salona and all Dalmatia; and Theodotus, elated with his success, refused to fulfil the articles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a>. Justinian dispatched Constansianus, an officer of great valour and experience, into Illyricum, with orders to raise forces there, and to enter Dalmatia; at the same time he wrote to Belisarius to pursue the war with the utmost vigour.\n\nThe Goths were now reduced to the greatest straits. Constansianus drove them out of Dalmatia; and Belisarius having reduced all the provinces which compose the present kingdom of Naples, advanced towards Rome. The chief men of the nation, finding their king incapable of preventing the impending ruin, assembled\nItaly. semblable without his consent, and dispatched ambass-\nsadors to Belifarius with proposals of peace. These \nproposals were rejected; and Belifarius returned for \nanswer, that he would hearken to no terms, nor heath \nhis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>, till Italy was reannexed to the empire to \nwhich it belonged. The Goths finding Theodotus \nstill inactive, unanimously deposed him; and chose in \nhis stead one Vitiges, a man of great valour, but of a \nmean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>. Theodotus fled to Ravenna; but the \nnew king dispatched after him a messenger, who soon \novertook him and cut off his head.\n\nVitiges began his government by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> a circular \nletter, in which he exhorted his countrymen to exert \ntheir ancient courage, and fight bravely for their lives \nand liberties. He then marched with what forces he \ncould collect towards Rome; but not thinking himself \nable to defend that city against the Roman forces, he \nabandoned it to Belifarius, and arriving at Ravenna \nwas joined by the Goths from all parts, so that he \nsoon found himself at the head of a considerable army. \nBelifarius in the mean time entered Rome without op-\nposition, on the 9th or 10th of December 537. The \nGothic garrison retired by the Porta Flaminia, while \nBelifarius entered by the Porta Asinaria. Leudaris, \ngovernor of the city, who stood behind, was sent, to-\ngether with the keys, to the emperor. Belifarius \nimmediately applied himself to the repairing of the \nwalls and other fortifications; filled the granaries \nwith corn, which he caused to be brought from Sicily; \nand stored the place with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>, as if he had been \npreparing for a siege; which gave no small uneasiness \nto the inhabitants, who chose rather that their city \nshould <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> open to every invader, than that they should \nbe liable to the calamities of a siege. While Belifarius \nwas thus employed at Rome, the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVENTO\">Benevento</a>, \nwith great part of the territory of Samnium, was de-\nlivered up to him: at the same time the cities of Nar-\nnia, Spoleto, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERUGIA\">Perugia</a>, revolting from the Goths, \nreceived Roman garrisons; as did most of the cities of \nTuscany.\n\nIn the mean time, Vitiges having collected an army \nof 150,000 men, resolved to march directly to Rome, \nand engage Belifarius; or, if he declined an engage-\nment, to lay siege to the city. But apprehending \nthat the Franks, who were in confederacy with the \nemperor, might <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> upon him at the same time, he \nsent ambassadors to them, with offers of all the Gothic \npossessions in Gaul, besides a considerable sum of \nmoney, provided they joined him against the emperor. \nThe Franks with their usual treachery consented to the \nproposal, received the money and the territories agreed \non, and then refused to fulfil the terms of the treaty. \nVitiges, however, began his march to Rome, leaving \nbehind him all the fortified <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, the \nreduction of which he knew would cost him too much \ntrouble. Belifarius, whose army, reduced by the \nmany towns he had garrisoned, did not now amount \nto above 5000 men, dispatched messengers to Constan-\ntianus in Tuscany; and to Bellas, by nation a Goth, \nbut of the emperor's party, in Umbria, with orders \nto join him with all possible expedition; writing at \nthe same time to the emperor himself for supplies in \nthe most pressing manner. Constantianus joined him \npursuant to his orders; and soon after, Bellas, fall-\ning in with part of the enemy's vanguard, killed a \nconsiderable number of them, and put the rest to flight. \nBelifarius had built a fort upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> \nfrom Rome, and placed a strong garrison in it to \ndispute the passage with the enemy; but the garrison, \nfeeling with a panic at the approach of the Goths, \nabandoned their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POST\">post</a> in the night, and fled into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CAM\">Cam</a>-\npania. Early in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> Vitiges passed over great \npart of his army, and marched on till he was met by \nBelifarius, who, knowing nothing of what had hap-\npened, came with 1000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> to view the ground \nabout the bridge. He was greatly surprized when he \nbeheld the enemy marching up against him; however, \nengaged lest he should heighten their courage by his flight or \nmen be-\nretreat, he stood his ground, and received the enemy at \nthe head of his small body, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> himself, without \nhis usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a>, to the greatest dan-\ngers. Being known by some fugitives, and discovered \nto the enemy, they all aimed at him alone, which \nmade his own men the more solicitous to defend him; \nso that the whole contest was for some time about his \nperson. At last the Goths were driven back to their \ncamp, which the Romans with great temerity attempt-\ned to force. In this attempt, however, they met with \nsuch a vigorous resistance, that they soon abandoned \nthe enterprise, and retired with precipitation to a \nneighbouring eminence; whence they were forced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> \nby the enemy, put to flight, and pursued to the very \ngates of the city. Here they were in greater danger \nthan ever; for those within, fearing that the enemy \nmight in that confusion enter with them, refused to \nadmit them. The general himself cried out earnestly \nto them, telling who he was, and commanding them \nto open the gates; but as they had been informed by \nthose who first fled, that he was slain, and they could \nnot distinguish him on account of the blood and dust \nwith which his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> was covered, they gave no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> to \nwhat he said. In this extremity, having encouraged \nhis men, who were now driven into a narrow compass, \nto make a last effort, he put himself at their head, and \nattacked the enemy with such fury, that the Goths \nimagining fresh troops were falling out upon them, \nbegan to give ground, and at last retired to their \ncamp. The Roman general did not pursue them; but \nentered the city, where he was received with loud accla-\nmations.\n\nA few days after, the city was closely invested by \nVitiges; who, to distress the inhabitants, pulled down \nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-AQUEDUCTS\">aqueducts</a> by which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> was conveyed into the Goths' \ncity, and which had been built at an immense charge \nby the Roman emperors. Belifarius on his part omit-\nted nothing for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>; in such that the coward-\nly citizens assembled in a tumultuous manner, and railed \nat the general on account of his supposed temerity. \nVitiges, to encourage this mutinous disposition, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIS\">dis</a>-\npatched ambassadors to the senate with proposals of \npeace. These ambassadors, however, were dismissed \nwithout any answer, and the siege was begun with \ngreat vigour. Belifarius made a gallant defence, and \nin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> months is said to have destroyed 40,000 of \nthe Goths. About this time he received a supply of \n1600 archers from the emperor; and these, in several \nsuccessful actions, are said to have killed 4000 more of \nthe enemy.\n\nThe Romans, elated with their successes, now be-\ncame impatient for an engagement; and at last, not-\nwithstanding\nwithstanding all the remonstrances of their general, forced him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> them out against the enemy. The success was answerable to the rash attempt. The Romans were defeated, with the loss of some of their bravest officers, and a great many of their common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>; after which they contented themselves with falling out in small parties, which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> did with the greatest success.\n\nBut though the Romans had the satisfaction of thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> off their enemies, they were most grievously afflicted with a famine and plague; insomuch that the inhabitants, no longer able to bear their calamities, were on the point of forcing Belisarius to venture a second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, when a reasonable supply of troops, viz. 3000 Ilaurians, 800 Thracian horse, and 1300 horde of other nations, together with 500 Italians who joined them by the way, arrived at Rome. Belisarius immediately fell back by the Flaminian gate, and fell upon the Goths in order to give his allies time to enter by the opposite side of the city, which they did without the loss of a man.\u2014The Goths hearing of the arrival of these troops, and their numbers being magnified as is usual in such cases, began to despair of becoming masters of the city; especially as the famine and plague raged with great violence in their camp, and their army was much reduced. Ambassadors were therefore dispatched to Belisarius with proposals of peace; but the only thing they could obtain was a cessation of arms for three months, during which time they might send ambassadors to the emperor. The negotiations with the emperor, however, proved unsuccessful; and the siege was pursued with great vigour till Vitiges received the news of the taking of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIMINI\">Rimini</a> by the Romans. As this city was but a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>'s journey from Ravenna, the Goths were so much alarmed, that they immediately raised the siege of Rome, after it had continued a year and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> days. Belisarius fell upon their rear as they passed the bridge of the Tiber, and cut great numbers of them in pieces, while others, struck with panic, threw themselves into the river and were drowned.\n\nThe first enterprise of Vitiges, after raising the siege of Rome, was an attempt upon Rimini; but while he was employed in this siege, the Romans made themselves masters of Milan; upon which a Gothic general, named Uraia, was immediately dispatched with a powerful army to retake it. In the mean time, however, a supply of 7000 Romans arrived from the emperor, under the command of Narset, a celebrated general. The immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this was the raising of the siege of Rimini; for Vitiges perceiving the two Roman armies coming against him, and concluding, from the many fires they made, that they were much more numerous than they really were, fled in such haste, that the greatest part of the baggage was left behind. The confusion of the Goths was so great, that, had not the garrison been extremely feeble, they might have easily cut them off in their retreat, and thus put an end to the war at once. The success of the Romans, however, was now retarded by some misunderstandings between the two generals: so that, though Belisarius made himself master of Urbinum and Urbicentum, while Narset reduced some other places, yet the important city of Milan was suffered to fall into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the Goths, who massacred all the inhabitants that were able to bear arms, to the number of 300,000, and sold the women for slaves. The city was also totally demolished; and this disaster made such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on the mind of Justinian, that he immediately recalled Narset, and gave the command of his troops to Belisarius.\n\nVitiges, who had promised himself great advantages from the disagreement of the two generals, was much disappointed by the recall of Narset; and therefore dreading the power of Belisarius when at the head of a formidable army, thought of engaging in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> with some foreign prince. In his choice, however, he was somewhat at a loss. He knew the treachery of the Franks, and therefore did not apply to them. He applied to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOMBARDS\">Lombards</a>; but, though tempted by the offer of a large sum of money, they continued inviolably attached to the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>. At last he found means to persuade Chosroes king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a> to make war upon Justinian, which he thought would infallibly procure the recall of Belisarius. But the Roman general, understanding his design, pushed on the war in the most vigorous manner; while, in the meantime, the treacherous Franks, thinking both nations sufficiently weakened by their mutual hostilities, resolved to attack both, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> upon the country for which they contended. Accordingly, Theodebert, unmindful of the oaths he had taken both to the Goths and Romans, passed the Alps at the head of 150,000, or, as some will have it, 200,000 men, and entered Liguria. As no hostilities were committed by them on their march, the Goths concluded that they were come to their assistance; and therefore took care to supply them with provisions. Thus they crossed the Po without opposition; and having secured the bridge, marched towards the place, where a body of Goths was encamped; who, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> upon them as friends, admitted them without hesitation. But they were soon convinced of their mistake; for the Franks falling unexpectedly upon them, drove them out of the camp with great slaughter, and seized on their baggage and provisions. A body of Romans that lay at a small distance from the Goths concluding that they had been defeated by Belisarius, advanced with great joy to meet him as they imagined; but the Franks falling unexpectedly upon them, drove them out of the camp with great slaughter, and seized on their baggage and provisions. Thus they acquired a very considerable booty and store of provisions; but the latter being soon consumed, and the country round about quite exhausted, vast numbers of the Franks perished; so that Theodebert at last found himself obliged to return. In his way he destroyed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENOA\">Genoa</a> and several other places, and arrived in his own dominions loaded with booty.\n\nIn the mean time, Belisarius was making great progress. He took the cities of Auximum and Pesulacum, after an obstinate siege; the inhabitants of the former having for some time fed on grass before they would surrender. After this he invested Ravenna, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of all the Gothic dominions in Italy. The place was defended by a very numerous garrison, commanded by the king in person, who exerted all his bravery in the defence of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>. As the siege, however, was pushed on with great vigour, it was evident that the city must at last submit; and the great success of the Romans began to give jealousy to the neighbouring potentates.\npotentates. Theodebert king of the Franks offered to afflit Vitiges with an army of 500,000 men; but Belisarius, being informed of this negotiation, sent ambassadours to Vitiges, putting him in mind of the treachery of the Franks, and assured him that the emperor was ready to grant him very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> terms. The king, by the advice of his counsellors, rejected the alliance of the Franks, and sent ambassadours to Constantinople; but in the mean time, Belisarius, in order to bring the citizens to his own terms, bribed one of them to set fire to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">magazine</a> of corn, by which means the city was soon starved for want of provisions. But, notwithstanding this disaster, they still continued to hold out, till the arrival of the ambassadours from Constantinople, who brought very favourable terms. These were, That the country beyond the Po, with respect to Rome, should remain to the Goths; but that the rest of Italy should be yielded to the emperor, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> of the Goths should be equally divided between him and the king. To these conditions, however, Belisarius positively refused to assent; being desirous of leading captive the king of the Goths, as he had formerly done the king of the Vandals, to Constantinople. He therefore pursued the siege with more vigour than ever, without hearkening to the complaints of his soldiers and officers, who were quite tired out with the length of the siege: he only obliged such of the officers as were of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that the town could not be taken, to express their opinion in writing, that they might not deny it afterwards.\n\nThe Goths were as weary of the siege as the Romans; but fearing lest Justinian should transplant them to Thrace, formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>, without the consent of their king, of surrendering to Belisarius himself, and declaring him emperor of the west. To this they were the more encouraged by the refusal of Belisarius to agree to the terms propounded by the emperor; whence they concluded that he designed to revolt, and make himself emperor of Italy. Of this, however, Belisarius had no design; but thought proper to accept of that title, in order to accelerate the surrender of the city, after acquainting his principal officers with what had passed. Vitiges at last discovered the plot; but finding himself in no condition to oppose it, he commended the resolution of his people, and even wrote to Belisarius, encouraging him to take upon him the title of king, and assuring him of his affiance. Upon this Belisarius pressed the Goths to surrender; which, however, they still refused, till he had taken an oath that he would treat them with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, and maintain them in the possession of all their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> and privileges. He was then admitted into the city, where he conducted himself with great moderation towards the Goths; but seized on the royal treasure, and secured the person of the king. The Roman army, when it entered Ravenna, appeared so very inconsiderable, that the Gothic women on beholding it could not forbear spitting in the faces of their husbands, and reviling them as cowards.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a> of Vitiges, and the capture of Ravenna, did not terminate the war. Belisarius was soon after recalled to take the command of the army in the east. The Goths were greatly surprized that he should leave his new kingdom out of regard to the orders of the emperor; but, after his departure, chose one Ildebaldo, a man of great experience in affairs both civil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a>, for their king. He revived the drooping spirits of his countrymen, defeated the Romans, and reduced all the province of Venetia; but was in a short time murdered, and Eraric, a Rugian, succeeded to the throne. He was scarcely invested with the sovereignty, when his subjects began to think of deposing him, and raising Totila to the throne; which the latter accepted, upon condition that they previously dispatched Eraric. This was accordingly done; after which Totila was proclaimed king of Italy in the year 542.\n\nThe new king proved a very formidable enemy to the Romans, who now lost ground everywhere. They made an attempt on the city of Verona; in which they miscarried through their own avarice, having disputed about the division of the plunder till the opportunity of taking the town was past. They were next defeated in two bloody engagements; the consequence of which was, that the Goths made themselves masters of all the strong places in Tuscany. From thence marching into Campania and Samnium, they reduced the strong town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVENTUM\">Beneventum</a>, and laid siege to Naples. During the siege of this last place, several detachments were sent from the king's army, which took Cumae, and recovered all Brutia, Lucania, Apulia, and Calabria, where they found considerable sums which had been gathered for the emperor's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. The Romans, in the mean time, disheartened by their losses, and deprived of those sums which should have paid their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a>, refused to take the field. A considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> was therefore sent by Justinian to the relief of Naples; but Totila, having timely notice of this design, manned, with incredible expedition, a great number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> vessels; which, falling unexpectedly on the Roman fleet, took or sunk every ship, and made prisoners of all on board, excepting a few who escaped in their boats. A similar fate attended another fleet dispatched from Sicily for the same purpose. They put to sea in the depth of winter; and, meeting with a violent storm, were driven ashore near the enemy's camp; who sunk the ships, and made what slaughter they pleased of the seamen and soldiers. Upon this second disaster, the Neapolitans, despairing of further relief, submitted to Totila; who granted them honourable terms, and treated them with great humanity. As they had been long pinched with famine, Totila, apprehending they might endanger their lives by indulging their appetites too much at first, placed guards at the gates to prevent their going out, taking care at the same time to supply them sparingly with provisions, but increasing their allowance every day. Being thus by degrees restored to their former strength, he ordered the gates to be let open, and gave every one full liberty to stay in the city or remove as he thought fit. The garrison he treated with extraordinary kindness. They were first supplied with ships to carry them to Constantinople; but the king having discovered that their real design was to fail to Rome, in order to reinforce the garrison of that city (which they knew he was soon to besiege), he was so far from punishing them as they expected, that he furnished them with horses, waggons, and provisions, and ordered a body of Goths to escort them to Rome by land.\nItaly, land, as the winds had proved unfavourable for their passage by sea.\n\nTotila having thus become master of Naples and most of the other fortresses in these parts, began to think of reducing Rome also. He first attempted to persuade the citizens to surrender; but finding his persuasions ineffectual, he sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> of his army into Calabria to reduce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OTRANTO\">Otranto</a>, which had not yet submitted; after which, he marched with the rest of his forces against the towns in the neighbourhood of Rome. The city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIBUR\">Tibur</a>, now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIVOLI\">Tivoli</a>, about 18 miles from Rome, was betrayed to him; and all the inhabitants, together with their bishop, were put to the sword. Several other strong holds in the neighbourhood of that city he took by storm; so that Rome was in a manner blocked up by land, all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with the neighbouring country being cut off.\n\nJustinian, in the mean time, being greatly perplexed by the bad news he every day received from Italy, recalled Belisarius from Persia, notwithstanding the success which attended him there. To save Rome, however, was now impossible even for Belisarius himself. As soon as he arrived in Italy, finding himself unable either to relieve the towns which were besieged, or to stop the progress of the Goths, he dispatched letters to Justinian, informing him, that being destitute of men, arms, and money, it was impossible for him to prosecute the war; upon which the emperor ordered new levies to be made, all the veterans being engaged in the Persian war. In the mean time, however, Totila pursued his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a>; took the cities of Firmum, Aculum, Auximum, Spoletum, &c., and at length advanced to Rome, which he invested on all sides. As he drew near the city, two officers, whom Belisarius had sent into the city, ventured to make a fall, though contrary to the express orders of their general, thinking they should surprise the Goths; but they were themselves taken in an ambuscade, and, most of their men being cut in pieces, narrowly escaped falling into the hands of the enemy. Belisarius made several attempts to relieve the city: but all of them, however well concerted, by some accident or other proved unsuccessful; which gave him so much uneasiness, that he fell into a feverish disorder, and was for some time thought to be in danger of his life. The city was soon reduced to great straits; a dreadful famine ensued; and the unhappy citizens having consumed everything that could be supposed to give them nourishment, even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a> that grew near the walls, were obliged, it is said, to feed on their own excrements. Many put an end to their lives, in order to free themselves from the intolerable calamities they suffered. The rest addressed their governor Bessas in the most pathetic manner, intreating him to supply them with food; or if that was not in his power, either to give them leave to go out of the town, or to terminate their miseries by putting them to death. Bessas replied, that to supply them with food was impossible; to let them go, unsafe; and to kill them impious. In the end, however, he suffered those who were willing to retire, to leave the city, upon paying him a sum of money; but most of them either died on the road, or were cut in pieces by the enemy. At last, the besieged, unable to bear their miseries any longer, began to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTINY\">mutiny</a>, and to press their governor to come to an agreement with Totila. This, however, he still refused; upon which, four of the Iaurians who guarded one of the gates, went privately to the camp of Totila, and offered to admit him into the city. The king received this proposal with great joy; and sending four Goths of great strength and intrepidity into the town, along with them, he silently approached the gates in the nighttime with his whole army. The gates were opened by the Iaurians, as they had promised; and upon the first alarm, Bessas with most of the soldiers and officers fled out of the town. The inhabitants took sanctuary in the churches; and only 60 of them and 26 soldiers were killed after the town was taken. Totila, however, gave his soldiers full liberty to plunder the city; which they did for several days together, stripping the inhabitants of all their wealth, and leaving nothing in their houses but naked walls; by which means many persons of distinction were reduced to beg their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> from door to door. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of Bessas was found an immense treasure, which he had scandalously amassed during the siege, by selling to the people, at an exorbitant price, the corn which had been stored up for the use of the garrison.\n\nTotila, thus become master of Italy, sent ambassadors to Justinian with very respectful letters, desiring to live on the same terms with him that Theodoric had done with his predecessor Anailafius; promising in that case to respect him as his father, and to assist him, when he pleased, with all his force, against any other nation whatever. On the contrary, if the emperor rejected his offers, he threatened to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> Rome with the ground, to put the whole senate to the sword, and to carry the war into Illyricum. The emperor returned no other answer than that he referred the whole to Belisarius, who had full power to manage all things of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. Upon this Totila resolved to destroy the city; and had actually thrown down a third part of the wall, when he received a letter from Belisarius, disfavouring him from his intention. After having seriously considered this letter, Totila thought proper to alter his resolution with regard to the destruction of the city; but sent every one of the inhabitants into Lucania, without leaving a single person in the metropolis. Belisarius hearing of this, immediately returned to the capital, and undertook to repopulate and repair it. He cleared the ditch which had been filled by Totila, but was for the present obliged to fill up the breaches in the walls with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> loosely heaped upon one another, and in this situation the city was again attacked by the Goths. Belisarius, however, had taken care to supply the inhabitants with plenty of provisions, so that they were now in no danger of suffering by famine; and the assaults of the enemy were vigorously repelled, notwithstanding the bad situation of the fortifications, so that Totila at last abandoned the enterprise.\n\nIn the mean time the Persians gained great advantages over the Romans in the East, so that there was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> for recalling Belisarius a second time. He was no sooner gone, than Totila renewed his efforts with greater vigour than ever; and at the same time the Franks, concluding that both Romans and Goths would be much weakened by such a destructive war, seized upon Venetia, which belonged to both nations, and made it a province of the French empire. Totila did not oppose them; but having obtained a reinforcement of\nof 6000 Lombards, returned immediately before Rome, fully intent on making himself master of that metropolis. Having closely invested it by sea and land, he hoped in a short time to reduce it by famine; but against this the governor wisely provided, by causing corn to be sown within the walls; so that he could probably have defeated the power of Totila, had not the city been again betrayed by the Haurians, who opened one of the gates and admitted the enemy.\n\nThus the empire of the Goths was a third time established in Italy; and Totila, immediately on his becoming master of Rome, dispatched ambassadors to Justinian, offering to assist him as a faithful ally against any nation whatever, provided he would allow him the quiet possession of Italy. But Justinian was so far from hearkening to this proposal, that he would not even admit the ambassadors into his presence; upon which Totila resolved to pursue the war with the utmost vigour, and to make himself master not only of those places which the Romans possessed in Italy, but in Sicily also. This he fully accomplished; when Narves, who had formerly been joined in the command with Belifarius, was appointed general, with absolute and uncontrolled authority. But while this general was making the necessary preparations for his expedition, Totila, having equipped a fleet of 300 galleys, sent them to pillage the coasts of Greece, where they got an immense booty. They made a descent on the island of Corfu; and having laid it waste, they failed to Epirus, where they surprised and plundered the cities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NICOPOLIS\">Nicopolis</a> and Anchialus, taking many ships on the coast, among which were some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a> with provisions for the army of Narves. After these successes they laid siege to Ancona in Dalmatia. Being defeated, however, both by sea and land, Totila once more sent ambassadors to Constantinople, offering to yield Sicily and all Dalmatia, to pay an annual tribute for Italy, and to assist the Romans as a faithful ally in all their wars; but Justinian, bent upon driving the Goths out of Italy, would not even suffer the ambassadors to appear in his presence.\n\nTotila finding that no terms could be obtained, began to levy new forces, and to make great preparations by sea and land. He soon reduced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a> of Corfuca and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARDINIA\">Sardinia</a>; but this was the last of his successes. Narves arrived in Italy with a very formidable army, and an immense treasure to pay the troops their arrears, the want of which had been one great cause of the bad success of Belifarius in his last expedition. He immediately took the road to Rome; while Totila assembled all his forces, in order to decide the fate of Italy by a general engagement. The battle proved very obstinate; but at last the Gothic cavalry being put to the rout, and retiring in great confusion among the infantry, the latter were thereby thrown into such disorder, that they could never afterwards rally. Narves, observing their confusion, encouraged his men to make a last effort; which the Goths not being able to withstand, betook themselves to flight, with the loss of 6000 men killed on the spot. Totila finding the day irrecoverably lost, fled with only five horsemen for his attendants; but was pursued and mortally wounded by a commander of one of the bodies of barbarians who followed Narves. He continued his flight, however, for some time longer; but was at last obliged to halt in order to get his wound dressed, soon after which he expired.\n\nThis disaster did not yet entirely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the spirit of the Goths. They chose for their king one Teia, deservedly esteemed one of the most valiant men of their nation, and who had on several occasions distinguished himself in a most eminent manner. All the valour and experience of Teia, however, were now insufficient to stop the progress of the Romans. Narves made himself master of a great number of cities, and of Rome itself, before the Goths could assemble their forces.\u2014The Roman general next proceeded to invest Cumae; which Teia determined at all events to relieve, as the royal treasure was lodged in that city. This brought on an engagement, which, if Procopius is to be credited, proved one of the most bloody that ever was fought. The Roman army consisted of vast multitudes brought from different nations: the Goths were few in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>; but, animated by despair, and knowing that all was at stake, they fought with the utmost fury. Their king placed himself in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, to encourage his men by his example; and is said to have given such proofs of his valour and conduct as equalled him to the most renowned heroes of antiquity. The Romans discovering him, and knowing that his death would probably put an end to the battle, if not to the war itself, directed their whole force against him, some attacking him with spears, and others discharging against him showers of darts and arrows. Teia maintained his ground with great intrepidity, received the missiles weapons on his shield, and killed a great number of the enemy with his own hand. When his shield was so loaded with darts that he could not easily wield it, he called for another. Thus he shifted his shield three times; but as he attempted to change it another time, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> being necessarily exposed for a moment, a dart struck him in that moment with such force, that he immediately fell down dead in the place where he had stood from the beginning of the battle, and upon heaps of the enemy whom he had killed. The Romans, seeing him fall, cut off his head and exposed it to the sight of the Goths, not doubting but they would be immediately disheartened and retire. In this, however, they were disappointed. The Goths maintained the fight with great vigour, till night put an end to the engagement. The next day the engagement was renewed early in the morning, and continued till night; but on the third day, the Goths despairing of being able to overcome an enemy so much superior to them in numbers, sent deputies to Narves, offering to lay down their arms, provided such of them as chose to remain in Italy were allowed to enjoy their estates and possessions without molestation, as subjects of the empire; and those who were willing to retire elsewhere, were suffered to carry with them all their goods and effects. To these terms Narves readily assented; and thus the empire of the Goths in Italy was finally destroyed, the country now becoming a province of the eastern Roman empire.\n\nIn this conquest Narves had been assisted, as already observed, by many barbarous nations, among whom were the Lombards, at that time settled in Pannonia. On the conclusion of the war, they were dismissed with rich presents, and the nation for some time continued...\ncontinued faithful allies to the Romans. In the mean time Julian dying, Narfes, who governed Italy with an absolute sway, was accused to the emperor Justin II. and to the empress Sophia, of aspiring to the sovereignty of the country. Hereupon he was recalled, and Longinus sent to succeed him. As Narfes was an eunuch, the empress is reported to have said, that his employment at Constantinople should be to distribute in the apartment of her women the portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a> which each was to spin. Narfes, enraged at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARCE\">farce</a>, replied, that he should begin such a web as he should never be able to finish; and immediately dispatched messengers to Alboinus king of the Lombards, inviting them into Italy. Along with the messengers he sent some of the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> the country afforded, in order to tempt him the more to become master of such a rich kingdom.\n\nAlboinus, highly pleased with the opportunity of invading a country with which his subjects were already well acquainted, began without loss of time to make the necessary preparations for his journey. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of April, 568, he set out with his whole nation, men, women, and children; carrying with them all their moveables. This promiscuous multitude arrived by the way of Istria; and advancing through the province of Venetia, found the whole country abandoned, the inhabitants having fled to the neighbouring islands in the Adriatic. The gates of Aquileia were opened by the few inhabitants who had courage to stay; most of them, however, had fled with all their valuable effects; and among the rest the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAULINUS\">Paulinus</a>, who had carried with him all the sacred utensils of the churches. From Aquileia, Alboinus proceeded to Forum Julii, of which he likewise became master without opposition. Here he spent the winter; during which time he erected Friuli into a dukedom, which has continued ever since. In 569, he made himself master of Trivigli, Oderzo, Monte Selce, Vicenza, Verona, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENT\">Trent</a>; in each of which cities he left a strong garrison of Lombards under the command of an officer, whom he distinguished by the title of duke; but these dukes were only officers and governors of cities, who bore the title no longer than the prince thought proper to continue them in their command or government. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PADUA\">Padua</a> and some other cities Alboinus left behind him without attempting to reduce them, either because they were too well garrisoned, or because they lay too much out of his way. In 572, he entered Liguria. The inhabitants were so terrified at his approach, that they left their habitations with such of their effects as they could carry off, and fled into the most mountainous and inaccessible parts of the country. The cities of Brescia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERGAMO\">Bergamo</a>, Lodi, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMO\">Como</a>, and others quite to the Alps, being left almost without inhabitants, submitted of course; after which he reduced Milan, and was thereupon proclaimed king of Italy.\n\nBut though the Lombards had thus conferred the title of king of Italy on their sovereign, he was by no means possessed of the whole country, nor indeed was it ever in the power of the Lombards to get possession of the whole. Alboinus having made himself master of Venetia, Liguria, Aemilia, Hetruria, and Umbria, applied himself to legislation and the civilization of his subjects. But before he could make any progress in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, he was taken off by the treachery of his wife; and Clephis, one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a>, chosen king in his stead. Clephis rebuilt some cities which had been ruined during the wars between the Goths and Romans, and extended his conquests to the very gates of Rome; but as he behaved both to the Romans and Lombards with the greatest cruelty, he was murdered, after a short reign of 18 months. His cruelty gave the Lombards such an aversion against regal power, that they changed their form of government, being governed only by their dukes for the space of ten years. During this interregnum, they proved successful in their wars with the Romans, and made themselves masters of several cities; but perceiving that their kingdom, thus divided, could not subsist, they resolved once more to submit to the authority of one man; and accordingly, in 585, Autharis was chosen king of the Lombards.\n\nThe great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of ambition to the new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> of subdued Lombard monarchs was the conquest of all Italy; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLEMAGNE\">Charlemagne</a>, as related under the article France, No. 27. As the Lombards, however, had not been possessed of the whole territory of Italy, so the whole of it never came into the possession of Charlemagne; neither since the time of the Goths, has the whole of this country been under the dominion of any single state. Some of the southern provinces were still possessed by the emperors of Constantinople; and the liberal grants of Pepin and Charlemagne himself to the pope, had invested him with a considerable share of temporal power. The territories of the pope indeed were supposed to be held in vassalage from France; but this the popes themselves always stoutly denied. The undivided territory of Italy, therefore, was restricted to dominions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIEDMONT\">Piedmont</a>, the Milanese, the Mantuan, the territory of Genoa, Parma, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODENA\">Modena</a>, Tuscany, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOLOGNA\">Bologna</a>, the dukedoms of Friuli, Spoleto, and Benevento; the last of which contained the greatest part of the present kingdom of Naples.\n\nThe feudal government which the Lombards had introduced into Italy, naturally produced revolts and commotions, as the different dukes inclined either to change their masters or to set up for themselves. Several revolts indeed happened during the life of Charlemagne himself; which, however, he always found means to crush; but after his death, the sovereignty of Italy became an object of contention between the kings of France and the emperors of Germany. That great monarch had divided his extensive dominions among his children; but they all died during his lifetime, except <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a>, whom he associated with himself in the empire, and who succeeded to all his dominions after his death. From this time we may date the troubles with which Italy was so long overwhelmed; and of which, as they proceeded from the ambition of those called kings of Italy and their nobles, of the kings of France, and of the emperors of Germany, it is difficult to have any clear idea. The following short sketch, however, may perhaps give some satisfaction on this perplexed subject.\n\nAt the time Louis the son of Charlemagne was declared emperor of the West, Italy was held by Berengar, the son of Pepin, brother to Louis. Though this time of Bernard bore the title of king, yet he was only acknowledged.\ncounted a vassal of the emperor. His ambition, however, soon prompted him to rebel against his uncle; but being abandoned by his troops, he was taken prisoner, had his eyes pulled out, and died three days after. As the disturbances still continued, and the nobles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOMBARDY\">Lombardy</a> were yet very refractory, Lothaire, eldest son to the emperor, was in the year 823 sent into Italy; of which country he was first crowned king at Rome, and afterwards emperor of the West, during his father's lifetime. But though his abilities were sufficient to have settled everything in a state of tranquillity, his unbounded ambition prompted him to engage in a rebellion against his father; whom he more than once took prisoner; though in the end he was obliged to submit, and ask <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> for his offences, which was obtained only on condition of his not passing the Alps without leave obtained from his father.\n\nIn the mean time, the Saracens, taking advantage of these intestine wars, landed on the coasts of Italy, and committed such ravages, that even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> were obliged to arm themselves for the defence of the country. Lothaire, however, after returning from his unnatural war with his father, was so far from attempting to put an end to these ravages, or to restore tranquillity, that he seized on some places belonging to the see of Rome, under pretence that they were part of his kingdom of Lombardy; nor would he forbear these encroachments till expressly commanded to do so by his father. After having embroiled himself, and almost lost all his dominions, in a war with his brothers after the death of Louis, and declared his son, also called Louis, king of Italy, this ambitious prince died, leaving to Louis the title of emperor as well as king of Italy, with which he had before invested him.\n\nThe new emperor applied himself to the restoration of tranquillity in his dominions, and driving out the Saracens from those places which they had seized in Italy. This he fully accomplished, and obliged the infidels to retire into Africa; but in 875 he died without naming any successor. After his death, some of the Italian nobles, headed by the duke of Tuscany, represented to the pope, that as Louis had left no successor, the regal dignity, which had so long been usurped by foreigners, ought now to return to the Italians. The pope, however, finding that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> the Bald, king of France, had such an ambition for the imperial crown, that he would stick at nothing to obtain it, resolved to gratify him, though at as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> a price as possible. He accordingly crowned him emperor and king of Lombardy, on condition of his owning the independency of Rome, and that he himself only held the empire by the gift of the pope. This produced a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> among the discontented nobles; and at the same time the Saracens renewing their incursions, threatened the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> territories with the utmost danger. The pope solicited the emperor's assistance with the greatest earnestness; but the latter died before anything effectual could be done; after which, being distressed by the Saracens on one hand, and the Lombard nobles on the other, the unhappy pontiff was forced to fly into France. Italy now fell into the utmost confusion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a>; during which time many of the nobles and states of Lombardy assumed an independency, which they have ever since retained.\n\nIn 877, the pope was reconducted to Italy with an army by Boson, son-in-law to Louis II. of France; but though he inclined very much to have raised this prince to the dignity of king of Italy, he found his interest insufficient for that purpose, and matters remained in their former situation. The nobles, who had driven out the pope, were now indeed reconciled to him; but notwithstanding this reconciliation, the state of the country was worse than ever: the great men renouncing the authority of any superior, and every one claiming to be sovereign in his own territories. To add to the calamities which ensued through the ambition of these despots, the Saracens committed everywhere the most terrible ravages; till at last the Italian nobles, despising the kings of the Carolingian race, who had weakened themselves by their mutual dissensions, began to think of throwing off even all nominal submission to a foreign yoke, and retaining the imperial dignity among themselves. Thus they hoped, that, by being more united among themselves, they might be more able to resist the common enemy. Accordingly in 885 they went to Pope Adrian; and requesting him to join them in asserting the independency of Italy, they obtained of him the two following decrees, viz. That the popes, after their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a>, might be consecrated without waiting for the presence of the king or his ambassadors; and that, if Charles the Grofs died without sons, the kingdom of Italy, with the title of emperor, should be conferred on some of the Italian nobles.\n\nThese decrees were productive of the worst consequences imaginable. The emperor complained of being deprived of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>; and the dissensions between the Italian nobles themselves became more fatal than ever. The two most powerful of these noblemen, Berengarius duke of Friuli, and Guido or Vido duke of Spoleto, entered into an agreement, that on the death of the emperor the former should seize on the kingdom of Italy, and the latter on the kingdom of France. Berengarius succeeded without opposition; but Vido was disappointed, the French having already chosen Eudes or Otho for their king. Upon this he returned to Italy, and turned his arms against Berengarius. Vido proved victorious in an engagement, and drove his rival into Germany; where he fought the affiance of Arnolpus, who had succeeded to the crown after the death of Charles. Having thus obtained the kingdom of Italy, Vido employed his time in reforming the abuses of the state, and confirming the grants formerly given to the pope, out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> for his having sanctified his usurpation and declared him lawful king of Italy. This tranquillity, however, was of short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>. Arnolpus sent an army into Italy; the Saracens from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> ravaged the northern parts of the country, and getting possession of a castle near the Alps, held it for many years after, to the great distress of the neighbouring parts, which were exposed to their continual incursions; and at the same time Benevento was besieged and taken by the forces of the eastern emperor, so that Vido found his empire very considerably circumscribed in its dimensions.\n\nThe new king, distressed by so many enemies, associated his son Lambert with him in the government,\nand bribed the Germans to return to their own country. In 893, however, they again invaded Italy; but were suddenly obliged to leave the country, after having put Berengarius in possession of Pavia. In the mean time, Vido died, and his son Lambert drove out Berengarius; but having joined a faction, headed by one Sergius, against Pope Formosus, the latter offered the kingdom of Italy to Arnolphi; who thereupon entered the country with an army, besieged and took Rome, massacring the faction of Sergius with the most unrelenting cruelty.\n\nArnolphus thus master of Italy, and crowned emperor by the pope, began to form schemes of strengthening himself in his new acquisitions by putting out the eyes of Berengarius; but the latter having timely notice of this treachery, fled to Verona; and the Italians were so provoked at this and the other cruelties of Arnolphus, that they drove him out of the country. His departure occasioned the greatest confusion at Rome. Formosus died soon after; and the successors to the papal dignity, having now no army to fear, excited the greatest disturbances. The body of Formosus was dug up and thrown into the Tiber by one pope; after which that pope was strangled, and Formosus' body buried again in the Vatican, by order of another. At last the coronation of Arnolphus was declared void, the Sergian faction entirely demolished, and the above-mentioned decrees of Adrian were annulled; it being now determined that the elected popes should not be consecrated but in presence of the emperor or his ambassadors.\n\nDuring these confusions Lambert enjoyed the kingdom in quiet; but the nobles hating him on account of his arbitrary and tyrannical government, began again to think of Berengarius. In the mean time, however, another faction offered the crown to Louis king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARLES\">Arles</a>. This new competitor entered Italy with an army in 899; but was forced by Berengarius to renounce his claim upon oath, and to swear that he would never again enter Italy, even though he should be invited to be crowned emperor.\u2014This oath, however, was soon forgotten. Louis readily accepted of another invitation, and was crowned king of Italy at Pavia in 901. The following year he forced Berengarius to fly into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAVARIA\">Bavaria</a>; but having unwisely disbanded his army, as thinking himself now securely seated on the throne, Berengarius, who watched every opportunity, surprized him at Verona, and put out his eyes.\n\nThus Berengarius at last became king of Italy without a rival; and held his kingdom for 20 years afterwards, without any opposition from his subjects, who at last became sensible of the mischiefs arising from civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCORD\">discord</a>. He was not yet, however, without troubles. The Hungarians invaded Italy with a formidable army, and advanced within a small distance of Pavia. Berengarius armed the whole force of his dominions; and came against them with such a multitude, that the Hungarians retired without venturing an engagement. A great many of their men were lost in passing a river; upon which they sent deputies to Berengarius, offering to restore all their booty, and never to come again into Italy, provided they were allowed a safe retreat. These conditions were imprudently denied; upon which the Hungarians attacked the army of Berengarius in despair, and defeated them with great slaughter. After this they overran the whole country, and plundered the towns of Trevilo, Vicenza, and Padua, without resistance, the inhabitants <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> everywhere into fortified places. This devastation they continued for two years; nor could their departure be procured without paying them a large sum of money; which, however, proved of little avail; for the following year they returned and ravaged the territory of Friuli without control. Scarcely were these invaders departed, when the Saracens, who had settled at the foot of the Alps, invaded Apulia and Calabria, and made an irruption as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACQUI\">Acqui</a> in the neighbourhood of Pavia; while the inhabitants, instead of opposing them, fled to some forts which had been erected in the time of the first irruption of the Hungarians. In 912, however, John, prelate of Ravenna, having attained the papal dignity by means of Theodora wife of Alderbert count of Tuscany, applied himself to regulate the affairs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, and to repel the insults of the Saracens. While he was considering on the most proper methods of effecting this, one of the Saracens, who had received an injury from his countrymen, fled to Rome, and offered to deliver the Italians from their invasions, if the pope would but allow him a small body of men. His proposals being accepted, 65 young men were chosen, all well armed; who being conducted by the Saracens into by paths, attacked the infidels as they were returning from their inroads, and several times defeated great parties of them. These losses affecting the Saracens, a general alliance was concluded amongst all their cities; and having fortified a town on the Garigliano, they abandoned the rest, and retired hither. Thus they became much more formidable than before; which alarming the pope, he consulted with Arnolphus prince of Benevento and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPUA\">Capua</a>, sending at the same time ambassadors to Constantine the Greek emperor, inviting him to an alliance against the infidels. The Saracens, unable to withstand such a powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a>, were besieged in their city; where being reduced to great straits, they at last set fire to it, and fellied out into the woods; but being pursued by the Italians, they were all cut off to a man.\n\nIn this expedition it is probable that Berengarius gave great assistance; for this very year, 915, he was crowned emperor by the pope. This gave displeasure to many of the ambitious nobles; conspiracies were repeatedly formed against him; in 922, Rodolphus king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURGUNDY\">Burgundy</a> was crowned also king of Italy; and in 924, Berengarius was treacherously assassinated at Verona; of which disturbances the Hungarians taking the advantage, plundered the cities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANTUA\">Mantua</a>, Brescia, and Bergamo. Marching afterwards to Pavia, they Pavia plundered it closely on all sides; and about the middle of March 925, taking advantage of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a>, they fell burnt by fire to the houses next the walls, and during the confusion broke open the gates, and getting possession of the city treated the inhabitants with the greatest barbarity. Having burnt the capital of the kingdom, they next proceeded to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACENTIA\">Placentia</a>, where they plundered the suburbs; and then returned to Pannonia laden with booty.\n\nThe affairs of Italy now fell into the utmost confusion. A faction was formed against Rodolphus in favour of Hugh count of Arles. The latter prevailed, and was crowned king at Pavia in 927. The Italians, however, soon repented of their choice. The Romans\nItaly first invited him to be their governor, and then drove him out with disgrace; at the same time choosing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a>, tribunes, &c., as if they had designed to assert their ancient liberty. One faction, in the mean time, offered the crown to Rodolphus, and the other to Arnold duke of Bavaria, while the Saracens took this opportunity to plunder the city of Genoa.\n\nHugh, in the mean time, was not inactive. Having collected an army, he marched directly against Arnold, and entirely defeated him. Rodolphus delivered him from all apprehensions on his part, by entering into an alliance with him, and giving his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> Adelaide in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> to Lotharius, Hugh's son. Being thus free from all danger from foreign enemies, he marched against the Romans; but with them he also came to an agreement, and even gave his daughter in marriage to Albert, whom they had chosen consul. In the meantime the country was infested by the Hungarians and Saracens, and at the same time depopulated by a plague. Endless conspiracies were formed against Hugh himself; and at last, in 947, he was totally deprived of the regal power by Berengarius, grandson to the first king of that name; soon after which he retired into Burgundy, and became a monk.\n\nThough Berengarius was thus possessed of the supreme power, he did not assume the title of king till after the death of Lotharius, which happened in 950; but in the mean time Italy was invaded by Henry duke of Bavaria, and the Hungarians. The former took and plundered the city of Aquileia, and ravaged the neighbouring country; after which he returned without molestation into Germany; the latter made a furious irruption; and Berengarius being unable to oppose them, was at last obliged to purchase their departure by money. In raising the sum agreed upon, however, Berengarius is said to have been more oppressive than even the Hungarians themselves. Every individual, without distinction of age or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, was obliged to pay so much for their head, not excepting even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>. The churches were likewise robbed; by which means the king raised an immense sum of money, ten bullocks of which he gave to the Hungarians, but kept the much greater part to himself.\n\nBerengarius, not yet satisfied, wanted to be put in possession of Pavia, which was held by Adelaide, the widow of Lotharius. In order to obtain his purpose, he proposed a marriage between her and his son Adelbert. This proposal was rejected; upon which Berengarius besieged and took the city. The queen was confined in a neighbouring castle, from whence she made her escape by a contrivance of her confessor. With him and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> attendant she concealed herself for some days in a wood; but being obliged to remove from thence for want of food, she applied for protection to Adelard bishop of Reggio. By him she was recommended to his uncle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTILA\">Attila</a>, who had a strong castle in the neighbourhood of Canoza. Here she was quickly besieged by Berengarius; upon which messengers were dispatched to Otho king of Germany, acquainting him, that, by expelling Berengarius, and marrying Adelaide, he might easily obtain the kingdom of Italy. This proposal he readily accepted, and married Adelaide; but allowed Berengarius to retain the greatest part of his dominions, upon condition of his doing homage for them to the kings of Germany.\n\nVol. XI. Part I.\n\nHe deprived him, however, of the dukedom of Friuli and marquisate of Verona, which he gave to Henry duke of Bavaria.\n\nBerengarius, thus freed from all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>, not only opprobred his subjects in a most tyrannical manner, but revolted against Otho himself. This at last provoked Italy and cured his ruin: for, in 961, Otho returned with an army into Italy, where he was crowned king by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of Milan; and the year following was crowned emperor by the pope. On this occasion he received the imperial crown from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a>, and kissed his feet with great humility: after which they both went to the altar of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>, and bound themselves by a solemn oath, the pope to be always faithful to the emperor, and to give no assistance to Berengarius or Adelbert his enemies; and Otho, to consult the welfare of the church, and to restore to it all its patrimony granted by former emperors. Otho, besides this, bestowed very rich presents on the church of St Peter. He ordained that the election of popes should be according to the canons; that the elected pope should not be consecrated till he had publicly promised, in presence of the emperor's commissaries, to observe every thing formerly specified with regard to the rights of the emperors; that these commissaries should constantly reside at Rome, and make a report every year how justice was administered by the judges; and in case of any complaints, the commissaries should lay them before the pope; but if he neglected to intimate them, the imperial commissaries might then do what they pleased.\n\nThus we see that Otho, however much he might allow the pope's supremacy in spiritual matters, plainly assumed the sovereignty in temporals to himself; and thus Italy was for upwards of 300 years accounted a part of the German empire. The popes, however, by no means relished this superiority of the emperor. The latter was hardly departed, when the pope, (John XII.) broke the oath which he had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> before sworn with so much solemnity; and entered first into an alliance with Adelbert count of Tuscany to expel the Germans, and then solicited the Hungarians to invade Italy. This treachery was soon punished by Otho. He returned with part of his army, and assembled a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of bishops. As the pope did not appear, Otho pretended great concern for his absence. The bishops replied, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of his guilt made him afraid to show himself. The emperor then inquired particularly into his crimes; upon which the bishops accused him of filling the palace with lewd women, of ordaining a bishop in a stable, castrating a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">cardinal</a>, drinking the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVIL\">devil</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>, &c. As the pope still refused to appear in order to justify himself from these charges, he was formally deposed; the pope and Leo the chief secretary, though a layman, elected in his stead.\n\nThe new pope, in compliment to the emperor, granted a bull, by which it was ordained that Otho and his successors should have a right of appointing the popes and investing archbishops and bishops; and that none should dare to consecrate a bishop without leave obtained from the emperor. Thus were the affairs of the Italians still kept in the utmost confusion even during the reign of Otho I., who appears to have been a wife and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> prince. He was no sooner gone, than the\nnew pope was deposed, all his decrees annulled, and John replaced. The party of Leo was now treated with great cruelty; but John was soon stopped in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAREER\">career</a>; for about the middle of May, the same year (964), in which he had been restored, being surprised in bed with a Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">lady</a>, he received a blow on the head from the devil (according to the authors of those times), of which he died eight days after. After his death a cardinal deacon, named Benedict, was elected by the Romans, but deposed by Otho, and banished to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAM\">Ham</a>-\n\nburgh.\n\nThe emperor was scarce returned to Germany, when his fickle Italians revolted, and sent for Adelbert, who had fled to Corsica. But being soon reduced, they continued quiet for about a year; after which they revolted again, and imprisoned the pope. Otho, however, provoked at their rebellious disposition, soon returned, and punished the rebels with great severity; after which he made several laws for the better regulation of the city of Rome, granting several privileges to the Venetians, and caused his son Otho, then only thirteen years of age, to be crowned emperor.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> being over, Otho dispatched an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> to Nicephorus, emperor of Constantinople, demanding his step-daughter Theophania in marriage for the young emperor; but upon this alliance being rejected, and that not without circumstances of the most atrocious perfidy, Otho instantly invaded the countries of Apulia and Calabria, and entirely defeated the Greek army in those parts. In the mean time, however, Nicephorus being killed, and his throne usurped by John Zimilces, Otho immediately entered into an alliance with the latter, and easily obtained Theophania for his son. She was crowned with great solemnity on the 8th of April 969: at the same time it is pretended by some authors, that the Greeks renounced their rights to Calabria and Apulia; though this is denied by others. After the celebration of this marriage, the emperor undertook an expedition against the Saracens, who still resided at the foot of the Alps; but being informed of the death of several nobles in Germany, he thought proper to return thither, where he died of an apoplexy in the year 973.\n\nAt the time of Otho's death Italy was divided into the provinces of Apulia, Calabria, the dukedom of Benevento, Campania, Terra Romana, the dukedom of Spoleto, Tuscany, Romagna, Lombardy, and the marquises of Ancona, Verona, Friuli, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-TREVISO\">Treviso</a>, and Genoa. Apulia and Calabria were still claimed by the Greeks; but all the rest were either immediately subject to, or held of, the kings of Italy. Otho conferred Benevento (including the ancient Samnium) on the duke of that name. Campania and Lucania he gave to the dukes of Capua, Naples, and Salerno. Rome with its territory, Ravenna with the exarchate, the dukedom of Spoleto, with Tuscany, and the marquisate of Ancona, he granted to the pope; and retained the rest of Italy under the form of a kingdom. Some of the cities were left free, but all tributary. He appointed several <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> marquises and counties, but referred to himself the sovereign jurisdiction in their territories. The liberty of the cities consisted in a freedom to choose their own magistrates, to be judged by their own laws, and to dispose of their own revenues, on condition that they took the oath of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> to the king, and paid the customary tribute. The cities that were not free were governed by the commissaries or lieutenants of the emperor; but the free cities were governed by two or more consuls, afterwards called podestates, chosen annually, who took the oath of allegiance to the emperor before the bishop of the city or the emperor's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSARY\">commissary</a>. The tribute exacted was called foderum, parata, et man-\n\njonicum. By the foderum was meant a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of corn which the cities were obliged to furnish to the king when marching with an army or making a progress through the country; though the value of this was frequently paid in money. By the parata was understood the expense laid out in keeping the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a> and bridges in repair; and the manjonicum included those expenses which were required for lodging the troops or accommodating them in their camp. Under pretence of this last article, the inhabitants were sometimes stripped of all they possessed, except their oxen and seed for the land. Besides regulating what regarded the cities, Otho distributed honours and positions to those who had served him faithfully. The honours consisted in the titles of duke, marquis, count, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>, valvafior, and valvafin: the positions were, besides land, the duties arising from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a>, ferries, roads, fish-ponds, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-MILLS\">mills</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>-pits, the uses of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, and all pertaining to them, and such like. The dukes, marquises, and counts, were those who received dukedoms, marquises, and counties, from the king in fiefs; the captains had the command of a certain number of men by a grant from the king, duke, marquis, or count; the valvafors were subordinate to the captains, and the valvafins to them.\n\nNo sooner was the death of Otho I., known in Italy, Great than, as if they had been now freed from all restraint, turbulence the nobles declared war against each other: some cities revolted, and chose to themselves consuls; while the dominions of others were seized by the nobles, who confirmed their power by erecting citadels. Rome especially was harassed by tumults, occasioned chiefly by the factious practices of one Cincius, who preferred his fellow-citizens to restore the ancient republic. As the pope continued firm in the interests of the emperor, Cincius caused him to be strangled by one Franco a cardinal deacon; who was soon after rewarded with the pontificate, and took upon him the name of Boniface VII. Another pope was chosen by the faction of the count of Tuscany; who being approved by the emperor, drove Cincius and Boniface out of the city. Disturbances of a similar kind took place in other cities, though Milan continued quiet and loyal in the midst of all this uproar and confusion.\n\nIn the mean time Boniface fled for refuge to Constantinople, where he excited the emperor to make war against Otho II. In 979 an army was accordingly sent into Italy, which conquered Apulia and Calabria; but the next year Otho entered Italy with a formidable army; and having taken a severe revenge on the authors of the disturbances, drove the Greeks entirely out of the provinces they had seized. Having then caused his son Otho III. at that time a boy of ten years of age, to be proclaimed emperor, he died at Rome in the year 983. Among the regulations made by this emperor, one is very remarkable, and must give us a strange\nItaly strange idea of the inhabitants of Italy at that time. He made a law, That no Italian should be believed upon his oath; and that in any dispute which could not be decided otherwise than by witnesses, the parties should have recourse to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUEL\">duel</a>.\n\nOtto III. succeeded to the empire at twelve years of age; and during his minority the disturbances in Italy revived. Cincius, called also Crescentius, renewed his scheme of restoring the republic. The pope (John XV.) opposing his schemes, was driven out of the city; but was soon after recalled, on hearing that he had applied to the emperor for assistance. A few years after Crescentius again revolted, and expelled Gregory V. the successor of John XV.; raising to the papal dignity a creature of his own, under the name of John XVI. Otho, enraged at this insult, returned to Rome with a powerful army in 998, besieged and took it by assault; after which he caused Crescentius to be beheaded, and the pope he had set up to be thrown headlong from the castle of St. Angelo, after having his eyes pulled out, and his nose cut off. Four years after, he himself died of the smallpox; or, according to some, was poisoned by the widow of Crescentius, whom he had debauched under a promise of marriage, just as he was about to punish the Romans for another revolt.\n\nOtho was succeeded in the imperial throne by Henry duke of Bavaria, and grandson to Otho II. Henry had no sooner settled the affairs of Germany, than he found it necessary to march into Italy against Ardoin marquis of Ivrea, who had assumed the title of king of Italy. Him he defeated in an engagement, and was himself crowned king of Italy at Pavia in 1005; but a few years after, a new contest arose about the papal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a>, which again required the presence of the emperor. Before he arrived, however, one of the competitors (Benedict VIII.) had got the better of his rival, and both Henry and his queen received the imperial crown from his hands. Before the emperor entered the church, the pope proposed to him the following question: \"Will you observe your fidelity to me and my successors in every thing?\" To which, though a kind of homage, he submitted, and answered in the affirmative. After his coronation, he confirmed the privileges bestowed on the Roman see by his predecessors, and added some others of his own; still however, reserving for himself the sovereignty and the power of sending commissaries to hear the grievances of the people. Having repelled the incursions of the Saracens, reduced some more rebellions of his subjects, and reduced the greatest part of Apulia and Calabria, he died in the year 1024.\n\nThe death of this emperor was, as usual, followed by a competition for the crown. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONRAD\">Conrad</a> being chosen emperor of Germany, was declared king of Italy by the archbishop of Milan; while a party of the nobles made offer of the crown to Robert king of France, or his son Hugh. But this offer being declined, and likewise another to William duke of Guinne, Conrad enjoyed the dignity conferred on him by the archbishop without molestation. He was crowned king of Italy at Monza in 1026; and the next year he received the imperial crown from Pope John XX. in presence of Canute the Great, king of England, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a>, and Rodolph III., king of Burgundy. His reign was similar to that of his predecessors. The Italians revolted, the pope was expelled, the malecontents were subdued, and the pope restored, after which the emperor returned to Germany, and died in 1039.\n\nUnder Henry III. who succeeded Conrad, the disturbances were prodigiously augmented. Pope Sylvester II. was driven out by Benedict; who in his turn was expelled by John bishop of Sabinum, who assumed the title of Sylvester III. Three months after Benedict was restored, and excommunicated his rivals; but soon after resigned the pontificate for a sum of money. In a short time he reclaimed it; and thus there were at once three popes, each of whom was supported on a branch of the papal revenue, while all of them made themselves odious by the scandalous lives they led. At last a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> called Gratian put an end to this singular triumvirate. Partly by artifice, and partly by presents, he persuaded all the three to renounce their pretensions to the papacy; and the people of Rome, out of gratitude for so signal a service to the church, chose him pope, under the name of Gregory VI. Henry III. took umbrage at this election, in which he had not been consulted, and marched with an army into Italy. He deposed Gregory, as having been guilty of simony, and filled the papal chair with his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> Heidiger, bishop of Bamberg, who assumed the name of Clement II. and afterwards consecrated Henry and the empress Agnes. This ceremony being over, and the Romans having sworn never to elect a pope without the approbation of the reigning emperor, Henry proceeded to Capua, where he was visited by Drago, Rainphilus, and other Norman adventurers; who leaving their country at different times, had made themselves masters of great part of Apulia and Calabria, at the expense of the Greeks and Saracens. Henry entered into treaty with them; and not only solemnly invited the Normans to submit to his authority, but also with them with those territories which they had acquired by force of arms, but prevailed on the pope to excommunicate the Beneventines, who had refused to open their gates to him, and bestowed that city and its dependencies, as fiefs of the empire, upon the Normans, provided they took possession by force of arms. The emperor was scarce returned into Germany when he received intelligence of the death of Clement II. He was succeeded in the apostolic see by Damaus II.; who also dying soon after his elevation, Henry nominated Bruno bishop of Toul to the vacant chair. This Bruno, who was the emperor's relation, immediately assumed the pontificals; but being a modest and pious prelate, he threw them off on his journey, by the persuasion of a monk of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLUNY\">Cluny</a>, named Hildebrand, afterwards the famous Gregory VII. and went to Rome as a private man. \"The emperor alone (said Hildebrand) has no right to create a pope.\" He accompanied Bruno to Rome, and secretly retarded his election, that he might arrogate to himself the merit of obtaining it. The scheme succeeded to his wish; Bruno, who took the name of Leo IX., believing himself indebted to Hildebrand for the pontificate, favoured him with his particular friendship and confidence; and hence originated the power of this enterprising monk, of obscure birth, but boundless ambition, who governed Rome so long, and whose zeal for\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXALTATION\">exaltation</a> of the church occasioned so many troubles to Europe.\n\nLeo soon after his elevation waited on the emperor at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">Worms</a>, to crave alliance against the Norman princes, who were become the terror of Italy, and treated their subjects with great severity. Henry furnished the pope with an army; at the head of which he marched against the Normans, after having excommunicated them, accompanied by a great number of bishops and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICS\">ecclesiastics</a>, who were all either killed or taken prisoners, the Germans and Italians being totally routed. Leo himself was led captive to Benevento, which the Normans were now masters of, and which Henry had granted to the pope in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> for the fief of Bamberg in Germany; and the apolitical see is to this day in possession of Benevento, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of that donation. The Normans, however, who had a right to the city by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> grant, restored it, in the mean time, to the princes of Lombardy; and Leo was treated with so much respect by the conquerors, that he revoked the sentence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXCOMMUNICATION\">excommunication</a>, and joined his sanction to the imperial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTITURE\">investiture</a> for the lands which they held in Apulia and Calabria. Leo died soon after his release; and the emperor about the same time caused his infant son, afterwards the famous Henry IV., to be declared king of the Romans, a title still in use for the acknowledged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> of the empire. Gebhard, a German bishop, was elected pope, under the name of Victor II., and confirmed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> of Hildebrand, who waited on the emperor in person for that purpose, though he disdained to consult him beforehand. Perhaps Hildebrand would not have found this task so easy, had not Henry been involved in a war with the Hungarians, who pressed him hard, but whom he obliged at last to pay a large tribute, and furnish him annually with a certain number of fighting men.\n\nAs soon as the emperor had finished this war and others to which it gave rise, he marched into Italy to inspect the conduct of his sister Beatrice, widow of Boniface marquis of Mantua, and made her prisoner. She had married Gozelo, duke of Lorraine, without the emperor's consent; and contrived her daughter Matilda, by the marquis of Mantua, to Godfrey duke of Spoleto and Tuscany, Gozelo's son by a former marriage. This formidable alliance justly alarmed Henry; he therefore attempted to dissolve it, by carrying his sister into Germany, where he died soon after his return, in the 39th year of his age, and the 16th of his reign.\n\nThe emperor, in his last journey to Italy, concluded an alliance with Contarini, doge of Venice. That republic was already rich and powerful, though it had only been enfranchised in the year 998, from the tribute of a mantle of cloth of gold, which it formerly paid, as a mark of subjection to the emperor of Constantinople. Genoa was the rival of Venice in power and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, and was already in possession of the island of Corsica, which the Genoese had taken from the Saracens. These two cities engrossed at this time almost all the trade of Europe. There was no city in any respect equal to them either in France or Germany.\n\nHenry IV. was only five years old at his father's death. The popes made use of the reprieve given them by his minority, to flake off in great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> their dependence upon the emperors. After a variety of councils about the pontificate, Nicholas II., a creature of Hildebrand's, was elected; who, among others, passed the following celebrated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a>, viz. That for the future, the cardinals only should elect the pope; and that the election should afterwards be confirmed by the rest of the clergy and the people, \"Saving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> (adds he) due to our dear son Henry, now king; and who, if it please God, shall be one day emperor, according to the right which we have already conferred upon him.\" After this he entered into a treaty with the Norman princes above-mentioned; who, though they had lately sworn to hold their possessions from the emperor, now swore to hold them from the pope; and hence arose the pope's claim of sovereignty over the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily.\n\nThus was the power of the German emperors in Italy greatly diminished, and that of the popes proportionally exalted; of which Henry soon had sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>. For having assumed the government into his own hands in the year 1072, being then 22 years of age, he was summoned by Alexander II., to appear before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a> of the holy see, on account of his loose life, and to answer the charge of having exposed the investiture of bishops to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a>; at the same time that the pope excited his German subjects to rebel against him. The rebels, however, were defeated, and peace was restored to Germany; but soon after, Hildebrand above-mentioned being elected to the pontificate under the name of Gregory VII., openly affirmed the superiority over every earthly monarch whatever. He began with excommunicating every ecclesiastic who should receive a benefice from the hands of a layman, and every layman who should take upon him to confer such a benefice. Henry, instead of resenting this insolence, submitted, and wrote a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENITENTIAL\">penitential</a> letter to the pope: who, upon this, condescended to take him into favour, after having severely reprimanded him for his loose life; of which the emperor now confessed himself guilty.\n\nThe quarrel between the church and the emperor was, however, soon brought to a crisis by the following accident. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a> king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUNGARY\">Hungary</a>, being deposed by his brother G\u00e9za, had fled to Henry for protection, and renewed the homage of Hungary to the empire. Gregory, who favoured G\u00e9za, exclaimed against this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of submission; and said in a letter to Solomon, \"You ought to know that the kingdom of Hungary belongs to the Roman church; and learn that you will incur the indignation of the holy see, if you do not acknowledge that you hold your dominions of the pope, and not of the emperor.\" Henry, though highly provoked at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECLARATION\">declaration</a>, thought proper to treat it with neglect; upon which Gregory refused the dilate about investitures. The predecessors of Henry had always enjoyed the right of nominating bishops and abbots, and of giving them investiture by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a>. This right they had in common with almost all princes. The predecessors of Gregory VII. had been accustomed on their part, to send legates to the emperors, in order to entreat their affluence, to obtain their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a>, or desire them to come and receive the papal sanction, but for no other purpose. Gregory, however, sent\ntwo legates to summon Henry to appear before him as a delinquent, because he still continued to betray investitures, notwithstanding the apostolic decree to the contrary; adding, that if he should fail to yield obedience to the church, he must expect to be excommunicated and deposed. Incensed at this arrogant message from one whom he considered as his vassal, Henry dismissed the legates with very little ceremony, and in 1106 convoked an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> of all the princes and dignified ecclesiastics at Worms; where, after mature deliberation, they concluded, that Gregory having usurped the chair of St Peter by indirect means, infected the church of God with a great many novelties and abuses, and deviated from his duty to his sovereign in several scandalous attempts, the emperor, by that supreme authority derived from his predecessors, ought to divest him of his dignity, and appoint another in his place. In consequence of this determination, Henry sent an ambassador to Rome, with a formal deprivation of Gregory; who, in his turn, convoked a council, at which were present 110 bishops, who unanimously agreed that the pope had just cause to depose Henry, to dissolve the oath of allegiance which the princes and states had taken in his favour, and to prohibit them from holding any correspondence with him on pain of excommunication; which was immediately fulminated against the emperor and his adherents. \"In the name of Almighty God, and by our authority (said Gregory), I prohibit Henry, the son of our emperor Henry, from governing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEUTONIC\">Teutonic</a> kingdom and Italy; I release all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> from their oath of allegiance to him; and strictly forbid all persons from serving or attending him as king!\" The circular letters written by this pontiff breathe the same spirit with his sentence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a>. He there repeats several times, that \"bishops are superior to kings, and made to judge them!\" expressions alike artful and presumptuous, and calculated for bringing in all the churchmen of the world to his standard.\n\nGregory knew well what consequences would follow the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> of the church. The German bishops came immediately over to his party, and drew along with them many of the nobles: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> of civil war still lay smothering, and a bull properly directed was sufficient to set it in a blaze. The Saxons, Henry's old enemies, made use of the papal displeasure as a pretence for rebelling against him. Even Guelph, to whom the emperor had given the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUCHY\">duchy</a> of Bavaria, supported the malecontents with that power which he owed to his sovereign's bounty: nay, those very princes and prelates who had assisted in deposing Gregory, gave up their monarch to be tried by the pope; and his holiness was solicited to come to Augsburg for that purpose.\n\nWilling to prevent this odious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> at Augsburg, Henry took the unaccountable resolution of suddenly passing the Alps at Tirol, accompanied only by a few domestics, to ask <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTION\">absolution</a> of Pope Gregory his opponent; who was then in Canoza, on the Apennine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, a fortress belonging to the countess or duchess Matilda above mentioned. At the gates of this place the emperor presented himself as a humble penitent. He alone was admitted within the outer court; where, being stripped of his robes, and wrapped in sackcloth, he was obliged to remain three days, in the month of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a>, bare-footed and fasting; before he was permitted to kiss the feet of his holiness; who all that time was shut up with the devout Matilda, whose spiritual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTOR\">director</a> he had long been, and, as some say, her gallant. But be that as it may, her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to Gregory, and her hatred to the Germans, was so great, that she made over all her estates to the apostolic see; and this donation is the true cause of all the wars which since that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> have raged between the emperors and the popes. She possessed in her own right great part of Tuscany, Mantua, Parma, Reggio, Placentia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERRARA\">Ferrara</a>, Modena, Verona, and almost the whole of what is now called the patrimony of St Peter, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VITERBO\">Viterbo</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORVIETO\">Orvieto</a>; together with part of Umbria, Spoleto, and the Marche of Ancona.\n\nThe emperor was at length permitted to throw himself at the pontiff's feet; who condescended to grant him absolution, after he had sworn obedience to him in all things, and promised to submit to his solemn deposition at Augsburg; so that Henry got nothing but disgrace by his journey; while Gregory, elated by his triumph, and now looking upon himself (not altogether without reason) as the lord and master of all the crowned heads in Christendom, laid in several of his letters, that it was his duty \"to pull down the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> of kings.\"\n\nThis extraordinary accommodation gave much difficulty to the princes of Italy. They never could forgive the insolence of the pope, nor the abject humility of the emperor. Happily, however, for Henry, their indignation at Gregory's arrogance overbalanced their detestation of his meanness. He took advantage of this temper; and by a change of fortune, hitherto unknown to the German emperors, he found a strong party in Italy, when abandoned in Germany. All Lombardy took arms against the pope, while he was raising all Germany against the emperor. Gregory, on the other hand, made use of every art to get another emperor elected in Germany; and Henry, on his part, left nothing undone to persuade the Italians to elect another pope. The Germans chose Rodolph, duke of Swabia, who was solemnly crowned at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENTZ\">Mentz</a>; and Gregory, chosen emmetiating on this occasion, behaved truly like the supreme judge of kings. He had depoed Henry, but still it was in his power to pardon that prince: he therefore affected to be displeased that Rodolph was consecrated without his order; and declared, that he would acknowledge as emperor and king of Germany, him of the two competitors who should be most submissive to the holy see.\n\nHenry, however, trifling more to the valour of his troops than to the generosity of the pope, set out immediately for Germany, where he defeated his enemies in several engagements; and Gregory, seeing no hopes of submission, thundered out a second sentence of excommunication against him, confirming at the same time the election of Rodolph, to whom he sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> crown, on which the following well-known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>, equally haughty and puerile, was engraved.\n\n*Petra dedit Petro, Petrus diadema Rodolpho.*\n\nThis donation was also accompanied with a most enthusiastic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANATHEMA\">anathema</a> against Henry. After depriving him of strength and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a>, and condemning him never to be victorious, it concludes with the following remarkable\nmarkable apostrophe to St Peter and St Paul: \"Make all men tenible, that as you can bind and looie every thing in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, you can also upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> take from or give to every one, according to his deserts, empires, kingdoms, principalities\u2014let the kings and the princes of the age then instantly feel your power, that they may not dare to despise the orders of your church; let your justice be so speedily executed upon Henry, that nobody may doubt but he falls by your means, and not by chance.\"\n\nIn order to avoid the effects of this second excommunication, Henry assembled at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIXEN\">Brixen</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of Tirol, about 20 German bishops who, acting also for the bishops of Lombardy, unanimously resolved, that the pope, instead of having power over the emperor, owed him obedience and allegiance; and that Gregory VII., having rendered himself unworthy of the papal chair by his conduct and rebellion, ought to be deposed from a dignity he so little deserved. They accordingly degraded Hildebrand; and elected in his room Guibert, archbishop of Ravenna, a person of undoubted merit, who took the name of Clement III.\n\nHenry promised to put the new pope in possession of Rome; but he was obliged, in the mean time, to employ all his forces against his rival Rodolph, who had reassembled a large body of troops in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a>. The two armies met near Merburg, and both fought with great fury; but the fortune of the day seemed inclined to Rodolph, when his hand was cut off by the famous Godfrey of Bouillon, then in the service of Henry, and afterwards renowned for his conquest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>. Discouraged by the misfortune of their chief, the rebels immediately gave way; and Rodolph perceiving his end approaching, ordered the hand that was cut off to be brought him, and made a speech to his officers on the occasion, which could not fail to have an influence on the emperor's affairs. \"Behold (said he) the hand with which I took the oath of allegiance to Henry; and which oath, at the instigation of Rome, I have violated, in perdition aspiring at an honour that was not my due.\"\n\nThus delivered from this formidable antagonist, Henry soon dispersed the rest of his enemies in Germany, and set out for Italy in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> Clement in the papal chair. But the gates of Rome being shut against him, he was obliged to attack it in form. The siege continued upwards of two years; Henry during that time being obliged to quell some insurrections in Germany. The city was at length carried by assault, and with difficulty saved from being pillaged; but Gregory was not taken: he retired into the castle of St Angelo, and thence defied and excommunicated the conqueror. The new pope was, however, consecrated with the usual ceremonies; and expressed his gratitude by crowning Henry, with the concurrence of the Roman senate and people. Mean while the siege of St Angelo was going on; but the emperor being called about some affairs into Lombardy, Robert Guiscard took advantage of his absence to release Gregory, who died soon after at Salerno. His last words, borrowed from the Scripture, were worthy of the greatest saint: \"I have loved justice, and hated iniquity; therefore I die in exile.\"\n\nHenry, however, did not enjoy all the advantages which might have been expected from the death of Gregory. The subsequent popes trod in the paths of their predecessor. In 1101, Paschal II. excited young Henry to rebel against his father. The emperor did all in his power to dissuade him from proceeding to extremities, but in vain. The young prince persisted in his rebellious intentions; and having by feigned submissions prevailed on the emperor to abandon his army, he treacherously seized and confined him. Henry, however, found means to escape from his confinement, and attempted to engage all the sovereigns of Europe in his quarrel; but before any thing effectual could be done, he died at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEGE\">Liege</a> in the year 1106.\n\nThe dispute about investitures was not terminated by the deposition and death of Henry IV. His son Henry V. pursued the very same conduct for which he had deposed his father. Paschal opposed him with violence; upon which Henry gave him an invitation into Germany, to end the dispute in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMICABLE\">amicable</a> manner. Paschal did not think proper to accept of this invitation; but put himself under the protection of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> I., king of France, who undertook to mediate between the contending parties. His mediation, however, proved ineffectual, and Henry was prevented by the wars in Hungary and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a> from paying any further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the affair of investitures. At last, having settled his affairs in Germany, he took a resolution of going to Rome, in order to settle the dispute personally with the pope. To give his arguments the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, however, he marched at the head of an army of 80,000 men. Paschal received him with great appearance of friendship, but would not renounce the claim of investitures; and Henry, finding himself deceived in his expectations, ordered the pope to be seized. The consul put the citizens in arms to defend the pope, and a battle was fought within the walls of Rome. The slaughter was so great, that the waters of the Tiber were tinged with blood. The Romans were defeated, and Paschal was taken prisoner. The latter renounced his right of investiture; solemnly swore never to resume it, and broke his oath as soon as Henry was gone, by fulminating the sentence of excommunication against him. In 1114 died the countess Matilda, who had bequeathed all her domains to the pope, as we have already observed; but Henry thinking himself the only lawful heir, alleged, that it was not in Matilda's power to alienate her estates, which depended immediately on the empire. He therefore set out for Lombardy, and sent ambassadors to the pope, beseeching him to revoke the sentence of excommunication above mentioned. Paschal, however, would not even favour the ambassadors with an audience; but dreading the approach of Henry himself, he took refuge among the Norman princes in Apulia. Henry arrived at Rome in 1117; but being soon after obliged to leave it in order to settle some affairs in Tuscany, the pope returned to Rome, but died in a few days. On the third day after his decease, Cardinal Cajetan was elected his successor, without the privity of the emperor, under the name of Gelasius II. The new pope was instantly deposed by Henry; who set up the archbishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRAGUE\">Prague</a>, under the name of Gregory VIII. Gelasius, though supported by the Norman princes, was obliged to take refuge\nrefuge in France, where he died; and the archbishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a> was elected by the cardinals then present under the name of Calixtus II.\n\nThe new pope attempted an accommodation with Henry; which not succeeding, he excommunicated the emperor, the antipope, and his adherents. He next set out for Rome, where he was honourably received; and Gregory VIII. was forced to retire to Sutri, a strong town garrisoned by the emperor's troops. Here he was besieged by Calixtus and the Norman princes. The city was soon taken, and Gregory thrown into prison by his competitor; but at last, the states of the empire being quite wearied out with such a long quarrel, unanimously supplicated Henry for peace. He referred himself entirely to their decision; and a diet being assembled at Wurtzburg, it was decreed that an embassy should be immediately sent to the pope, deeming that he would convolve a general council at Rome, by which all disputes might be determined. This was accordingly done, and the affair of investitures at length regulated in the following manner, viz. That the emperor should leave the communities and chapters at liberty to fill up their own vacancies, without bestowing investitures with the crofs and ring; that he should restore all that he had unjustly taken from the church; that all elections should be made in a canonical manner, in presence of the emperor or his commissaries; and whatever disputes might happen should be referred to the decision of the emperor, assisted by the metropolitan and his suffragans; that the person elected should receive from the emperor the investiture of the fiefs and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> rights, not with the crofs, but with the sceptre; and should pay allegiance to him for these rights only.\n\nAfter the death of Henry, the usual disorders took place in Italy; during which, Roger duke of Apulia conquered the island of Sicily, and assumed the right of creating popes, of whom there were two at that time, viz. Innocent II. and Anacletus. Roger drove out the former, and Lothario emperor of Germany the latter, forcing Roger himself at the same time to retire into Sicily. The emperor then conducted Innocent back to Rome in triumph; and having subdued all Apulia, Calabria, and the rest of Roger's Italian dominions, erected them into a principality, and bestowed it, with the title of duke, upon Renaud, a German prince, and one of his own relations.\n\nIn the reign of Conrad III. who succeeded Lothario, the celebrated factions called the Guelphs and Gibelines*, arose, which for many years deluged the cities of Italy with blood. They took their origin during a civil war in Germany, in which the enemies of the emperor were styled Guelphs, and his friends Gibelines; and these names were quickly received in Italy as well as other parts of the emperor's dominions. Of this civil war many of the cities in Italy took the advantage to set up for themselves; neither was it in the power of Conrad, who during his whole reign was employed in unsuccessful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CRUSADES\">crusades</a>, to reduce them; but in 1158 Frederic Barbarossa, successor to Conrad, entered Italy at the head of a very numerous and well disciplined army. His army was divided into several columns, for the conveniency of entering the country by as many different routes. Having passed the Alps, he reduced the town of Brescia; where he made several salutary regulations for the preservation of good order and military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>. Continuing to advance, he besieged Milan, which surrendered at discretion. He was crowned king of Lombardy at Monza; and having made himself master of all the other cities of that country, he ordered a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> inquiry to be set on foot concerning the rights of the empire, and exacted homage of all those who held of it, without excepting even the bishops. Grievances were redressed; magistracies reformed; the rights of regality disfused and ascertained; new laws enacted for the maintenance of public tranquillity and the encouragement of learning, which now began to revive in the school of Bologna; and, above all, subvassals were not only prohibited from alienating their lands, but also compelled, in their oath to their lords paramount, to except the emperor nominally, when they swore to serve and assist them against all their enemies. The pope took umbrage at this behaviour towards the ecclesiastics; but Frederic justified what he had done, telling his deputies it was but reasonable they should do homage for the fiefs they possessed; as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ himself, though the lord of all the sovereigns upon earth, had deigned to pay for himself and St Peter the tribute which was due to Caesar.\n\nFrederic having sent commissaries to superintend the election of new magistrates at Milan, the inhabitants were so much provoked at this infringement of their old privileges, that they insulted the imperialists, revolted, and refused to appear before the emperor's tribunal. This he highly resented, and resolved to chastise them severely; for which purpose he sent for a reinforcement from Germany, which soon after arrived with the empress, while he himself ravaged Liguria, declared the Milanese rebels to the empire, and plundered and burnt the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREMA\">Crema</a> which was in alliance with that of Milan.\n\nIn the mean time, Pope Adrian IV. dying, two opposite factions elected two persons known by the names of Victor II. and Alexander III. The emperor's allies necessarily acknowledged the pope chosen by him; and those princes who were jealous of the emperor, acknowledged the other. Victor II. Frederic's pope, had Germany, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a>, and one half of Italy on his side; while the rest submitted to Alexander III. The emperor took a severe revenge on his enemies; Milan was razed from the foundation, and and default firewood on its ruins; Brescia and Placentia were always dismantled; and the other cities which had taken part Ian, &c. with them were deprived of their privileges. Alexander III. however, who had excited the revolt, returned to Rome after the death of his rival; and at his return the civil war was renewed. The emperor caused another pope, and after his death a third, to be elected. Alexander then fled to France, the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a> of every pope who was oppressed by the emperors; but the flames of civil discord which he had raised continued daily to spread. In 1168, the cities of Italy, supported by the Greek emperor and the king of Sicily, entered into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> for the defense of their liberties; and the pope's party at length prevailed. In 1176, the imperial army, worn out by fatigues and diseases, was defeated by the confederates, and Frederic himself narrowly escaped. About the same time, he was defeated at sea by the Venetians;\nand his eldest son Henry, who commanded his fleet, fell into the hands of the enemy. The pope, in honour of this victory, sailed out into the open sea, accompanied by the whole senate; and after having pronounced a thousand benedictions on that element, threw into it a ring as a mark of his gratitude and affection. Hence the origin of that ceremony which is annually performed by the Venetians, under the notion of eloping the Adriatic. These misfortunes disfitted the emperor towards a reconciliation with the pope: but, reckoning it below his dignity to make an advance, he rallied his troops, and exerted himself with so much vigour in repairing his loss, that the confederates were defeated in a battle; after which he made proposals of peace, which were now joyfully accepted, and Venice was the place appointed for a reconciliation. The emperor, the pope, and a great many princes and cardinals, attended; and there the emperor, in 1177, put an end to the dispute, by acknowledging the pope, killing his feet, and holding his stirrup while he mounted his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULE\">mule</a>. This reconciliation was attended with the submission of all the towns of Italy which had entered into an association for their mutual defence. They obtained a general pardon, and were left at liberty to use their own laws and forms of government, but were obliged to take the oath of allegiance to the emperor as their superior lord. Calixtus, the antipope, finding himself abandoned by the emperor in consequence of this treaty, made also his submission to Alexander, who received him with great humanity; and in order to prevent for the future those disturbances which had so often attended the elections of the popes, he called a general council, in which it was decreed, that no pope should be deemed duly elected without having two-thirds of the votes in his favour.\n\nThe affairs of Italy being thus settled, Barbarossa returned to Germany; and having quieted some disturbances which had arisen during his absence in Italy, at last undertook an expedition into the Holy Land; where having performed great exploits, he was drowned as he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a> in the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYDNUS\">Cydnus</a>, in the year 1190. He was succeeded by his son Henry VI, who at the same time became heir to the dominions of Sicily by the right of his wife, daughter of William king of that country. After settling the affairs of Germany, the new emperor marched with an army into Italy, in order to be crowned by the pope, and to recover the succession of Sicily, which was usurped by Tancred his wife's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> brother. For this purpose, he endeavoured to conciliate the affections of the Lombards, by enlarging the privileges of Genoa, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PISA\">Pisa</a>, and other cities, in his way to Rome; where the ceremony of the coronation was performed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CELESTINE\">Celestine</a> III, on the day after Easter in the year 1191. The pope, then in the 86th year of his age, had no sooner placed the crown upon Henry's head, than he kicked it off again, as a testimony of the power residing in the sovereign pontiff to make and unmake emperors at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>.\n\nThe coronation being over, Henry prepared for the conquest of Naples and Sicily; but in this he was opposed by the pope: for though Celestine considered Tancred as an usurper, and desired to see him deprived of the crown of Sicily, which he claimed as a fief of the fee, yet he was much more averse to the emperor's being put in possession of it, as that would render him too powerful in Italy for the interest of the church. Henry, however, without paying any regard to the threats and remonstrances of his holiness, took almost all the towns of Campania, Calabria, and Apulia; invested the city of Naples; and sent for the Genoese fleet, which he had before engaged, to come and form the blockade by sea: but before its arrival, he was obliged to raise the siege, in consequence of a dreadful mortality among his troops: and all future attempts upon Sicily were ineffectual during the life of Tancred.\n\nThe whole reign of Henry from this time seems to have been a continued train of the most abominable and cruel perjuries and cruelties. Having treacherously seized and imprisoned Richard I. of England, in the manner related under that article, No. 128\u2014130, he had no sooner received the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RANSOM\">ransom</a> paid for his royal captive, than he made new preparations for the conquest of Sicily. As Tancred died about this time, the emperor, with the assistance of the Genoese, accomplished his purpose. The queen-dowager surrendered Salerno, and her right to the crown, on condition that her son William should possess the principality of Tarentum; but Henry no sooner found himself master of the place, than he ordered the infant king to be castrated, to have his eyes put out, and to be confined in a dungeon. The royal treasure was transported to Germany, and the queen and her daughter confined in a convent.\n\nIn the mean time, the empress, though near the age of 50, was delivered of a son, named Frederic; and Henry soon after assembled a diet of the princes of Germany, to whom he explained his intentions of rendering the imperial crown hereditary, in order to prevent those disturbances which usually attended the election of emperors. A decree passed for this purpose; and Frederic, yet in his cradle, was declared king of the Romans. Soon after, the emperor being solicited to undertake a crusade, obeyed the injunctions of the pope, but in such a manner as to make it turn out to his own advantage. He convoked a general diet at Worms, where he solemnly declared his resolution of employing his whole power, and even of hazarding his life, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a> of so holy an enterprise; and he expatiated upon the subject with so much eloquence, that almost the whole assembly took the cross. Nay, such multitudes from all the provinces of the empire enlisted themselves, that Henry divided them into three large armies; one of which, under the command of the bishop of Mentz, took the route of Hungary, where it was joined by Margaret, queen of that country, who entered herself in this pious expedition, and actually ended her days in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a>: the second was assembled in Lower Saxony, and embarked in a fleet furnished by the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUBECK\">Lubeck</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMBURG\">Hamburg</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLSTEIN\">Holstein</a>, and Friesland: and the emperor in person conducted the third into Italy, in order to take vengeance on the Normans in Naples and Sicily who had risen against his government.\n\nThe rebels were humbled; and their chiefs were condemned to perish by the most excruciating tortures. One Jornandi, of the house of the Norman princes, was tied naked on a chair of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>-hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, and crowned\ncrowned with a circle of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> metal, which was nailed to his head. The empresses, shocked at such cruelty, renounced her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> to her husband, and encouraged her countrymen to recover their liberties. Resolution sprung from despair. The inhabitants took themselves to arms; the empress Constantia headed them; and Henry, having dismissed his troops, no longer thought necessary to his bloody purposes, and sent them to pursue their expedition to the Holy Land, was obliged to submit to his wife, and to the conditions which she was pleased to impose on him in favour of the Sicilians. He died at Messina in 1197, soon after this treaty; and, as was supposed, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> administered by the empress.\n\nThe emperor's son Frederic had already been declared king of the Romans, and consequently became emperor on the death of his father; but as Frederic II. was yet a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a>, the administration was committed to his uncle the duke of Swabia, both by the will of Henry and by an assembly of the German princes. Other princes, however, incensed to see an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELECTIVE\">elective</a> empire become hereditary, held a new diet at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOGNE\">Cologne</a>, and chose Otho duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUNSWICK\">Brunswick</a>, son of Henry the Lion. Frederic's title was confirmed in a third assembly at Arniburg; and his uncle, Philip duke of Swabia, was elected king of the Romans, in order to give greater weight to his administration. These two elections divided the empire into two powerful factions, and involved all Germany in ruin and desolation. Innocent III., who had succeeded Celestin in the papal chair, threw himself into the scale of Otho, and excommunicated Philip and all his adherents. This able and ambitious pontiff was a sworn enemy of the house of Swabia; not from any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> animosity, but out of a principle of policy. That house had long been terrible to the popes, by its continual possession of the imperial crown; and the accession of the kingdom of Naples and Sicily made it still more to be dreaded. Innocent, therefore, gladly seized the present favourable opportunity for divesting it of the empire, by supporting the election of Otho, and fanning divisions among the Swabian party. Otho was also patronized by his uncle, the king of England; which naturally inclined the king of France to the side of his rival. Faction clashed with faction; friendship with interest; caprice, ambition, or resentment, gave the way; and nothing was beheld on all hands but the horrors and the miseries of civil wars.\n\nMeanwhile, the empress Constantia remained in Sicily, where all was peace, as regent and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">guardian</a> for her infant son Frederic II., who had been crowned king of that island, with the consent of Pope Celestin III. But she also had her troubles. A new investiture from the holy see being necessary, on the death of Celestin, Innocent III., his successor, took advantage of the critical situation of affairs for aggrandizing the papacy, at the expense of the kings of Sicily. They petitioned, as has been already observed, the privilege of filling up vacant benefices, and of judging all ecclesiastical causes in the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a>: they were really popes in their own island, though vassals of his holiness. Innocent pretended that these powers had been surreptitiously obtained; and demanded, that Constantia should renounce them in the name of her son, and do liege, pure, and simple homage for Sicily.\n\nBut before anything was settled relative to this affair, the empress died, leaving the regency of the kingdom to the pope; so that he was enabled to prescribe what conditions he thought proper to young Frederic. The troubles of Germany still continued; and the pope redoubled his efforts to detach the princes and prelates from the cause of Philip, notwithstanding the remonstrances of the king of France, to whom he proudly replied, \"Either Philip must lose the empire, or I the papacy.\" But all these dissensions and troubles in Europe did not prevent the formation of another crusade, or expedition into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a> of the Holy Land. Those who took the cross were principally French and Germans; Baldwin, count of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a>, was their commander; and the Venetians, as greedy of wealth and power as the ancient Carthaginians, furnished them with ships, for which they took care to be amply paid both in money and territory. The Christian city of Zara, in Dalmatia, had withdrawn itself from the government of the republic; the army of the cross undertook to reduce it to obedience; and it was besieged and taken, notwithstanding the threats and excommunications of the pope.\n\nWhile the crusaders were spreading desolation through the east, Philip and Otho were in like manner desolating the west. At length Philip prevailed; and Otho, obliged to abandon Germany, took refuge in England. Philip, elated with success, confirmed his election by a second coronation, and proposed an accommodation with the pope, as the means of finally establishing his throne; but before it could be brought about, he fell a sacrifice to private revenge, being assassinated by the count Palatine of Bavaria, whose daughter he had promised to marry, and afterwards rejected. Otho returned to Germany, on the death of Philip; married that prince's daughter; and was crowned at Rome by Pope Innocent III., after yielding to the holy see the long-disputed inheritance of the countess Matilda, and confirming the rights and privileges of the Italian cities. But these concessions, as far at least as regarded the pope, were only a sacrifice to present policy: Otho, therefore, no sooner found himself in a condition to act offensively, than he resumed his grant; and in 1210 not only recovered the possessions of the empire, but made hostile incursions into Apulia, ravaging the dominions of young Frederic king of Naples and Sicily, who was under the protection of the holy see. For this reason he was excommunicated by Innocent; and Frederic, now 17 years of age, was elected emperor by a diet of the German princes. Otho, however, on his return to Germany, finding his party still considerable, and not doubting but he should be able to humble his rival by means of his superior force, entered into an alliance with his uncle John king of England, against Philip Augustus king of France, A.D. 1213. The unfortunate battle of Bouvines, where the confederates were defeated, completed the fate of Otho. He attempted to retreat into Germany, but was prevented by young Frederic; who had marched into the empire at the head of a powerful army, and was everywhere received with open arms. Thus abandoned by all the princes of Germany, and altogether without resource, Otho retired to Brunswick, where he lived four years as a private man, dedicating his time to the duties of religion.\nFrederic II., being now universally acknowledged emperor, was crowned at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AIX\">Aix</a>-la-Chapelle in 1215, with great magnificence; when, in order to preserve the favour of the pope, he added to the other solemnities of his coronation a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOW\">vow</a> to go in person to the Holy Land.\n\nThe bad success of this expedition hath been already taken notice of under the article Croisade. The emperor had, on various pretences, refused to go into the east; and in 1225, the pope, incensed at the loss of Damietta, wrote a severe letter to him, taxing him with having sacrificed the interests of Christianity by delaying so long the performance of his vow, and threatening him with immediate excommunication if he did not instantly depart with an army to Aifa. Frederic, exasperated at these reproaches, renounced all correspondence with the court of Rome: renewed his ecclesiastical jurisdiction in Sicily; filled up vacant sees and benefices; and expelled some bishops, who were creatures of the pope, on pretence of their being concerned in practices against the state.\n\nThe pope at first threatened the emperor with the thunder of the church, for presuming to lift up his hand against the sanctuary; but finding Frederic not to be intimidated, he became sensible of his own imprudence in wantonly incurring the resentment of so powerful a prince, and thought proper to soothe him by submissive apologies and gentle exhortations. They were accordingly reconciled, and conferred together at Veroli in 1226; where the emperor, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of his sincere attachment to the church, published some very severe edicts against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a>, which seem to have authorized the tribunal of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INQUISITION\">inquisition</a>. A solemn assembly was afterwards held at Ferentino, where both the pope and the emperor were present, together with John de Brienne, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TITULAR\">titular</a> king of Jerusalem, who was come to Europe to demand succours against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SULTAN\">sultan</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>. John had an only daughter named Yolanda, whom he proposed as a wife to the emperor, with the kingdom of Jerusalem as her dower, on condition that Frederic should within two years perform the vow he had made to lead an army into the Holy Land. Frederic married her on these terms, because he chose to please the pope; and since that time the kings of Sicily have taken the title of king of Jerusalem. But the emperor was in no hurry to go and conquer his wife's portion, having business of more importance on his hands at home. The chief cities of Lombardy had entered into a secret <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a>, with a view to renounce his authority. He convoked a diet at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREMONA\">Cremona</a>, where all the German and Italian noblemen were summoned to attend. A variety of subjects were there discussed; but nothing of consequence was settled. An accommodation, however, was soon after brought about by the mediation of the pope; who, as umpire of the dispute, decreed, that the emperor should lay aside his resentment against the confederate towns, and that the towns should furnish and maintain 400 knights for the relief of the Holy Land.\n\nPeace being thus concluded, Honorius reminded the emperor of his vow; Frederic promised compliance; but his holiness died before he could see the execution of a project which he seemed to have so much at heart. He was succeeded in the papal chair by Gregory IX., brother of Innocent III.; who, pursuing the same line of policy, urged the departure of Frederic for the Holy Land; and finding the emperor still backward, declared him incapable of the imperial dignity, as having incurred the sentence of excommunication. Frederic, incensed at such insolence, ravaged the patrimony of St Peter; and was actually excommunicated. The animosity between the Guelphs and Gibellines revived; the pope was obliged to quit Rome; and Italy became a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of war and desolation, or rather of a hundred civil wars; which, by inflaming the minds and exciting the resentment of the Italian princes, accustomed them too much to the horrid practices of poisoning and assassination.\n\nDuring these transactions, Frederic, in order to remove the cause of all these troubles, and gratify the prejudices of a superstitious age, by the advice of his friends resolved to perform his vow; and he accordingly embarked for the Holy Land, leaving the affairs of Italy to the management of Renaldo duke of Spoleto. The pope prohibited his departure before he should be absolved from the censures of the church; but Frederic went in contempt of the church, and succeeded better than any person who had gone before him. He did not indeed delocate Aifa, and gratify the barbarous zeal of the times by spilling the blood of infidels; but he concluded a treaty with Mladen, sultan of Egypt and master of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, by which the end of his expedition seemed fully answered. The sultan ceded to him Jerusalem and its territory as far as Joppa; Bethlehem, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAZARETH\">Nazareth</a>, and all the country between Jerusalem and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMAIS\">Ptolemais</a>; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRE\">Tyre</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIDON\">Sidon</a>, and the neighbouring territories: in return for which, the emperor granted the Saracens a truce of ten years; and in 1230 prudently returned to Italy, where his presence was much wanted.\n\nFrederic's reign, after his return from the east, was one continued quarrel with the popes. The cities of Lombardy had revolted during his absence, at the instigation of Gregory IX.; and before they could be reduced, the same pontiff excited the emperor's son Henry, who had been elected king of the Romans, to rebel against his father. The rebellion was suppressed, the prince was confined, and the emperor obtained a complete victory over the afflicated towns. But his troubles were not yet ended. The pope excommunicated him anew, and sent a bull, filled with the most absurd and ridiculous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, into Germany, in order to sow division between Frederic and the princes of the empire.\n\nFrederic retorted in the same strain, in his apology to the princes of Germany, calling Gregory the Great Dragon, the Antichrist, &c. The emperor's apology was sustained in Germany; and finding he had nothing to fear from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, he resolved to take ample vengeance on the pope and his associates. For that purpose he marched to Rome, where he thought his party was strong enough to procure him admission; but this favourite scheme was defeated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> of Gregory, who ordered a crusade to be preached against the emperor, as an enemy of the Christian faith; a step which incensed Frederic so much, that he ordered all his prisoners who wore the cross to be exposed to the most cruel tortures. The two factions of the Guelphs and Gibellines continued to rage with greater violence than ever, involving cities, districts, and...\nand even private families, in troubles, divisions, and civil butchery; no quarter being given on either side. Meanwhile Gregory IX died, and was succeeded in the see of Rome by Celestine IV, and afterwards by Innocent IV, formerly Cardinal Fiesque, who had always expressed the greatest regard for the emperor and his intellect. Frederic was accordingly congratulated upon this occasion; but having more penetration than those about him, he sagely replied, \"I see little reason to rejoice; the cardinal was my friend, but the pope will be my enemy.\" Innocent soon proved the justice of this conjecture. He attempted to negotiate a peace for Italy; but not being able to obtain from Frederic his exorbitant demands, and in fear for the safety of his own person, he fled into France, assembled a general council at Lyons, and in 1245 deposed the emperor.\n\nConrad, the emperor's second son, had already been declared king of the Romans, on the death of his brother Henry, which now followed his confinement; but the empire being now declared vacant by the pope, the German bishops (for none of the princes were present), at the instigation of his holiness, proceeded to the election of a new emperor; and they chose Henry landgrave of Thuringia, who was styled in derision, The king of priests. Innocent now renewed the crusade against Frederic. It was proclaimed by the preaching friars, since called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMINICANS\">Dominicans</a>, and the minor friars, known by the name of Cordeliers or Franciscans. The pope, however, did not confine himself to these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> only, but engaged in conspiracies against the life of an emperor who had dared to resist the decree of a council, and oppose the whole body of the monks and zealots. Frederic's life was several times in danger from plots, poisonings, and assassinations; which induced him, it is said, to make choice of Mahometan guards, who, he was certain, would not be under the influence of the prevailing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a>.\n\nAbout this time the landgrave of Thuringia dying, the same prelates who had taken the liberty of creating one emperor made another; namely, William count of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, a young nobleman of 20 years of age, who bore the same contemptuous title with his predecessor. Fortune, which had hitherto favoured Frederic, seemed now to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> him. He was defeated before Parma, which he had long besieged; and to complete his misfortune, he soon after learned, that his natural son Entius, whom he had made king of Sardinia, was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-WORSTED\">worsted</a> and taken prisoner by the Bolognese.\n\nIn this extremity Frederic retired to his kingdom of Naples, in order to recruit his army; and there died of a fever in the year 1250. After his death, the affairs of Germany fell into the utmost confusion, and Italy continued long in the same distracted state in which he had left it. The clergy took arms against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAITY\">laity</a>; the weak were oppressed by the strong; and all laws divine and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> were disregarded. After the death of Frederic's son Conrad, who had assumed the imperial dignity as successor to his father, and the death of his competitor William of Holland, a variety of candidates appeared for the empire, and several were elected by different factions, among whom was Richard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Cornwall, brother to Henry II, king of England; but no emperor was properly acknowledged till the year 1273, when Rodolph, count of Hapsburg, was unanimously raised to the vacant throne. During the interregnum which preceded the election of Rodolph, Denmark, Holland, and Hungary, entirely freed themselves from the homage they were wont to pay to the empire; and much about the same time several German cities erected a municipal form of government, which still continues. Lubeck, Cologne, Brunswick, and Dantzig, united for their mutual defense against the encroachments of the great lords, by a famous association, called the Hanseatic league; and these towns were afterwards joined by 80 others, belonging to different states, which formed a kind of commercial republic. Italy also, during this period, assumed a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of government. That freedom for which the cities of Lombardy had so long struggled, was confirmed to them for a sum of money; they were emancipated by the fruits of their industry. Sicily likewise changed its government and its prince; of which revolution a particular account is given under the article Sicily.\n\nFrom the time of Frederic II, we may date the ruin of the German power in Italy. The Florentines, the Pisans, the Genoese, the Luccans, &c., became independent, and could not again be reduced. The power of the emperor, in short, was in a manner annihilated, when Henry VII undertook to restore it in the beginning of the 14th century. For this purpose a diet was held at Frankfort, where proper supplies being granted for the emperor's journey, well known by the name of the Roman expedition, he set out for Italy, accompanied by the dukes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-AUSTRIA\">Austria</a> and Bavaria, the archbishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIER\">Trier</a>, the bishop of Liege, the counts of Savoy and Flanders, and other noblemen, together with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a> of all the imperial towns. Italy was still divided by the factions of the Guelphs and Gibelines, who butchered one another without humanity or remorse. But their contest was no longer the same: it was not now a struggle between the empire and the priesthood, but between faction and faction, inflamed by mutual jealousies and animosities. Pope Clement V had been obliged to leave Rome, which was in the anarchy of popular government. The Colonna, the Orsini, and the Roman barons, divided the city; and this division was the cause of a long abode of the popes in France, so that Rome seemed equally lost to the popes and the emperors. Sicily was in the possession of the house of Arragon, in consequence of the famous massacre called the Sicilian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VESPERS\">vespers</a>, which delivered that island from the tyranny of the French. Carobert, king of Hungary, disputed the kingdom of Naples with his uncle Robert, son of Charles II, of the house of Anjou. The house of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-ESTE\">Este</a> had established itself at Ferrara; and the Venetians wanted to make themselves masters of that country. The old league of the Italian cities no longer subsisted. It had been formed with no other view than to oppose the emperors; and since they had neglected Italy, the cities were wholly employed in aggrandizing themselves, at the expense of each other. The Florentines and the Genoese made war upon the republic of Pisa. Every city was also divided into factions within itself. In the midst of these troubles Henry VII appeared in Italy in the year 1311, and caused himself to be crowned king of Lombardy at Milan. But the Guelphs had concealed the old iron crown of the Lombard kings, as\nItaly if the right of reigning were attached to a small circlet of metal. Henry ordered a new crown to be made, with which the ceremony of inauguration was performed.\n\nCremona was the first place that ventured to oppose the emperor. He reduced it by force, and laid it under heavy contributions. Parma, Vicenza, and Placentia, made peace with him on reasonable conditions. Padua paid 100,000 crowns, and received an imperial officer as governor. The Venetians presented Henry with a large sum of money, an imperial crown of gold enriched with diamonds, and a chain of very curious workmanship. Brescia made a desperate resistance, and sustained a very severe siege; in the course of which the emperor's brother was slain, and his army diminished to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, that the inhabitants marched out under the command of their prefect Thibault de Druslatt, and gave him battle; but they were repulsed with great loss, after an obstinate engagement; and at last obliged to submit, and their city was dismantled. From Brescia Henry marched to Genoa, where he was received with expressions of joy, and splendidly entertained. He next proceeded to Rome; where, after much bloodshed, he received the imperial crown from the hands of the cardinals. Clement V., who had originally invited Henry into Italy, growing jealous of his success, had league with Robert king of Naples and the Urfini faction, to oppose his entrance into Rome. He entered it in spite of them by the assistance of the Colonnas. Now master of that ancient city, Henry appointed it a governor; and ordered, that all the cities and states of Italy should pay him an annual tribute. In this order he comprehended the kingdom of Naples, to which he was going to make good his claim of superiority by arms, when he died at Benevento in 1313, as is commonly supposed, of poison given him by a Dominican friar, in the consecrated wine of the sacrament.\n\nThe efforts of Henry VII. were unable to restore the imperial power in Italy. From this time the authority of the emperor in that country consisted in a great measure in the conveniency which the Gibellines found in opposing their enemies under the sanction of his name. The power of the pope was much of the same nature. He was less regarded in Italy than in any other country in Christendom. There was indeed a great party who called themselves Guelphs; but they affected this distinction only to keep themselves independent of the imperialists; and the states and princes who called themselves Guelphs paid little more acknowledgment to his holiness than sheltering themselves under his name and authority. The most desperate wars were carried on by the different cities against each other; and in these wars Caltruccio Caltraccani, and Sir John Hawkwood an Englishman, are celebrated as heroes. A detail of these transactions would furnish materials for many volumes; and after all seems to be but of little importance, since nothing material was effected by the utmost efforts of valour, and the belligerent states were commonly obliged to make peace without any advantage on either side. By degrees, however, this martial spirit subsided; and in the year 1492, the Italians were so little capable of resisting an enemy, that Charles VIII. of France conquered the whole kingdom of Naples in six weeks, and might easily have subdued the whole country had it not been for his own imprudence. Another attempt on Italy was made by Louis XII. and a third by Francis I., as related under the article France. In the reigns of Louis XIII. and XIV. an obstinate war was carried on between the French and Spaniards, in which the Italian states bore a very considerable share. The war concluded in 1660, with very little advantage to the French, who have been always unsuccessful in their Italian wars. The like bad success attended them in that part of the world, in the war which commenced between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> and Spain in the year 1740. But the particulars of these wars, with regard to the different states of Italy, naturally fall to be considered under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of those states into which the country is now divided; viz. Sardinia, Milan or the Milanese, Genoa, Venice, Tuscany or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUCCA\">Lucca</a>, St Marino, Parma, Mantua, Modena, Rome, and Naples.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> in Italy is very different, according to the different situations of the several countries contained in it. In those on the north of the Apennines it is more temperate, but on the south it is generally very warm. The air of the Campania of Rome, and of the Ferrarese, is said to be unhealthful; which is owing to the lands not being duly cultivated, nor the marshes drained. That of the other parts is generally pure, dry, and healthy. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> is very great in the kingdom of Naples; and would be almost intolerable, if it was not somewhat alleviated by the sea breezes. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> of Italy in general is very fertile, being watered by a great number of rivers. It produces a great variety of wines, and the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> in Europe; excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> in abundance; corn of all sorts, but not in such plenty as in some other countries; oranges, lemons, citrons, pomegranates, almonds, raisins, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, mulberry-trees without number, figs, peaches, nectarines, apricots, pears, apples, filberts, chestnuts, &c. Most of these fruits were at first imported by the Romans from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASIA_MINOR\">Asia Minor</a>, Greece, Africa, and Syria, and were not the natural products of the soil. The tender <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> are covered in winter on the north side of the Apennines, but on the south side they have no need of it. This country also yields good pasture; and abounds with cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes, wild boars, mules, and horses. The forests are well stored with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAME\">game</a>; and the mountains yield not only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> of iron, lead, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>, sulphur, marble of all sorts, alabaster, jasper, porphyry, &c. but also gold and silver; with a great variety of aromatic herbs, trees, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-EVERGREENS\">evergreens</a>, as thyme, lavender, laurel, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>, wild olive trees, tamarinds, juniper, oaks, and pines.\n\nA very extensive trade is carried on in many places in Italy, particularly at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEGHORN\">Leghorn</a>, Genoa, Bologna, Venice, and Naples; the country having a great variety of commodities and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPORTATION\">exportation</a>, especially wine, oil, perfumes, fruits, and silks. Travellers also bring large sums of money into Italy, besides what they lay out in pictures, curiosities, relics, antiquities, &c.\n\nThe Italians are generally well proportioned, though their complexions are none of the best. As to dress, they follow the fashions of the countries on which they border, or to which they are subject; namely, those of France, Spain, and Germany. With respect to their genius and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>, carving, and music,\nmusick, they are thought to excel greatly, and to leave the other nations of Europe far behind them; but their music seems too soft and effeminate to deserve all the praise bestowed on it; and their houses are far inferior to those of England in respect of convenience. No country hath produced better politicians, historians, poets, painters, and sculptors; we mean since the revival of the arts and sciences, exclusive of those of ancient times. The Italians are very affable, courteous, ingenious, sober, and ready-witted; but extremely jealous, vindictive, lascivious, ceremonious, and superstitious. In respect to jealousy, indeed, it is said a very extraordinary change has taken place; and that the Italians are now less indulgent and complaisant to their wives than the most polite husbands in France itself. In their tempers, the Italians seem to be a good medium between the French and Spaniards; neither so gay and volatile as the one, nor so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> and solemn as the other. Boiled snails, served up with oil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEPPER\">pepper</a>, or fried in oil, and the hinder parts of frogs, are reckoned dainty dishes. Kites, jackdaws, hawks, and magpies, are also eaten not only by the common people but by the better sort. Wine is drank here both in summer and winter cooled by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> or snow. The women affect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, as the Roman ladies and courtizans formerly did. They also use paint and wafles, both for their hands and faces. The day here is reckoned from sunset to sunset, as the Athenians did of old.\n\nRevolution. Amidst the convulsions which agitated Europe in consequence of the French revolution, the different states of Italy were not permitted to enjoy repose. Bonaparte, whose unprecedented and extraordinary success has hitherto even exceeded his military talents, made a rapid conquest of the whole of this country; the battles of Arcola and Lodi are memorable for the desperate valour with which they were fought, and Mantua surrendered on the 2d of February 1797, at ten o'clock at night. The immediate consequence of these successes was the conquest of the popish territories, which was not effected without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFUSION\">effusion</a> of much blood. Different changes and modifications were made in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> after these victories, and the emperor of France was in the illus proclaimed king of Italy. A detail of military and other transactions in Italy, in so far as they stood connected with the political schemes and conquests of the French government, has already been given under the article France, to which we refer our readers.\n\nAccording to Boetticher, the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of Italy including the islands of Sicily and Sardinia, ought not to be estimated at more than 13,000,000. The kingdom of Naples and Sicily is supposed to contain about 6,000,000; the central part about 3,000,000; and the northern part about 4,000,000.","sp":391,"ep":417},{"h":"ITCH","t":"a cutaneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, appearing in small watery pustules on the skin; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> of a mild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, though sometimes attended with obstinate and dangerous symptoms.

The rains fall heavy for about a fortnight in the months of May and October; and, as they are the cause of fertility, are styled seasons. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">Thunder</a> is pretty frequent, and sometimes showers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a>: but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> and snow are never seen, although on the tops of the mountains, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> very great height, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is exceedingly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>.\n\nThe most eastern parts of this ridge are known under the name of the Blue Mountain. This great chain of rugged rocks defends the south side of the island from those boisterous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-west winds, which might be fatal to their produce. Their streams, though small, supply the inhabitants with good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, which is a great blessing, as their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELLS\">wells</a> are generally brackish. The Spaniards were persuaded that these hills abounded with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>; but we do not find that they wrought any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINES\">mines</a>; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they did, it was only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, of which they said the bells in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of St Jago were made. They have several hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a>, which have done great cures. The climate was certainly more temperate before the great earthquake; and the island was supposed to be out of the reach of hurricanes, which since that time it hath severely felt. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, however, is very much tempered by land and sea breezes; and it is asserted, that the hottest time of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> is about eight in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>. In the night, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> blows from the land on all sides, so that no ships can then enter their ports.\n\nIn an island so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> as this, which contains above five millions of acres, it may be very reasonably conceived that there are great variety of soils. Some of these are deep, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, and rich, and mixed with a kind of potters <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; others shallow and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a>; and some of a middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. There are many savannahs, or wide plains, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, in which the native Indians had luxuriant crops of maize, which the Spaniards turned into meadows, and kept in them prodigious herds of cattle. Some of these savannahs are to be met with even amongst the mountains. All these different soils may be justly pronounced fertile, as they would certainly be found, if tolerably cultivated, and applied to proper purposes. A sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> arise from a very cursory review of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> produce of this spacious country.\n\nIt abounds in maize, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a>, vegetables of all kinds, meadows of fine grass, a variety of beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, and as great a variety of oranges, lemons, citrons, and other rich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>. Useful animals there are of all sorts, horses, asses, mules, black cattle of a large size, and sheep, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> of which is well tasted, though their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a> is hairy and bad. Here are also goats and hogs in great plenty; sea and river fish; wild, tame, and water-fowl. Amongst other commodities of great value, they have the sugar-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANE\">cane</a>, cacao, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a>, pimento, cotton, ginger, and coffee; trees for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> and other uses, such as mahogany, manchineel, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> wood which no worm will touch, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEDAR\">cedar</a>, olives, and many more. Besides these, they have fustick, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> wood, and various other materials for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYEING\">dyeing</a>. To these we may add a multitude of valuable drugs, such as guaiacum, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">china</a>, farfarailla, castia, tamarinds, vanellas, and the prickly-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEAR\">pear</a> or opuntia, which produces the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COCHINEAL\">cochineal</a>; with no inconsiderable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of odoriferous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a>. Near the coast they have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>-ponds, from which at one time they supplied their own consumption, and might certainly make any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> they pleased.\n\nAs this island abounds with rich commodities, it is happy likewise in having a number of fine and safe ports. Point Morant, the eastern extremity of the island, hath a fair and commodious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>. Passing on to the south, there is Port <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a>: on a neck of land which forms one side of it, there stood once the fairest town in the island; and the harbour is as fine a one as can be wished, capable of holding a thousand large vessels, and still the station of our squadron. Old Harbour is also a convenient port, so is Maccary Bay; and there are at least twelve more between this and the western extremity, which is Point Negrillo, where our ships of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> when there is a war with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>. On the north side there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a> bay, Cold harbour, Rio Novo, Montego bay, Port Antonio, one of the finest in the island, and several others. The north-west winds, which sometimes blow furiously on this coast, render the country on that side less fit for canes, but pimento thrives wonderfully; and certainly many other staples might be raised in small plantations, which are frequent in Barbadoes, and might be very advantageous here in many respects.\n\nThe town of Port Royal stood on a point of land running far out into the sea, narrow, sandy, and incapable of producing anything. Yet the excellence of the port, the convenience of having ships of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> hundred tons coming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> up to their wharfs, and other advantages, gradually attracted inhabitants in such a manner, that though many of their habitations were built on piles, there were near two thousand houses in the town in its most flourishing state, and which let at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> rents. The earthquake by which it was overthrown happened on the 7th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1692, and numbers of people perished in it. This earthquake was followed by an epidemic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, of which upwards of three thousand died: yet the place was rebuilt; but the greatest part was reduced to ashes by a fire that happened on the 9th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1703, and then the inhabitants removed mostly to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGSTON\">Kingston</a>. It was, however, rebuilt for the third time; and was rising towards its former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>, when it was overwhelmed by the sea, August 28, 1742. There is, notwithstanding, a small town there at this day. Hurricanes since that time have often happened, and occasioned terrible devastations.\n\nThe island is divided into three counties, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIDDLESEX\">Middlesex</a>, Surry, and Cornwall; containing 20 parishes, over each of which presides a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a> styled a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>; but there\nthese parishes in point of size are a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-HUNDREDS\">hundreds</a>. The whole contain 36 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> and villages, 18 churches and chapels, and about 23,000 white inhabitants.\n\nThe administration of public affairs is by a governor and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of royal appointment, and the representatives of the people in the lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a>. They meet at Spanish-town, and things are conducted with great order and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a>-governor and commander in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> has 500l. currency, or 3571l. 8s. 6\u00bdd. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a> besides which, he has a houle in Spanish-town, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> adjoining, and a polin or mountain for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>: a secretary, an under-secretary, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> chaplain.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> the council consists of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> and 10 members; with a clerk, at 270l. a chaplain 100l., usher of the black rod and messenger 250l.\n\nThe honourable the assembly consists of 43 members, one of whom is chosen speaker. To this assembly belong a clerk, with 100l. salary; a chaplain, 150l.; messenger, 700l.; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a>, 100l.; and printer, 200l.\n\nThe number of members returned by each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> are, for Middlesex 17, viz. St Catharine 3, St Dorothy 2, St John 2, St Thomas in the Vale 2, Clarendon 2, Vere 2, St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> 2, St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANN\">Ann</a> 2: For <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURREY\">Surrey</a> 16, viz.

The court of vice <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRALTY\">admiralty</a> has a sole judge, judge surrogate, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSARY\">commissary</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s advocate, principal registrar, marshal, and a deputy-marshal. The court of ordinary, consists of the ordinary (governor for the time being), and a clerk. The supreme court of judicature has a chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, 120l. and 16 assistant judges; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATTORNEY_GENERAL\">attorney-general</a>, 400l.; clerk of the court, 100l.; clerk of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, 350l.; solicitor for the crown: 33 commissioners for taking affidavits; a provost-marshal-general, and eight deputies; 18 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARRISTERS\">barristers</a>, besides the attorney-general and advocate-general; and upward of 120 practising attorneys at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> of Jamaica is very considerable, not only with all parts of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a>, but with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, North and South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, the West Indies, and the Spanish main. The ships annually employed are upwards of 500 sail.\n\nThe following account of the exports of this island in 1770, as given by Abb\u00e9 Raynal, but which in several particulars appears to be under-rated, will contribute more than all that hath been said, to show the importance of Jamaica. They consisted in 2249 bales of cotton, which at 10 pounds per bale, the price in the island, amounts to 22,490l.; 1873 hundred <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of coffee, at three pounds five shillings per hundred, 6088l.; 2753 bags of ginger, at two pounds five shillings per bag, 6194l.; 2211 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIDES\">hides</a>, at seven shillings per hide, 773l.; 16,475 puncheons of rum, at 10l. per puncheon, 164,750l. Mahogany, 15,282 pieces and 8500 feet, 50,000l. Of pimento, 2,089,734 pounds weight, 52,243l. Sugar, 57,675 hogheads, 6425 tierces, 52 barrels, at seventeen pounds ten shillings per hoghead, twelve pounds per tierce, and four pounds per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a>, amounting in the whole to 1,086,620l. Saraparilla, 205 bags, at ten pounds per bag, 2250l. Exports to Great Britain and Ireland, 1,301,210l. To North America, 1,463,24l. To the other islands, 595l. Total of the exports, 1,538,730l.\n\nThe following is a general view of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> and chief produce of the whole island in 1786, as prefixed by Mr Beckford to his descriptive account of Jamaica.\n\n| Counties | Sugar Estates | Other Settlements | Slaves | Produce Hhds. of Sugar | Cattle |\n|----------|---------------|-------------------|--------|-----------------------|--------|\n| Middlesex| 323           | 917               | 87100  | 31500                 | 75000  |\n| Surrey   | 350           | 540               | 75600  | 34900                 | 80000  |\n| Cornwall | 388           | 561               | 90000  | 39000                 | 69500  |\n| Total    | 1061          | 2018              | 255700 | 105400                | 224500 |\n\nIt should be here observed, that where two hogheads of sugar are made, there is at least one puncheon of rum; but the proportion has been of late years more considerable: the quantity of the latter will therefore be 52,700 puncheons.\n\nA comparative view between the years 1768 and 1786.\n\n|                  | Middlesex in 1768 | Middlesex in 1786 | Surrey in 1768 | Surrey in 1786 | Cornwall in 1768 | Cornwall in 1786 | Total in 1768 | Total in 1786 | Amount of Increase |\n|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|\n| Sugar Estates    | 239               | 323               | 146            | 350            | 266             | 388             | 651          | 1061        | 410              |\n| Sugar Hhds.      | 24050             | 31500             | 15010          | 34900          | 29100           | 39000           | 68160        | 105400      | 37240            |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">Negroes</a>           | 66744             | 87100             | 39542          | 75600          | 60614           | 93000           | 166900       | 255700      | 88800            |\n| Cattle            | 59510             | 73000             | 21465          | 80000          | 54775           | 69500           | 133750       | 224500      | 88750            |\nFrom the above scheme it appears, how considerable has been the increase of sugar-estates, and consequently of produce of negroes and cattle in eighteen years; and in the same portion of time (it is said), if proper encouragement were given, they might be augmented in a threefold proportion.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> valuation of an estate in Jamaica is as follows:\n\n| Item                        | Sterling |\n|-----------------------------|----------|\n| Cane land (the canes upon it valued separately) at | \u00a322 per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a> |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">Plants</a>                      | 22 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DITTO\">ditto</a> |\n| Cane land, in ratoons and young plants, | 15 ditto |\n| Pasture land                | 8 ditto |\n| Wood land                   | 4 ditto |\n| Provisions                  | 14 ditto |\n| Negroes                     | 57 ditto |\n| Mules                       | 22 ditto |\n| Steers                      | 10 ditto |\n| Breeding cattle, &c.        | 5 ditto |\n| Works, water, carts, &c.    | from 7 to 10,000 |\n\nIf a planter would wish to leave his estate for a number of years, his income would be large if he could get only 10d. sterling a day for his negroes (the loss made good), without requiring anything for his land or works.","sp":30,"ep":33},{"h":"JAMBI","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> JAMBIS, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-port town and small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, on the eastern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMATRA\">Sumatra</a>.

He was the author of the epistle which bears his name.\n\nSt James of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">Sword</a>, (San Jago del Espada), a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> order in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, instituted in 1170, under the reign of Ferdinand II, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of Leon and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALICIA\">Galicia</a>. Its end was to put a stop to the incursions of the Moors; three knights obliging themselves by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOW\">vow</a> to secure the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>. An union was proposed and agreed to in 1170 between these and the canons of St Eloy; and the order was confirmed by the pope in 1175. The highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> in that order is that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, which has been united to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of Spain.

The novices are obliged to serve six months in the galleys, and to live a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONASTERY\">monastery</a>. Heretofore they were truly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a>, and took a vow of celibacy; but Alexander III. gave them a permission to marry. They now make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> vows but of poverty, obedience, and conjugal fidelity; to which, since the year 1624, they have added that of defending the immaculate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of the holy Virgin. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> cloak, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>. This is esteemed the most considerable of all the military orders in Spain; the king carefully preserves the office of grand master in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, on account of the rich revenues and offices, whereof it gives him the disposal. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of knights is much greater now than formerly, all the grandees choosing rather to be received into this than into the order of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEECE\">fleece</a>; insomuch as this puts them in a fair way of attaining to commands, and gives them many considerable privileges in all the provinces of Spain, but especially in Catalonia.\n\nJames, the name of several kings of Scotland and of Great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. See (Histories of) Scotland and Britain.\n\nJames I, king of Scotland in 1423, the first of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of Stuart, was not only the most learned king, but the most learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> in which he flourished. This ingenious and amiable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> fell into the hands of the enemies of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> in his tender youth, when he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> from the snares of his unnatural ambitious uncle, who governed his dominions, and was suspected of designs against his life. Having secretly embarked for France, the ship was taken by an English privateer off Flamborough-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>; and the prince and his attendants (among whom was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Orkney) were confined in a neighbouring castle until they were sent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. See (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of) Scotland.\n\nThe king of England knew the value of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> he had obtained, and kept it with the most anxious care. The prince was conducted to the Tower of London immediately after he was seized, April 12. A.D. 1405, in the 13th year of his age; and there kept a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> prisoner till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 10. A.D. 1407, when he was removed to the castle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTTINGHAM\">Nottingham</a>, from whence he was brought back to the Tower, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1. A.D. 1414, and there confined till August 3. in the same year, when he was conveyed to the castle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINDSOR\">Windsor</a>, where he was detained till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> of A.D. 1417; when Henry V. for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> reasons, carried him with him into France in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> expedition. In all these fortresses, his confinement, from his own account of it, was so severe and strict, that he was not so much as permitted to take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. In this melancholy situation, so unsuitable to his age and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, books were his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> companions, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> his greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. He rose early in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, immediately applied to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a>, to divert him from painful reflections on his misfortunes, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> his studies, with little interruption, till late at night. James being naturally sensible, ingenious, and fond of knowledge, and having received a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> in his early youth, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of Walter Wardlaw bishop of St Andrews's, by this close application to study, became an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> scholar, an excellent poet, and exquisite musician. That he wrote as well as read much, we have his own testimony, and that of all our historians who lived near his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. Bowmanker, the continuator of Fordun, who was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a>, and personally acquainted with him, spends ten chapters in his praises, and in lamentations on his death; and, amongst other things, says, that his knowledge of the scriptures, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, was incredible. Hector Boece tells us, that Henry IV. and V. furnished their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> prisoner with the best teachers in all the arts and sciences; and that, by their affluence, he made great proficiency in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of learning and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-FINE_ARTS\">fine arts</a>; that he became a perfect master in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, music, and all the secrets of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\"><a class=\"xref\" hr</a>ef=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> philosophy, and was inferior to none in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> and law. He observes further, that the poems he composed in his native tongue were so beautiful, that you might easily perceive he was born a poet; but that his Latin poems were not so faultless; for though they abounded in the most sublime sentiments, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> was not so pure, owing to the rudeness of the times in which he lived. This prince's skill in music was remarkable. Walter Bower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABBOT\">abbot</a> of Inchcolm, who was intimately acquainted with that prince, assures us, that he excelled all mankind in that art both vocal and instrumental; and that he played on eight different instruments (which he names), and especially on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARP\">harp</a>, with such exquisite skill, that he seemed to be inspired. King James was not only an excellent performer, but also a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> composer, both of sacred and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> music; and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> on that account was extensive, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>. Above a century after his death, he was celebrated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a> as the inventor of a new and pleasing kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MELODY\">melody</a>, which had been admired and imitated in that country. This appears from the following testimony of Alessandro Tafioni, a writer who was well informed, and of undoubted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>. \"We may reckon among us moderns, James king of Scotland, who not only composed many sacred pieces of vocal music, but also of himself invented a new kind of music, plaintive and melancholy, different from all others; in which he hath been imitated by Carlo Gesualdo prince of Venosa, who, in Alessandria, our age, hath improved music with new and admirable inventions.\" As the prince of Venosa imitated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">Duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEVONSHIRE\">Devonshire</a>, King James, the other musicians of Italy imitated the John Hawkins, prince of Venosa. \"The most noble Carlo Gesualdo, kins, vol. iv., do p. 51, 61.\nJames do, the prince of musicians of our age, introduced such a style of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODULATION\">modulation</a>, that other musicians yielded the preference to him; and all singers and players on stringed instruments, laying aside that of others, everywhere embraced his. All the lovers, therefore, of Italian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Scotch music, are much indebted to the admirable genius of King James I., who, in the gloom and solitude of a prison, invented a new kind of music, plaintive indeed, and suited to his situation, but at the same time so sweet and soothing, that it hath given pleasure to millions in every succeeding age.\n\nAs James I. of Scotland was one of the most accomplished princes that ever filled a throne, he was also one of the most unfortunate. After spending almost 20 years in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a>, and encountering many difficulties on his return into his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, he was murdered by barbarous assassins in the prime of life. In the monuments of his genius, he hath been almost equally unfortunate. No vestiges are now remaining of his skill in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARDENING\">gardening</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>; though we are assured by one who was well acquainted with him, that he excelled in all these arts*. Many of the productions of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> have also perished; for he tells us himself that he wrote much\u2020; and we know of only three of his poems that are now extant, viz. Chrift's Kirk on the Green\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEEBLES\">Peebles</a> at the Play\u2014and the King's Quair, which was lately discovered by Mr Warton, and hath been published by another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>\u2021. But slender as these remains are, they afford sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>, that the genius of this royal poet was not inferior to that of any of his contemporaries; and that it was equally fitted for the gayest or the gravest strains.\n\nJames II. king of Scotland, 1437, succeeded his father, being then not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> years of age; and was killed at the siege of Roxburgh in 1460, aged 29.\n\nJames III. king of Scotland, succeeded his father, in 1460, in the 7th year of his age. The most striking feature in the character of this prince, unjustly represented as tyrannical by several historians, was his fondness for the fine arts, and for those who excelled in them, on whom he bestowed more of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>, confidence, and favour, than became a king in his circumstances. This excited in his fierce and haughty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a> dislike and contempt of their sovereign, and indignation against the objects of his favour; which produced the most pernicious consequences, and ended in a rebellion that proved fatal to James, who was slain in 1488, aged 36.\n\nJames IV. king of Scotland, succeeded his father in 1488. He was a pious and valiant prince; subdued his rebellious subjects; and afterwards, taking part with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XII. against Henry VIII. of England, he was slain in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of Flodden-field in 1513, aged 41.\u2014This king is acknowledged to have had great accomplishments both of mind and body. His Latin epistles are classical, compared with the barbarous style of the foreign princes with whom he corresponded. Like his father, he had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> for the fine arts, particularly that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> he paid to the civilization of his people, and his distribution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, merit the highest praise. After all, the virtues of James appear to have been more shining than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a>; and his character was that of a fine gentleman and a brave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a>, rather than a wife or a great monarch. At the time of his death, he was only in his forty first year. Like all the princes of his family (to his great grandson James VI.) his person was handsome, vigorous, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>. From their coins, it does not appear that either he, or any of his predecessors of the Stuart <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, wore their beards, as did all his successors, to the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> II.\n\nJames V. king of Scotland, in 1513, was but 18 months old when his father lost his life. When of age, he assisted Francis I. king of France against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Charles V.; for which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> Francis gave him his eldest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, in 1535. This princess died in two years; and James married Mary of Lorraine, daughter of Claud duke of Guise, and widow of Louis d'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a>, by whom he had only one child, the unfortunate Mary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> of Scots, born only eight days before his death, which happened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 13, 1542, in the 35th year of his age. This was the first prince of his family who died a natural death since its elevation to the throne. He died, however, of a broken heart, occasioned by differences with his barons. He was formed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> to be the ornament of a throne and a blessing to his people; but his excellent endowments were rendered in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> ineffectual by an improper education. Like most of his predecessors, he was born with a vigorous, graceful person, which, in the early part of his reign, was improved by all the manly exercises then in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>. This prince was the author of a humorous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> in poetry, which goes by the name of the Gaberlunzie Man.\n\nJames VI. king of Scotland in 1567, and of England in 1603, was son of Mary queen of Scots; whom he succeeded in Scotland, as he did <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> in England. Strongly attached to the Protestant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, he dignified himself in its support; which gave rise to the horrid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> of the Papists to destroy him and all the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">Gunpowder</a> Plot, discovered November 5, 1605. The following year, a political test of loyalty was required, which secured the king's person, by clearing the kingdom of those disaffected Roman Catholic subjects who would not submit to it. The chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> of this king's reign consisted in the establishment of new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-COLONIES\">colonies</a>, and the introduction of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> enjoyed peace, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> flourished during his reign. Yet his administration was despaired both at home and abroad: for, being the head of the Protestant cause in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, he did not support it in that great crisis, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOHEMIA\">Bohemia</a>; abandoning his son-in-law the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELECTOR\">elector</a> Palatine; negotiating when he should have fought, deceived at the same time by the courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MADRID\">Madrid</a>; continually sending illustrious ambassadors to foreign powers, but never making a single ally. He valued himself much upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLEMICAL\">polemical</a> writings; and so fond was he of theological disputations, that to keep them alive, he founded, for this express purpose, Chelsea-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>; which was converted to a much better use by Charles II. His Basilicon Doron, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMENTARY\">Commentary</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">Revelation</a>, writings against Bellarmine, and his Demonologia, or doctrine of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITCHCRAFT\">witchcraft</a>, are sufficiently known. There is a collection of his writings and speeches in one folio <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>. Several other pieces of his are extant; some of them in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CABALA\">Cabala</a>, others in manuscript in the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">Museum</a>,\nJames, and others in Howard's collection. He died in 1625, in the 59th year of his age, and 23rd of his reign.\n\nJames II, king of England, Scotland, &c., 1685, grandson of James I. succeeded his brother Charles II. It is remarkable, that this prince wanted neither courage nor political abilities whilst he was duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>; on the contrary, he was eminent for both: but when he ascended the throne, he was no longer the same man. A bigot from his infancy to the Romish religion and to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIERARCHY\">hierarchy</a>, he sacrificed everything to establish them, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> he had acquired, during the long reign of his brother, of the genius and character of the people he was to govern. Guided by the Jesuit Peters his confessor, and the infamous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> Jeffries, he violated every law enacted for the security of the Protestant religion; and then, unable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> the resentment of his injured subjects, he fled like a coward, instead of disarming their rage by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> of his Popish ministers and priests. He rather chose to live and die a bigot, or, as he believed, a saint, than to support the dignity of his ancestors, or perish beneath the ruins of his throne. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> was the revolution in 1689. James II. died in France in 1710, aged 68. He wrote <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">Memoirs</a> of his own life and campaigns to the restoration; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> of which is preserved in the Scotch college at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>. This piece is printed at the end of Ramsay's life of Marshal Turenne. 2. Memoirs of the English affairs, chiefly naval, from the year 1660 to 1673. 3. The royal sufferer, King James II. consisting of meditations, folliques, vows, &c. said to be composed by his majesty at St Germain. 4. Three letters; which were published by William Fuller, gent. in 1702, with other papers relating to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of St Germain, and are said in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> page to be printed by command.\n\nJames, Thomas, a learned English critic and divine, born about the year 1571. He recommended himself to the office of keeper of the public library at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, by the arduous undertaking of publishing a catalogue of the MSS in each college library at both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a>. He was elected to this office in 1602, and held it 18 years, when he resigned it to prosecute his studies with more freedom. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVOCATION\">convocation</a> held with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> at Oxford in 1625, of which he was a member, he moved to have proper commissioners appointed to collate the MSS of the fathers in all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LIBRARIES\">libraries</a> in England, with the Popish editions, in order to detect the forgeries in the latter; but this proposal not meeting with the desired encouragement, he engaged in the laborious task himself, which he continued until his death in 1629. He left behind him a great number of learned works.\n\nJames, Richard, nephew of the former, entered into orders in 1615; but, being a man of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>, of three sermons preached before the university, one concerning the observation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LENT\">Lent</a> was without a text, according to the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> manner; another against the text; and the third beside it. About the year 1619, he travelled through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a>, Scotland, Shetland, into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENLAND\">Greenland</a> and Russia, of which he wrote observations. He assisted Selden in composing his Marmora Arundeliana; and was very serviceable to Sir Robert Cotton, and his son Sir Thomas, in defining and settling their noble library. He died in 1683; and has an extraordinary character given him by Wood for learning and abilities.\n\nJames, Dr Robert, an English physician of great eminence, and particularly distinguished by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of a most excellent fever-powder, was born at Kinverton in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFFORDSHIRE\">Staffordshire</a>, A.D. 1723; his father a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">major</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>, his mother a sister of Sir Robert Clarke. He was of St John's college in Oxford, where he took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of A.B. and afterwards practised physic at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHEFFIELD\">Sheffield</a>, Lichfield, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRMINGHAM\">Birmingham</a> successively. Then he removed to London, and became a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LICENTIATE\">licentiate</a> in the college of physicians; but in what years is not known. At London he applied himself to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> as well as practising physic; and in 1743, published a Medical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DICTIONARY\">Dictionary</a>, in 3 vols folio. Soon after he published an English translation, with a supplement by himself, of Ramazzini de morbis aris- cum; to which he also prefixed a piece of Frederic Hoffman upon Endemical Distempers, 8vo. In 1746, The Practice of Physic, 2 vols 8vo; in 1760, On Canine Madness, 8vo; in 1764, A Diffenatory, 8vo. June 25, 1755, when the king was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, James was admitted by mandamus to the doctorship of physic. In 1788, were published, A Dissertation upon Fevers, and A Vindication of the Fever-powder, 8vo; with A Short Treatise on the Disorders of Children, and a very good print of Dr James. This was the 8th edition of the Dissertation, of which the first was printed in 1751; and the purpose of it was, to set forth the success of this powder, as well as to describe more particularly the manner of administering it. The Vindication was posthumous and unfinished; for he died March 23, 1776, while he was employed upon it.\u2014Dr James was married, and left several sons and daughters.\n\nJames's Powder, a medicine prepared by Robert James, which is known also by the name of James's fever powder.

He studied under Rubens, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTWERP\">Antwerp</a>; and, after his return, applied with indefatigable industry to portraits in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, though he sometimes practised\npractised in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINIATURE\">miniature</a>, and also in history and landscapes. His largest portraits were somewhat less than life. His earliest works were chiefly on board, afterwards on fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> cloth smoothly primed with a proper tone to help the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> of his shadows. His excellence is said to consist in delicacy and softness, with a clear and beautiful colouring; his shades not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a>, but helped by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a>, with little appearance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a>. When King Charles I visited Scotland in 1633, the magistrates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, knowing his majesty's taste, employed this art to make drawings of the Scottish monarchs; with which the king was so pleased, that, encouraging the painter, he sat to him, and rewarded him with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMOND\">diamond</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RING\">ring</a> from his own finger. It is observable, that Jamyn always drew himself with his hat on, either in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of his master Rubens, or on having been indulged in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> by the king when he sat to him.

This misfortune would have entirely ruined his party, had not his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> been supported by the extraordinary abilities of his wife, Jane of Flanders. Bold, daring, and intrepid, she fought like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a> in the field; shrewd, sensible, and sagacious, she spoke like a politician in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>; and endowed with the most amiable manners and winning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, she was able to move the minds of her subjects by the force of her eloquence, and mould them exactly according to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. She happened to be at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RENNES\">Rennes</a> when she received the news of her husband's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a>; but that disaster, instead of depressing her spirits, served only to raise her native courage and fortitude. She forthwith assembled the citizens; and, holding in her arms her infant son, recommended him to their care and protection in the most pathetic terms, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> dukes, who had always governed them with lenity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a>, and to whom they had ever professed the most zealous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a>. She declared herself willing to run all hazards with them in Jane's cause; pointed out the resources that still remained in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> of England; earnestly beseeching them to make one vigorous effort against an usurper, who being forced upon them by the intrigues of France, would, as a mark of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a>, sacrifice the liberties of Brittany to his protector.

The countess went from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> to place, encouraging the garrisons of the several fortresses, and providing them with every thing necessary for their subsistence; after which she shut herself up with her son in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HENNEBON\">Hennebon</a>, where she resolved to wait for the succours which the king of England (Edward III.) had promised to send to her assistance.

Being sent to foment some bufaloes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> relating to the university, into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, the Catholic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>, viewing with a jealous eye the intriguing policy of France, engaged him to write a book to expose the French to the pope as no good Catholics, since they made no scruple of forming alliances with Protestant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>. Jansen performed this task in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MARS\">Mars</a> Gallicus; and was rewarded with a mitre, being promoted to the see of Ypres in 1635.

This having set the controversy on foot, Jansenius opposed to the doctrine of the Jesuits the sentiments of St Augustine; and wrote a treatise on grace, which he entitled Augustinus. This treatise was attacked by the Jesuits, who accused Jansenius of maintaining dangerous and heretical opinions; and afterwards, in 1642, obtained of Pope Urban VIII. a formal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDEMNATION\">condemnation</a> of the treatise written by Jansenius: when the partizans of Jansenius gave out that this bull was spurious, and composed by a person entirely devoted to the Jesuits. After the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Urban VIII., the affair of Jansenius began to be more warmly controverted, and gave birth to an infinite number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLEMICAL\">polemical</a> writings concerning grace. And what occasioned some mirth, was the titles which each party gave to their writings; one writer published The torch of St Augustine, another found Snuffers for St Augustine's torch, and Father Veron formed Agag for the Jansenists, &c. In the year 1650, 68 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> of France subscribed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Pope Innocent X. to obtain an inquiry into and condemnation of the five following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROPOSITIONS\">propositions</a>, extracted from Jansenius's Augustinus: 1. Some of God's commandments are impossible to be observed by the righteous, even though they endeavour with all their power to accomplish them. 2. In the state of corrupted nature, we are incapable of resisting inward grace. 3. Merit and demerit, in a state of corrupted nature, does not depend on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> which excludes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, but on a liberty which excludes constraint. 4. The Semipelagians admitted the necessity of an inward preventing grace for the performance of each particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, even for the beginning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>: but they were heretics in maintaining that this grace was of such a nature, that the will of man was able either to resist or obey it. It is Semipelagianism to say, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ died, or shed his blood, for all mankind in general.\n\nIn the year 1652, the pope appointed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGREGATION\">congregation</a> for examining into the dispute in relation to grace. In this congregation Jansenius was condemned; and the\nJanssens, the bull of condemnation, published in May 1653, filled all the pulpits in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> with violent outcries and alarms against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a> of the Jansenists. In the year 1656, Pope Alexander VII issued another bull, in which he condemned the five propositions of Janfe-\nnus. However, the Jansenists affirm, that these propo-\nsitions are not to be found in this book; but that some of his enemies having caused them to be printed on a sheet, inserted them in the book, and thereby de-\nceived the pope. At last Clement XI put an end to the di-\npute by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 17, 1705, in which, after having recited the constitutions of his predeces-\nsors in relation to this affair, he declares, \"That in order to pay a proper obedience to the papal constitu-\ntions concerning the present question, it is necessary to receive them with a respectful silence.\" The clergy of Paris, the same year, approved and accepted this bull, and none dared to oppose it.\n\nThis is the famous bull Unigenitus, so called from its beginning with the words Unigenitus Dei Filius, &c., which has occasioned so much confusion in France.","sp":37,"ep":39},{"h":"JANSSEN","t":"Cornelius, called Johnson, an eminent paint-\ner of portraits, was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a> (though in the Chronological tables, and in Sandrart, it is im-\nproperly asserted that he was born in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>), and he resided in England for several years; where he was engaged in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> James I. and painted several excellent portraits of that monarch, as also of his children and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>.

During 11 years he continued at Rome, which barely sufficed for his finishing those pictures for which he was engaged; nor could he have even then been at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, had he not limited himself to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a>, and determined not to un-\ndertake more.\u2014Returning to Brussels, his performances were as much admired there as they had before been in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>; but having married, and gradually become the father of 11 children, he was compelled to change his manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> in small, and to undertake only those of the large kind, as being more lucrative, more expeditious, and also more agreeable to his gen-\nius and inclination.

It was first discovered by the Portuguese about the year of Christ 1542.\n\nMost of the islands which compose it are surrounded with such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> craggy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, and such shallow and boisterous seas, that failing about them is extremely dangerous; and the creeks and bays are choked up with such rocks, shelves, and sands, that it looks as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a> had designed it to be a kind of little world by itself.

Some of these whirlpools also make a noise terrible to hear.\n\nThe Chinese pretend that the Japan islands were first peopled by themselves; but it is more probable that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> inhabitants were a mixture of different nations, driven thither by those tempestuous seas, at different times.\n\nAs these islands <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in the fifth and sixth climates, they would be much hotter in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> than England, were not the heats refreshed by the winds which continually blow from the sea around them, and to which they are much exposed by the height of their situation: this circumstance, however, not only renders their winters excessively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, but the seasons more inclement. They have great falls of snow in winter, which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> followed by hard frosts. The rains in summer are very violent, especially in the months of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>, which on that account are called satuki, or water-months. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> is also much subject to dreadful thunders and lightnings, as well as storms and hurricanes, which frequently do a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of damage.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, though naturally barren and mountainous, by the industry of the inhabitants, not only supplies them with every necessary of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, but also furnishes other countries with them; producing, besides corn, the finest and whitest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICE\">rice</a> and other grains, with a great variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, and vast numbers of cattle of all sorts. Besides rice, and a sort of wheat and barley, with two sorts of beans, they have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> wheat, millet, and several other kinds in great abundance. Their seas, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIVERS\">rivers</a>, abound with fish; and their mountains, woods, and forests, are well stocked with horses, elephants, deer, oxen, buffaloes, sheep, hogs, and other useful animals.

Of these mountains, some may be justly ranked among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> rarities of this country; one, in particular, in the great island of Nippon, is of such prodigious height as to be easily seen forty leagues off at sea, though its distance from the shore is about eighteen. Some authors think it exceeds the famous Peak of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TENERIFFE\">Teneriffe</a>; but it may rather be called a clutter or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROUP\">group</a> of mountains, among which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> less than eight dreadful volcanoes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> with incredible fury, and often laying waste the country round about them; but, to make some amends, they afford great variety of medicinal waters, of different degrees of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>; one of these, mentioned by Varenius, is said to be as hot as burning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, and to torch and consume everything thrown into it.\n\nThe many brooks and rivers that have their sources among the mountains, form a great number of delightful cascades, as well as some dreadful cataracts. Among the great variety of trees in the forests here, the cedars exceed all of that kind through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, for straightness, height, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>. They abound in most of the islands, especially the largest.\n\nTheir seas, besides fish, furnish them with great quantities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> coral, and some pearls of great value, besides a variety of sea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> and shells; which last are not inferior to those that are brought from Ambon, the Molucca and other eastern islands.\n\nThe vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of sulphur with which most of the Japan islands abounds, makes them subject to frequent and dreadful earthquakes. The inhabitants are so accustomed to them, that they are scarcely alarmed at any, unless they chance to be very terrible indeed, and lay whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a> in ruins, which very often proves the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. On these occasions, they have recourse to extraordinary sacrifices, and acts of worship, to their deities or demons, according to the different notions of each fact, and sometimes even proceed to offer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> victims; but in this case they only take some of the vilest and most abandoned fellows they can meet with, because they are only sacrificed to the malevolent deities.\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> throughout Japan, it is well known, is Pagan, split into several sects, who live together in the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a>. Every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> has its own temple and priests. The spiritual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>, the Dairi, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of their religion. They acknowledge and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> a Supreme Being. The author of this relation (Dr Thunberg) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a> of the God of gods of a majestic height. The idol that represented this god was of gilded wood, and of so prodigious a size, that upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> six persons might fit in the Japanese fashion; his shoulders were five toises <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>. In the other temple, the infinite power of this god was represented by little gods to the number of 33,333; all standing round the great idol that represented God. The priests, who are numerous in every temple, have nothing to do but to clean the pavement, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> the lamps, and dress the idol with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>. The temples are open to everybody, even to the Hollanders; and in case they are in want of a lodging in the suburbs, when they go to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of Jeddo, they are entertained with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a> in these temples.\n\nThe Roman Catholic religion had once made a considerable progress in this country, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of a mission conducted by the Portuguese and Spanish Jesuits; among whom the famous Saint Francis Xavier was employed, but soon relinquished the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>. There were also some Franciscan friars of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> engaged at last. The Jesuits and friars were supplied from Goa, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACAO\">Macao</a>, and the Manilhas. At first the undertaking proceeded with the most rapid success, but ended at last in the most tragic manner, all owing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> and haughtiness, the misconduct, rapacity, and tenacity of extravagant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> of the fathers against the state. This folly and madness produced a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a> of 40 years <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, terminated by a most horrible and bloody massacre, not to be paralleled in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>. After this the Portuguese, as likewise the Christian religion, were totally expelled the country, and the most effectual means taken for preventing their return. The natives are for this purpose prohibited from going out of the country; and all foreigners are excluded from an open and free trade; for as to the Dutch and Chinese, under which last name some other eastern nations go thither, they are shut up whilst they remain there, and a most strict watch is kept upon them, inasmuch that they are no better than prisoners; and the Dutch, it is said, to obtain a privilege even so far, declared themselves to be no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, but Dutchmen. This calumny, however, Dr Kempfer has endeavoured to wipe off, but not altogether to satisfaction.\n\nIt was about the year of Christ 1549, or six years after the first discovery, that the fathers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> arrived there, being induced by the favourable representations of a young Japanese who had fled to Goa. Till the year 1625, or near 1630, the Christian religion spread through most of the provinces of the empire, many of the princes and lords openly embracing it; and \"there was very good reason to hope, that within a short compass of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the whole empire would have been converted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> of our Saviour, had not the ambitious views, and the impatient endeavours of the fathers to reap the temporal as well as the spiritual fruits of their care and labour, so provoked the supreme majesty of the empire as to raise against themselves and their converts a persecution which hath not its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> in history, whereby the religion they preached, and all those that professed it, were in a few years time entirely exterminated.\"\u2014The fathers had made a progress so great, that the princes of Bungu, Arima, and Omura who had been baptized, \"sent, in the year 1582, some of their nearest relations, with letters and presents to pay homage to the then pope, Gregory XIII, and to assure his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLINESS\">holiness</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILIAL\">filial</a> submission to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>; an account of which most celebrated embassy hath been given in the works of that incomparable historian Thuanus, and by many other Roman catholic writers.\"\n\nBut notwithstanding this pleasing prospect, the emperor, anno 1586, issued proclamations for the suppression of the religion, and the persecution began. This, however, at first had not that effect which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> expected; for though, according to the letters of the Jesuits, 20,570 persons suffered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> for the faith of Christ in the year 1590 only, yet in 1591 and 1592, when all the churches were actually shut up, they made 12,000 new converts. The business was finally concluded by the massacre at Simabara, about the year 1640. The reasons of the emperor's proclamations, making it death to embrace the religion, were as follow: 1. The new religion occasioned considerable alterations in the Japanese church, and was prejudicial in the highest degree to the heathen clergy. 2. It was feared the innovation in religion might be attended with fatal consequences even in regard to the sick; but what more immediately gave rise to them was, as the Japanese of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> confessed to Dr Kempfer, pride and covetousness; pride among the great ones, and covetousness in people of less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>; the spiritual fathers aiming not only at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a> of their souls, but having an eye also to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> and lands, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a> disposing of their goods in the most furious and unreasonable manner. To confine ourselves to the clergy here: they \"thought it beneath their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> to walk on foot any longer; nothing would serve them but they must be carried about in stately chairs, mimicking the pomp of the pope and his cardinals at Rome. They not only put themselves on an equal footing with the greatest men of the empire, but, swelled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> pride, fancied that even a superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> was nothing but their due. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> happened, that a Portuguese bishop met upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> one of the counsellors of state on his way to court. The haughty prelate would not order his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> to be stopped, in order to alight and to pay his respects to the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, as is usual in that country; but without taking any notice of him, nay, indeed without showing him so much as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> marks of civility, he very contemptuously bid his men carry him by. The great man, exasperated to so signal an affront, thenceforward bore a mortal hatred to the Portuguese, and, in the height of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> resentment, made his complaint to the emperor himself, with such an odious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of the insolence, pride, and vanity of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>, as he expected could not but raise the emperor's utmost indignation.\" This happened in 1566. The next year the persecution began anew, and 26 persons, of the number whereof were two foreign Jesuits, and several other fathers of the Franciscan order, were executed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>. The emperor Jijoas had usurped the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> on his pupil Tidajori, who, as likewise the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his court and party, had been either Christians themselves,\nelves, or at least very favourably inclined to that religion; so that reasons of state mightily co-operated to forward the persecution.\n\nSome Franciscan friars, whom the governor of the Manilhas had sent as his ambassadors to the emperor of Japan were guilty at this time of a most imprudent step: they, during the whole time of their abode in the country, preached openly in the streets of Macao where they resided; and of their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a> built a church, contrary to the imperial commands, and contrary to the advice and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> solicitations of the Jesuits.\n\nSome time after, a discovery of a dangerous conspiracy, which the fathers, and the yet remaining adepts of their religion, entered into against the person of the emperor as a heathen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, put a finishing stroke to the affair, and hastened the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> which was pronounced soon after, that the Portuguese should for ever be banished the emperor's dominions; for till then the state seemed disposed to spare the merchants and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> persons, for the purpose of continuing trade and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> with them, which was looked upon as an affair independent of religion. The affair of the conspiracy was as follows: the Dutch had had an eye to the trade of Japan before 1602, and in 1611 had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> of a free commerce granted them by the imperial letters patent, and had actually a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTORY\">factory</a> at Firando. The Dutch were then at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with Spain, which was then sovereign of the Portuguese dominions; so that it was natural for them to be trying to supplant them. The Portuguese, on their parts, made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of all malicious inventions to blacken their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, calling them rebels and pirates, whence it was natural for the Dutch to endeavour to clear, and even to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a>, themselves. Now they \"took an homeward-bound Portuguese ship near the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good Hope, on board of which they found some traitorous letters to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, written by one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Moro, who was chief of the Portuguese in Japan, himself a Japanese by birth, and a great zealot for the Christian religion. The Dutch took special care to deliver the said letters to their protector the prince of Firando, who communicated them without loss of time to the governor of Nagasaki, a great friend to the Portuguese. Captain Moro having been taken up, boldly, and with great assurance, denied the fact, and so did all the Portuguese then at Nagasaki. However, neither the governor's favour, nor their constant denial, were able to clear them, and to keep off the cloud which was ready to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> over their heads. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">Hand</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a> convinced them; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> was sent up to court, and Captain Moro sentenced to be burnt alive on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a>, which was executed accordingly. This letter laid open the whole plot which the Japanese Christians, in conjunction with the Portuguese, had laid against the emperor's life and throne; the want they stood in of ships and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, which were promised them from Portugal; the names of the Japanese princes concerned in the conspiracy; and lastly, to crown all, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of the papal blessing. This discovery made by the Dutch was afterwards confirmed by another letter written by the said Captain Moro to the Portuguese government at Macao, which was intercepted and brought to Japan by a Japanese ship.\"\n\nConsidering this, and the suspicions which the court had then already conceived against the Portuguese, it was no difficult <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> thoroughly to ruin the little credit and favour they had as yet been able to preserve; and the rather, since the strict imperial orders notwithstanding, they did not leave off privately to bring over more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICS\">ecclesiastics</a>. Accordingly, in the year 1637, an imperial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a> was sent to the governors of Nagasaki, with orders to see it put in execution. It was then that the empire of Japan was shut for ever both to foreigners and natives.\n\nNow, although the governors of Nagasaki, on receipt of these commands, took care they should be obeyed, yet the directors of the Portuguese trade maintained themselves in Japan two years longer, hoping to obtain leave to stay in the island of Delima, and there to continue their trade. But they found themselves at last wholly disappointed; for the emperor was resolved to get rid of them; and on assurance given him by the Dutch East India <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> that they would supply for the future what commodities had been imported by the Portuguese, he declared the Portuguese and the Castilians, and whoever belonged to them, enemies of the empire, forbidding the importation of even the goods of their country, Spanish wines only excepted, for the use of the court. And thus the Portuguese lost their profitable trade and commerce with Japan, and were totally expelled the country before the latter end of the year 1639 or 1640; and thus ended the fruitless popish mission in this empire, for the Portuguese have never been able to restore themselves; and the Dutch have it not in their power to do any one thing in favour of religion, were they so inclined; but, as it appears, they are very indifferent as to that, and are in but little credit with the Japanese.\n\nAccording to Dr Thunberg's researches, the Japanese have never been subdued by any foreign power, not even in the most remote periods; their chronicles contain such accounts of their valour, as one would rather incline to consider as fabulous inventions than actual occurrences, if later ages had not furnished equally striking proofs of it. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TARTARS\">Tartars</a>, for the first time in 792, had overrun part of Japan, and when, after a considerable time had elapsed, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> was destroyed by a violent storm in the course of a single night, the Japanese general attacked, and so totally defeated his numerous and brave enemies, that not a single person survived to return and carry the tidings of such an unparalleled defeat. In like manner, when the Japanese were again, in 1281, invaded by the warlike Tartars, to the number of 240,000 fighting men, they gained a victory equally complete. The extirpation of the Portuguese, and with them of the Christian religion, towards the beginning of the 17th century, as already mentioned, was so complete, that scarce a vestige can now be discerned of its ever having existed there.\n\nWith respect to the government of these islands, it is and has been for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time monarchical; though formerly it seems to have been split into a great number of petty kingdoms, which were at length all swallowed by one. The imperial dignity had been enjoyed for a considerable time before the year 1500, by a regular succession of princes, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of daimios, a name supposed to have been derived from Dairo the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>. Soon after that epoch, such a dreadful civil war broke out, and lasted so many years, that the empire was quite ruined. During these distractions and confusions, a common fol-\nJapan, died, by name Tayckoy, a person of obscure birth, but of an enterprising genius, found means to raise himself to the imperial dignity; having, in little more than three years time, by an uncommon share of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a>, subdued all his competitors and opponents and reduced all their cities and castles. The dairo not being in a condition to obstruct or put a stop to his progress, was forced to submit to his terms; and might perhaps have been condemned to much harder, had not Tayckoy been apprehensive lest his soldiers, who still revered their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> natural monarch, should have revolted in his favour. To prevent this, he granted him the supreme power in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> matters, with great privileges, honours, and revenues annexed to it; whilst himself remained invested with the whole civil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> power, and was acknowledged and proclaimed king of Japan. This great revolution happened in 1517, and Tayckoy reigned several years with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> and tranquillity; during which he made many wholesome laws and regulations, which still subsist, and are much admired to this day. At his death, he left the crown to his son Tayckofama, then a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a>; but the treacherous prince under whose guardianship he was left deprived him of his life before he came of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. By this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a>, the crown passed to the family of Jejafama, in which it still continues. Tayckoy and his successors have contented themselves with the title of cubo, which, under the dairos, was that of prime minister, whose office is now supprested; so that the cubo, in all secular concerns, is quite as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> and despotic, and has as extensive a power over the lives and fortunes of all his subjects, from the petty kings <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to the lowest persons, as ever the dairos had. The dairo resides constantly at Meaco, and the cubo at Jeddo.\n\nThe inhabitants of Japan are well-grown, agile, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>, and at the same time stout-limbed, though they do not equal in strength the northern inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> is commonly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>; which sometimes varies to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>, and sometimes to white. The inferior fort, who during their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> in summer have often the upper parts of the body naked, are sun-burnt and brown; women of distinction, who never go uncovered into the open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, are perfectly white.\n\nThe national character, consists in intelligence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>, frankness, obedience, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a>, good-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and civility, curiosity, industry, and dexterity, economy and sobriety, hardiness, cleanliness, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> and uprightness, honesty and fidelity; in being also mistrustful, superstitious, haughty, resentful, brave and invincible.\n\nIn all its transactions, the nation shows great intelligence, and can by no means be numbered among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> and uncivilized, but rather is to be placed among the polished. The present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of government, admirable skill in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, sparing mode of life, way of trading with foreigners, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>, &c., afford convincing proofs of their cunning, firmness, and intrepid courage. Here there are no appearances of that vanity so common among the Asiatics and Africans, of adorning themselves with shells, glass-beads, and polished metal plates: neither are they fond of the useless European ornaments of gold and silver <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LACE\">lace</a>, jewels, &c., but are careful to provide themselves, from the productions of their own country, with neat clothes, well-tasted food, and good weapons.\n\nTheir curiosity is excessive; nothing imported by the Europeans escapes it. They ask for information concerning every article, and their questions continue till they become wearisome. It is the physician, among the traders, that is alone regarded as learned, and particularly during the journey to court and the residence at Jeddo, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of the empire, that he is regarded as the oracle, which they trust can give responses in all things, whether in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a>, physics, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">chemistry</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARMACY\">pharmacy</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZOOLOGY\">zoology</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTANY\">botany</a>, medicine, &c.\n\nEconomy has its peculiar abode in Japan. It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> admired as well in the emperor's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> as in the meanest cottage. It makes those of small pretensions content with their little, and it prevents the abundance of the rich from overflowing in excess and voluptuousness. Hence it happens, that what in other countries is called scarcity and famine, is unknown here; and that, in so very populous a state, scarce a person in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>, or a beggar, should be found.\n\nThe names of families, and of single persons, are under very different regulations from ours. The family name is never changed, but is never used in ordinary conversation, and only when they sign some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>; to which they also for the most part affix their seal. There is also this peculiarity, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SURNAME\">surname</a> is always placed first; just as in botanical books the generic name is always placed before the specific name. The praenomen is always used in addressing a person; and it is changed several times in the course of life. A child receives at birth from its parents a name, which is retained till it has itself a son arrived at maturity. A person again changes his name when he is invested with any office; as also when he is advanced to a higher trust; some, as emperors and princes, acquire a new name after death. The names of women are less variable; they are in general borrowed from the most beautiful flowers.\n\nAfter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, the wife is confined to her own apartment, from whence she hardly ever flirts, except once a-year to the funeral-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a> of her family; nor is she permitted to see any man, except perhaps some very near relation, and that as seldom as can be. The wives, as well as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHINA\">China</a> and other parts of the east, bring no portion with them, but are rather bought by the husband of their parents and relations. The bridegroom most commonly sees his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDE\">bride</a> for the first time upon her being brought to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of the nuptial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>: for in the temple where it is performed she is covered over with a veil, which reaches from the head to the feet. A husband can put his wives to a more or less severe death, if they give him the least cause of jealousy, by being seen barely to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> with another man, or suffering one to come into their apartment.\n\nThe dress of the Japanese deserves, more than that of any other people, the name of national; since they are not only different from that of all other men, but are also of the same form in all ranks, from the monarch to his meanest subject, as well as in both sexes; and what exceeds all credibility, they have not been altered for at least 2444 years. They universally consist of night-gowns, made long and wide, of which several\nveral are worn at once by all ranks and all ages. The more distinguished and the rich have them of the finest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>; the poorer sort of cotton. Those of the women reach down to the ground, and sometimes have a train; in the men, they reach down to the heels; travellers, soldiers, and labourers, either tuck them up, or wear them only down to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-KNEES\">knees</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of the men is generally of one colour; the women have theirs variegated and frequently with flowers of gold interwoven. In summer, they are either without lining, or have but a thin one; in winter they are stuffed to a great thickness with cotton or silk. The men seldom wear a great number; but the women thirty, fifty, or more, all so thin, that they scarce together amount to five pounds. The undermost serves for a shirt, and is therefore either white or blue, and for the most part thin and transparent. All these gowns are fastened round the waist with a belt, which in the men are about a hand's-breadth, in the women about a foot; of such a length that they go twice round the waist, and afterwards are tied in a knot with many ends and bows. The knot, particularly among the fair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, is very conspicuous, and immediately informs the spectator whether they are married or not. The unmarried have it behind, on their back; the married before. In this belt the men fix their sabres, fans, pipe, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>, and medicine boxes. In the neck the gowns are always cut round, without a collar; they therefore leave the neck bare; nor is it covered with cravat, cloth, or any thing else. The sleeves are always ill made, and out of all proportion wide; at the opening before, they are half sewed up, so that they form a sack, in which the hands can be put in cold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>; they also serve for a pocket. Girls in particular have their sleeves so long that they reach down to the ground. Such is the simplicity of their habit, that they are soon dressed; and to undress, they need only open their girdle and draw in their arms.\n\nAs the gowns, from their length, keep the thighs and legs warm, there is no occasion for stockings; nor do they use them in all the empire. Among poorer persons on a journey, and among soldiers, who have not such long gowns, one sees bulkins of cotton. Shoes, or, more properly speaking, flippers, are of all that is worn by the Japanese, the simplest, the meanest, and the most miserable, though in general used among high and low, rich and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>. They are made of interwoven rice-straw; and sometimes, for persons of distinction, of reeds split very thin. They consist only of a sole, without upper leathers or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a>. Before, there palls over, transversely, a bow of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>, of a finger's breadth; from the point of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOE\">shoe</a> to this bow goes a thin round band, which running within the great toe, serves to keep the shoe fixed to the foot. The shoe being without quarters, slides, during walking, like a flipper. Travellers have three bands of twisted straw, by which they fasten the shoe to the foot and leg, to prevent its falling off. The Japanese never enter their houses with shoes, but put them off in the entrance. This precaution is taken for the sake of their neat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CARPETS\">carpets</a>. During the time the Dutch reside in Japan, as they have sometimes occasion to pay the natives visits in their houses, and as they have their own apartment at the factory covered with the same sort of carpets, they do not wear European shoes, but have in their stead red, green, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> slippers, which can easily be put off at entering in. They, however, wear stockings, with toes of cotton, fastened by buckles. These shoes are made in Japan, and may be washed whenever they become dirty.\n\nThe way of dressing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> is not less peculiar to this people, and less universally prevalent among them, than the use of their long gowns. The men shave the head from the forehead to the neck; and the hair remaining on the temples, and in the nape, is well befineared with oil, turned upwards, and then tied with a white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> thread, which is wrapped round several times. The ends of the hair beyond the head, are cut crofs-ways, about a finger's length being left. This part, after being patted together with oil, is bent in such a manner that the point is brought to the crown of the head; in which situation it is fixed by patting the same thread round it once. Women, except such as happen to be separated from their husbands, have no part of their head.\n\nThe head is never covered with hat or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONNET\">bonnet</a> in winter or in summer, except when they are on a journey; and then they use a conical hat, made of a sort of grass, and fixed with a ribband. Some travelling women, who are met with on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-ROADS\">roads</a>, have a bonnet like a shaving basin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a> on the head, which is made of cloth, in which gold is interwoven. On other occasions, their naked heads are preferred, both from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> and the sun, by umbrellas. Travellers, moreover, have a sort of riding-coat, made of thick paper oiled. They are worn by the upper servants of princes, and the suite of other travellers. Dr Thunberg and his fellow-travellers, during their journey to court, were obliged to provide such for their attendants when they passed through the place where they are made.\n\nA Japanese always has his arms painted on one or more of his garments, especially on the long and short gowns, on the sleeves, or between the shoulders; so that nobody can steal them; which otherwise might easily happen in a country where the clothes are so much alike in stuff, shape, and size.\n\nThe weapons of the Japanese consist of a bow and arrows, sabre, halbert, and mukket. The bows are very large, and the arrows long, as in China. When the bows are to be bent and discharged, the troop always rests on one knee, which hinders them making a speedy discharge. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> the troops assemble to practice <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> at a mark. Mukkets are not general; Dr Thunberg only saw them in the hands of persons of distinction, in a separated and elevated part of the audience room. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a> is of the common length; but the stock is very short, and there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a> in the lock. The sabre is their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> and best weapon, which is universally worn, except by the peasants. They are commonly a yard long, a little crooked, and thick in the back. The blades are of an incomparable goodness, and the old ones are in very high esteem. They are far superior to the Spanish blades so celebrated in Europe. A tolerably thick nail is easily cut in two without any damage to the edge; and a man, according to the account of the Japanese, may be clefled asunder. A separate faith is never used, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> is stuck in the belt, on the left side, with the edge upwards, which to a European appears ridiculous. All persons in office wear two such sabres, one of their own, and\nand the other the sword of office, as it is called; the latter is always the longer. Both are worn in the belt on the same side, and so disposed as to cross each other. When they are fitting, they have their sword of office laid on one side or before them.\n\nThe sciences are very far from having arrived at the same height in Japan as in Europe. The history of the country is, notwithstanding, more authentic, perhaps, than that of any other country; and it is studied, without distinction, by all. Agriculture, which is considered as the art most necessary, and most conducive to the support and prosperity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, is nowhere in the world brought to such perfection as here; where neither civil nor foreign war, nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMIGRATION\">emigration</a>, diminishes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>; and where a thought is never entertained, either of getting possession of other countries, or to import the useless and often hurtful productions of foreign lands; but where the utmost care is taken that no turf lies uncultivated, and no produce of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> unemployed. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a> is pursued and respected; but the natives are unable, without the aid of Chinese, and sometimes of Dutch almanacks, to form a true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALENDAR\">calendar</a>, or calculate an eclipse of the sun or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> within minutes and seconds. Medicine has neither arrived, nor is it likely to arrive, at any degree of perfection. Anatomy is totally unknown; the knowledge of diseases imperfect, intricate, and often fabulous. Botany, and the knowledge of medicines, constitute the whole of their skill. They use only simples; and these generally in diuretic and diaphoretic decoctions. They are unacquainted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> medicines. Their physicians always indeed feel the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULSE\">pulse</a>; but they are very tedious, not quitting it for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>; besides, they examine first one, and then the other arm, as if the blood was not driven by the same heart to both pulses. Besides those diseases which they have in common with other countries, or peculiar to themselves, the venereal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> is very frequent, which they only understand how to alleviate by decoctions, thought to purify the blood. Salivation, which their physicians have heard mentioned by the Dutch surgeons, appears to them extremely formidable, both to conduct and to undergo; but they have lately learned the art of employing the sublime with much success.\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURISPRUDENCE\">Jurisprudence</a> is not an extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> in Japan. No country has thinner <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>-books, or fewer judges. Explanations of the law, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a>, are things altogether unknown; but nowhere, perhaps, are the laws more certainly put in force, without respect to persons, without partiality or violence. They are very strict, and lawsuits very short. The Japanese know little more of physics or chemistry than what they have learned of late years of the Europeans.\n\nTheir computation of time takes its rise from Min-o, or 660 years before Christ. The year is divided according to the changes of the moon; so that some years consist of twelve, and others of thirteen, months; and the beginning of the year falls out in February or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>. They have no weeks consisting of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> days, or of six working days, and a holiday; but the first and fifteenth days of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> serve for holidays. On these days no work is done. On new-year's day they go round to wish one another a new year, with their whole families, clad in white and blue chequered, their holiday-dresses; and they rest almost the whole of the first month. The day is divided only into twelve hours; and in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> they are directed the whole year by the rising and setting of the sun. They reckon six o'clock at the rising, and five likewise at the setting of the sun. Mid-day and mid-night are always at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a>. Time is not measured by clocks or hour-glasses, but with burning matches, which are twisted together like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a>, and divided by knots. When the match is burnt to a knot, which indicates a certain portion of time elapsed, notice is given during the day, by striking the bells of the temples; and in the night, by the watchmen striking two boards against one another. A child is always reckoned a year old at the end of the year of his birth, whether this happen at the beginning or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>. A few days after the beginning of the year, is performed the horrid ceremony of trampling on images representing the cross and the Virgin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> with her child. The images are of melted copper, and are said to be scarce a foot in height. This ceremony is intended to impress every individual with hatred of the Christian doctrine, and the Portuguese, who attempted to introduce it there; and also to discover whether there is any remnant of it left among the Japanese. It is performed in the places where the Christians chiefly resided. In Nagasaki it lasts four days; then the images are conveyed to the circumjacent places, and afterwards are laid aside against the next year. Every person, except the Japanese governor and his attendants, even the smallest child, must be present; but it is not true, as some have pretended, that the Dutch are also obliged to trample on the image. Overseers are appointed in every place, who assemble the people in companies in certain houses, call over the name of everyone in his turn, and take care that everything goes on properly. The children, not yet able to walk, have their feet placed upon it; older persons pass over it from one side of the room to the other.\n\nThe Japanese are much addicted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, music, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>: the first is said to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> as to the style and imagery, loveliness, and cadence; but, like that of the Chinese, is not easily understood or relished by the Europeans. The same may be said of their music, both vocal and instrumental; the best of which, of either kind, would hardly be tolerable to a nice European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a>.\n\nThey pretend, like the Chinese, to have been the inventors of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> from time immemorial, and their method is the same with theirs on wooden blocks; but they excel them in the neatness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> them, as well as in the goodness of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INK\">ink</a> and paper. They likewise lay claim to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>; and are vastly superior to the Chinese in the use of all sorts of fire-arms, especially of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>, as well as the curiosities of their fire-works.\n\nTheir manner of writing is much the same as that of the Chinese, viz. in columns from top to bottom, and the columns beginning at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and ending at the left hand. Their characters were also originally the same, but now differ considerably.\n\nTheir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> hath some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> with the Chinese, though it appears from its various dialects to have been a kind of compound of that and other languages, derived from the various nations that first peopled those islands. It is not only very regular, polite, elegant, and copious, but abounds with a great variety of synonyms,\nnonyma, adapted to the nature of the subject they are upon, whether sublime, familiar, or low; and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, age, and sex, both of the speaker and person spoken.\n\nThe Japanese are commonly very ingenious in most handicraft trades; and excel even the Chinese in several manufactures, particularly in the beauty, goodness, and variety of their silks, cottons, and other stuffs, and in their Japan and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORCELAIN\">porcelain</a> wares. No eastern nation comes up to them in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPERING\">tempering</a> and fabricating of scimitars, swords, muskets, and other such weapons.\n\nThe Japanese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> is much in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and style as that of the Chinese, especially as to their temples, palaces, and other public buildings; but in private ones they affect more plainness and neatness than show. These last are of wood and cement, consisting of two stories: they dwell only in the lower; the upper chamber serving for wardrobes. The roofs are covered with rush-mats three or four inches thick. In every house there is a small court, ornamented with trees, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHRUBS\">shrubs</a>, and flower-pots; as likewise with a place for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIMNEYS\">Chimneys</a> are unknown in this country, although fire is needed from the cold month of October till the end of March. They heat their rooms with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a> contained in a copper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOVE\">stove</a>, which they sit round. Their cities are generally spacious, having each a prince or governor residing in them. The capital of Jeddo is 21 French leagues in circumference. Its streets are straight and large. There are gates at little distances, with an extremely high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADDER\">ladder</a>, which they ascend to discover fires. Villages differ from cities in having but one street; which often extends several leagues. Some of them are situated so near each other, that they are only separated by a river or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>.\n\nThe principal furniture of the Japanese consists in straw-mats, which serve them for seats and beds; a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> for every one who chooses to eat is the only movable. The Japanese sit always upon their haunches. Before dinner begins, they make a profound bow and drink to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> of the guests. The women eat by themselves. During the courses, they drink a glass of sakki, which is a kind of beer made of rice kept constantly warm; and they drink at each new morsel. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEA\">Tea</a> and sakki are the most favourite drink of this people; wine and spirits are never used, nor even accepted when offered by the Dutch. Sakki, or rice beer, is clear as wine, and of an agreeable taste; taken in quantity, it intoxicates for a few moments, and causes headache. Both men and women are fond of tobacco, which is in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> vogue and smoked continually. The gardens about their houses are adorned with a variety of flowers, trees, verdure, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a>, terraces, and other embellishments. The furniture and decorations of the houses of persons of distinction consist in Japan-work of various colours, curious paintings, beds, couches, screens, cabinets, tables, a variety of porcelain jars, vases, tea-equipment, and other vessels and figures, together with swords, guns, scimitars, and other arms. Their retinues are more or less numerous and splendid according to their rank; but there are few of the lords who have less than 50 or 60 men richly clad and armed, some on foot, but most on horseback. As for their petty kings and princes, they are seldom seen without 300 or 200 at least, when they either wait on the emperor, which is Japan one-half of the year, or attend him abroad.\n\nWhen a prince or great man dies, there are commonly about 10, 20, or more youths of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a>, and such as were his greatest favourites, who put themselves to a voluntary death, at the place where the body is buried or burned: as soon as the funeral pile, consisting of odoriferous woods, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a>, spices, oils, and other ingredients, is set on fire, the relations and friends of the deceased throw their presents into it, such as clothes, arms, victuals, money, sweet herbs, flowers, and other things which they imagine will be of use to him in the other world. Those of the middle or lower rank commonly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> their dead, without any other burning than that of some odoriferous woods, gums, &c. The sepulchres in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> and ashes of persons of rank are deposited, are generally very magnificent, and situated at some distance from the towns.\n\nThe Dutch and Chinese are the only nations allowed to traffic in Japan. The Dutch at present send but two ships annually, which are fitted out at Batavia, and sail in June, and return at the end of the year. The chief merchandise is Japanese copper and raw camphor. The wares which the Dutch company import are, coarse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, ivory, a great quantity of tin and lead, a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> iron, various kinds of fine chintzes, Dutch cloth of different colours and fineness, ferge wood for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYEING\">dyeing</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TORTOISE_SHELL\">tortoise-shell</a>, and coqus Arabicus. The little merchandise brought by the officers on their own account, consists of saffron, theriac, sealing-wax, glass-beads, watches, &c., &c. About the time when the Dutch ships are expected, several outposts are stationed on the highest hills by the government; they are provided with telephones, and long before their arrival give the governor of Nagasaki notice. As soon as they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCHOR\">anchor</a> in the harbour, the upper and under officers of the Japanese immediately betake themselves on board, together with interpreters; to whom is delivered a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHEST\">chest</a>, in which all the sailors' books, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MUSTER\">muster</a>-roll of the whole crew, six small barrels of powder, six barrels of balls, six muskets, six bayonets, six pistols, and six swords are deposited; this is supposed to be the whole remaining ammunition after the imperial garrison has been saluted. These things are conveyed on shore, and preserved in a separate warehouse, nor are they returned before the day the ship quits the harbour.\n\nDuties are quite unknown as well in the inland part as on the coast; nor are there any customs required either for exported or imported goods; an advantage enjoyed by few nations. But, to prevent the importation of any forbidden wares, the utmost vigilance is observed; then the men and things are examined with the eyes of Argus. When any European goes on shore, he is examined before he leaves the ship, and afterwards on his landing. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> search is exceedingly strict; so that not only the pockets and clothes are broached with the hands, but the pudenda of the meaner sort are pressed, and the hair of the flaves. All the Japanese who come on board are searched in like manner, except only their superior officers: so also are the wares either exported or imported, first on board, and then at the factory, except the great chests, which are opened at the factory, and so carefully examined that\nthey strike the very sides lest they should be hollow. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a>-clothes are often opened, and the feathers examined; rods of iron are run into the pots of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTTER\">butter</a> and confections: a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> hole is made in the cheese, and a long pointed iron is thrust into it in all directions. Their suspicion is carried so far, that they take out and break one or two of the eggs brought from Batavia.\n\nThe interpreters are all natives; they speak Dutch in different degrees of purity. The government permits no foreigner to learn their language, lest they should by means of this acquire the knowledge of the manufactures of the country; but 40 or 50 interpreters are provided to serve the Dutch in their trade, or on any other occasion.\n\nThe interpreters are very inquisitive after European books, and generally provide themselves with some from the Dutch merchants. They peruse them with care, and remember what they learn. They besides endeavour to get information from the Europeans; for which purpose they ask numberless questions, particularly respecting medicine, physics, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural history</a>. Most of them apply to medicine, and are the only physicians of their nation who practise in the European manner, and with European medicines, which they procure from the Dutch physicians. Hence they are able to acquire money, and to make themselves respected.\n\nAmong the vegetable productions peculiar to Japan, we may take notice of the aletris japonica, camellia japonica, and the volkameria japonica. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRUMPET\">trumpet</a>-flower, or bignonia catalpa of Linnaeus, is very common, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> a resemblance to the epidendrum vanilla, the berries of which are said to constitute an article of commerce. Here also we find the mimosa arborea, and tallow tree, together with the plantain, cocoa-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> tree, the chamereps excelsa, and the cycas circinalis, adorning the woods near the sea shore.\n\nIt is a singular circumstance, that in the whole empire of Japan, neither sheep nor goats are to be met with, the goats being deemed pernicious to cultivation; and the vast quantities of silk and cotton with which it abounds, are considered as an excellent substitute for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>. There are few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPEDS\">quadrupeds</a> of any kind, either swine, horses, or cattle, as the Japanese live upon fish, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POULTRY\">poultry</a>, and vegetables. Some wolves are seen in the northern provinces; and foxes are considered as demons incarnate.\n\nGold and silver abound in Japan, and copper richly impregnated with gold, which constitutes the chief wealth of many provinces. Iron is said to be scarcer than any other metal, which of consequence they are not fond of exporting. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBER\">Amber</a>, sulphur, pit-coal, red <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGATE\">agate</a>, asbestos, porcelain, clay, pumice and white marble, are also found in considerable quantities; but, according to Kempfer, neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a> nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>. As Europeans have seldom visited the interior parts of the country, the natural curiosities of Japan are but very little known.\n\nJapan Earth.

In the older practice, such priming was always used; and is at present retained in the French manner of japanning coaches and snuff-boxes of the papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9; but in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BIRMINGHAM\">Birmingham</a> manufacture here, it has been always rejected. The advantage of using such priming or undercoat is, that it makes a saving in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of varnish used; because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of which the priming is composed fills up the inequalities of the body to be varnished; and makes it easy, by means of rubbing and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>-polishing, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> an even surface for the varnish; and this was therefore such a convenience in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of wood, as the giving a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> and firmness to the ground was also in the case of leather, that it became an established method; and is therefore retained even in the instance of the papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 by the French, who applied the received method of japanning to that kind of work on its introduction. There is nevertheless this inconvenience always attending the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of an undercoat of size, that the japan coats of varnish and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be constantly liable to be cracked and peeled off by any violence, and will not endure near so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as the bodies japanned in the same manner, but without any such priming; as may be easily observed in comparing the wear of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> and Birmingham snuff-boxes; which latter, when good of their kind, never peel or crack, or suffer any damage, unless by great violence, and such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> rubbing as wastes away the substance of the varnish; while the japan coats of the Parisians crack and fly off in flakes, whenever any knock or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, particularly near the edges, expose them to be injured. But the Birmingham manufacturers, who originally practised the japanning only on metals, to which the reason above given for the use of priming did not extend, and who took up this art of themselves as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a>, of course omitted at first the use of any such undercoat; and not finding it more necessary in the instance of papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 than on metals, continue still to reject it. On which account, the boxes of their manufacture are, with regard to the wear, greatly better than the French.\n\nThe laying on the colours in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>-water, instead of varnish, is also another variation from the method of japanning formerly practised; but the much greater strength of the work, where they are laid on in varnish or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, has occasioned this way to be exploded with the greatest reason in all regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>: however, they who may practise japanning on cabinets, or other such pieces as are not exposed to much wear and violence,\nJapanning violence, for their amusement only, and consequently may not find it worth their while to encumber themselves with the preparations necessary for the other methods, may paint with water-colours on an undercoat laid on the wood or other substance of which the piece to be japanned is formed; and then finished with the proper coats of varnish, according to the methods below taught: and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the colours are tempered with the strongest ifinglafs size and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>, instead of gum-water, and laid on very flat and even, the work will not be much inferior in appearance to that done by the other method, and will last as long as the old Japan.\n\nOf Japan Grounds.\u2014The proper grounds are either such as are formed by the varnish and colour, where the whole is to remain of one simple colour; or by the varnish either coloured or without colour, on which some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> or other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECORATION\">decoration</a> is afterwards to be laid. It is necessary, however, before we proceed to speak of the particular grounds, to show the manner of laying on the priming or undercoat, where any such is used.\n\nThis priming is of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> with that called clear coating, or vulgarly clear-coating, practised erroneously by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>-painters; and consists only in laying on and drying in the moist even manner a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of size and whiting, or sometimes lime instead of the latter. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> size has been generally used for this purpose; but where the work is of a nicer kind, it is better to employ the glovers or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARCHMENT\">parchment</a> size; and if a third of ifinglafs be added, it will be still better, and, if not laid on too thick, much less liable to peel and crack. The work should be prepared by this priming, by being well smoothed with the fifth-flake or glass-blaver; and, being made thoroughly clean, should be brushed over once or twice with hot size, diluted with two-thirds of water, if it be of the common strength. The priming should then be laid on with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a> as even as possible; and should be formed of a size whose consistence is between the common kind and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLUE\">glue</a>, mixed with as much whiting as will give it a sufficient body of colour to hide the surface of whatever it is laid upon, but not more.\n\nIf the surface be very clean on which the priming is used, two coats of it laid on in this manner will be sufficient; but if, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> with a fine wet rag, it will not receive a proper water polish on account of any inequalities not sufficiently filled up and covered, two or more coats must be given it; and whether a greater or less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> be used, the work should be smoothed, after the last coat but one is dry, by rubbing it with the Dutch rushes. When the last coat is dry, the water polish should be given, by passing over every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of it with a fine rag gently moistened, till the whole appear perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> and even. The priming will then be completed, and the work ready to receive the painting or coloured varnish; the rest of the proceedings being the same in this case as where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> priming is used.\n\nWhen wood or leather is to be japanned, and no priming is used, the best preparation is to lay two or three coats of coarse varnish composed in the following manner:\n\n\"Take of rectified spirit of wine one pint, and of coarse feed-lac and resin each two ounces. Dissolve the japanning-feed-lac and resin in the spirit; and then strain off the varnish.\"\n\nThis varnish, as well as all others formed of spirit of wine, must be laid on in a warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>; and, if it can be conveniently managed, the piece of work to be varnished should be made warm likewise; and for the same reason all dampness should be avoided; for either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> or moisture chills this kind of varnish, and prevents it taking proper hold of the substance, on which it is laid.\n\nWhen the work is so prepared, or by the priming with the composition of size and whiting above described, the proper japan ground must be laid on, which is much the best formed of shell-lac varnish, and the colour desired, if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> be not in question, which demands a peculiar treatment, or great brightness be not required, when also other means must be pursued.\n\nThe colours used with the shell-lac varnish may be any pigments whatever which give the tint of the ground desired; and they may be mixed together to form browns or any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> colours.\n\nAs metals never require to be undercoated with whiting, they may be treated in the same manner as wood or leather, where the undercoat is omitted, except in the instances particularly spoken of below.\n\nWhite Japan Grounds.\u2014The forming a ground perfectly white, and of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of hardness, remains hitherto a desideratum, or matter sought for, in the art of japanning, as there are no substances which form a very hard varnish but what have too much colour not to deprive the whiteness, when laid on of a due thickness over the work.\n\nThe nearest approach, however, to a perfect white varnish, already known, is made by the following composition:\n\n\"Take flake white, or white <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, washed over and ground up with a sixth of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STARCH\">starch</a>, and then dried; and temper it properly for spreading with the mastick varnish prepared as under the article VARNISH.\n\n\"Lay these on the body to be japanned, prepared either with or without the undercoat of whiting, in the manner as above ordered; and then varnish it over with five or six coats of the following varnish:\n\n\"Provide any quantity of the best feed-lac; and pick out of it all the clearest and whitest grains, reserving the more coloured and fouler parts for the coarse varnishes, such as that used for priming or preparing wood or leather. Take of this picked feed-lac two ounces, and of gum-animal three ounces; and dissolve them, being previously reduced to a grofs powder, in about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUART\">quart</a> of spirit of wine; and strain off the clear varnish.\"\n\nThe feed-lac will yet give a slight tinge to this composition; but cannot be omitted where the varnish is wanted to be hard; though, when a softer will answer the end, the proportion may be diminished, and a little crude turpentine added to the gum animal to take off the brittleness.\n\nA very good varnish, free entirely from all brittleness, may be formed by dissolving as much gum animal as the oil will take, in old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> or poppy oil; which must be made to boil gently when the gum is put into it. The\nJapaning ground of white colour itself may be laid on in this varnish, and then a coat or two of it may be put over the ground; but it must be well diluted with oil of turpentine when it is used. This, though free from brittleness, is nevertheless liable to suffer by being indented or bruised by any slight strokes; and it will not well bear any polish, but may be brought to a very smooth surface without, if it be judiciously managed in the laying it on. It is likewise somewhat tedious in drying, and will require some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> where several coats are laid on; as the lac ought not to contain much oil of turpentine.\n\nBlue Japan Grounds.\u2014Blue japan grounds may be formed of bright Prussian blue, or of verditer glazed over by Prussian blue, or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMALT\">smalt</a>. The colour may be best mixed with shell-lac varnish, and brought to a polishing state by five or six coats of varnish of seed-lac: but the varnish, nevertheless, will somewhat injure the colour by giving to a true blue a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> of green, and fouling in some degree a warm blue by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> it contains: where, therefore, a bright blue is required, and a less degree of hardness can be dispensed with, the method before directed in the case of white grounds must be pursued.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> Japan Grounds.\u2014For a scarlet japan ground, vermillion may be used: but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMILION\">vermilion</a> has a glaring effect, that renders it much less beautiful than the crimson produced by glazing it over with carmine or fine lake: or even with rose-pink, which has a very good effect used for this purpose. For a very bright crimson, nevertheless, instead of glazing with carmine, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> lake should be used, dissolved in the spirit of which the varnish is compounded, which it readily admits of when good: and, in this case, instead of glazing with the shell-lac varnish, the upper or polishing coats need only be used; as they will equally receive and convey the tinge of the Indian lake, which may be actually dissolved by spirit of wine: and this will be found a much cheaper method than the using carmine. If, nevertheless, the highest degree of brightness be required, the white varnishes must be used.\n\nYellow Japan Grounds.\u2014For bright yellow grounds, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s yellow, or the turpeth mineral, should be employed, either alone or mixed with fine Dutch pink: and the effect may be still more heightened by dissolving powdered turmeric root in the spirit of wine of which the upper or polishing coat is made; which spirit of wine must be strained from off the dregs before the seed-lac be added to it to form the varnish.\n\nThe shell-lac varnish is not equally injurious here, and with greens, as in the case of other colours; because, being only tinged with a reddish yellow, it is little more than an addition to the force of the colours.\n\nYellow grounds may be likewise formed of the Dutch pink only; which, when good, will not be wanting in brightness, though extremely cheap.\n\nGreen Japan Grounds.\u2014Green grounds may be produced by mixing the king's yellow and bright Prussian blue, or rather the turpeth mineral and Prussian blue; and a cheap, but fouler kind, by verdigris with a little of the above-mentioned yellows, or Dutch pink. But, where a very bright green is wanted, the crystals of verdigris, called distilled verdigris, should be employed; and to heighten the effect, they should be laid on a ground of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, which renders the colour extremely brilliant and pleasing.\n\nThey may any of them be used successfully with good seed-lac varnish, for the reason before given; but will be still brighter with white varnish.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">Orange</a>-coloured Japan Grounds.\u2014Orange-coloured japan grounds may be formed by mixing vermillion or red-lead with king's yellow, or Dutch pink; or the orange-lac, which will make a brighter orange ground than can be produced by any mixture.\n\nPurple Japan Grounds.\u2014Purple japan grounds may be produced by the mixture of lake and Prussian blue; or a fouler kind, by vermillion and Prussian blue. They may be treated as the rest with respect to the varnish.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> Japan Grounds to be produced with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">Heat</a>.\u2014Black grounds may be formed by either ivory-black or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a> black: but the former is preferable where it is perfectly good.\n\nThese may be always laid on with shell-lac varnish; and have their upper or polishing coats of common seed-lac varnish, as the tinge or fulness of the varnish can be here no injury.\n\nCommon Black Japan Grounds on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">Iron</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">Copper</a>, produced by means of Heat.\u2014For forming the common black japan grounds by means of heat, the piece of work to be japanned must be painted over with drying oil; and, when it is of a moderate dryness, must be put into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOVE\">stove</a> of such degree of heat as will change the oil to black, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> it so as to destroy or weaken its tenacity. The stove should not be too hot when the work is put into it, nor the heat increased too fast; either of which errors would make it blister: but the slower the heat is augmented, and the longer it is continued, provided it be restrained within the due degree, the harder will be the coat of japan.\n\nThis kind of varnish requires no polish, having received, when properly managed, a sufficient one from the heat.","sp":48,"ep":50},{"h":"JAPHETH","t":"the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOAH\">Noah</a>.

With an intention to visit his native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> he at last left Rome; but passing through Lyons, and meeting some agreeable companions, they prevailed on him to stay there for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, and he found as much employment in that city as he could possibly undertake or execute.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> is mountainous and woody in the middle; but a flat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, full of bogs and marshes, renders the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> unhealthy.

Many of the mountains are so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as to be seen at the distance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of leagues. That which is called the Blue Mountain is by far the highest of them all, and seen the farthest off at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>. They have frequent and very terrible earthquakes in this island, which shake the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Batavia and places adjacent, to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> of the houses is expected every moment. The waters in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> are excessively agitated, inasmuch that their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> resembles that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> pot; and in some places the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> opens, which affords a strange and terrible spectacle. The inhabitants are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that these earthquakes proceed from the mountain Parang, which is full of sulphur, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALTPETRE\">saltpetre</a>, and bitumen. The fruits and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> of this island are in their several kinds excellent, and almost out of number. There are abundance of forests scattered over it, in which are all kinds of wild beasts, such as buffaloes, tygers, rhinoceroses, and wild horses, with an infinite variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a>, some of them of an enormous size. Crocodiles are prodigiously large in Java, and are found chiefly about the mouths of rivers; for, being amphibious animals, they delight mostly in marshes and savannahs. This creature, like the tortoise, lays its eggs in the hot sands, without taking any further care of them; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HATCHES\">hatches</a> them at the proper season, when the young run instantly into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. There is, in short, no kind of animal wanting here: fowls they have of all sorts, and exquisitely good, especially peacocks, partridges, pheasants, wood-pigeons; and, for curiosity, they have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> bat, which differs little in form from ours; but its wings, when extended, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> a full yard, and the body of it is of the size of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-RAT\">rat</a>. They have fish in great plenty, and very good; so that for the value of three-pence there may be enough bought to dine six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> men. They have likewise a multitude of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TORTOISES\">tortoises</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> of which is very little inferior to veal, and there are many who think it better.\n\nIt is said, that there are in the island upwards of 40 great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, which, from the number of their inhabitants, would, in any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the world, merit the name of cities; and more than 4500 villages, besides hamlets, and straggling houses, lying very near each other, upon the sea coast, and in the neighbourhood of great towns: hence, upon a fair and moderate computation, there are within the bounds of the whole island, taking persons of both sexes, and of all ranks and ages, more than thirty millions of souls; so that it is thrice as populous as France, which, though twice as big, is not computed to have more than twenty millions of inhabitants.\n\nThere are a great many princes in the island, of which the most considerable are, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACASSAR\">Macassar</a>, who resides at Katalura, and the kings of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BANTAM\">Bantam</a> and Japara. Upon the first of these many of the petty princes are dependent; but the Dutch are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> masters of the greatest part of the island, particularly of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> coast, though there are some of the princes beyond the mountains, on the south coast, who still maintain their independency. The natives of the country, who are established in the neighbourhood of Batavia, and for a tract of about 40 leagues along the mountains of the country of Bantam, are immediately subject to the governor-general. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> send droffards, or commissaries, among them, who administer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> and take care of the public revenues.\n\nThe city of Batavia is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> not only of this island but of all the Dutch dominions in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>. It is an exceeding fine city, situated in the latitude of 6\u00b0 south, at the mouth of the river Jucatra, and in the bosom of a large commodious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>, which may be considered not only as one of the safest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-HARBOURS\">harbours</a> in India, but in the world. The city is surrounded by a rampart 21 feet thick, covered on the outside with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> and fortified with 22 bastions. This rampart is environed by a ditch 45 yards over, and full of water, especially when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> are high, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>. The avenues to the town are defended by several forts, each of which is well furnished with excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> cannon: no person is suffered to go beyond these forts without a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSPORT\">passport</a>. The river Jucatra passes through the midst of the town, and forms 15 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CANALS\">canals</a> of running water, all faced with free-stone, and adorned with trees that are ever green; over these canals are 56 bridges, besides those which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> without the town. The streets are all perfectly straight, and each, generally speaking, 30 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>. The houses are built of stone, after the manner of those in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>. The city is about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> and a half in circumference, and has five gates; but there are ten times the number of houses without that there are within it. There is a very fine town-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, four Calvinist churches, besides other places of worship for all sorts of religions, a spin-huys or house of correction, an orphan house, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGAZINE\">magazine</a> of sea stores, several for spices, with wharfs and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> manufactories, and many other public buildings. The garrison consists <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> of between 2000 and 3000 men. Besides the forts mentioned above, there is the citadel of Batavia, a very fine regular fortification, situated at the mouth of the river, and flanked with four battions; two of which command the sea, and the other two the town. It is in the citadel that the governor-general of the Indies has his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>; over against which is that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTOR\">director</a>-general, who is the next person to the governor. The counsellors, and other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> officers of the company, have also their apartments there; as have likewise the physician, the surgeon, and the apothecary. There are in it, besides, arsenals and magazines furnished with ammunition for many years. The city of Batavia is not only inhabited by Dutch, French, Portuguese, and other Europeans, established here on account of trade; but also by a vast number of Indians of different nations, Javanese, Chinese, Malaysians, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NEGROES\">Negroes</a>, Ambonese, Armenians, natives of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLE\">isle</a> of Bali, Mardykers or Topasses, Macaffers, Timors, Bougis, &c. Of the Chinese, there are, it is said,\nsaid, about 100,000 in the island; of which near 30,000 resided in the city till the year 1740, when the Dutch, pretending that they were in a plot against them, sent a body of troops into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, and demanded their arms, which the Chinese readily delivered up; and the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> the governor sent another body, with orders to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> and massacre every one of the Chinese, men, women, and children. Some relate there were 20,000, others 30,000, that were put to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, without any manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>; and yet the barbarous governor, who was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> of this cruel proceeding, had the assurance to embark for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, imagining he had amassed wealth enough to secure him against any prosecution in Holland: but the Dutch, finding themselves detested and abhorred by all mankind for this piece of tyranny, endeavoured to throw the odium of it upon the governor, though he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of Batavia, except one, to the order for the massacre. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, therefore, dispatched a packet to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good Hope, containing orders to apprehend the governor, and send him back to Batavia to be tried. He was accordingly apprehended at the Cape; but was never heard of afterwards. It supposed he was thrown over-board in his passage to Batavia, that there might be no farther inquiries into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>; and it is said, all the wealth this merciful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> had amassed, and sent over before him in four ships, was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> away in the passage.\n\nBesides the garrison here, the Dutch had formerly about 15,000 men in the island, either Dutch, or formed out of the several nations they had enslaved; and they had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> of between 20 and 30 men of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, with which they gave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> to every power on the coast of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, and to all the European powers that visit the Indian ocean, unless we should except the British: it was, however, but a little before the revolution that they expelled us from our settlement at Bantam.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JAVELIN\">Javelin</a>, in antiquity, a sort of spear five feet and an half long; the shaft of which was of wood, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> point.\u2014Every soldier in the Roman armies had seven of these, which were very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> and slender.\n\nJawer, a city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SILESIA\">Silesia</a>, capital of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of the same name, with a citadel, and a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, surrounded with piazzas.

Thence arose the proverb Ibyci Grues.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ICE\">Ice</a>, in Physiology, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a>, transparent, and brittle body.\nICE\n\nThe younger Lemery observes, that ice is only a re-establishment of the parts of water in their natural state; that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> absence of fire is sufficient to account for this re-establishment; and that the fluidity of water is a real fusion, like that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> exposed to the fire; differing only in this, that a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of fire is necessary to the one than the other. Galileo was the first that observed ice to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LIGHTER\">lighter</a> than the water which composed it; and hence it happens, that ice floats upon water, its specific gravity being to that of water as eight to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a> of ice seems to be owing to the air-bubbles produced in water by freezing; and which, being considerably large in proportion to the water frozen, render the body so much specifically lighter: these air-bubbles, during their production, acquire a great expansive power, so as to burst the containing vessels, though ever so strong.\n\nM. Mairan, in a dissertation on ice, attributes the increase of its bulk chiefly to a different arrangement of the parts of the water from which it is formed; the icy skin on the water being composed of filaments, which, according to him, are found to be constantly and regularly joined at an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of 60\u00b0; and which, by this angular disposition, occupy a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a>. He found the augmentation of the volume of water by freezing, in different trials, a 14th, an 18th, a 19th; and when the water was previously purged of air, only a 22d part: that ice, even after its formation, continues to expand by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>; for, after water had been frozen to some thickness, the fluid part being let out by a hole in the bottom of the vessel, a continuance of the cold made the ice convex; and a piece of ice, which was at first only a 14th part specifically lighter than water, on being exposed some days to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FROST\">frost</a>, became a 12th part lighter. To this cause he attributes the bursting of ice on ponds.\n\nWax, resins, and animal fats, made fluid by fire, instead of expanding like watery liquors, shrink in their return to solidity: for solid pieces of the same bodies sink to the bottom of the respective <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLUIDS\">fluids</a>; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that these bodies are more dense in their solid than in their fluid state. The oils which congeal by cold, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> olive, and the essential oil of aniseeds, appear also to shrink in their congelation. Hence, the different dispositions of different kinds of trees to be burnt by, or to resist, strong frosts, are by some attributed to the juices with which the tree abounds; being in the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> watery, and in the other resinous or oily.\n\nThough it has been generally supposed that the natural crystals of ice are stars of five rays, forming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> of 60\u00b0 with each other, yet this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYSTALLIZATION\">crystallization</a> of water, as it may properly be called, seems to be as much affected by circumstances as that of salts. Hence we find a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> in the accounts of those who have undertaken to describe these crystals. M. Mairan informs us, that they are stars with five radii; and his opinion is confirmed by observing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of frost on glass. M. Rome de L'Isle determines the form of the solid crystal to be an equilateral octahedron. M. Hassenfratz found it to be a prismatic hexaedron; but M. d'Antic found a method of reconciling these seemingly opposite opinions. In a violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a>-storm, where the hailstones were very large, he found they had sharp wedge-like angles of more than half an inch; and in these he supposed it impossible to see two pyramidal tetraedra joined laterally, and not to conclude that each grain was composed of octaedrons converging to a centre. Some had a cavity in the middle; and he saw the opposite extremities of two opposite pyramids, which constitute the octahedron; he likewise saw the octahedron entire united in the middle: all of them were therefore similar to the crystals formed on a thread immersed in a saline solution. On these principles M. d'Antic constructed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> octahedron resembling one of the largest hailstones; and found that the angle at the summit of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a> was 45\u00b0, but that of the junction of the two pyramids 145\u00b0. It is not, however, easy to procure regular crystals in hailstones where the operation is conducted with such rapidity: in snow and hoar-frost, where the crystallization goes on more slowly, our author is of opinion that he sees the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of octaedra.\n\nIce forms generally on the surface of the water: but this too, like the crystallization, may be varied by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in the circumstances. In Germany, particularly the northern parts of that country, it has been observed that there are three kinds of ice. 1. That which forms on the surface. 2. Another kind formed in the middle of the water, resembling nuclei or small hail. 3. The ground ice which is produced at the bottom, especially where there is any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-FIBROUS\">fibrous</a> substance to which it may adhere. This is full of cells like a wasp's nest, but less regular; and performs many strange effects in bringing up very heavy bodies from the bottom, by means of its inferiority in specific gravity to the water in which it is formed. The ice which forms in the middle of the water rises to the top, and there unites into large masses; but the formation both of this and the ground ice takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> only in violent and sudden colds, where the water is shallow, and the surface disturbed in such a manner that the congelation cannot take place. The ground ice is very destructive to dykes and other aquatic works. In the more temperate European climates these kinds of ice are not met with.\n\nIn many countries the warmth of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> renders ice not only a desirable, but even a necessary article; so that it becomes an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to fall upon a ready and cheap method of procuring it. We shall here take notice of some attempts made by Mr Cavallo to discover a method of producing a sufficient degree of cold for this purpose by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> of volatile liquors. He found, however, in the course of these experiments, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a> was incomparably superior to any other fluid in the degree of cold it produced. The price of the liquor naturally induced him to fall upon a method of using it with as little waste as possible. The thermometer he made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> quite detached from the ivory piece on which the scale was engraved. The various fluids were then thrown upon the ball through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> aperture of a small glass vessel shaped like a funnel; and care was taken to throw them upon it so slowly, that a drop might now and then fall from the under part, excepting when these fluids were used, which\nwhich evaporate very slowly; in which case it was sufficient barely to keep the ball moist, without any drop falling from it. During the experiment, the thermometer was kept very gently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> round its axis, that the fluid made use of might fall upon every part of its ball. He found this method preferable to that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIPPING\">dipping</a> the ball of the thermometer into the fluid and taking it out again immediately, or even of anointing it constantly with a feather. The evaporation, and consequently the cold, produced by it, may be increased by blowing on the thermometer with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAIR\">pair</a> of bellows; though this was not used in the experiments now to be related, on account of the difficulty of its being performed by one person, and likewise because it occasions much uncertainty in the results.\n\nThe room in which the experiments were made was heated to 64\u00b0 of Fahrenheit; and with water it was reduced to 56\u00b0, viz. 8\u00b0 below that of the room or of the water employed. The effect took place in about two minutes; but though the operation was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for a longer time, it did not sink lower. With spirit of wine it sunk to 48\u00b0. The cold was greater with highly rectified spirit than with the weaker fort; but the difference is less than would be expected by one who had never seen the experiment made. The pure spirit produces its effect much more quickly. On using various other fluids which were either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> of water and spirituous liquors, or pure essences, he found that the cold produced by their evaporation was generally some intermediate degree between that produced by water and the spirit of wine. Oil of turpentine sunk the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> three degrees; but olive oil and others, which evaporate very slowly, or not at all, did not sensibly affect the thermometer.\n\nTo observe how much the evaporation of spirit of wine, and consequently the cold produced by it, would be increased by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a>, he put the tube containing it into an insulating handle, and connected it with the conductor of an electrical machine, which was kept in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> during the time of making the experiment; by which means one degree of cold seemed to be gained, as the mercury now sunk to 47\u00b0 instead of 48\u00b0, at which it had stood formerly. On trying the three mineral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>, he found that they heated the thermometer instead of cooling it; which effect he attributes to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> they themselves acquired by uniting with the moisture of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. The vitriolic acid, which was very strong and transparent, raised the mercury to 102\u00b0, the smoking nitrous acid to 72\u00b0, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> to 66\u00b0.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> for using the least possible quantity of ether for freezing water consists in a glass tube (fig. 1.) terminating in a capillary aperture, which is to be fixed upon the bottle containing the ether. Round the lower part of the neck at A some thread is wound, in order to let it fit the neck of the bottle. When the experiment is to be made, the stopper of the bottle containing the ether is to be removed, and the tube <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned put in its room. The thread round the tube ought also to be previously moistened with water or spit before it is put into the neck of the bottle, in order the more effectually to prevent the escape of the ether betwixt the neck of the phial and tube. Hold then the bottle by its bottom FG (fig. 2.)\n\nVol. XI. Part I.\n\nand keeping it inclined as in the figure, the small stream of ether issuing out of the aperture D of the tube DE, is directed upon the ball of the thermometer, or upon a tube containing water or other liquor that is required to be congealed. As ether is very volatile, and has the remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of increasing the bulk of air, there is no aperture requisite to allow the air to enter the bottle while the liquid flows out. The heat of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> is more than sufficient to force out the ether in a continued stream at the aperture D.\n\nIn this manner, throwing the stream of ether upon the ball of a thermometer in such a quantity that a drop might now and then, every ten seconds for instance, fall from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a> of the thermometer, Mr Cavallo brought the mercury <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to 3\u00b0, or 29\u00b0 below the freezing point, when the atmosphere was somewhat hotter than temperate. When the ether is very good, i.e. capable of dissolving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, and has a small bulb, not above 20 drops of it are required to produce this effect, and about two minutes of time; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> fort must be used in greater quantity, and for a longer time; though at last the thermometer is brought down by this very nearly as low as by the best fort.\n\nTo freeze water by the evaporation of ether, Mr Cavallo takes a thin glass tube about four inches long, and one-fifth of an inch diameter, hermetically sealed at one end, with a little water in it, so as to take up about half an inch of the cavity, as is shewn at CB in fig. 3. Into this tube a slender wire H is also introduced, the lower extremity of which is twisted into a spiral, and serves to draw up the bit of ice when formed. He then holds the glass tube by its upper part A with the fingers of the left hand, and keeps it continually and gently turning round its axis, first one way and then the other: whilst with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> hand he holds the phial containing the ether in such a manner as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the stream on the outside of the tube, and a little above the surface of the water contained in it. The capillary aperture D should be kept almost in contact with the surface of the tube containing the water; and by continuing the operation for two or three minutes, the water <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be frozen as it were in an instant; and the opacity will ascend to C in less than half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> of time, which makes a beautiful appearance. This congelation, however, is only superficial: and in order to congeal the whole quantity of water, the operation must be continued a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> or two longer; after which the wire H will be found kept very tight by the ice. The hand must then be applied to the outside of the tube, in order to soften the surface of the ice; which would otherwise adhere very firmly to the glass; but when this is done, the wire H easily brings it out.\n\nSometimes our author was accustomed to put into the tube a small thermometer instead of the wire H; and thus he had an opportunity of observing a very curious phenomenon unnoticed by others, viz. that in the winter time water requires a smaller degree of cold to congeal it than in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>. In the winter, for instance, the water in the tube <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AB\">AB</a> will freeze when the thermometer stands about 30\u00b0; but in the summer, or even when the thermometer stands at 60\u00b0, the quicksilver must be brought down to 10, 15, or even more degrees.\ngrces below the freezing point before any congelation can take place. In the summer time therefore a greater quantity of ether, and more time, will be required to congeal any given quantity of water than in winter. When the temperature of the atmosphere has been about 40\u00b0, our author has been able to congeal a quantity of water with an equal quantity of good ether; but in summer, two or three times the quantity are required to perform the effect. \"There seems (says he) to be something in the air, which, besides heat, interferes with the freezing of water, and perhaps of all fluids; though I cannot say from my own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> whether the above-mentioned difference between the freezing in winter and summer takes place with other fluids, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, oils, wines,\" &c.\n\nThe proportion of ether requisite to congeal water seems to vary with the quantity of the latter; that is, a large quantity of water seems to require a proportionably less quantity of ether to freeze it than a smaller one. \"In the beginning of the spring (says Mr Cavalli), I froze a quarter of an ounce of water with about half an ounce of ether: the apparatus being larger, though similar to that described above. Now as the price of ether, sufficiently good for the purpose, is generally about 18d. or 2s. per ounce, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, that with an expense under two shillings, a quarter of an ounce of ice, or ice-cream, may be made in every climate, and at any time, which may afford great satisfaction to those persons, who, living in those places where no natural ice is to be had, never saw or tasted any such delicious refreshment. When a small piece of ice, for instance, of about ten grains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>, is required, the necessary apparatus is very small, and the expense not worth mentioning. I have a small box four inches and a half long, two inches broad, and one and a half deep, containing all the apparatus necessary for this purpose; viz. a bottle capable of containing about one ounce of ether; two pointed tubes, in case one should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a>; a tube in which the water is to be frozen, and a wire. With the quantity of ether contained in this small and very portable apparatus, the experiment may be repeated about ten times. A person who wishes to perform such experiments in hot climates, and in places where ice is not easily procured, requires only a larger bottle of ether besides the whole apparatus described above.\" Electricity increases the cold produced by means of evaporating ether but very little, though the effect is perceptible. Having thrown the electrified and also the unelectrified stream of ether upon the bulb of a thermometer, the mercury was brought down two degrees lower in the former than in the latter case.\n\nOur author observes, for the sake of those who may be inclined to repeat this experiment, that a cork confined this volatile fluid much better than a glass stopple, which is almost impossible to grind with such exactness as to prevent entirely the evaporation of the ether. When a stopple, made very nicely out of an uniform and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> piece of cork, which goes rather tight, is put upon a bottle of ether, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> of that fluid cannot be perceived through it; but he never saw a glass stopple which could produce that effect. In this manner, ether, spirit of wine, or any other volatile fluid, may be preserved, which does not corrode cork by its fumes. When the stopple, however, is very often taken out, it becomes loose, as it will also be by long keeping: in either of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> it must be changed.\n\nBlink of the Ice, is a name given by the pilots to a bright appearance near the horizon, occasioned by the ice, and observed before the ice itself is seen.\n\nIce-Boats, boats so constructed as to sail upon ice, and which are very common in Holland, particularly upon the river Maese and the lake Y. See Plate CCLXXVIII. They go with incredible swiftness, sometimes so quick as to affect the breath, and are found very useful in conveying goods and passengers over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAKES\">lakes</a> and great rivers in that country. Boats of different sizes are placed in a transverse form upon a 2\u00bd or 3 inch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> board; at the extremity of each end are fixed irons, which turn up in the form of skids; upon this plank the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> rests, and the two ends serve as out-riggers to prevent upsetting; whence <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROPES\">ropes</a> are fastened that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the mast in the nature of throats, and others passed through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> across the bowprit; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUDDER\">rudder</a> is made somewhat like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HATCHET\">hatchet</a> with the head placed downward, which being pressed down, cuts the ice, and serves all the purposes of a rudder in the water, by enabling the helmsman to steer, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TACK\">tack</a>, &c.\n\nMethod of making Ice-Cream. Take a sufficient quantity of cream, and, when it is to be mixed with raspberry, or currant, or pine, a quarter part as much of the juice or jam, as of the cream: after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> and straining the mixture through a cloth, put it with a little juice of lemon into the mould, which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEWTER\">pewter</a> vessel, and varying in size and shape at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>; cover the mould, and place it in a pail about two-thirds full of ice, into which two handfuls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> have been thrown; turn the mould by the hand-hold with a quick motion to and fro, in the manner used for milling chocolate, for eight or ten minutes; then let it rest as long, and turn it again for the same time; and having left it to stand half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, it is fit to be turned out of the mould and to be sent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>. Lemon juice and sugar, and the juices of various kinds of fruits, are frozen without cream; and when cream is used, it should be well mixed.\n\nIce-Hills, a sort of structure or contrivance common upon the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEVA\">Neva</a> at Petersburg, and which afford a perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> of amusement to the populace. They are constructed in the following manner. A scaffolding is raised upon the river about 30 feet in height, with a landing place on the top, the ascent to which is by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LADDER\">ladder</a>. From this summit a sloping <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> of boards, about four yards broad and 30 long, descends to the superficies of the river; it is supported by strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLES\">poles</a> gradually decreasing in height, and its sides are defended by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARAPET\">parapet</a> of planks. Upon these boards are laid square masses of ice about four inches thick, which being first smoothed with the axe and laid close to each other, are then sprinkled with water; by these means they coalesce, and, adhering to the boards, immediately form an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCLINED_PLANE\">inclined plane</a> of pure ice. From the bottom of this plane the snow is cleared away for the length of 200 yards, and the breadth of four, upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of the river; and the sides of this course, as well as the sides and top of the scaffolding, are ornamented with firs and pines. Each person, being provided with\nICE\n\na fledge, mounts the ladder; and having attained the summit, he feats himself upon his fledge at the upper extremity of the inclined plane, down which he suffers it to glide with considerable rapidity, poising it as he goes down; when the velocity acquired by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> carries it above 100 yards upon the level ice of the river. At the end of this course, there is usually a similar ice-hill, nearly parallel to the former, which begins where the other ends; so that the person immediately mounts again, and in the same manner glides down the other inclined plane of ice. This diversion he repeats as often as he pleases. The boys also are continually employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SKATING\">skating</a> down these hills; they glide chiefly upon one skait, as they are able to poise themselves better upon one leg than upon two. These ice-hills exhibit a pleasing appearance upon the river, as well from the trees with which they are ornamented, as from the moving objects which at particular times of the day are defending without intermission.","sp":53,"ep":59},{"h":"JEALOUSY","t":"in Ethics, is that peculiar uneasiness which arises from the fear that some rival may rob us of the affection of one whom we greatly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> suspicion that he has already done it.

He was afterwards chosen solicitor to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>; and in 1680 was knighted, and made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHESTER\">Chester</a>.

During the reign of King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> II., he showed himself a bitter enemy to those dissenting ministers who, in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a>, were tried by him: he was one of the greatest advisers and promoters of all the oppressions and arbitrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> carried on in the reign of James II.; and his sanguinary and inhuman proceedings against Monmouth's unhappy adherents in the well <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> ever render his name infamous. Whenever the prisoner was of a different party, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> he could please the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> by condemning him, instead of appearing, according to the duty of his office, Jeffreys, as his counsel, he would scarce allow him to speak for himself; but would load him with the grossest and most vulgar abuses, browbeat, insult, and turn to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> the witnesse that spoke in his behalf; and even threaten the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a> with fines and imprisonment, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they made the least hesitation about bringing in the prisoner guilty. Yet it is said, that when he was in temper, and matters perfectly indifferent came before him, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> one became a seat of justice better. Nay, it even appears, that, when he was under no state influence, he was sometimes inclined to protect the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> and civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of mankind, of which the following instance has been given:\u2014The mayor and aldermen of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a> had been used to transport convicted criminals to the American plantations, and fell them by way of trade. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> to good account when any pilferers or petty rogues were brought before them, they threatened them with hanging; and then some officers who attended, earnestly persuaded the ignorant intimidated creatures to beg for transportation, as the only way to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> them; and in general their advice was followed. Then, without more form, each alderman in course took one, and sold him for his own benefit; and sometimes warm disputes arose between them about the next turn. This infamous trade which had been carried on many years, coming to the knowledge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> chief justice, he made the mayor descend from the bench and stand at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>, in his scarlet and fur, with his guilty brethren the aldermen, and plead as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> criminals. He then obliged them to give securities to answer informations; but the proceedings were stopped by the Revolution.\u2014However, the brutality Jeffreys commonly showed on the bench, where his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> and visage were equally terrible, at length exposed him to a severe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a>. A scrivener of Wapping having a cause before him, one of the opponent's counsel said he was a strange fellow, and sometimes went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>, and sometimes to conventicles; and it was thought he was a trimmer. At this the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> fired: \"A trimmer?\" (said he); I have heard much of that monster, but never <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> one.

But Mr Trimmer going out, gave notice that he was there; and the mob rushing in seized him, and carried him before the lord mayor, who sent him with a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> to the lords of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, by whom he was committed to the Tower, where he died in 1689.\u2014It is remarkable, that the late countess of Pomfret met with very rude insults from the populace on the western <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, only because she was granddaughter to the inhuman Jeffreys.","sp":140,"ep":140},{"h":"JEFOFAILE","t":"(compounded of three French words, \"J'<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AY\">ay</a> failli,\" \"I have failed\"), a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, used for an oversight in pleading <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> other proceeding at law.\n\nThe shewing of these defects or oversights was formerly often practised by the counsel; and when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a> came into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> in order to try the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>, they said, This inquest you ought not to take; and after verdict they would say to the court, To judgment you ought not to go.

His first publication, a poetical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> on the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DANCING\">dancing</a>, appeared without his name in 1727; but he was very soon discovered, and it was considered as a prelude of his future eminence.\n\nSoon after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of his father, he was chosen in 1742 one of the members of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of Cambridge, and from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> he retained his seat in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of commons till the year 1780. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> entertained by his constituents of his parliamentary conduct, may be learned from the unanimity of their choice; for he never but once experienced any opposition. He was chosen one of the commissioners of the board of trade and plantations in 1753, which office he retained till an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> was made in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of it by authority of parliament. He was married, first to the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> Soame, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEREHAM\">Dereham</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORFOLK\">Norfolk</a>, who died without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>, and afterwards to the daughter of Henry Gray, Esq., of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HACKNEY\">Hackney</a>, who survived him. He died himself of a fever, after a few days illness, on the 18th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>, 1787, leaving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> issue.\n\nHis temper was mild, sweet, and gentle, which he manifested indiscriminately to all. It was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> wish never to give offence to any; yet he made such liberal allowances for diversities of temper, that he was very rarely offended with others. He was punctual in the discharge of the duties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> both in public and private, professing to be better pleased with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> and discipline of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of England than of any other in Christendom, which, however, he considered as capable of important alterations and amendments, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> it were previously and deliberately determined what these alterations should be. He possessed an uncommon vein of the most lively and genuine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>, which he never made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of to wound the feelings of others, but was rather very much offended with those who did, being convinced that distinguished endowments of the mind are as much intended to promote the felicity of others, as of those who possess them.\n\nNo man was ever a more genuine philanthropist, as he felt most sensibly for the miseries of others, and used every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> in his power to render them as happy as possible. His indigent neighbours in the country he viewed as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his family, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> he considered them as entitled to his care and protection. As an author, Soame Jenyns certainly deserves a place among those who have excelled, whether we view him as a poet, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> a writer of prose, in which latter capacity he ranks with the purest and most correct writers of the English language. He reasons with closeness and precision, and comes to the conclusion he means to establish by a regular chain of argument. His first publication on account of which he was attacked, was his Free Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Evil; but in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREFACE\">preface</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> edition he fully vindicated it against all the calumny, slander, and misrepresentation which had been thrown out against it, with that temper and moderation which distinguished him so eminently upon all occasions. His view of the Internal Evidences of the Christian Religion was published without his name in the year 1776, which gave delight and satisfaction to many eminent judges, and made converts of numbers who had been infidels before.","sp":141,"ep":142},{"h":"JEPHTHAH","t":"judge of Israel, and successor to Jair in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the people, was a native of Mizpeh, and the son of one Gilead by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARLOT\">harlot</a>. This Gilead having married a lawful wife, and had children by her, these children drove Jephthah from his father's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, saying that he should not be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> with them. Jephthah retired into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a> of Tob, and there he became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a> of a band of thieves and such other people as he had picked up together. At that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, the Israelites beyond Jordan, seeing themselves preyed upon by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMONITES\">Ammonites</a>, came to desire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> from Jephthah; and that he would take upon him the command of them. Jephthah at first reproached them with the injustice which they had done him, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> at least which they had not prevented, when he was forced from his father's house. But as these people were very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> in their request, he told them, that he would succour them, provided that at the end of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> they would acknowledge him for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>. This they consented to, and promised with an oath.\n\nJephthah, in the year of the world 2817, having been acknowledged prince of the Israelites in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> of the people, was filled with the spirit of God, and began to get his troops together; to that end, he went over all the land which the children of Israel possessed beyond Jordan. At the same time he made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOW\">vow</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he were successful against the Ammonites, he would offer up for a burnt-offering whatever should first come out of his house to meet him. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> being fought, Jephthah remained conqueror, and ravaged all the land of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMON\">Ammon</a>. But as he returned to his house, his only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: whereupon Jephthah tore his clothes, and said, \"Alas, my daughter, thou hast brought me very low, for I have made a vow unto the Lord, and cannot fail in the performance of it.\" His daughter answered, \"My father,\nJephthah, if thou hast made a vow unto the Lord, do with me as thou hast promised; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> me only the favour that I may be at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to go up to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a>, and there for two months bewail my virginity with my companions.\" Jephthah granted her this liberty; and at the end of two months, he offered up his daughter, who died a virgin, a burnt-offering, agreeable to his vow, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of most commentators.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, the Ephraimites, jealous of the victory obtained by Jephthah over the Ammonites, passed the river Jordan in a tumultuous manner, came and complained to Jephthah that he had not invited them to this war, and threatened to set fire to his house. Jephthah answered them, that he had sent to desire their assistance; but observing that they did not come, he put his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> and hazarded a battle. The Ephraimites not being satisfied with these reasons, Jephthah assembled the people of Gilead, gave them battle, and defeated them; so that there were two and forty thousand men of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> of Ephraim killed that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. We know nothing more in particular concerning the life of Jephthah, only that he judged Israel five years, and was buried in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Gilead.\n\nSt Paul (Heb. xi. 32.) places Jephthah among the saints of the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, the merit of whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> distinguished them. But it must be observed, that there is something so extraordinary in Jephthah's vow, that notwithstanding the Scripture speaks of it in very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> and clear terms, yet such difficulties arise concerning it as perplex commentators. Some maintain, that this daughter of Jephthah was not sacrificed, as that would have been a violation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of Moses; and especially, when by the same law he might have redeemed his daughter for ten shekels of silver: therefore they contend, that it was something else Jephthah did to his daughter, such as devoting her to a state of celibacy, or dedicating her to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of God. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, those who maintain the affirmative, or that Jephthah's daughter was actually sacrificed, urge, that the times wherein Jephthah lived were sadly addicted to idolatry; also the manner wherein he lived before he was called to the assistance of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>; but above all, the clear, evident, and express meaning of the text. They observe, that vows of perpetual virginity are institutions of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DATE\">date</a>; and had there been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more in it, there would have been little occasion for rending his clothes, and bemoaning himself as he did; besides the bitter lamentations made by herself, and by all the daughters of Israel in succeeding times. But if she was sacrificed, we may safely and confidently aver with Josephus, who says that she was, that this sacrifice was neither lawful nor acceptable to God; but, on the contrary, an abominable crime, that might, notwithstanding, have proceeded from a mistaken principle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>.","sp":142,"ep":143},{"h":"JERBOA","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of quadruped belonging to the genus *Dipus*, and resembling in some of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a>, the mouse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a>.

He was not carried captive to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLON\">Babylon</a> with the other Jews, but remained in Judea to lament the desolation of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. He was afterwards a prisoner in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a> with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> Baruch, where it is supposed he died in a very advanced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>.

The prophet lays open the sins of Judah with great freedom and boldness, and reminds them of the severe judgments which had befallen the ten tribes for the same offences. He passionately laments their misfortune, and recommends a speedy reformation to them. Afterwards he predicts the grievous calamities that were approaching, particularly the 70 years captivity in Chaldea. He likewise foretells their deliverance and happy return, and the recompence which Babylon, Moab, and other enemies of the Jews, should meet with in due time. There are likewise several intimations in this prophecy concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> of the Messiah; also several remarkable visions, and types, and historical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> relating to those times. The 52d chapter does not belong to the prophecy of Jeremiah, but probably was added by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EZRA\">Ezra</a>, and contains a narrative of the taking of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, and of what happened during the captivity of the Jews, to the death of Jehoiachin. St Jerome has observed upon this prophet, that his style is more easy than that of Isaiah and Hosea; that he retains something of the rusticity of the village where he was born; but that he is very learned and majestic, and equal to those two prophets in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of his prophecy.","sp":143,"ep":143},{"h":"JERICHO","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Hierichus, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">Ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">Geography</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Judah; situated between Jordan and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, at the distance of 150 stadia from the latter, and 60 from the former.

It was first taken in the days of Jebooth, by Hazael the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, who slew all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, but did not destroy their city. It was afterwards taken by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEBUCHADNEZZAR\">Nebuchadnezzar</a> king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLON\">Babylon</a>, who destroyed it, and carried away the inhabitants. Seventy years after, permission was granted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYRUS\">Cyrus</a> king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a> to the Jews to rebuild their city, which was done; and it continued the capital of Judea (though frequently suffering much from the Grecian monarchs of Syria and Egypt), till the time of Vespasian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> of Rome, by whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> Titus it was totally destroyed\u2020.\u2020 See JERUSALEM. It was, however, rebuilt by Adrian; and seemed likely to have recovered its former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a>, being surrounded with walls, and adorned with several noble buildings; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> also being permitted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in it. But this was a short-lived change; so that when the empress Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, came to visit this city, she found it in the most forlorn and ruinous situation. Having formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of restoring it to its ancient lustre, she caused, with a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a>\nJerusalem deal of coft and labour; all the rubbish that had been thrown upon those places where our Saviour had suffered, been buried, &c., to be removed. In doing this, they found the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> on which he died, as well as those of the two malefactors who suffered with him; and, as the writers of those times relate, discovered by a miracle that which had borne the Saviour of mankind. She then caused a magnificent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> to be built, which inclosed as many of the scenes of our Saviour's sufferings as could conveniently be done, and adorned the city with several other buildings. The emperor Julian is said to have formed a design of rebuilding the temple of Jerusalem, and of restoring the Jewish worship. This scheme was contrived on purpose to give the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> to our Saviour's prophecy concerning the temple and city of Jerusalem; namely, that the first should be totally destroyed, without one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> being left upon another; and that Jerusalem should be trodden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> by the Gentiles till the times of the Gentiles were fulfilled. In this attempt, however, according to the accounts of the Christian writers of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, the emperor was frustrated by an earthquake and fiery eruption from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, which totally destroyed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, consumed the materials which had been collected, and killed a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of the workmen.\n\nThis event hath been the subject of much dispute. Mr Warburton, who hath published a treatise expressly on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of this fact, hath collected the following testimonies in favour of it. The first is that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMMIANUS_MARCELLINUS\">Ammianus Marcellinus</a>, who tells us, \"Julian (having been already thrice <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a>), taking Salutius, prefect of the several Gauls, for his colleague, entered a fourth time on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> magistracy; and although his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> of the many and great events which this year was likely to produce made him very anxious for the future, yet he both pushed on the various and complicated preparations for this expedition with the utmost application, and, having an eye in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, and being desirous to eternalize his reign by the greatness of his achievements, he projected to rebuild at an immense expense the proud and magnificent temple of Jerusalem; which (after many combats, attended with much bloodshed on both sides, during the siege by Vespasian) was with great difficulty taken and destroyed by Titus. He committed the conduct of this affair to Alypius of Antioch, who had formerly been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. When therefore this Alypius had set himself to the vigorous execution of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>, in which he had all the assistance that the governor of the province could afford him, horrible balls of fire breaking out near the foundations, with frequent and reiterated attacks, rendered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> from time to time inaccessible to the scorched and blasted workmen; and the victorious element continuing, in this manner, obstinately and resolutely bent, as it were, to drive them to a distance, Alypius thought best to give over the enterprise.\"\n\nThe next testimony is that of Gregory Nazianzen. Speaking of the emperor Julian, he says, \"After having run through a course of every other tyrannical experiment against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, and upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> despising all of them as trifling and contemptible, he at last brought down the whole body of the Jews upon us; whom, for their ancient turn to fictitious novelties, and an inveterate hatred of the Christian name, he chose as the fittest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> for his machinations. These, under a show of great good-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>, which hid his secret purpose, he endeavoured to convince from their sacred books and traditions, which he took upon him to interpret, that now was come the time foretold when they should return to their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, rebuild their temple, and restore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> to its ancient force and splendor. When these things had been thoroughly infamated, and heartily entertained (for deceit finds easy admittance when it flatters our passions), the Jews set upon the work of rebuilding with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, and pushed on the project with the utmost labour and application. But when, now driven from their work by a violent whirlwind and a sudden earthquake, they fled together for refuge to a certain neighbouring church (some to deprecate the impending mischief; others, as is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> in such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, to catch at any help that presents itself; and others again, enveloped in the crowd, were carried along with the body of those who fled); there are who say, the church refused them entrance; and that when they came to the doors which were wide open but a moment before, they found them on a sudden closed by a secret and invisible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>; a hand accustomed to work these wonders by the terror and confusion of the impious, and for the security and comfort of godly men. This, however, is now invariably affirmed and believed by all, that as they strove to force their way in by violence, the fire which burst from the foundations of the temple, met and stopped them. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> it burnt and destroyed, and another it desperately maimed, leaving them a living monument of God's commination and wrath against sinners. Thus the affair passed; and, let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> continue incredulous concerning this or the other miraculous works of God. But still the thing most wonderful and illustrious was, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> which appeared in the heavens, of a cross within a circle. That name and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> which impious men before esteemed so dishonourable upon earth, was now raised on high, and equally objected to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> view of all men; advanced by God himself as the trophy of his victory over unbelievers; of all trophies the most exalted and sublime. Nay further, they who were present, and partakers of the miracle we are now about to speak of, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> to this very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> the sign or figure of the cross which was then marked or impressed upon their garments. For at that time, as these men (whether such as were of us or strangers) were showing these marks, or attending to others who showed them, each presently observed the wonder, either on himself or his neighbour; having a radiant mark on his body or on his garment, in which there is something that, in art and elegance, exceeded all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EMBROIDERY\">embroidery</a>.\"\n\nNotwithstanding these testimonies, however, this fact hath been strenuously contested by others; and indeed it must be owned that the testimonies above mentioned are by no means unexceptionable. In the last, particularly, the propensity to the marvellous is so exceedingly great, that every one must at first sight be struck with it. It is true indeed, the most miraculous part of it, as it seemed to be to Gregory, namely, the appearance of crosses upon the garments and bodies of some of the people who were there, may be explained upon a natural principle; since the\nJerusalem are assured that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a> will sometimes produce effects of this kind; but even this is no decisive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the authenticity of the relation; though it cannot by any means discredit it, as some think. On the whole, however, it is not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> whether this event happened with the circumstances above mentioned or not. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> Julian did make any attempt to rebuild the temple, it is certain that something obstructed the attempt, because the temple was never actually rebuilt. If he made no such attempt, the prophecy of our Saviour still holds good; and it surely cannot be thought to detract from the merit of a prophecy, that no body ever attempted to elude it, or prove it to be a falsehood.\n\nJerusalem continued in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the eastern emperors till the reign of the caliph Omar, who reduced it under his subjection. The Saracens continued in possession of it till the year 1099, when it was taken by the Crusaders. They founded a new kingdom, of which Jerusalem was the capital, which lasted 88 years under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> kings. At last this kingdom was utterly ruined by Saladin; and though the Christians once more got possession of the city, they were again obliged to relinquish it. In 1217, the Saracens were expelled by the Turks, who have ever since continued in possession of it.\n\nThe city of Jerusalem, in its most flourishing state, was divided into four parts, each inclosed with its own walls; viz., 1. The old city of Jebus, which stood on Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZION\">Zion</a>, where the prophets dwelt, and where David built a magnificent castle and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, which became the residence both of himself and successors; on which account it was emphatically called the City of David. 2. The lower city, called also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">Daughter</a> of Zion, being built after it; on which stood the two magnificent palaces which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a> built for himself and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>; that of the Maccabean princes; and the stately <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMPHITHEATRE\">amphitheatre</a> built by Herod, capable of containing 80,000 spectators; the strong citadel, built by Antiochus, to command and overtop the temple, but afterwards razed by Simon the Maccabee; and lastly, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> citadel, built by Herod, upon a high and craggy rock, and called by him Antonia. 3. The new city, mostly inhabited by tradesmen, artificers, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERCHANTS\">merchants</a>; and, 4. Mount Moriah, on which was built the so famed temple of Solomon, described in the fifth and seventh chapters of the second book of Kings; and, since then, that rebuilt by the Jews on their return from Babylon, and afterwards built almost anew and greatly adorned and enriched by Herod.\n\nSome idea of the magnificence of this temple may be had from the following considerations. 1. That there were no less than 163,300 men employed in the work. 2. That notwithstanding that prodigious number of hands, it took up <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> whole years in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>. 3. That the height of this building was 120 cubits, or 82 yards, rather more than less; and the courts round it about half as high. 4. That the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a>, on the east side, was sustained by ramparts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> stone, of vast bulk, and built up from the valley below, which last was 300 cubits high, and being added to that of the edifice amounted to 420 cubits; to which, if we add, 5. The height of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> tower above all the rest, viz. 60, will bring it to 480 cubits, which, reckoning at two feet to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUBIT\">cubit</a>, will amount to 960 feet; but according to the length of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, as others reckon it, viz. at two feet and an half, it will amount to 1200 feet; a prodigious height thus from the ground, and such as might well make Josephus say, that the very design of it was sufficient to have turned the brain of any but Solomon. 6. The ramparts, which were raised in this manner, to fill up the prodigious chasm made by the deep valley below, and to make the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AREA\">area</a> of a sufficient breadth and length for the edifice, were 1000 cubits in length at the bottom, and 800 at the top, and the breadth of them 100 more. 7. The huge buttresses which supported the ramparts were of the same height, square at the top, and 30 cubits <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and jutted out 150 cubits at the bottom. 8. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, of which they were built, were, according to Josephus, 40 cubits <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, 12 thick, and 8 high, all of marble, and so exquisitely joined, that they seemed one continued piece, or rather polished rock. 9. According to the same Jewish historian, there were 1433 columns of Parian marble, and twice that number of pilasters; and of such thickness, that three men could hardly embrace them, and their height and capitals proportionable, and of the Corinthian order. But it is likely Josephus hath given us these two last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> from the temple of Herod, there being nothing like them mentioned by the sacred historians, but a great deal about the prodigious cedars of Lebanon used in that noble edifice, the excellent workmanship of them adapted to their several ends and designs, together with their gildings and other curious ornaments. The only thing more we shall venture to add is, what is affirmed in Scripture, that all the materials of this stupendous fabric were finished and adapted to their several ends before they were brought to Jerusalem, that is, the stones in their quarries, and the cedars in Lebanon; so that there was no noise of axe, hammer, or any tool, heard in the rearing of it.\n\nAt present Jerusalem is called by the Turks Cudjemitarie, and Cudjiberiff; and is reduced to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> thinly inhabited town, about three miles in circumference, situated on a rocky mountain, surrounded on all sides, except the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>, with steep alcants and deep valleys; and these again environed with other hills, at some distance from them. In the neighbourhood of the city there grew some corn, vines, olives, &c. The lately church erected by the empress Helena, on Mount Calvary, is still standing. It is called the church of the sepulchre; and is kept in good repair by the generous offerings of a constant concourse of pilgrims, who annually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> to it, as well as by the contributions of several Christian princes. The walls of this church are of stone, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEDAR\">cedar</a>; the east end incloses Mount Calvary, and the west the holy sepulchre; the former is covered with a noble cupola, open at top, and supported by 16 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASSIVE\">massive</a> columns. Over the high altar, at the east end, is another stately <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOME\">dome</a>. The nave of the church constitutes the choir; and in the inside alike are shown the places where the most remarkable circumstances of our Saviour's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> were transected, together with the tombs of Godfrey and Baldwin, the two first Christian kings of Jerusalem. In the chapel of the crucifixion is shown the very hole in the rock in which the cross is said to have\nJerusalem have been fixed. The altar in this chapel hath three crofes on it; and is richly adorned, particularly with four lamps of immense value that hang before it, and are kept constantly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>. At the west end is that of the sepulchre, which is hewn in that form out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> rock, and hath a small dome supported by pillars of porphyry. The cloister round the sepulchre is divided into sundry chapels, appropriated to the several sorts of Christians who reside there; as Greeks, Armenians, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARONITES\">Maronites</a>, Jacobites, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COPTS\">Copts</a>, Abyssines, Georgians, &c. and on the north-west side of it are the apartments of the Latins, who have the care of the church, and are forced to reside constantly in it; the Turks keeping the keys of it, and not suffering any of them to go out, but obliging them to receive their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> in at a wicket. At Easter there are some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> ceremonies performed in the church, representing our Lord's passion, crucifixion, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESURRECTION\">resurrection</a>, at which a vast concourse of pilgrims <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> assist. For a particular account of them, we refer the reader to Doctors Shaw and Pococke.\n\nOn Mount Moriah, on the south-east part of the city, is an edifice called Solomon's Temple, standing on or near the same spot as the ancient; but when or by whom erected is uncertain. In the midst of it is a Turkish mosque, where the Jewish sanctum sanctorum is supposed to have stood. The building, which Dr Pococke thinks must have been formerly a Christian church, is held in the utmost veneration by the Turks.\n\nThe city is now under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of a fanatic, who resides in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> said to have been that of Pontius Pilate, over-against the castle of Antonia built by Herod the Great. Many of the churches erected in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of some remarkable gospel transaction, have been since converted into mosques; into some of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> will procure admittance, but not into others. Both the friars and other Christians are kept so poor by the tyranny of the government, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> support and trade of the place consists in providing strangers with food and other accommodations, and selling them beads, relics, and other trinkets, for which they are obliged to pay considerable sums to the fanatic, as well as to his officers; and those are seldom too well contented with their usual duties, but they frequently extort some fresh ones, especially from the Franciscans, whose convent is the common receptacle for all pilgrims, and for which they have considerable allowances from the pope, and other crowned heads, besides the presents which strangers generally make them at their departure. The most remarkable antiquities in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem are, 1. The pools of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BETHESDA\">Bethesda</a> and Gihon; the former 120 paces long, 40 broad, and at least eight deep, but now without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; and the old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a>, which it still discovers at the west end, are quite dammed up: the other, which is about a quarter of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> without Bethlehem-gate, is a very stately edifice, 126 paces long, and 65 broad, lined with a wall and platter, and still well stored with water. 2. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a> of the Virgin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, in the valley of Jehoshaphat, into which one descends by a magnificent flight of 47 steps. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> hand as one goes down, is also the sepulchre of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANN\">Ann</a> the mother, and on the left that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a> the husband, of the virgin-mother; some add likewise that of Jehoia-Jerusalem, him her father. In all these are erected altars for priests of all sorts to say <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, and the whole is cut into the solid rock. 3. The tomb of King Jehoshaphat, cut likewise into the rock, and divided into several apartments; in one of which is his tomb, which is adorned with a flatly portico and entablature over it. 4. That commonly called Absalom's pillar or place, as being generally supposed to be that which he is said to have erected in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>-time to perpetuate his memory, as he had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>. The place, however, both within and without, hath more the resemblance of a sepulchre than any thing else; though we do not read that he was buried there, neither do the people here affirm that he was. There is a great heap of stones about it, which is continually increasing; the superstitious Jews and Turks always throwing some as they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a>, in token of their abhorrence of Absalom's unnatural rebellion against so good and holy a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a>. The structure itself is about 20 cubits square, and 60 high, rising in a lofty square, adorned below with four columns of the Ionic order, with their capitals, entablatures, &c. to each front. From the height of 20 to 40 cubits, it is somewhat less, and quite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, excepting a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILLET\">fillet</a> at the upper end; and from 40 to the top it changes into a round, which grows gradually into a point, the whole cut out of the solid rock. There is a room within, considerably higher than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the ground without, on the sides of which are niches, probably to receive coffins. 5. A little eastward of this is that called the tomb of Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, whom the Jews slew between the temple and the altar, as is commonly supposed. This fabric is all cut out of the natural rock, 18 feet high, and as many square; and adorned with Ionic columns on each front, cut out likewise of the same rock, and supporting a cornice. The whole ends in a pointed top, like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIAMOND\">diamond</a>. But the most curious, grand, and elaborate pieces, in this kind, are the grotts without the walls of Jerusalem, styled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> sepulchres; but of what kings is not agreed on. They consist of a great number of apartments, some of them spacious, all cut out of the solid marble rock; and may justly be pronounced a royal work, and one of the most noble, surprising, and magnificent. For a particular account of them we must refer the reader, for want of room, to Pococke's Travels. In the neighbourhood of Jerusalem is a spot of ground, about 30 yards long and 15 broad, now the burying-place of the Armenians, which is known as the Accidama, or Field of Blood, formerly the Potters Field, and since styled Campo Santo, or the Holy Field, purchased with the price of Judas's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a>, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BURIAL\">burial</a> of strangers. It is walled round, to prevent the Turks abusing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> of Christians; and one half of it is taken up by a building in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARNEL\">charnel</a> house. Besides the above, a great many other antiquities in the city and its environs are shown to strangers; there being scarce any place or transaction mentioned either in the Old or New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, but they show the very spot of ground where the one stood, and the other was done; not only here, but all over Judea.","sp":148,"ep":151},{"h":"JESTING","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> concise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>, as distinguished from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> wit or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>, lies either in the thought, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, or both.

See IGNATIUS.\u2014The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> which this fantastic formed of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> and laws was suggested, as he gave out, and as his followers still teach, by the immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPIRATION\">inspiration</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>. But notwithstanding this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> pretension, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> met at first with violent opposition. The pope, to whom Loyola had applied for the sanction of his authority to confirm the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a>, referred his petition to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> of cardinals. They represented the establishment to be unnecessary as well as dangerous, and Paul refused to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> his approbation of it. At last, Loyola removed all his scruples by an offer which was impossible for any pope to refuse. He proposed, that besides the three vows of poverty, of chastity, and of monastic obedience, which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to all the orders of regulars, the members of his society should take a fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VOW\">vow</a> of obedience to the pope, binding themselves to go whithersoever he should command for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, and without requiring anything from the holy see for their support. At a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> when the papal authority had received such a shock by the revolt of so many nations from the Roman church; at a time when every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the papal system was attacked with so much violence and success, the acquisition of a body of men, thus peculiarly devoted to the see of Rome, and whom it might set in opposition to all its enemies, was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>. Paul instantly perceiving this, confirmed the institution of the Jesuits by his bull, granted the most ample privileges to the members of the society, and appointed Loyola to be the first general of the order. The event hath fully justified Paul's discernment, in expecting such beneficial consequences to the see of Rome from this institution. In less than half a century, the society obtained establishments in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> that adhered to the Roman catholic church; its power and wealth increased amazingly; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of its members became great; their character as well as accomplishments were still greater; and the Jesuits were celebrated by\n\nThe friends and dreaded by the enemies of the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> as the most able and enterprising order in the church.\n\nThe constitution and laws of the society were perfected by Laynez and Aquaviva, the two generals who succeeded Loyola; men far superior to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> in abilities and in the science of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>. They framed that system of profound and artful policy which distinguishes the order. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> infusion of fanaticism mingled with its regulation should be imputed to Loyola its founder. Many circumstances concurred in giving a peculiarity of character to the order of Jesuits, and in forming the members of it not only to take greater part in the affairs of the world than any other body of monks, but to acquire superior influence in the conduct of them.\n\nThe primary object of almost all the monastic orders is to separate men from the world, and from any concern in its affairs. In the solitude and silence of the cloister, the monk is called to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> out his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SALVATION\">salvation</a> by extraordinary acts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTIFICATION\">mortification</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a>. He is dead to the world, and ought not to mingle in its transactions. He can be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> benefit to mankind but by his example and by his prayers. On the contrary, the Jesuits are taught to consider themselves as formed for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>. They are chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a>, bound to exert themselves continually in the service of God, and of the pope his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-VICAR\">vicar</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. Whatever tends to instruct the ignorant, whatever can be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> to reclaim or to oppose the enemies of the holy see, is their proper object. That they may have full leisure for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> service, they are totally exempted from those functions the performance of which is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> business of other monks. They appear in no processions; they practise no rigorous austerities; they do not consume one half of their time in the repetition of tedious offices; but they are required to attend to all the transactions of the world, on account of the influence which these may have upon religion; they are directed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> the dispositions of persons in high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, and to cultivate their friendships; and by the very constitution as well as genius of the order, a spirit of action and intrigue is infused into all its members.\n\nAs the object of the society of Jesuits differed from that of the other monastic orders, the diversity was no less in the form of its government. The other orders are to be considered as voluntary associations, in which whatever affects the whole body is regulated by the common suffrage of all its members. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXECUTIVE_POWER\">executive power</a> is vested in the person placed at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of each convent or of the whole society; the legislative authority resides in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>. Affairs of moment, relating to particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-CONVENTS\">convents</a>, are determined in conventual chapters; such as respect the whole order are considered in general congregations. But Loyola, full of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of implicit obedience, which he had derived from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> profession, appointed that the government of his order should be purely monarchical. A general, chosen for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> by deputies from the several provinces, possessed power that was supreme and independent, extending to every person and to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a>. He, by his sole authority, nominated provincials, rectors, and every other officer employed in the government of the society, and could remove them\nthem at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. In him was vested the sovereign administration of the revenues and funds of the order. Every member belonging to it was at his disposal; and by his uncontrollable mandate he could impose on them any task, or employ them in what service forever he pleased. To his commands they were required to yield not only outward obedience, but to resign up to him the inclinations of their own wills and the feitiments of their own understandings. They were to listen to his injunctions as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they had been uttered by Christ himself. Under his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> they were to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a> instruments, like clay in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the potter, or like dead carcases incapable of resistance. Such a singular form of policy could not fail to impress its character on all the members of the order, and to give a peculiar force to all its operations. There is not in the annals of mankind any example of such a perfect despotism, exercised not over monks shut up in the cells of a convent, but over men dispersed among all the nations of the earth.\n\nAs the constitutions of the order vest in the general such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> dominion over all its members, they carefully provide for his being perfectly informed with respect to the character and abilities of his subjects. Every novice who offers himself as a candidate for entering into the order is obliged to manifest his con- science to the superior, or a person appointed by him; and is required to confess not only his sins and defects, but to discover the inclinations, the passions, and the bent of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>. This manifestation must be renewed every six months. The society, not satisfied with penetrating in this manner into the innermost recesses of the heart, directs each member to observe the words and actions of the novices: they are constituted spies upon their conduct, and are bound to disclose everything of importance concerning them to the superior. In order that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SCRUTINY\">scrutiny</a> into their character may be as complete as possible, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> noviciate must expire, during which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASS\">pass</a> through the several gradations of ranks in the society; and they must have attained the full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of thirty-three years before they can be admitted to take the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> vows, by which they become professed members. By these various methods, the superiors, under whose immediate inspection the novices are placed, acquire a thorough knowledge of their dispositions and talents. In order that the general, who is the soul that animates and moves the whole society, may have under his eye every thing necessary to inform or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> him, the provincials and heads of the several houses are obliged to transmit to him regular and frequent reports concerning the members under their inspection. In these they descend into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> details with respect to the character of each person, his abilities <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> or acquired, his temper, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> in affairs, and the particular department for which he is best fitted. These reports, when digested and arranged, are entered into registers kept for purpose, that the general may, at one comprehensive view, survey the state of the society in every corner of the earth; observe the qualifications and talents of its members; and thus choose, with perfect information, the instruments which his absolute power can employ in any service for which he thinks meet to assign them.\n\nAs it was the professed intention of the order of Jesuits to labour with unwearied zeal in promoting the salvation of men, this engaged them of course in many active functions. From their first institution, they considered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> of youth as their peculiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a>; they aimed at being spiritual guides and the power confessors; they preached frequently in order to instruct the people; they set out as missionaries to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the unbeliefing nations. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> of the institution, as well as the singularity of his objects, procured the order many admirers and patrons. The governors of the society had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> to avail themselves of every circumstance in its favour; and in a short time the number as well as influence of its members increased wonderfully. Before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPIRATION\">expiration</a> of the sixteenth century, the Jesuits had obtained the chief direction of the education of youth in every catholic country in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. They had become the confessors of almost all its monarchs; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of no small importance in any reign, but, under a weak <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, inferior even to that of minister. They were the spiritual guides of almost every person eminent for rank or power. They possessed the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of confidence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> with the papal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, as the most zealous and able champions for its authority. The advantages which an active and enterprising body of men might derive from all these circumstances are obvious. They formed the minds of men in their youth. They retained an ascendancy over them in their advanced years. They possessed, at different periods, the direction of the most considerable courts in Europe. They mingled in all affairs. They took part in every intrigue and revolution. The general, by means of the extensive intelligence which he received, could regulate the operations of the order with the most perfect discernment; and, by means of his absolute power, could carry them on with the utmost vigour and effect.\n\nTogether with the power of the order, its wealth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to increase. Various expedients were devised for evading the obligation of the vow of poverty. The order acquired ample possessions in every catholic country; and by the number as well as magnificence of its public buildings, together with the value of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, moveable or real, it vied with the most opulent of the monastic fraternities. Besides the sources of wealth common to all the regular clergy, the Jesuits possessed one which was peculiar to themselves. Under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRETEXT\">pretext</a> of promoting the success of their missions, and of facilitating the support of their missionaries, they obtained a special licence from the court of Rome to trade with the nations which they laboured to convert. In consequence of this, they engaged in an extensive and lucrative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> both in the East and West Indies. They opened warehouses in different parts of Europe, in which they vend their commodities. Not satisfied with trade alone, they imitated the example of other commercial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>, and aimed at obtaining settlements. They acquired possession accordingly of a large and fertile province in the southern continent of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, and reigned as sovereigns over some hundred thousand subjects.\n\nUnhappily for mankind, the vast influence which permitted the order of Jesuits acquired by all these different effects, has been often exerted with the most pernicious effect. Such was the tendency of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> observed by the society in forming its members, and such\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> maxims in its constitution, that every Jesuit was taught to regard the interest of the order as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> object to which every consideration was to be sacrificed. This spirit of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> to their order, the most ardent perhaps that ever influenced any body of men, is the characteristic principle of the Jesuits, and serves as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KEY\">key</a> to the genius of their policy as well as the peculiarities in their sentiments and conduct.\n\nAs it was for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> and advantage of the society that its members should possess an ascendant over persons in high rank or of great power; the desire of acquiring and preserving such a direction of their conduct with greater facility has led the Jesuits to propagate a system of relaxed and plaint morality, which accommodates itself to the passions of men, which justifies their vices, which tolerates their imperfections, which authorizes almost every action that the most audacious or crafty politician would wish to perpetrate.\n\nAs the prosperity of the order was intimately connected with the preservation of the papal authority, the Jesuits, influenced by the same principle of attachment to the interests of their society, have been the most zealous patrons of those doctrines which tend to exalt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> power on the ruins of civil government. They have attributed to the court of Rome a jurisdiction as extensive and absolute as was claimed by the most presumptuous pontiffs in the dark ages. They have contended for the entire independence of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ECCLESIASTICS\">ecclesiastics</a> on the civil magistrates. They have published such tenets concerning the duty of opposing princes who were enemies of the Catholic faith, as countenanced the most atrocious crimes, and tended to dissolve all the ties which connect subjects with their rulers.\n\nAs the order derived both reputation and authority from the zeal with which it stood forth in defense of the Roman church against the attacks of the reformers, its members, proud of this distinction, have considered it as their peculiar function to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMBAT\">combat</a> the opinions and to check the progress of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROTESTANTS\">Protestants</a>. They have made use of every art, and have employed every weapon against them. They have set themselves in opposition to every gentler or tolerating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> in their favour. They have incessantly stirred up against them all the rage of ecclesiastical and civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a>.\n\nMonks of other denominations have indeed ventured to teach the same pernicious doctrines, and have held opinions equally inconsistent with the order and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of civil society. But they, from reasons which are obvious, have either delivered such opinions with greater reserve, or have propagated them with less success. Whoever recollects the events which have happened in Europe during two centuries, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> find that the Jesuits may justly be considered as responsible for most of the pernicious effects arising from that corrupt and dangerous causality, from those extravagant tenets concerning ecclesiastical power, and from that intolerant spirit, which have been the disgrace of the church of Rome throughout that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, and which have brought so many calamities upon civil society.\n\nBut, amidst many bad consequences flowing from the institution of this order, mankind, it must be acknowledged, have derived from it some considerable advantages. As the Jesuits made the education of youth one of their capital objects, and as their first attempts to establish colleges for the reception of ill-educated youth were violently opposed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> in different countries, it became necessary for them, as the most effectual method of acquiring the public favour, to surpass their rivals in science and industry. This prompted them to cultivate the study of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> literature with extraordinary ardour. This put them upon various methods for facilitating the instruction of youth; and, by the improvements which they made in it, they have contributed so much towards the progress of polite learning, that on this account they have merited well of society. Nor has the order of Jesuits been successful only in teaching the elements of literature; it has produced likewise eminent matters in many branches of science, and can alone boast of a greater number of ingenious authors than all the other religious fraternities taken together.\n\nBut it is in the new world that the Jesuits have exhibited the most wonderful display of their abilities, and have contributed most effectually to the benefit of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a>. The conquerors of that unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the globe had nothing in view but to plunder, to enslave, and to exterminate its inhabitants. The Jesuits alone have made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> the object of their settling there. About the beginning of the 17th century, they obtained admission into the fertile province of Paraguay, which stretches across the southern continent of America, from the bottom of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> of Potosi to the confines of the Spanish and Portuguese settlements on the banks of the river De la Plata. They found the inhabitants in a state little different from that which takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> among men when they first begin to unite together; strangers to the arts, subsisting precariously by hunting or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a>, and hardly acquainted with the first principles of labor, ordination, and government. The Jesuits set themselves to instruct and to civilize these savages. They taught them to cultivate the ground, to rear tame animals, and to build houses. They brought them to live together in villages. They trained them to arts and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MANUFACTURES\">manufactures</a>. They made them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> the sweets of society, and accustomed them to the blessings of security and order. These people became the subjects of their benefactors, who have governed them with a tender <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, resembling that with which a father directs his children. Respected and beloved almost to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a>, a few Jesuits presided over some hundred thousand Indians. They maintained a perfect equality among all the members of the community. Each of them was obliged to labour, not for himself alone, but for the public. The produce of their fields, together with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of their industry of every species, were deposited in common storehouses, from which each individual received everything necessary for the supply of his wants. By this institution, almost all the passions which disturb the peace of society, and render the members of it unhappy, were extinguished. A few magistrates, chosen by the Indians themselves, watched over the public tranquility, and secured obedience to the laws. The languishing punishments frequent under other governments were unknown. An admonition\nadmonition from a Jesuit, a slight mark of infamy, or on some singular occasion, a few lashes with a whip, were sufficient to maintain good order among these innocent and happy people.\n\nBut even in this meritorious effort of the Jesuits for the good of mankind, the genius and spirit of their order have mingled and are discernible. They plainly aimed at establishing in Paraguay an independent empire, subject to the society alone, and which, by the superior excellence of its constitution and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a>, could scarcely have failed to extend its dominion over all the southern continent of America. With this view, in order to prevent the Spaniards or Portuguese in the adjacent settlements from acquiring any dangerous influence over the people within the limits of the province subject to the society, the Jesuits endeavoured to inspire the Indians with hatred and contempt of these nations. They cut off all intercourse between their subjects and the Spanish or Portuguese settlements. They prohibited any private trader of either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> from entering their territories. When they were obliged to admit any person in a public character from the neighbouring governments, they did not permit him to have any conversation with their subjects; and no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> was allowed even to enter the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> where these strangers resided unless in the presence of a Jesuit. In order to render any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> between them as difficult as possible, they industriously avoided giving the Indians any knowledge of the Spanish or of any other European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>; but encouraged the different tribes which they had civilized to acquire a certain dialect of the Indian tongue, and laboured to make that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> language throughout their dominions. As all these precautions, without military force, would have been insufficient to have rendered their empire secure and permanent, they instructed their subjects in the European arts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>. They formed them into bodies of cavalry and infantry, completely armed and regularly disciplined. They provided a great train of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>, as well as magazines stored with all the implements of war. Thus they established an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> so numerous and well-appointed, as to be formidable in a country where a few sickly and ill-disciplined battalions composed all the military force kept on foot by the Spaniards or Portuguese.\n\nSuch were the laws, the policy, and the genius of this formidable order; of which, however, a perfect knowledge has only been attainable of late. Europe had observed, for two centuries, the ambition and power of the order. But while it felt many fatal effects of these, it could not fully discern the causes to which they were to be imputed. It was unacquainted with many of the singular regulations in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> constitution or government of the Jesuits, which formed the enterprising spirit of intrigue that distinguished its members, and elevated the body itself to such a height of power. It was a fundamental maxim with the Jesuits, from their first institution, not to publish the rules of their order. These they kept concealed as an impenetrable mystery. They never communicated them to strangers, nor even to the greater part of their own members. They refused to produce them when required by courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>; and, by a strange solemnity in policy, the civil power in different countries authorized or connived at the establishment of an order of men, whose constitution and laws were concealed with a solicitude which alone was a good reason for having excluded them. During the prosecutions lately carried on against them in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a> and France, the Jesuits have been so inconsiderate as to produce the mysterious volumes of their institute. By the aid of these authentic records, the principles of their government may be delineated, and the sources of their power investigated, with a degree of certainty and precision, which, previous to that event, it was impossible to attain.\n\nThe pernicious effects, however, of the spirit and constitution of this order, rendered it early obnoxious to some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> powers in Europe, and gradually brought on its downfall.

The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of his birth was Bethlehem, a flourishing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of Judah; but the year in which he was born is not precisely ascertained. The most general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> is that it happened about the year of Rome 748 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 749, and about 18 months before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Herod. Four inspired writers have transmitted to us an account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ. They mention particularly his birth, lineage, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, and parents; but say very little concerning his infancy and earlier youth. Herod being informed that the Messiah, or king of the Jews, so much spoken of by the prophets, was now born, being afraid that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> should now be taken away, contrived how to destroy his supposed rival: but Christ, being carried, while very young, into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, escaped the cruelty of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>; who, being determined to make sure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, made a general massacre of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> about Bethlehem, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of two years and under.\n\nAfter the death of Herod, our Saviour was brought back to Jud\u00e6a; but we are totally ignorant of what his employment was during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between his return thither and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of his entering upon the ministry. We know only, that when he was but 12 years of age, he disputed in the temple with the most learned of the Jewish doctors; whom he surprised with his knowledge, and the answers he gave to their questions. After this, as the scripture tells us, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>...\ncontinued with his parents, and was subject to them, till he entered upon his ministry. It is said, indeed, though upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> sure foundation, that during this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> he followed the trade of his father, who was a carpenter. In the 30th year of his age, he began his public ministry; to which, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the people was drawn by the preaching of John, a prophet miraculously inspired of God to proclaim the excellency of the Saviour, as now descended upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and visible to the eyes of all; and by this prophet Christ himself was baptized in the waters of Jordan, that he might not, in any point, neglect to answer the demands of the Jewish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>.\n\nIt is not necessary here to enter into a particular detail of the life and actions of Jesus Christ. Every one knows, that his life was one continued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of the most perfect sanctity, and the purest and most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>; not only without spot, but also beyond the reach of suspicion. And it is also well known, that by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MIRACLES\">miracles</a> of the most stupendous kind, and not more stupendous than salutary and beneficent, he displayed to the universe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> which he brought with him from above, and demonstrated the reality of his divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> in the most illustrious manner. For the propagation of his religion through the country of Judea, our Saviour chose 12 apostles; whom, however, he sent out only once, and after their return kept them constantly about his person. But, besides these, he chose other 70, whom he dispersed throughout the country.\n\nThere have been many conjectures concerning the reason why the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of apostles was fixed at 12, and that of the other teachers at 70. The first, however, was, according to our Saviour's own words (Matt. xix. 28), an allusion to the 12 tribes of Israel, thereby intimating that he was the king of these 12 tribes; and as the number of his other messengers answers evidently to that of the senators who composed the Sanhedrim, there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> in the conjecture of those who think that Christ by this number designed to admonish the Jews, that the authority of their Sanhedrim was now at an end, and that all power with respect to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> matters was vested in him alone. His ministry, however, was confined to the Jews; nor, while he remained upon earth, did he permit his apostles or disciples to extend their labours beyond this favoured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a>. At the same time, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> we consider the illustrious acts of mercy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> that were performed by Christ, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to conclude, that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> must soon have spread abroad in other countries. Indeed this seems probable from a passage in scripture, where we are told that some Greeks applied to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APOSTLE\">apostle</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> in order to see Jesus. We learn also from authors of no small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, that Abgarus* king of Edessa, being seized with a severe and dangerous illness, wrote to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>, imploring his affiance; and that Jesus not only sent him a gracious answer, but also accompanied it with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a>, as a mark of his esteem for that pious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>. These letters are still extant; but by the judicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of mankind are universally looked upon as spurious; and indeed the late Mr Jones, in his treatise entitled A new and full method of settling the canonical authority of the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, hath offered\n\n* See Abgarus.\n\nrelations which seem almost unanswerable against the authenticity of the whole transaction.\n\nThe preaching of our Saviour, and the numberless miracles he performed, made such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on the body of the Jewish nation, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> priests and leading men, jealous of his authority, and provoked at his reproaching them with their wicked lives, formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> against him. For a considerable time their designs proved abortive; but at last Jesus, knowing that he had fulfilled every purpose for which he came into the world, suffered himself to be taken through the treachery of one of his disciples, named Judas Iscariot, and was brought before the Sanhedrim. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> he was accused of blasphemy; and being afterwards brought before Pilate the Roman governor, where he was accused of sedition, Pilate was no sooner set <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to judge in this cause, than he received a message from his wife, deliring him to have nothing to do with the affair, having that very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a> had a frightful dream on account of our Saviour, whom she called that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>. The governor, intimidated by this message, and filled more by the majesty of our Saviour himself, and the evident falsehood of the accusations brought against him, was determined if possible to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> him. But the clamours of an enraged populace, who at last threatened to accuse Pilate himself as a traitor to the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>, got the better of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, which indeed on other occasions was not very fervent.\n\nOur Saviour was now condemned by his judge, though contrary to the plainest dictates of reason and justice; was executed on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> between two thieves, and very soon expired. Having continued three days in a state of death, he rose from the dead, and made himself visible to his disciples as formerly. He conversed with them 40 days after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESURRECTION\">resurrection</a>, and employed himself during that time in instructing them more fully concerning the nature of his kingdom; and having manifested the certainty of his resurrection to as many witnesses as he thought proper, he was, in the presence of many of his disciples, taken up into heaven, there to remain till the end of the world.

However, this did not procure his safety; for he was obliged to fly, and after encountering many difficulties, arrived at Frankfort, in the 2d year of Queen Mary's reign, where he made a public recantation of his subscription to the Popish doctrines. Thence he went to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STRASBOURG\">Strasbourg</a>, and afterwards to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZURICH\">Zurich</a>, where he attended Peter Martyr, in whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> he resided. He returned to England in 1558, after Queen Mary's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; and in 1559, was consecrated bishop of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALISBURY\">Salisbury</a>. This promotion was given him as a reward for his great merit and learning; and another attestation of these was given him by the university of Oxford, who, in 1565, conferred on him in his absence the degree of D.D. In this character he attended the queen to Oxford the following year, and presided at the divinity disputations held before her majesty on that occasion. He had before greatly distinguished himself by a sermon preached at St Paul's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>, presently after he was made a bishop, wherein he gave a public challenge to all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMAN_CATHOLICS\">Roman catholics</a> in the world, to produce but one clear and evident testimony out of any father or famous writer, who flourished within 600 years after Christ, for any one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> which the Romanists maintain against the church of England; and two years afterwards, he published his famous apology for this church. In the meantime, he gave a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a>; where he began in his first visitation, and perfected in his last, such a reformation, not only in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a> and parochial churches, but in all the churches of his jurisdiction, as procured him and the whole order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BISHOPS\">bishops</a> due reverence and esteem. For he was a careful overseer and strict observer, not only of all the flocks, but also of the pastors, in his diocese; and he watched so narrowly upon the proceedings of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> and archdeacons, and of his stewards and receivers, that they had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> opportunities of being guilty of oppression, injustice, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTORTION\">extortion</a>, nor of being a burden to the people, or a scandal to himself. To prevent these and the like abuses, for which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> courts are often too justly censured, he sat often in his consistory-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> that all things were carried rightly there: he also sat often as assitant on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENCH\">bench</a> of civil <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, being himself a justice of the peace. Amidst these employments, however, the care of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> was too much neglected; to which, indeed, his general course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> was totally unfavourable.

After dinner, his doors and ears were open to all suitors; and it was observed of him, as of Titus, that he never sent any fad from him. Suitors being thus disinfected, he heard, with great impartiality and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>, such causes debated before him, as either devolved to him as a judge, or were referred to him as an arbitrator; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> he could spare any time from these, he reckoned it as clear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>. About <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> at night he called all his servants to an account how they had spent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and he went to prayers with them.

This watchful and laborious life, without any recreation at all, except what his necessary refreshment at meals and a very few hours of rest afforded him, wasted his life too fast. He died at Monkton-Farley, in 1571, in the 5th year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. He wrote, 1. A view of a seditious bull sent into England by Pope Pius V. in 1569. 2. A treatise on the Holy Scriptures. 3. An exposition of St Paul's two epistles to the Thessalonians. 4. A treatise on the sacrament. 5. An apology for the national church. 6. Several sermons, controversial treatises, and other works.\n\n\"This excellent prelate (says the Rev.

His admirable Apology was translated from the Latin by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> of the four learned daughters of Sir Anthony <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COKE\">Coke</a>, and mother of Sir Francis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACON\">Bacon</a>. It was published, as it came from her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a>, in 1564, with the approbation of the queen and the prelates. The same Apology was printed in Greek at Constantinople, under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of St Cyril the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRIARCH\">patriarch</a>. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">Defence</a> of his Apology, against Hardwicke and other Popish divines, was in such esteem, that Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>, King James I, King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I, and four successive archbishops, ordered it to be kept chained in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> churches for public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>.\"\n\nJewel Blocks, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, a name given to two small blocks which are suspended at the extremity of the main and fore top-tail yards, by means of an eye-bolt driven from without into the middle of the yard-arm, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to its axis. The use of these blocks is, to retain the upper part of the top-mast fludding-falls beyond the skirts of the top-tails, so that each of those falls may have its full force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, which would be diminished by the encroachment of the other over its surface.

Here the kingdom of Israel had an end after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of 253 years.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYRUS\">Cyrus</a> the Great, king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, having conquered Cyrus published Babylon and almost all the western parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, perceiving a de-ceiving the defolate and ruinous condition in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of Palestine lay, formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of re- storing the Jews to their native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, and permitting them to rebuild Jerusalem and re-establish their worship. For this purpose he issued out a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> in the first year of his reign, about 536 B.C., by which they were allowed not only to return and rebuild their city, but to carry along with them all the sacred vessels which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NEBUCHADNEZZAR\">Nebuchadnezzar</a> had carried off, and engaged to defray the expense of building the temple himself. This offer was gladly embraced by the more zealous Jews of the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Levi; but many more, being no doubt less sanguine about their religion, chose to stay where they were.\n\nIn 534 B.C. the foundations of the temple were laid, and matters seemed to go on prosperously, when the undertaking was suddenly obstructed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SAMARITANS\">Samaritans</a>. They came at first expressing an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> desire to assist in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, as they worshipped the same God with the Jews; but the latter refused their assistance, as they knew they were not true Israelites, but the descendants of those heathens who had been transplanted into the country of the ten tribes after their captivity by Shalmanezer. This refusal proved the source of all that bitter enmity which afterwards took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> between the Jews and Samaritans; and the immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> was, that the latter made all the opposition in their power to the going on of the work. At last, however, all obstacles were surmounted, and the temple finished as related in the &c. books of Ezra and Nehemiah. The last of these chiefs died about 429 B.C., after having restored the Jewish worship to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> purity, and reformed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of abuses which took place immediately on its commencement.\n\nBut though the Jews were now restored to the free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of religion, they were neither a free nor a powerful people as they had formerly been. They were few in number, and their country only a province of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, subject to the kings of Persia.\nSyrian governors conferred the administration of affairs upon the high-priests; and their accepting this office, and thus deviating from the law of Moses, must be considered as one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> causes of the misfortunes which immediately befell the people, because it made room for a set of men, who aspired at this high office merely through ambition or avarice, without either zeal for religion or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> for their country.\n\nIt besides made the high-priesthood capable of being disposed of at the pleasure of the governors, whereas the Mosaic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> had fixed it unalienably in the family of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AARON\">Aaron</a>.\u2014Of the bad effects of this practice a fatal instance happened in 373 B.C. Bagofes, governor of Syria, having contracted an intimate friendship with Jehuah the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> of Johanan the high-priest, promised to raise him to the pontifical office a few years after his brother had been invested with it. Jehuah came immediately to Jerusalem, and acquainted his brother with it. Their interview happened in the inner court of the temple; and a scuffle ensuing, Jehuah was killed by his brother, and the temple thus polluted in the most scandalous manner. The consequence to the Jews was, that a heavy fine was laid on the temple, which was not taken off till seven years after.\n\nThe first public calamity which befell the Jewish nation after their restoration from Babylon, happened in the year 351 B.C.: for having some how or other displeased <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DARIUS\">Darius</a> Ochus king of Persia, he besieged and took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERICHO\">Jericho</a>, and carried off all the inhabitants captives. From this time they continued faithful to the Persians, infomuch that they had almost drawn upon themselves the displeasure of Alexander the Great. That monarch having resolved upon the siege of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRE\">Tyre</a>, and being informed that the city was wholly supplied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> from Judea, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAMARIA\">Samaria</a>, and Galilee, sent to Jaddua, then high-priest, to demand of him that supply which he had been accustomed to pay to the Persians. The Jewish pontiff excused himself on account of his oath of fidelity to Darius; which provoked Alexander, that he had no sooner completed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of Tyre than he marched against Jerusalem. The inhabitants, then, being with good reason thrown into the utmost consternation, had recourse to prayers; and Jaddua is said, by a divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a>, to have been commanded to go and meet Alexander. He obeyed accordingly, and set out on his journey, drest in his pontifical robes, at the head of all his priests in their proper habits, and attended by the rest of the people drest in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> garments. Alexander is said to have been seized with such awful respect on seeing this venerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESSION\">procession</a>, that he embraced the high-priest, and paid a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADORATION\">adoration</a> to the name of God engraven on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of his mitre. His followers being surprized at this unexpected behaviour, the Macedonian monarch informed them, that he paid that respect not to the priest, but to his God, as an acknowledgment for a vision which he had been favoured with at Dia; where he had been promised the conquest of Persia, and encouraged in his expedition, by a person of much the same aspect and drest in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> with the pontiff before him. He afterwards accompanied Jaddua into Jerusalem, where he offered sacrifices in the temple. The high-priest showed him also the prophecies of Daniel, wherein the destruction of the Persian empire by himself is plainly set forth; in consequence of which the king went away highly satisfied, and at his departure asked the high-priest if there was nothing in which he could gratify himself or his people? Jaddua then told him, that according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSAIC_LAW\">Mosaic law</a>, they neither sowed nor ploughed on the seventh year; therefore would esteem it an high favour if the king would be pleased to remit their tribute in that year. To this request the king readily yielded; and having confirmed them in the enjoyment of all their privileges, particularly that of living under their own laws, he departed.\n\nWhether this story deserves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> or not (for the whole transaction is not without reason called in question by some), it is certain that the Jews were much favoured by Alexander; but with him their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> seemed also to expire. The country of Judea, being situated between Syria and Egypt, became subject to the Jews after all the revolutions and wars which the ambitious successors of Alexander waged against each other.\n\nAt first it was given, together with Syria and Phoenicia to Leomedon the Mitlenian, one of Alexander's generals, but he being soon after stripped of the other two by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a>, Judea was next summoned to yield to the conqueror. The Jews scrupled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> their oath of fidelity to Leomedon; and were of consequence invaded by Ptolemy at the head of a powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>. The open country was easily reduced; but the city being strongly fortified both by art and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, threatened a strong resistance. A superstitious fear for breaking the Sabbath, however, prevented the besieged from making any defence on that day; of which Ptolemy being informed, he caused an assault to be made on the Sabbath, and easily carried the place. At first he treated them with great severity, and carried 100,000 men of them into captivity; but reflecting soon after on their known fidelity to their conquerors, he restored them to all the privileges they had enjoyed under the Macedonians. Of the captives he put some into garrisons, and others he settled in the countries of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBYA\">Libya</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CYRENE\">Cyrene</a>. From those who settled in the latter of these countries descended the Cyrenean Jews mentioned by the writers of the New Testament.\n\nFive years after Ptolemy had subdued Judea, he was forced to yield it to Antigonus, referring to himself only the cities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACE\">Ace</a>, Samaria, Joppa, and Gaza; and carrying off an immense booty, together with a great number of captives, whom he settled at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, and endowed with considerable privileges and immunities.\u2014Antigonus behaved in such a tyrannical manner, that great numbers of his Jewish subjects fled into Egypt, and others put themselves under the protection of Seleucus, who also granted them considerable privileges. Hence this nation came gradually to be spread over Syria and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASIA_MINOR\">Asia <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">Minor</a>; while Judea seemed to be in danger of being depopulated till it was recovered by Ptolemy in 292. The affairs of the Jews then took a more prosperous turn, and continued in a thriving way till the reign of Ptolemy Philopator, when they were grievously oppressed by the incursions of the Samaritans, at the same time that Antiochus Theos king of Syria invaded Galilee. Ptolemy, however, marched against Antiochus, and defeated him;\nhim; after which, having gone to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices, he ventured to profane the temple itself by going into it. He penetrated through the two outer courts; but as he was about to enter the sanctuary, he was struck with such dread and terror that he fell down half dead. A dreadful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERSECUTION\">persecution</a> was then raised against the Jews, who had attempted to hinder him in his impious attempt; but this persecution was stopped by a still more extraordinary accident related under the article EGYPT, No. 30, and the Jews again received into favour.\n\nAbout the year 204 B.C. the country of Judea was subdued by Antiochus the Great; and on this occasion the loyalty of the Jews to the Egyptians failed them, the whole nation readily submitting to the king of Syria. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> so pleased the Syrian monarch, that he sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to his general, wherein he acquainted him that he designed to restore Jerusalem to its ancient splendor, and to recall all the Jews that had been driven out of it: that out of his singular respect to the temple of God, he granted them 20,000 pieces of silver, towards the charges of the victims, frankincense, wine, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>; 1400 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of fine wheat, and 375 measures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, towards their usual oblations: that the temple should be thoroughly repaired at his cost; that they should enjoy the free exercise of their religion; and restore the public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> of the temple, and the priests, Levites, singers, &c. to their usual functions: that no stranger, or Jew that was unpurified, should enter farther into the temple than was allowed by their law; and that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> of unclean beasts should be brought into Jerusalem; not even their skins: and all these under the penalty of paying 3000 pieces of silver into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a> of the temple. He further granted an exemption of taxes for three years to all the dispersed Jews that should come within a limited time to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>; and that all who had been sold for slaves within his dominions should be immediately set free.\n\nThis sudden prosperity proved of no long duration. About the year 176, a quarrel happened between Onias, at that time high priest, and one Simon, governor of the temple, which was attended with the most fatal consequences. The causes of this quarrel are unknown. The event, however, was, that Simon finding he could not get the better of Onias, informed Apollonius governor of Coelo-Syria and Palestine, that there was at that time in the temple an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a>, which at his pleasure might be seized upon for the use of the king of Syria. Of this the governor instantly sent intelligence to the king, who dispatched one Heliodorus to take possession of the supposed treasure. This person, through a miraculous interposition, as the Jews pretend, failed in his attempt of entering the temple; upon which Simon accused the high-priest to the people, as the person who had invited Heliodorus to Jerusalem. This produced a kind of civil war, in which many fell on both sides. At last Onias having complained to the king, Simon was banished; but soon after, Antiochus Epiphanes having ascended the throne of Syria, Jason, the high-priest's brother, taking advantage of the necessities of Antiochus, purchased from him the high-priesthood at the price of 350 talents, and obtained an order that his brother should be sent to Antioch, there to be confined for life.\n\nJason's next step was to purchase <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, at the price of 150 talents more, to build a gymnasium at Jerusalem, similar to those which were used in the Grecian cities, and to make as many Jews as he pleased free citizens of Antioch. By means of these powers, he became very soon able to form a strong party in Judea; for his countrymen were exceedingly fond of the Grecian customs, and the freedom of the city of Antioch was a very valuable privilege. From this time forward a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOSTASY\">apostasy</a> took place; the service of the temple was neglected, and Jason abandoned himself without remorse to all the impieties and absurdities of paganism.\n\nHe did not, however, long enjoy his ill-acquired <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>. Having sent his brother Menelaus with the usual tribute to Antiochus, the former took the opportunity of supplanting Jason in the same manner that he had supplanted Onias. Having offered for the high-priesthood 300 talents more than his brother had given, he easily obtained it, and returned with his new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> to Jerusalem. He soon got himself a strong party; but Jason proving too powerful, forced Menelaus and his adherents to retire to Antioch. Here, the better to gain their point, they acquainted Antiochus that they were determined to renounce their old religion, and wholly conform themselves to that of the Greeks: which so pleased the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>, that he immediately gave them a force sufficient to drive Jason out of Jerusalem; who thereupon took refuge among the Ammonites.\n\nMenelaus being thus freed from his rival, took care to fulfil his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> to the king with regard to the apostasy, but forgot to pay the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> he had promised. At last he was summoned to Antioch; and finding nothing but the payment of the promised sum would do, sent orders to his brother Lysimachus to convey to him as many of the sacred utensils belonging to the temple as could be spared. As these were all of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, the apostate soon raised a sufficient sum from them not only to satisfy the king, but also to bribe the courtiers in his favour. But his brother Onias, who had been all this time confined at Antioch, getting intelligence of the sacrilege, made such bitter complaints, that an insurrection was ready to take place among the Jews at Antioch. Menelaus, in order to avoid the impending danger, bribed Andronicus, governor of the city, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> Onias. This produced the most vehement complaints as soon as Antiochus returned to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> (he having been absent for some time in order to quell an insurrection in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CILICIA\">Cilicia</a>); which at last ended in the death of Andronicus, who was executed by the king's order. By dint of money, however, Menelaus still found means to keep up his credit; but was obliged to draw such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> sums from Jerusalem, that the inhabitants at last massacred his brother Lysimachus, whom he had left governor of the city in his absence. Antiochus soon after took a journey to Tyre; upon which the Jews sent deputies to him, both to justify the death of Lysimachus, and to accuse Menelaus of being the author of all the troubles which had happened. The apostate, however, was never at a loss while he could procure money. By means of this powerful argument, he pleaded his cause so effectually, that the deputies were not only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>, but put to death; and this unjust <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> gave the traitor such a complete victory over...\nover all his enemies, that from thenceforth he commenced a downright tyrant. Jerusalem was destitute of protectors; and the sanhedrim, if there were any zealous men left among them, were so much terrified, that they durst not oppose him, though they evidently saw that his design was finally to eradicate the religion and liberties of his country.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, Antiochus was taken up with the conquest of Egypt, and a report was some how or other spread that he had been killed at the siege of Alexandria. At this news the Jews imprudently showed some signs of joy; and Jason thinking this a proper opportunity to regain his lost dignity, appeared before Jerusalem at the head of about 1000 resolute men. The gates were quickly opened to him by some of his friends in the city; upon which Menelaus retired into the citadel, and Jason, minding nothing but his resentment, committed the most horrid butcheries. At last he was obliged to leave both the city and country, on the news that Antiochus was coming with a powerful army against him; for that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, highly provoked at this rebellion, and especially at the rejoicings the Jews had made on the report of his death, had actually resolved to punish the city in the severest manner. Accordingly, about 170 B.C., having made himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the city, he behaved with such cruelty, that within three days they reckoned no fewer than 40,000 killed, and as many sold for slaves. In the midst of this dreadful calamity, the apostate Menelaus found means not only to preserve himself from the general slaughter, but even to regain the good graces of the king, who, having by his means plundered the temple of every thing valuable, returned to Antioch in a kind of triumph. Before he departed, however, he put Judea under the government of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a>, a barbarous Phrygian; Samaria under that of Andronicus, a person of a similar disposition; and left Menelaus, the most hateful of all the three, in possession of the high-priesthood.\n\nThough the Jews suffered exceedingly under these tyrannical governors, they were still referred for greater calamities. About 168 B.C., Antiochus having been most severely mortified by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, took it into his head to wreak his vengeance on the unhappy Jews. For this purpose he dispatched Apollonius at the head of 22,000 men, with orders to plunder all the cities of Judea, to murder all the men, and sell the women and children for slaves. Apollonius accordingly came with his army, and to outward appearance with a peaceable intention; neither was he suspected by the Jews, as he was superintendent of the tribute in Palestine. He kept himself inactive till the next Sabbath, when they were all in a profound quiet; and then, on a sudden, commanded his men to arms. Some of them he sent to the temple and synagogues, with orders to cut in pieces all whom they found there; whilst the rest going through the streets of the city massacred all that came in their way; the superstitious Jews not attempting to make the least resistance for fear of breaking the Sabbath. He next ordered the city to be plundered and set on fire, pulled down all their stately buildings caused the walls to be demolished, and carried away captive about 10,000 of those who had escaped the slaughter. From that time the service of the temple was totally abandoned; that place having been quite polluted, both with the blood of multitudes who had been killed, and in various other ways. The Syrian troops built a large fortress on an eminence in the city of David; fortified it with a strong wall and stately towers, and put a garrison in it to command the temple, over-against which it was built, so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SOLDIERS\">soldiers</a> could easily see and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> out upon all those who attempted to come into the temple; so many of whom were continually plundered and murdered by them, that the rest, not daring to stay any longer in Jerusalem, fled for refuge to the neighbouring nations.\n\nAntiochus, not yet satiated with the blood of the Jews, resolved either totally to abolish their religion, or destroy their whole race. He therefore issued out a decree that all nations within his dominions should forsake their old religion and gods, and worship those of the king under the most severe penalties. To make his orders more effectual, he sent overseers into every province to see them strictly put in execution; and as he knew the Jews were the only people who would disobey them, special directions were given to have them treated with the utmost severity. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, an old and cruel minister, well versed in all the pagan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RITES\">rites</a>, was sent into Judea. He began by dedicating the temple to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUPITER\">Jupiter</a> Olympus, and setting up his statue on the altar of burnt-offerings. Another lesser altar was raised before it, on which they offered sacrifices to that false deity. All who refused to come and worship this idol were either massacred or put to some cruel tortures till they either complied or expired under the hands of the executioners. At the same time, altars, groves, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STATUES\">statues</a>, were raised everywhere throughout the country, and the inhabitants compelled to worship them under the same severe penalties; while it was instant death to observe the Sabbath, circumcision, or any other institution of Moses.\n\nAt last, when vast numbers had been put to cruel deaths, and many more had saved their lives by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-MATTATHIAS\">Mattathias</a> apostasy, an eminent priest, named Mattathias, began to signalize himself by his bravery and zeal for religion. He had for some time been obliged to retire to Modin his native place, in order to avoid the persecution which raged at Jerusalem. During his recess there, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APELLES\">Apelles</a>, one of the king's officers, came to oblige the inhabitants to comply with the above-mentioned orders. By him Mattathias and his sons were addressed in the most earnest manner, and had the most ample promises made them of the king's favour and protection if they would renounce their religion. But Mattathias answered, that though the whole Jewish nation, and the whole world, were to conform to the king's edict, yet both he and his sons would continue faithful to their God to the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> of their lives. At the same time perceiving one of his countrymen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUST\">just</a> going to offer sacrifices to an idol, he fell upon him and instantly killed him, agreeable to the law of Moses in such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>. Upon this his sons, fired with the same zeal, killed the officer and his men; overthrew the altar and idol; and running about the city, cried out, that those who were zealous for the law of God should follow them; by which means they quickly saw themselves at the head of a numerous troop, with whom they soon after withdrew into some of the deserts of Judea. They were followed by many others, so that in a short time they found themselves in a condition to resist their enemies;\nand having considered the danger to which they were exposed by their scrupulous observance of the Sabbath, they resolved to defend themselves, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of an attack, upon that day as well as upon any other.\n\nIn the year 167 B.C., Mattathias finding that his followers daily increased in number, began to try his strength by attacking the Syrians and apostate Jews. As many of these as he took he put to death, but forced a much greater number to fly for refuge into foreign countries; and having soon struck his enemies with terror, he marched from city to city, overturned the idolatrous altars, opened the Jewish synagogues, made a diligent search after all the sacred books, and caused fresh copies of them to be written; he also caused the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> of the Scriptures to be resumed, and all the males born since the persecution to be circumcised. In all this he was attended with such success, that he had extended his reformation through a considerable part of Judea within the space of one year: and would probably have completed it, had he not been prevented by death.\n\nMattathias was succeeded by his son Judas, furnishing the Jews with Macabees, the greatest uninspired <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERO\">hero</a> of whom the Jews can boast. His troops amounted to no more than 6000 men; yet with these he quickly made himself master of some of the strongest fortresses of Judea, and became terrible to the Syrians, Samaritans, and apostate Jews. In one year he defeated the Syrians in five pitched battles, and drove them quite out of the country; after which he purified the temple, and restored the true worship, which had been interrupted for three years and a half. Only one obstacle now remained, viz., the Syrian garrison, above-mentioned, which had been placed over against the temple, and which Judas could not at present reduce. In order to prevent them from interrupting the worship, however, he fortified the mountain on which the temple stood, with a high wall and strong towers round about, leaving a garrison to defend it; making some additional fortifications at the same time to Bethzura, a fortress at about 20 miles distance.\n\nIn the mean time Antiochus being on his return from an unsuccessful expedition into Persia, received the disagreeable news that the Jews had all to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> revolted, defeated his generals, driven their armies out of Judea, and restored their ancient worship. This threw him into such a fury, that he commanded his charioteer to drive with the utmost speed, threatening utterly to extirpate the Jewish race, without leaving a single person alive. These words were scarcely uttered, when he was seized with a violent pain in his bowels, which no remedy could cure or abate. But notwithstanding this violent shock, suffering himself to be hurried away by the transports of his fury, he gave orders for proceeding with the same precipitation in his journey. But while he was thus hastening forward, he fell from his chariot, and was so bruised by the fall, that his attendants were forced to put him into a litter. Not being able to bear even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the litter, he was forced to halt at a town called Tabe on the confines of Persia and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLONIA\">Babylonia</a>. Here he kept his bed, suffering inexpressible torments, occasioned chiefly by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMIN\">vermin</a> which bred in his body, and the stench, which made him intolerable even to himself. But the torments of his mind, caused by his reflecting on the former actions of his life, surpassed by many degrees those of his body. Polybius, who in his account of this prince's death agrees with the Jewish historians, tells us, that the uneasiness of his mind grew at last to a constant delirium or state of madness, by reason of several spectres and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARITIONS\">apparitions</a> of evil genii or spirits, which he imagined were continually reproaching him with the many wicked actions of which he had been guilty. At last, having languished for some time in this miserable condition, he expired, and by his death freed the Jews from the most intractable enemy they had ever known.\n\nNotwithstanding the death of Antiochus, however, the war was still carried on against the Jews; but through the valour and good conduct of Judas, the Syrians were constantly defeated, and in 163 B.C. a peace was concluded upon terms very advantageous to the Jewish nation. This tranquillity, however, was of no long continuance; the Syrian generals renewed their hostilities, and were attended with the same ill success as before. Judas defeated them in five engagements; but in the sixth was abandoned by all his men except 800, who, together with their chief, were slain in the year 161 B.C.\n\nThe news of the death of Judas threw his countrymen into the utmost consternation, and seemed to give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JONATHAN\">Jonathan</a> new life to all their enemies. He was succeeded, however, by his brother Jonathan; who conducted matters with no less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> and success than Judas had done, till he was treacherously seized and put to death by Tryphon, a Syrian usurper, who shortly after murdered his own sovereign. The traitor immediately prepared to invade Judea; but found all his projects frustrated by Simon, Jonathan's brother. This pontiff repaired all the fortresses of Judea, and furnished them with fresh garrisons, took Joppa and Gaza, and drove out the Syrian garrison from the fortresses of Jerusalem; but was at last treacherously murdered by a son-in-law named Ptolemy, about 135 B.C.\n\nSimon was succeeded by his son Hyrcan; who not only shook off the yoke of Syria, but conquered the Samaritans, demolished their capital city, and became master of all Palestine, to which he added the provinces of Samaria and Galilee; all which he enjoyed till within a year of his death, without the least disturbance from without, or any internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISCORD\">discord</a>. His reign was no less remarkable on the account of his great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> at home than his conquests abroad. He was the first since the captivity who had assumed the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>; and he raised the Jewish nation to a greater degree of splendor than it had ever enjoyed since that time. The author of the fourth book of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACCABEES\">Maccabees</a> also informs us, that in him three dignities were centered which never met in any other person, namely, the royal dignity, the high-priesthood, and the gift of prophecy. But the instances given of this last are very equivocal and suspicious. The last year of his reign, however, was embittered by a quarrel with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARISEES\">Pharisees</a>; and which proceeded such a length as was thought to have shortened his days. Hyrcan had always been a great friend to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>, and they had hitherto enjoyed the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> employments in the state; but at length one of them, named Elazar, took it into his head to question Hyrcan's legitimacy, alleging, that his mother had formerly been a slave,\nslave, and consequently that he was incapable of enjoying the high-priesthood. This report was credited, or pretended to be so, by the whole sect; which irritated the high-priest to such a degree, that he joined the Sadducees, and could never afterwards be reconciled to the Pharisees, who therefore raised all the troubles and seditions they could during the short time he lived.\n\nHyrcan died in 107 B.C. and was succeeded by his eldest son Aristobulus, who conquered Iturea, but proved a most cruel and barbarous tyrant, polluting his hands with the blood even of his mother and one of his brothers, keeping the rest closely confined during his reign, which, however, was but short. He was succeeded in 105 by Alexander Janneus, the greatest conqueror, next to King David, that ever sat on the Jewish throne. He was hated, however, by the Pharisees, and once in danger of being killed in a tumult excited by them; but having caused his guards to fall upon the mutinous mob, they killed 6000 of them, and dispersed the rest. After this, finding it impossible to remain in quiet in his own kingdom, he left Jerusalem, with a design to apply himself wholly to the extending of his conquests; but while he was busied in subduing his foreign enemies, the Pharisees raised a rebellion at home. This was quelled in the year 86 B.C., and the rebels were treated in the most inhuman manner. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a>, however, was by this means so thoroughly quelled, that they never dared to lift up their heads as long as he lived: and Alexander having made several conquests in Syria, died about 79 B.C.\n\nThe king left two sons, Hyrcanus and Aristobulus; but bequeathed the government to his wife Alexandra as long as she lived: but as he saw her greatly afraid, and not without reason, of the resentment of the Pharisees, he desired his queen, just before his death, to send for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> leaders of that party, and pretend to be entirely devoted to them; in which case, he assured her, that they would support her and her sons after her in the peaceable possession of the government. With this advice the queen complied; but found herself much embarrassed by the turbulent Pharisees, who, after several exorbitant demands, would at last be contented with nothing less than the total extermination of their adversaries the Sadducees. As the queen was unable to resist the strength of the pharisaic faction, a most cruel persecution immediately took place against the Sadducees, which continued for four years; until at last, upon their earnest petition, they were dispersed among the several garrisons of the kingdom, in order to secure them from the violence of their enemies. A few years after this, being seized with a dangerous sickness, her youngest son Aristobulus collected a strong party in order to secure the crown to himself; but the queen being displeased with his conduct, appointed her other son Hyrcanus, whom she had before made high-priest, to succeed her also in the royal dignity. Soon after this he expired, and left her two sons competitors for the crown. The Pharisees raised an army against Aristobulus, which almost instantly deserted to him, so that Hyrcanus found himself obliged to accept of peace upon any terms; which, however, was not granted, till the latter had abandoned all title both to the royal and pontifical dignity, and contented himself with the enjoyment of his peculiar patrimony as a private person.\n\nBut this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> did not extinguish the party of Hyrcanus. A new cabal was raised by Antipater an Idumean profelyte, and father of Herod the great; who carried off Hyrcanus into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>, under pretence that his life was in danger if he remained in Judea. Here he applied to Aretas king of that country, who undertook to restore the deposed monarch; and for that purpose invaded Judea, defeated Aristobulus, and kept him closely besieged in Jerusalem. The latter had recourse to the Romans; and having bribed Sc\u00e6vola, one of their generals, he defeated Aretas with the loss of 7000 of his men, and drove him quite out of the country. The two brothers next sent presents to Pompey, at that time commander in chief of all the Roman forces in the east, and whom they made the arbitrator of their differences. But he, fearing that Aristobulus, against whom he intended to declare, might obstruct his intended expedition against the Nabateans, dismissed them with a promise, that as soon as he had subdued Aretas, he would come into Judea and decide their controversy.\n\nThis delay gave such offence to Aristobulus, that he suddenly departed for Judea without even taking leave of the Roman general, who on his part was no less offended at this want of respect. The consequence was, that Pompey entered Judea with those troops with which he had designed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> against the Nabateans, and summoned Aristobulus to appear before him. The Jewish prince would gladly have been excused; but was forced by his own people to comply with Pompey's summons, to avoid a war with that general. He came accordingly more than once or twice to him, and was dismissed with great promises and marks of friendship. But at last Pompey insisted, that he should deliver into his hands all the fortified places he possessed; which let Aristobulus plainly see that he was in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of his brother, and upon this he fled to Jerusalem with a design to oppose the Romans to the utmost of his power. He was quickly followed by Pompey; and to prevent hostilities was at last forced to go and throw himself at the feet of the haughty Roman, and to promise him a considerable sum of money as the reward of his forbearance. This submission was accepted; but Gabinius, being sent with some troops to receive the stipulated sum, was repulsed by the garrison of Jerusalem, who flung the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> against him, and refused to fulfil the agreement. This disappointment so exasperated Pompey, that he immediately marched with his whole army against the city.\n\nThe Roman general first sent proposals of peace; but finding the Jews resolved to stand out to the last, he began the siege in form. As the place was strongly fortified both by nature and art, he might have found it very difficult to accomplish his design, had not the Jews been suddenly seized with a qualm of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> respecting the observance of the Sabbath-day. From the time of the Maccabees they had made no scruple of taking up arms against an offending enemy on the Sabbath; but now they discovered, that though it was lawful on that day to stand on their defence in case they were actually attacked, yet it was unlawful to do anything towards the preventing of those pre-\nparatives which the enemy made towards such future assaults. As therefore they never moved an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> to hinder the erection of mounds and batteries, or the making of breaches in the walls, on the sabbath, the besiegers at last made such a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> on that day, that the garrison could no longer retake them. The city was therefore taken in the year 63 B.C., 12,000 of the inhabitants were slaughtered, and many more died by their own hands; while the priests, who were offering up the usual prayers and sacrifices in the temple, chose rather to be butchered along with their brethren, than suffer divine service to be one moment interrupted. At last, after the Romans had satiated their cruelty with the death of a vast number of the inhabitants, Hyrcanus was restored to the pontifical dignity with the title of prince; but forbid to assume the title of king, to wear a diadem, or to extend his territories beyond the limits of Judea. To prevent future revolts, the walls were pulled down; and Scaurus was left governor with a sufficient force. But before he departed, the Roman general gave the Jews a still greater offence than almost anything he had hitherto done; and that was by entering into the most sacred recesses of the temple, where he took a view of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLESTICK\">candlestick</a>, censers, lamps, and all the other sacred vessels; but, out of respect to the Deity, forebore to touch any of them, and when he came out commanded the priests immediately to purify the temple according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>.\n\nPompey having thus subdued the Jewish nation, set out for Rome, carrying along with him Aristobulus and his two sons Alexander and Antigonus, as captives to adorn his future triumph. Aristobulus himself and his son Antigonus were led in triumph; but Alexander found means to escape into Judea, where he raised an army of 10,000 foot and 1500 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, and began to fortify several strongholds, from whence he made incursions into the neighbouring country. As for Hyrcanus, he had no sooner found himself freed from his rival brother, than he relapsed into his former indolence, leaving the care of all his affairs to Antipater, who, like a true politician, failed not to turn the weaknesses of the prince to his own advantage and the aggrandizing of his family. He foreflew, however, that he could not easily compass his ends, unless he ingratiated himself with the Romans; and therefore spared neither pains nor cost to gain their favour. Scaurus soon after received from him a supply of corn and other provisions, without which his army, which he had led against the metropolis of Arabia, would have been in danger of perishing; and after this, he prevailed on the king to pay 300 talents to the Romans, to prevent them from ravaging his country. Hyrcanus was now in no condition to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> his enemy Alexander; and therefore had again recourse to the Romans, Antipater at the same time sending as many troops as he could spare to join them. Alexander ventured a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>; but was defeated with considerable loss, and besieged in a strong fortress named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALEXANDRIAN\">Alexandrian</a>. Here he would have been forced to surrender; but his mother, partly by her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a>, and partly by the services she found means to do the Roman general, prevailed upon him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> her son a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> for what was past. The fortresses were then demolished, that they might not give occasion to fresh revolts; Hyrcanus was again restored to the pontifical dignity; and the province was divided into five several districts, in each of which a separate court of judicature was erected. The first of these was at Jerusalem, the second at Gadara, the third at Amath, the fourth at Jericho, and the fifth at Sephoris in Galilee. Thus was the government changed from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a> to an aristocracy, and the Jews now fell under a fet of dominion.\n\nSoon after this, Aristobulus found means to escape from his confinement at Rome, and raised new troubles in Judea, but was again defeated and taken prisoner; his son also renewed his attempts; but was in like manner defeated, with the loss of near 10,000 of his followers; after which Gabinius, having settled the affairs of Judea to Antipater's mind, resigned the government of his province to C\u00e6sar. The only transaction during his government was his plundering the temple of all its money and sacred utensils, amounting in the whole to 10,000 Attic talents, i.e. above two millions of our money. After this sacrilege, C\u00e6sar set out on his expedition against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARTHIA\">Parthia</a>, where he perished; and his death was by the Jews interpreted as a divine judgment for his impiety.\n\nThe war between C\u00e6sar and Pompey afforded the Jews some respite, and likewise an opportunity of ingratiating themselves with the former, which the artful Antipater readily embraced. His services were rewarded by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>. He confirmed Hyrcanus in his priesthood, added to it the principality of Judea, to be entailed on his posterity for ever, and restored the Jewish nation to their ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> and privileges; ordering at the same time a pillar to be erected, wherein all these grants, and his own decree, should be engraved, which was accordingly done; and soon after, when C\u00e6sar himself came into Judea, he granted liberty also to fortify the city, and rebuild the wall which had been demolished by Pompey.\n\nDuring the lifetime of C\u00e6sar, the Jews were so highly favoured, that they could scarcely be said to feel the Roman yoke. After his death, however, the nation fell into great disorders; which were not finally quelled till Herod, who was created king of Judea by Marc Antony in 40 B.C. was fully established on the throne by the taking of Jerusalem by his allies the Romans in 37 B.C. The immediate consequence of Herod's accession was another cruel pillage and massacre; then followed the death of Antigonus the son of Aristobulus, the Jew who had for three years maintained his ground against Herod, put to death his brother Phasa\u00ebl, and cut off Hyrcanus's ears, in order the more effectually to incapacitate him for the high-priesthood.\n\nThe Jews gained but little by this change of masters. The new king proved one of the greatest tyrants and cruel persecutors mentioned in history. He began his reign with a cruel persecution of those who had sided with his rival Antigonus; great numbers of whom he put to death, feigning and confiscating their effects for his own use. Nay, such was his jealousy in this last respect, that he caused guards to be placed at the city gates, in order to watch the bodies of those of the Antigonus faction who were carried out to be buried, lest some of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> should be carried along with them. His jealousy next prompted him to decoy Hyrcanus, the banished pontiff, from Parthia, where he had taken refuge.\nrefuge, that he might put him to death, though contrary to his most solemn promises. His cruelty then fell upon his own family. He had married Mariamne, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Hyrcanus; whose brother, Aristobulus, a young prince of great hopes, was made high-priest at the intercession of his mother Alexandra. But the tyrant, conscious that Aristobulus had a better <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to the kingdom than himself, caused him soon after to be drowned in a bath. The next victim was his beloved queen Mariamne herself. Herod had been summoned to appear first before Marc Antony, and then before Augustus, in order to clear himself from some crimes laid to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>. As he was, however, doubtful of the event, he left orders, that in case he was condemned, Mariamne should be put to death. This, together with the death of her father and brother, gave her such an aversion for him, that she showed it on all occasions. By this conduct the tyrant's resentment was at last so much inflamed, that having got her falsely accused of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDELITY\">infidelity</a>, she was condemned to die, and executed accordingly. She suffered with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>; but with her ended all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> of her husband. His love for Mariamne increased so much after her death, that for some time he appeared like one quite distracted. His remorse, however, did not get the better of his cruelty. The death of Mariamne was soon followed by that of her mother Alexandra, and this by the execution of several other persons who had joined with her in an attempt to secure the kingdom to the sons of the deceased queen.\n\nHerod, having now freed himself from the greatest part of his supposed enemies, began to show a greater contempt for the Jewish ceremonies than formerly; and introduced a number of heathenish games, which made him odious to his subjects. Ten bold fellows at last took it into their heads to enter the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a> where the tyrant was celebrating some games, with daggers concealed under their clothes, in order to stab him or some of his retinue. In case they should miscarry in the attempt, they had the desperate satisfaction to think, that, if they perished, the tyrant would be rendered still more odious by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> inflicted on them. They were not mistaken: for Herod being informed of their design by one of his spies, and causing the assassins to be put to a most excruciating death, the people were so much exasperated against the informer, that they cut and tore him to pieces, and cast his flesh to the dogs. Herod tried in vain to discover the authors of this affront; but at last having caused some women to be put to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACK\">rack</a>, he extorted from them the names of the principal persons concerned, whom he caused immediately to be put to death with their families. This produced such disturbances, that, apprehending nothing less than a general revolt, he set about fortifying Jerusalem with several additional works, rebuilding Samaria, and putting garrisons into several fortresses in Judea. Notwithstanding this, however, Herod had shortly after an opportunity of regaining the affections of his subjects in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>, by his generosity to them during a famine; but as he soon relapsed into his former cruelty, their love was again turned into hatred, which continued till his death.\n\nRebuilds Herod now, about 23 B.C. began to adorn his temple cities with many stately buildings. The most remarkable and magnificent of them all, however, was the temple at Jerusalem, which he is said to have raised to a higher pitch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRANDEUR\">grandeur</a> than even Solomon himself had done. Ten thousand artificers were immediately set to work, under the direction of 1000 priests, the best skilled in carving, masonry, &c., all of whom were kept in constant pay. A thousand carts were employed in fetching materials; and such a number of other hands were employed, that every thing was got ready within the space of two years. After this, they set about pulling down the old building, and rearing up the new one with the same expedition: so that the holy place, or temple, properly so called, was finished in a year and a half; during which we are told that it never rained in the daytime, but only in the night. The remainder was finished in somewhat more than eight years. The temple, properly so called, or holy place, was but 60 cubits high, and as many in breadth; but in the front he added two wings or shoulders which projected 20 cubits more on each side, and which in all made a front of 120 cubits in length, and as many in height; with a gate 70 cubits high and 20 in breadth, but open and without any doors. The stones were white marble, 25 cubits in length, 12 in height, and 9 in breadth, all wrought and polished with exquisite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>; the whole resembling a stately <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, whose middle being considerably raised above the extremities of each face, made it afford a beautiful vista at a great distance, to those who came to the metropolis. Instead of doors, the gates closed with very costly veils, enriched with a variety of flowering of gold, silver, purple, and every thing that was rich and curious; and on each side of the gates were planted two stately columns, from whose cornices hung golden festoons and vines, with their clusters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a>, leaves, &c. curiously wrought. The superstructure, however, which was properly reared on the old foundation without sufficient additions, proved too heavy, and sunk down about 20 cubits; so that its height was reduced to 100. This foundation was of an astonishing strength and height, of which an account is given under the article JERUSALEM. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PLATFORM\">platform</a> was a regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STADIUM\">stadium</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FURLONG\">furlong</a> on each side. Each front of the square had a spacious gate or entrance, enriched with suitable ornaments; but that on the west had four gates, one of which led to the palace, another to the city, and the two others to the suburbs and fields. This inclosure was surrounded on the outside with a strong and high wall of large stones, well cemented; and on the inside had on each front a stately piazza or gallery, supported by columns of such a bigness, that three men could just embrace them, their circumference being about 27 feet. There were in all 162 of them, which supported a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEDAR\">cedar</a> ceiling of excellent workmanship, and formed three galleries, the middlemost of which was the largest and highest, it being 45 feet in breadth and 100 in height, whereas those on each side were but 30 feet wide and 50 in height.\n\nThe piazzas and court were paved with marble of various colours; and, at a small distance from the galleries, was a second inclosure, surrounded with a flight of beautiful marble rails, with stately columns at proper distances, on which were engraven certain admonitions in Greek and Latin, to forbid strangers, and\nJews. those Jews that were not purified, to proceed farther under pain of death. This inclosure had but one gate on the east side; none on the west; but on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> and south it had three, placed at equal distances from each other.\n\nA third inclosure surrounded the temple, properly so called, and the altar of burnt-offerings; and made what they called the court of the Hebrews or Israelites. It was square like the rest; but the wall on the outside was surrounded by a flight of 14 steps, which hid a considerable part of it; and on the top was a terrace, of about 12 cubits in breadth, which went quite round the whole inclosure. The east side had but one gate; the west none; and the north and south four, at equal distances. Each gate was ascended by five steps more before one could reach the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> of the inward court; so that the wall which inclosed it appeared within to be but 25 cubits high, though considerably higher on the outside. On the inside of each of these gates were raised a couple of spacious square chambers, in form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAVILION\">pavilion</a>, 30 cubits wide and 40 in height, each supported by columns of 12 cubits in circumference.\n\nThis inclosure had likewise a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOUBLE\">double</a> flight of galleries on the inside, supported by a double row of columns; but the western side was only one continued wall, without gates or galleries. The women had likewise their particular courts separate from that of the men, and one of the gates on the north and south leading to it.\n\nThe altar of burnt-offerings was likewise high and spacious, being 40 cubits in breadth, and 15 in height. The ascent to it was, according to the Mosaic law, smooth, and without steps; and the altar of unhewn stones. It was surrounded, at a convenient distance, with a low wall or rail, which divided the court of the priests from that of the lay Israelites; so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAITY\">laity</a> were allowed to come thus far to bring their offerings and sacrifices; though none but the priests were allowed to come within that inclosure.\n\nHerod caused a new dedication of this temple to be performed with the utmost magnificence, and presented it to many rich trophies of his former victories, after the custom of the Jewish monarchs.\n\nThis, and many other magnificent works, however, did not divert the king's attention from his usual jealousies and cruelty. His sister Salome, and one of his sons named Antipater, taking advantage of this disposition, prompted him to murder his two sons by Mariamne, named Alexander and Aristobulus, who had been educated at the court of Augustus in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, and were justly admired by all who saw them. His cruelty soon after broke out in an impotent attempt to destroy the Saviour of the world, but which was attended with no other consequence than the destruction of 2000 innocent children of his own subjects. His misery was almost brought to its summit by the discovery of Antipater's designs against himself; who was accordingly tried and condemned for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a>. Something still more dreadful, however, yet awaited him; he was seized with a most loathsome and incurable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, in which he was tormented with intolerable pains, so that his life became a burden. At last he died, to the great joy of the Jews, five days after he had put Antipater to death, and after having divided his kingdom among his sons in the following manner.\u2014Archelaus had Judea; Antipas, or Herod, was tetrarch of Galilee and Perea; and Philip had the regions of Trachonitis, Gaulon, Batanea, and Panias, which he erected likewise into a tetrarchy. To his sister Salome he gave 50,000 pieces of money, together with the cities of Jannia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AZOTUS\">Azotus</a>, and Phasa\u00eblis; besides some considerable legacies to his other relations.\n\nThe cruelty of this monster accompanied him to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>; nay, he in a manner carried it beyond the grave. Being well apprised that the Jews would rejoice at being freed from such a tyrant, he betook himself of the following infernal stratagem to damp their mirth. A few days before his death, he summoned all the heads of the Jews to repair to Jericho under pain of death; and, on their arrival, ordered them all to be shut up in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CIRCUS\">circus</a>, giving at the same time strict orders to his sister Salome and her husband to have all the prisoners butchered as soon as his breath was gone out. \"By this means (said he), I shall not only damp the people's joy, but secure a real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOURNING\">mourning</a> at my death.\" These cruel orders, however, were not put in execution. Immediately after the king's death, Salome went to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPODROME\">Hippodrome</a>, where the heads of the Jews were detained, caused the gates to be flung open, and declared to them, that now the king had no further occasion for their attendance, and that they might depart to their respective homes; after which, and not till then, the news of the king's death was published. Tumults, seditions, and insurrections, quickly followed. Archelaus was deprived of his brethren, and obliged to appear at Rome, before Augustus, to whom many complaints were brought against him. After hearing both parties, the emperor made the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the kingdom: Archelaus had one half, under the title of ethnarch, or governor of a nation; together with a promise that he should have the title of king, as soon as he showed himself worthy of it. This ethnarchy contained Judea Propria, Idumea, and Samaria: but this last was exempted from one-fourth of the taxes paid by the rest, on account of the peaceable behaviour of the inhabitants during the late tumults. The remainder was divided between Philip and Herod; the former of whom had Trachonitis, Batanea, and Auranitis, together with a small part of Galilee; the latter had the rest of Galilee and the countries beyond the Jordan. Salome had half a million of silver, together with the cities of Jannia, Azotus, Phasa\u00eblis, and Acalon.\n\nFor some years Archelaus enjoyed his government in peace; but at last, both Jews and Samaritans, tired out with his tyrannical behaviour, joined in a petition to Augustus against him. The emperor immediately summoned him to Rome, where, having heard his accuser and defence, he banished him to the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VIENNE\">Vienne</a> in Dauphiny, and confiscated all his effects, banished Judea being by this sentence reduced to a Roman and a Roman province, was ordered to be taxed: and Cyrenius the governor of Syria, a man of consular dignity, was pointed thither to see it put in execution: which having over Jud\u00e6a done, and sold the palaces of Archelaus, and seized upon all his treasure, he returned to Antioch, leaving the Jews in no small ferment on account of this new tax.\nThus were the seeds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> sown between the Jews and Romans, which ended in the most lamentable catastrophe of the former. The Jews, always impatient of a foreign yoke, knew from their prophecies, that the time was now come when the Messiah should appear. Of consequence, as they expected him to be a great and powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a>, their rebellious and sedulous spirit was heightened to the greatest degree; and they imagined they had nothing to do but take up arms, and victory would immediately declare on their side. From this time, therefore, the country was never quiet; and the infatuated people, while they rejected the true Messiah, gave themselves up to the direction of every impostor who chose to lead them to their own destruction.\n\nThe governors appointed by the Romans were also frequently changed, but seldom for the better. About the 16th year of Christ, Pontius Pilate was appointed governor; the whole of whose administration, according to Josephus, was one continued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of venality, rapine, tyranny, and every wicked action; of racking and putting innocent men to death, untried and uncondemned; and of every kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> cruelty. Such a governor was but ill calculated to appease the ferments occasioned by the late tax. Indeed Pilate was so far from attempting this, that he greatly inflamed them by taking every occasion of introducing his standards with images and pictures, consecrated shields, &c., into their city; and at last attempting to drain the treasuries of the temple, under pretence of bringing an aqueduct into Jerusalem. The most remarkable transaction of his government, however, was his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDEMNATION\">condemnation</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ; seven years after which he was removed from Judea; and in a short time Agrippa, the grandson of Herod the Great, was promoted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIUS\">Caius</a> to the regal dignity. He did not, however, long enjoy this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a>; for, on his coming into Judea, having raised a persecution against the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, and blasphemously suffering himself to be styled a God by some deputies from Tyre and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SIDON\">Sidon</a>, he was miraculously struck with a disease, which soon put an end to his life. The sacred historian tells us, that he was eaten of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>; and Josephus, that he was seized with most violent pains in his heart and bowels; so that he could not but reflect on the baseness of those flatterers, who had but lately complimented him with a kind of divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMMORTALITY\">immortality</a>, that was now about to expire in all the torments and agonies of a miserable mortal.\n\nOn the death of Agrippa, Judea was once more reduced to a province of the Roman empire, and had new governors appointed over it. There were Ventidius, Felix, Festus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBINUS\">Albinus</a>, and Gellius Florus.\u2014Under their government the Jewish affairs went on from bad to worse; the country swarmed with robbers and assassins; the latter committing everywhere the most unheard-of cruelties under the pretence of religion; and about 64 A.C. were joined by 18,000 workmen, who had been employed in further repairing and beautifying the temple. About this time also, Gellius Florus, the last and worst governor the Jews ever had, was sent into the country. Josephus seems at a loss for words to describe him by, or a monster to compare him to. His rapines, cruelties, conniving for large sums with the banditti, and in a word, his whole behaviour, was so open and bare-faced, that he was looked upon by the Jews more like a bloody executioner, fain to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTCHER\">butcher</a>, than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a> to govern, them. In this distracted state of the country, many of the inhabitants forsook it to seek for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a> somewhere else; while those who remained applied themselves to Cestius Galus, governor of Syria, who was at Jerusalem at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PASSOVER\">passover</a>; beseeching him to pity their unhappy state, and free them from the tyranny of a man who had totally ruined their country. Florus, who was present when these complaints were brought against him, made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MERE\">mere</a> jest of them; and Cestius, instead of making a strict inquiry into his conduct, dismissed the Jews with a general promise that the governor should behave better for the future; and set himself about computing the number of Jews at that time in Jerusalem, by the number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAMBS\">lambs</a> offered at that festival, that he might fend an account of the whole to Nero. By his computation, there were at that time in Jerusalem 2,550,000; though Josephus thinks they rather amounted to 3,000,000.\n\nIn the year 67 began the fatal war with the Romans, cause of which was ended only by the destruction of Jerusalem, the last The immediate cause was the decision of a contest war with the Syrians concerning the city of Caesarea. The Romans Jews maintained that this city belonged to them, because it had been built by Herod; and the Syrians pretended that it had always been reckoned a Greek city, since even that monarch had reared <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TEMPLES\">temples</a> and statues in it. The contest at last came to such an height, that both parties took up arms against each other. Felix put an end to it for a time, by sending some of the chiefs of each nation to Rome, to plead their cause before the emperor, where it hung in suspense till this time, when Nero decided it against the Jews. No sooner was this decision made public, than the Jews in all parts of the country flew to arms; and though they were everywhere the sufferers, yet, from this fatal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, their rage never abated. Nothing was now to be heard of but robberies, murders, and every kind of cruelty. Cities and villages were filled with dead bodies of all ages, even sucking babes. The Jews, on their part, spared neither Syrians nor Romans, where they got the better of them; and this terribly proved the destruction of great numbers of their peace-maligned, full brethren: 20,000 were massacred at Caesarea, 50,000 at Alexandria, 2000 at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMAIS\">Ptolemais</a>, and 3500 at Jerusalem.\n\nA great number of assassins, in the mean time, having joined the factious Jews in Jerusalem, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> the Romans out of Antonia, a fortress adjoining to the temple, and another called Maffada; and likewise out of the towers called Phasa\u00ebl and Mariamne, killing all who opposed them. The Romans were at last reduced to such straits, that they capitulated on the single condition that their lives should be spared; notwithstanding which, they were all massacred by the furious zealots; and this treachery was soon revenged on the faithful Jews of Scythopolis. These had offered to assist in reducing their factious brethren; but their sincerity being suspected by the townsmen, they obliged them to retire into a neighbouring wood, where, on the third night, they were massacred to the number of 13,000, and all their wealth carried off. The rebels, in the mean time, crossed the Jordan, and took the fortresses of Macharoth and\nand Cyprus; which last they razed to the ground, after having put all the Romans to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a>.\u2014This brought C\u00e6lius Galus, the Syrian governor, into Judea with all his forces; but the Jews, partly by treachery and partly by force, got the better of him, and drove him out of the country with the loss of 5000 men.\n\nAll this time such dreadful dissensions reigned among the Jews, that great numbers of the better sort forefeeling the fatal effects of the resentment of the Romans, left the city as men do a sinking vessel; and the Christians, mindful of their Saviour's prediction, retired to Pella, a city on the other side of Jordan, whither the war did not reach. Miserable was the fate of such as either could not, or would not, leave that devoted city. Vespasian was now ordered to leave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, where he was at that time, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> with all speed into Judea. He did so accordingly at the head of a powerful army, ordering his son Titus in the mean time to bring two more legions from Alexandria; but before he could reach that country, the Jews had twice attempted to take the city of Afulon, and were each time repulsed with the loss of 10,000 of their number. In the beginning of the year 68, Vespasian entered Galilee at the head of an army of 60,000 men, all completely armed and excellently disciplined. He first took and burnt Gadera; then he laid siege to Jotapa, and took it after a stout resistance; at which he was so provoked, that he caused every one of the Jews to be massacred or carried into captivity, not one being left to carry the dreadful news to their brethren. Forty thousand perished on this occasion: only 1200 were made prisoners, among whom was Josephus the Jewish historian. Japha next shared the same fate, after an obstinate siege; all the men being massacred, and the women and children carried into captivity. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> after this, the Samaritans, who had assembled on Mount Gerizim, were almost all put to the sword, or perished. Joppa fell the next victim to the Roman vengeance. It had been formerly laid waste by C\u00e6lius; but was now repeopled and fortified by the sedulous Jews who infested the country. It was taken by storm, and shared the same fate with the rest. Four thousand Jews attempted to escape by taking to their ships; but were driven back by a sudden tempest, and all of them were drowned or put to the sword. Tarichea and Tiberias were next taken, but part of their inhabitants were spared on account of their peaceable dispositions. Then followed the sieges of Gamala, Gischala, and Itabry. The first was taken by storm, with a dreadful slaughter of the Jews; the last by stratagem. The inhabitants of Gischala were inclinable to surrender; but a sedulous Jew of that town, named John, the son of Levi, head of the faction, and a vile fellow, opposed it; and, having the mob at his back, overawed the whole city. On the Sabbath he begged of Titus to forbear hostilities till to-morrow, and then he would accept his offer; but instead of that, he fled to Jerusalem with as many as would follow him. The Romans, as soon as they were informed of his flight, pursued, and killed 6000 of his followers on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, and brought back near 3000 women and children prisoners. The inhabitants then surrendered to Titus; and only the factious were punished; and this completed the reduction of Galilee.\n\nThe Jewish nation by this time was divided into different very opposite parties: the one foreseeing that factions this war, if continued, must end in the total ruin among the of their country, were for putting an end to it by submitting to the Romans; the other, which was the remains of the faction of Judas Gaulonites, breathed nothing but war and confusion, and opposed all peaceable measures with invincible obstinacy. This last, which was by far the most numerous and powerful, consisted of men of the vilest and most profligate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARACTERS\">characters</a> that can be paralleled in history. They were proud, ambitious, cruel, rapacious, and committed the most horrid and unnatural crimes under the mask of religion. They affirmed everywhere, that it was offering the greatest dishonour to God to submit to any earthly potentate; much less to Romans and to heathens. This, they said, was the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOTIVE\">motive</a> that induced them to take up arms, and to bind themselves under the strictest obligations not to lay them down till they had either totally extirpated all foreign authority, or perished in the attempt.\u2014This dreadful dissension was not confined to Jerusalem, but had infected all the cities, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TOWNS\">towns</a>, and villages, of Palestine. Even houses and families were so divided against each other, that, as our Saviour had expressly foretold, a man's greatest enemies were often those of his own family and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a>. In short, if we may believe Josephus, the zealots acted more like incarnate devils than like men who had any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> left them.\u2014This obliged the contrary party likewise to rise up in arms in their own defence against those miscreants; from whom, however, they suffered much more than they did even from the exasperated Romans.\u2014The zealots began their outrages by murdering all that opposed them in the countries round about. Then they entered Jerusalem; but met with a stout opposition from the other party headed by Ananus, who had lately been high-priest. A fierce engagement ensued between them; and the zealots were driven into the inner cincture of the temple, where they were closely besieged. John of Gischala above-mentioned, who had pretended to side with the peaceable party, was then sent with terms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>; but, instead of advising the besieged to accept of them, he persuaded them still to hold out, and call the Idumeans to their assistance. They did so, and procured 20,000 of them to come to their relief; but these new allies were refused admittance into the city. On that night, however, there happened such a violent storm, accompanied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>, and an earthquake, that the zealots from within the inner court saw the bolts and hinges of the temple-gates without being heard, forced the guards of the besiegers, fell into the city, and led in the Idumeans. The city was instantly filled with butcheries of the most horrid kind. Barely to put any of the opposite party to death was thought too mild a punishment; they must have the pleasure of murdering them by inches: so that they made it now their diversion to put them to the most exquisite tortures that could be invented; nor could they be prevailed upon to dispatch them till the violence of their torments had rendered them quite.\nquite incapable of feeling them. In this manner perished 12,000 persons of noble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a>, and in the flower of their age; till at last the Idumeans complained so much against the putting such numbers to death, that the zealots thought proper to erect a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a>, which, however, was intended not for judgment but condemnation: for the judges having once acquitted a person who was manifestly innocent, the zealots not only murdered him in the temple, but depoed the new-created judges as persons unfit for their office.\n\nThe zealots, after having exterminated all those of any character or distinction, began next to wreak their vengeance on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> people. This obliged many of the Jews to forsake Jerusalem, and take refuge with the Romans, though the attempt was very hazardous; for the zealots had all the avenues well guarded, and failed not to put to death such as fell into their hands. Vespaian in the mean time stood at C\u00e6sarea an idle spectator of their outrages; well knowing that the zealots were fighting for him, and that the strength of the Jewish nation was gradually wasting away. Everything succeeded to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a>. The zealots, after having massacred or driven away the opposite party, turned their arms against each other. A party was formed against John, under one Simon who had his head-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> at the fortresses of Maffada. This new miscreant plundered, burned, and massacred, wherever he came, carrying the spoil into the fortresses above-mentioned. To increase his party, he caused a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a> to be published, by which he promised liberty to the slaves, and proportionable encouragement to the freemen who joined him. This stratagem had the desired effect, and he soon saw himself at the head of a considerable army. Not thinking himself, however, as yet master of force sufficient to besiege Jerusalem, he invaded Idumea with 20,000 men. The Idumeans opposed him with 25,000; and a sharp engagement ensued, in which neither party was victorious. But Simon, soon after, having corrupted the Idumean general, got their army delivered up to him. By this means he easily became master of the country; where he committed such cruelties, that the miserable inhabitants abandoned it to seek for shelter in Jerusalem.\n\nIn the city, matters went in the same way. John tyrannized in such a manner, that the Idumeans revolted, killed a great number of his men, plundered his palace, and forced him to retire into the temple. In the mean time the people, having taken a notion that he would fall out in the night and set fire to the city, called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a>, in which it was resolved to admit Simon with his troops, in order to oppose John and his zealots. Simon's first attempt against his rival, however, was ineffectual, and he was obliged to content himself with besieging the zealots in the temple. In the mean time, the miseries of the city were increased by the starting up of a third party headed by one Eleazar, who seized on the court of the priests, and kept John confined within that of the Israelites. Eleazar kept the avenues so well guarded, that none were admitted to come into that part of the temple but those who came thither to offer sacrifices; and it was by these offerings chiefly that he maintained himself and his men. John by this means found himself hemmed in between two powerful enemies, Simon below, and Eleazar above. He defended himself, however, against them both with great resolution; and when the city was invested by the Romans, having pretended to come to an agreement with his rivals, he found means totally to cut off or force Eleazar's men to submit to him, so that the factions were again reduced to two.\n\nThe Romans, in the year 72, began to advance towards the capital. In their way they destroyed many thousands, wasting the country as they went along; and in the year 73 arrived before the walls of Jerusalem, under Titus afterwards emperor. As he was a man of an exceedingly merciful disposition, and greatly desired to spare the city, he immediately sent offers of peace; but these were rejected with contempt, and he himself put in great danger of his life, so that he resolved to begin the siege in form. In the mean time, Simon and John renewed their hostilities with greater fury than ever. John now held the whole temple, some of the out-parts of it, and the valley of Cedron. Simon had the whole city to range in; in some parts of which John had made such devastations, that they served them for a field of battle, from which they fell in unanimously against the common enemy whenever occasion served; after which they returned to their usual hostilities, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> their arms against each other, as if they had sworn to make their ruin more easy to the Romans. These drew still nearer to the walls, having with great labour and pains levelled all the ground between Scopas and them, by pulling down all the houses and hedges, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> down the trees, and even cleaving the rocks that stood in their way, from Scopas to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a> of Herod, and Bethara or the pool of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a>; in which work so many hands were employed, that they finished it in four days.\n\nWhilst this was doing, Titus sent the besieged some offers of peace; and Josephus was pitched upon to be the messenger of them: but they were rejected with indignation. He sent a second-time Nicanor and Josephus with fresh offers, and the former received a wound in his shoulder; upon which Titus resolved to begin the assault in good earnest, and ordered his men to raze the suburbs, cut down all the trees, and use the materials to raise platforms against the wall. Every thing was now carried on with invincible ardour; the Romans began to play their engines against the city carried on with all their might. The Jews had likewise their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MACHINES\">machines</a> upon the walls, which they plied with uncommon fury: they had taken them lately from Caesius: but were so ignorant in their use, that they did little execution with them, till they were better instructed by some Roman deserters: till then, their chief success was rather owing to their frequent fallies; but the Roman legions, who had all their towers and machines before them, made terrible havoc. The least stones they threw were near 100 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>; and these they could throw the length of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> against the city, and with such a force, that they could do mischief on those that stood at some distance behind them. Titus had reared three towers 50 cubits high; one of which happening to fall in the middle of the night, greatly alarmed the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>, who immediately ran to arms at the noise of it; but Titus, upon knowing the cause, dismissed them, and caused it\nit to be set up again. These towers, being plated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, the Jews tried in vain to set fire to them, but were at length forced to retire out of the reach of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a>; by which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTERING\">battering</a>-rams were now at full liberty to play against the wall. A breach was soon made in it, at which the Romans entered: and the Jews, abandoning this last inclosure, retired behind the next. This happened about the 28th of April, a fortnight after the beginning of the siege.\n\nJohn defended the temple and the castle of Antonia, and Simon the rest of the city. Titus marched close to the second wall, and plied his battering-rams so furiously, that one of the towers, which looked towards the north, gave a prodigious shake. The men who were in it, made a signal to the Romans, as if they would surrender; and, at the same time, sent Simon word to be ready to give them a warm reception. Titus, having discovered their stratagem, plied his work more furiously, whilst the Jews that were in the tower set it on fire, and flung themselves into the flames. The tower being fallen, gave them an entrance into the second inclosure, five days after gaining the first; and Titus, who was bent on saving the city, would not suffer any part of the wall or streets to be demolished; which left the breach and lanes so narrow, that when his men were furiously repulsed by Simon, they had not room enough to make a quick retreat, so that there was a number of them killed in it. This oversight was quickly rectified; and the attack renewed with such vigour, that the place was carried four days after their first repulse.\n\nThe famine, raging in a terrible manner in the city, was soon followed by a pestilence; and as these two dreadful judgments increased, so did the rage of the factious, who, by their intestine feuds, had destroyed such quantities of provision, that they were forced to prey upon the people with the most unheard-of cruelty. They forced their houses; and, if they found any victuals in them, they butchered them for not appropriating them to it; and, if they found nothing but bare walls, which was almost everywhere the case, they put them to the most severe tortures, under pretence that they had some provision concealed. \"I should (says Josephus) undertake an impossible task, were I to enter into a detail of all the cruelties of those impious wretches; it will be sufficient to say, that I do not think, that since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> any city every suffered such dreadful calamities, or abounded with men so fertile in all kinds of wickedness.\"\n\nTitus, who knew their miserable condition, and was still willing to spare them, gave them four days to cool; during which he caused his army to be quartered, and provisions to be distributed to them in sight of the Jews, who flocked upon the walls to see it. Josephus was sent to speak to them afresh, and to exhort them not to run themselves into an inevitable ruin by obstinately persisting in the defence of a place which could hold out but a very little while, and which the Romans looked upon already as their own. But this stubborn people, after many bitter invectives, began to dart their arrows at him; at which, not at all discouraged, he went on with greater vehemence: but all the effect it wrought on them was, that it prevailed on great numbers to steal away privately to the Romans, whilst the rest became only the more desperate and resolute to hold out to the last, in spite of Titus's merciful offers.\n\nTo hasten therefore their destined ruin, he caused the city to be surrounded with a strong wall, to prevent either their receiving any succours or provision from abroad, or their escaping his resentment by flight. This wall, which was near 40 stadia or five miles in circuit, was yet carried on with such speed, and by so many hands, that it was finished in three days; by which one may guess at the ardour of the besiegers to make themselves masters of the city.\n\nThere was now nothing to be seen through the streets of Jerusalem but heaps of dead bodies rotting above-ground, walking skeletons, and dying wretches. As many as were caught by the Romans in their sallies, Titus caused to be sacrificed in sight of the town, to strike terror among the rest; but the zealots gave it out, that they were those who fled to him for protection; which when Titus understood, he sent a prisoner with his hands cut off to undeceive, and assure them, that he spared all that voluntarily came over to him; which encouraged great numbers to accept his offers, though the avenues were closely guarded by the factious, who put all to death who were caught going on that errand. A greater mischief than that was, that even those who escaped safe to the Roman camp were miserably butchered by the soldiers, from a notion which these had taken that they had swallowed great quantities of gold; so that two thousand of them were ripped up in one night, to come at their supposed treasure. When Titus was apprised of this barbarity, he would have condemned all those butchering wretches to death; but they proved so numerous, that he was forced to spare them, and contented himself with sending a proclamation through his camp, that as many as should be suspected thenceforward of that horrid villainy, should be put to immediate death: yet did not this deter many of them from it, only they did it more privately than before; so greedy were they of that bewitching metal. All this while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFECTION\">defection</a> increased, fill more through the inhumanity of the faction within, who made the miseries and dying groans of their starving brethren the subject of their cruel mirth, and carried their barbarity even to the sheathing of their swords in those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> wretches, under pretence of trying their sharpnesses.\n\nWhen they found therefore that neither their guards nor severities could prevent the people's flight, they had recourse to another stratagem equally impious and cruel: which was, to hire a pack of vile pretenders to prophecy, to go about and encourage the despairing remains of the people to expect a speedy and miraculous deliverance; and this imposture proved a greater expedient with that infatuated nation than their other precautions.\n\nNothing could be more dreadful than the famished condition to which they were now reduced. The poor, having nothing to trust to but the Roman's mercy or a speedy death, ran all hazards to get out of the city; and if in their flight, and wandering out for herbs or any other sustenance, they fell into the hands of any of Titus's parties sent about to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> the avenues, they were unmercifully scourged, and crucified if they made the least resistance. The rich within the walls were now\nnow forced, though in the most private manner, to give half, or all they were worth, for a measure of wheat, and the middling sort for one of barley. This they were forced to convey into some private place in their houses, and to feed upon it as it was, without daring to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> or grind it, much less to boil or bake it, lest the noisel or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> should draw the rapacious zealots to come and tear it from them. Not that these were reduced to any real want of provisions, but they had a double end in this barbarous plunder; to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-WIT\">wit</a>, the starving what they cruelly styled useless useless persons, and the keeping their own stores in reserve. It was upon this sad and pinching <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a>, that an unhappy mother was reduced to the extremity of butchering and eating her own child.\n\nWhen this news was spread through the city, the horror and consternation were as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> as they were inexplicable. It was then that they began to think themselves forsaken by the Divine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a>, and to expect the most terrible effects of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a> against the poor remains of their nation; insomuch that they began to envy those that had perished before them, and to wish their turn might come before the sad expected catastrophe. Their fears were but too just; since Titus, at the very first hearing of this inhuman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEED\">deed</a>, swore the total extirpation of city and people. \"Since (said he) they have so often refused my offers of pardon, and have preferred war to peace, rebellion to obedience, and famine, such a dreadful one especially, to plenty, I am determined to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> that accursed metropolis under its ruins, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a> may never shoot his beams on a city where the mothers feed on the flesh of their children, and the fathers, no less guilty than they, choose to drive them to such extremities, rather than lay down their arms.\"\n\nThe dreadful action happened about the end of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>, by which time the Romans, having pursued their attacks with fresh vigour, made themselves masters of the fortress Antonia; which obliged the Jews to set fire to those lately galleries which joined it to the temple, lest they should afford an easy passage to the besiegers into this last. About the same time Titus, with much difficulty, got materials for raising new mounds and terraces, in order to hasten the siege, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SAVE\">save</a>, if possible, the sad remains of that once glorious structure; but his pity proved still worse and worse bestowed on those obstinate wretches, who only became the more furious and desperate by it. Titus at length caused fire to be set to the gates, after having had a very bloody encounter, in which his men were repulsed with loss. The Jews were so terrified at it, that they suffered themselves to be devoured by the flames, without attempting either to extinguish them or save themselves. All this while Josephus did not cease exhorting the infatuated people to surrender, to represent to them the dreadful consequences of an obstinate resistance, and to assure them that it was out of mere compassion to them that he thus hazarded his own life to save theirs: he received one day such a wound in his head by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLEMENTS\">battlements</a>, as laid him for dead on the ground. The Jews fell immediately, to have seized on his body: but the Romans proved too quick and strong for them, and carried him off.\n\nBy this time the two factions within, but especially that of John, having plundered rich and poor of all they had, fell also on the treasury of the temple, whence John took a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of golden utensils, together with those magnificent gifts which had been presented to that sacred place by the Jewish kings, by Augustus, Livia, and many other foreign princes, and melted them all to his own use. The repositories of the sacred oil which was to maintain the lamps, and of the wine which was referred to accompany the usual sacrifices, were likewise seized upon, and turned into common use; and the last of this to such excess, as to make himself and his party drunk with it. All this while, not only the zealots, but many of the people, were still under such an infatuation, that though the fortress Antonia was lost, and nothing left but the temple, which the Romans were preparing to batter down, yet they could not persuade themselves that God would suffer that holy place to be taken by heathens, and were still expecting some sudden and miraculous deliverance. Even that vile minister John, who commanded there, either seemed confident of it, or else endeavoured to make them think him so. For, when Josephus was sent for the last time to upbraid his obstinately <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> that sacred building, and the miserable remains of God's people, to sudden and sure destruction, he only answered him with bitterest invectives; adding, that he was defending the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>'s vineyard, which he was sure could not be taken by any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> force. Josephus in vain reminded him of the many ways by which he had polluted both city and temple; and in particular of the seas of blood which he caused to be shed in both those sacred places, and which, he assured him from the old prophecies, were a certain sign and forerunner of their speedy surrender and destruction. John remained as inflexible as if all the prophets had assured him of a deliverance; till at length Titus, foreseeing the inevitable ruin of that stately edifice, which he was still extremely desirous to save, vouchsafed even himself to speak to them, and to persuade them to surrender. But the factious, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> upon this condemnation as the effects of his fear rather than generosity, only grew the more furious upon it, and forced him at last to come to those extremes which he had hitherto endeavoured to avoid. That his army, which was to attack the temple, might have the freer passage towards it through the castle Antonia, he caused a considerable part of the wall to be pulled down and levelled; which proved so very strong, that it took him up seven whole days, by which time they were far advanced in the month of July.\n\nIt was on the 17th day of that month, as all Josephus's copies have it, that the daily sacrifice ceased for sacrifice in the first time since its restoration by the brave Judas Maccabeus, there being no proper person left in the temple to offer it up. Titus caused the factious to be severely upbraided for it; exhorted John to set up whom he would to perform that office, rather than suffer the service of God to be set aside; and then challenged him and his party to come out of the temple, and fight on a more proper ground, and thereby save that sacred edifice from the fury of the Roman troops. When nothing could prevail on them, they began to set fire again to the gallery which formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> between the temple and the castle Antonia. The Jews\nJews had already burnt about 20 cubits of it in length; but this second blaze, which was likewise encouraged by the besieged, consumed about 14 more; after which, they beat down what remained standing. On the 27th of July, the Jews, having filled part of the western portico with combustible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, made a kind of flight; upon which, some of the forwardest of the Romans having scaled up to the top, the Jews set fire to it, which flamed with such sudden fury, that many of the former were consumed in it, and the rest, venturing to jump down from the battlements, were, all but one, crushed to death.\n\nOn the very next day, Titus having set fire to the north gallery, which inclosed the outer court of the temple, from Fort Antonia to the valley of Cedron, got an easy admittance into it, and forced the besieged into that of the priests. He tried in vain five days to batter down one of the galleries of that precinct with an helepolis; he was forced to mount his battering-rams on the terrace, which was raised by this time; and yet the strength of this wall was such, that it eluded the force of these also, though others of his troops were busy in fapping it. When they found that neither rams nor fapping could gain ground, they betook themselves of scaling; but were vigorously repulsed in the attempt, with the loss of some standards, and a number of men. When Titus therefore found that his desire of saving that building was like to cost too many lives, he set fire to the gates, which, being plated with silver, burnt all that night, whilst the metal dropped down in the melting. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> soon communicated itself to the porticoes and galleries; which the besieged beheld without offering to stop it, but contented themselves with sending whole volleys of impotent curses against the Romans. This was done on the eighth of August; and, on the next day, Titus, having given orders to extinguish the fire, called a council, to determine whether the remainder of the temple should be saved or demolished. That general was still for the former, and most of the rest declared for the latter; alleging, that it was no longer a temple, but a scene of war and slaughter, and that the Jews would never be at rest as long as any part of it was left standing; but when they found Titus stiffly bent on preserving so noble an edifice, against which he told them he could have no quarrel, they all came over to his mind. The next day, August the 10th, was therefore determined for a general assault; and the night before the Jews made two desperate fallies on the Romans; in the last of which, these, being timely succoured by Titus, beat them back into their inclosure.\n\nBut whether this last Jewish effort exasperated the besiegers, or, which is more likely, as Josephus thinks, pushed by the hand of Providence, one of the Roman soldiers, of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a>, took up a blazing firebrand, and, getting on his comrade's shoulders, threw it into one of the apartments that surrounded the sanctuary, through a window. This immediately let the whole north side in a flame up to the third story, on the same fatal day and month in which it had been formerly burnt by Nebuchadnezzar. Titus, who was gone to rest himself a while in his pavilion, was awaked at the noise, and ran immediately to give orders to have the fire extinguished. He called, prayed, threatened, and even caused his men, but in vain; the confusion was so great, and the soldiers so obstinately bent upon destroying all that was left, that he was neither heard nor minded. Those that flocked thither from the camp, instead of obeying his orders, were busy, either in killing the Jews, or in increasing the flames. When Titus observed that all his endeavours were vain, he entered into the sanctuary and the most holy place, in which he found still such sumptuous utensils and other riches as even exceeded all that had been told him of it. Out of the former he saved the golden candelstick, the table of shew-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, the altar of perfumes, all of pure gold, and the book or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the law, wrapped up in a rich gold tunic: but in the latter he found no utensils, because, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, they had not made a fresh ark since that of Solomon had been lost. Upon his coming out of that sacred place, some other soldiers set fire to it, and obliged those that had stood behind to come out; they all fell foul on the plunder of it, tearing even the gold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLATING\">plating</a> off the gates and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a> work, and carried off all the costly utensils, robes, &c. they found, inasmuch that there was not one of them who did not enrich himself by it.\n\nAn horrid massacre followed soon after, in which a dreadful great many thousands perished; some by the flames, massacre, others by the fall from the battlements, and a greater number by the enemy's sword, which destroyed all it met with, without distinction of age, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. Among them were upwards of 6000 persons who had been seduced thither by a false prophet, who promised them that they should find a speedy and miraculous relief there on that very day. Some of them remained five whole days on the top of the walls, and afterwards threw themselves on the general's mercy; but were answered that they had outlaid the time, and were led to execution. The Romans carried their fury to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> of all the treasure-houses of the place, though they were full of the richest furniture, plate, vestments, and other things of value, which had been laid up in those places for security. In a word, they did not cease burning and butchering, till they had destroyed all, except two of the temple-gates, and that part of the court which was destined for the women.\n\nIn the mean time the seditious made such a vigorous push, that they escaped the fury of the Romans, at least for the present, and retired into the city. But here they found all the avenues so well guarded, that there was no possibility left for them to get out; which obliged them to secure themselves as well as they could on the south side of it, from whence Simon, and John of Gischala, sent to desire a parley with Titus. They were answered, that though they had been the cause of all this bloodshed and ruin, yet they should have their lives spared, if they laid down their arms and surrendered themselves prisoners. To this they replied, that they had engaged themselves, by the most solemn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a>, never to surrender; and therefore, only begged leave to retire into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MOUNTAINS\">mountains</a> with their wives and children: which insolence so exasperated the Roman general, that he caused a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HERALD\">herald</a> to bid them stand to their defence; for that not one of them should be spared, since they had rejected his last offers of pardon. Immediately after this, he abandoned\nJews\n\ndenied the city to the fury of the soldiers, who fell forthwith on plundering, setting fire everywhere, and murdering all that fell into their hands; whilst the factious, who were left, went and fortified themselves in the royal palace, where they killed 8000 Jews who had taken refuge there.\n\nIn the mean time, great preparations were making for a vigorous attack on the upper city, especially on the royal palace; and this took them up from the 26th of August to the 7th of September, during which time great numbers came and made their submission to Titus. The warlike engines then played so furiously on the factious, that they were taken with a sudden panic; and, instead of fleeing to the towers of Hippicus, Phala\u00ebl, or Mariamne, which were yet untaken, and so strong that nothing but famine could have reduced them, they ran like madmen towards Siloah, with a design to have attacked the wall of circumvallation, and to have escaped out of the city; but, being there repulsed, they were forced to go and hide themselves in the public finks and common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEWERS\">sewers</a>, some one way and some another. All whom the Romans could find were put to the sword, and the city was set on fire. This was on the eighth of September, when the city was taken and entered by Titus. He would have put an end to the massacre; but his men killed all, except the most vigorous, whom they shut up in the porch of the women just mentioned. Fronto, who had the care of them, referred the youngest and most beautiful for Titus's triumph; and sent all that were above seventeen years of age into Egypt, to be employed in some public works there; and a great number of others were sent into several cities of Syria, and other provinces, to be exposed on the public theatre, to exhibit fights, or be devoured by wild beasts. The number of those prisoners amounted to 97,000, besides about 11,000 more, who were either starved through neglect, or starved themselves through fullness and despair.\u2014The whole number of Jews who perished in this war is computed at upwards of 1,400,000.\n\nBesides these, however, a vast number perished in caves, woods, wildernesses, common-fews, &c. of whom no computation could be made. Whilst the soldiers were still busy in burning the remains of the city, and visiting all the hiding-places, where they killed numbers of poor creatures who had endeavoured to evade their cruelty, the two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> rebels Simon and John were found, and referred for the triumph of the conqueror. John, being pinched with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>, soon came out; and having begged his life, obtained it; but was condemned to perpetual imprisonment. Simon, whose retreat had been better stored, held out till the end of October. The two chiefs, with 700 of the handsomest Jewish captives, were made to attend the triumphal chariot; after which Simon was dragged through the streets with a rope about his neck, severely scourged, and then put to death; and John was sent into perpetual imprisonment.\u2014Three castles still remained untenanted, namely, Herodion, Macheron, and Massada. The two former capitulated; but Massada held out. The place was exceedingly strong both by nature and art, well stored with all kinds of provisions, and defended by a numerous gar-\n\nrison of zealots, at the head of whom was one Eleazar, the grandson of Judas Gaulonites, formerly mentioned. The Roman general having in vain tried his engines and battering-rams against it, bethought himself of surrounding it with a high and strong wall, and then ordered the gates to be set on fire. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> pushed the flames so fiercely against the Jews, that Eleazar in despair persuaded them first to kill their wives and children, and then to choose ten men by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a>, who should kill all the rest; and lastly one out of the surviving ten to dispatch them and himself; only this last man was ordered to set fire to the place before he put an end to his own life. All this was accordingly done; and on the morrow, when the Romans were preparing to scale the walls, they were greatly surprized neither to see nor hear any thing more. On this they made such an hideous outcry, that two women, who had concealed themselves in an aqueduct, came forth and acquainted them with the desperate catastrophe of the besieged.\n\nThus ended the Jewish nation and worship; nor have they ever since been able to regain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> loss of the destruction in the country of Judea, nor indeed in any nation of other country on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, though there is scarce any part their city of the globe where they are not to be found. They continue their vain expectations of a Messiah to deliver them from the low estate into which they are fallen; and, notwithstanding their repeated disappointments, there are few who can ever be persuaded to embrace Christianity. Their ceremonies and religious worship ought to be taken from the law of Moses; but they have added a multitude of absurdities not worth the inquiring after. In many countries, and in different ages, they have been terribly massacred, and in general have been better treated by the Mahometans and Pagans than by Christians. Since the revival of arts and learning, however, they have felt the benefit of that increase of humanity which has diffused itself almost over the globe. It is said, that in this country the life of a Jew was formerly at the disposal of the chief lord where he lived, and likewise all his goods. So strong also were popular prejudices and suspicions against them, that in the year 1348, a fatal endemic distemper raging in a great part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, it was said that they had poisoned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPRINGS\">springs</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELLS\">wells</a>; in consequence of which a million and a half of them were cruelly massacred. In 1492, half a million of them were driven out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, and 150,000 from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>. Edward I. did the same. In short, they were everywhere persecuted, oppressed, and most rigorously treated.\n\nIn this enlightened period a more generous system is followed. France has allowed them the rights of citizens, which induces numbers of the most wealthy Jews to fix their residence in that country. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLAND\">Poland</a> granted them very great privileges and immunities; England, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRUSSIA\">Prussia</a> tolerate and protect them; and the emperor has revoked some restrictions, for which an edict was passed: Spain, Portugal, and some of the Italian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, are still, however, it is said, averse to their dwelling among them.","sp":157,"ep":174},{"h":"JEZIDES","t":"among the Mahometans; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of familiar import with heretics among <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>.\n\nThe Jezides are a numerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> inhabiting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a>\nand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>, so called from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> Jezid, an Arabian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, who flew the sons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ALI\">Ali</a>, Mahomet's father in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>; for which reason he is reckoned a paricide, and his followers heretics.

The town of Jidda itself receives but little advantage, for all the customs are immediately sent to the needy and rapacious sherif of Mecca and his dependents. \"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> (says Mr Bruce) is returned in bags and boxes, and passes on as rapidly to the ships as the goods do to the market, and leaves as little profit behind.

He cannot marry more than one wife, because he cannot maintain more; and from this cause arises the want of people and the number of unmarried women.\"\n\nThe trade at Jidda is carried on in a manner which appeared very strange to our traveller. \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">Nine</a> ships (says he) were there from India; some of them worth, I suppose 200,000l. One merchant, a Turk, living at Mecca, 30 hours journey off, where no Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DARES\">dares</a> go, whilst the continent is open to the Turk for escape, offers to purchase the cargoes of four out of these nine ships himself; another of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> comes and says he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> buy none unless he has them all. The samples are shown, and the cargoes of the whole nine ships are carried into the wildest parts of Arabia by men with whom one would not wish to trust himself alone in the field. This is not all; two India brokers come into the room to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> the price; one on the part of the India <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a>, the other on that of the buyer the Turk. They are neither Mahomets nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, but have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> with both. They sit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> on the carpet, and take an India shawl which they carry on their shoulder like a napkin, and spread it over their hands. They talk in the mean time indifferent conversation, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> they were employed in no serious business whatever. After about 20 minutes spent in handling each other's fingers below the shawl, the bargain is concluded, say for nine ships, without one word ever having been spoken on the subject, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEN\">pen</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INK\">ink</a> used in any shape whatever. There never was one instance of a dispute happening in these sales. But this is not all; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> is yet to be paid. A private Moor, who has nothing to support him but his character, becomes responsible for the payment of these cargoes. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> delivers a number of coarse hessian bags full of what is supposed to be money. He marks the contents upon the bag, and puts his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a> upon the string that ties the mouth of it. This is received for what is marked upon it without any one ever having opened one of the bags; and in India it is current for the value marked upon it as long as the bag lasts.\n\nThe port of Jidda is very extensive, and contains numberless shoals, small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>, and sunk rocks, with deep channels, however, between them; but in the harbour itself ships may ride secure, whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WIND\">wind</a> blows. The only danger is in the coming in or going out; but as the pilots are very skilful, accidents are never known to happen. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARTS\">charts</a> of this harbour, as Mr Bruce informs us, are exceedingly erroneous. While he laid here, he was desired by Captain Thornhill to make a new chart of the harbour; but finding that it had been undertaken by another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, Captain Newland, he dropped it. He argues in the strongest terms against the old maps, which he says can be of no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a>, but the contrary; and he gives it as a characteristic of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RED_SEA\"><a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a> Sea, \"scarce to have foundings in any part of the channel, and often on both sides; whilst ashore, foundings are hardly found a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> length from the main. To this, says he, I will add, that there is scarce one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> on which I ever was, where the bowspirit was not over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, while there were no foundings by a line heaved over the stern.

Yet they had made no estimation of the currents without the straits, nor the different very strong ones soon after passing Socotra; their half-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> glasses, upon a medium, ran 57 seconds; they had made no observations on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> or currents in the Red Sea, either in the channel or in the inward passage; yet there is delineated in this map a chart of Captain Newland's, which he kept in the middle of the channel, full of sharp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> and short stretches; you would think every yard was measured and founded!\"\n\nJIG.

The Suttee Jogue (or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of purity) is said to have lasted three million two hundred thousand years; and they hold that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> was extended in that age to one hundred thousand years, and that his stature was 21 cubits.\n\n2.

The Dwapaar Jogue (in which half of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> became depraved) endured one million six hundred thousand years, and the life of man was then reduced to a thousand years.\n\n4. The Collee Jogue (in which all mankind are corrupted, or rather lessened, for that is the true meaning of Collee) is the present era, which they suppose ordained to fulfill four hundred thousand years, of which near five thousand are already past; and the life of man in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> is limited to one hundred years.\n\nConcerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> chronology, we have already had occasion to be pretty copious; see HINDOOS, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">No</a>. 19, 22. We shall here, however, subjoin Dr Robertson's observations on the above periods, from the Notes to his Historical Disquisition concerning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>.\n\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> (says he *) we suppose the computation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> * p. 360, in the Indian chronology to be made by solar or even by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LUNAR\">lunar</a> years, nothing can be more extravagant in itself, or more repugnant to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of calculating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of the world, founded on sacred and infallible authority. From one circumstance, however, which merits <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, we may conclude, that the informa-\ntion which we have hitherto received concerning the chronology of the Hindoos is very incorrect. We have, as far as I know, only five <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> accounts of the different Jogue or eras of the Hindoos. The first is given by M. Rogers who received it from the Brahmins on the Coromandel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>. According to it, the Suttee Jogue is a period of one million <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> hundred and twenty-eight thousand years; the Tirtah Jogue is one million two hundred and ninety-six thousand years; the Dwapaa Jogue is eight hundred and sixty-four thousand. The duration of the Collee Jogue he does not specify; (Porte Ouverte, p. 179.). The next is that of M. Bernier, who received it from the Brahmins of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENARES\">Benares</a>. According to him, the duration of the Suttee Jogue was two million five hundred thousand years; that of the Tirtah Jogue, one million two hundred thousand years; that of the Dwapaa Jogue is eight hundred and sixty-four thousand years. Concerning the period of the Collee Jogue, he likewise is silent; (Voyager, tom. ii. p. 163.). The third is that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> Dow; according to which the Suttee Jogue is a period of fourteen million of years, the Tirtah Jogue one million eighty thousand, the Dwapaa Jogue seventy-two thousand, and the Collee Jogue thirty-five thousand years; (Hist. of Hindost., vol. i. p. 2.). The fourth account is that of M. le Gentil, who received it from the Brahmins of the Coromandel coast; and as his information was acquired in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of India, and derived from the same source with that of M. Roger, it agrees with his in every particular; (Mem. de l'Academ. des Sciences pour 1772, tom. ii. part i. p. 176.). The fifth is the account of Mr Halhed, which has been already given. From this discrepancy, not only of the total numbers, but of many of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> in the different accounts, it is manifest that our information concerning Indian chronology is hitherto as uncertain as the whole system of it is wild and fabulous. To me it appears highly probable, that when we understand more thoroughly the principles upon which the fictitious eras or jogues of the Hindoos have been formed, that we may be more able to reconcile their chronology to the true mode of computing time, founded on the authority of the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>; and may likewise find reason to conclude, that the account given by their astronomers of the situation of the heavenly bodies at the beginning of the Collee Jogue, is not established by actual observation, but the result of a retrospective calculation.","sp":328,"ep":329},{"h":"JOHN","t":"St, the Baptist, the forerunner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ, was the son of Zacharias and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>.

After the death of Domitian, he returned to Ephesus, where he composed his Gospel, about the year 95; and died there, in the reign of Trajan, about the year 100, aged 94.\n\nGospel of St John, a canonical book of the New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a>, containing a recital of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>, actions, doctrine, and death, of our Saviour Jesus Christ, written by St John the apostle and evangelist.\n\nSt John wrote his Gospel at Ephesus, after his return from the isle of Patmos, at the desire of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> of Asia. St Jerome says, he would not undertake it, but on condition that they should appoint a public fast to implore the affluence of God; and that, the fast being ended, St John, filled with the Holy Ghost, broke out into these words: \"In the beginning was the Word,\" &c. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a> assign two reasons for this undertaking: the first is, because, in the other three Gospels, there was wanting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of the beginning of Jesus Christ's preaching, till the imprisonment of John the Baptist, which therefore he applied himself particularly to relate. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> reason was, in order to remove the errors of the Cerinthians, Ebionites, and other sects. But Mr Lampe and Dr Lardner have urged several reasons to show that St John did not write against Cerinthus or any other heretics in his Gospel.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">Revelation</a> of St John. See Apocalypse.\n\nJohn of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALISBURY\">Salisbury</a>, bishop of Chartres in France, was born at Salisbury in Wiltshire, in the beginning of the 12th century. Where he imbibed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a>, is unknown; but we learn, that in the year 1136, being then a youth, he was sent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, where he studied under several eminent professors, and acquired considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> for his application and proficiency in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>, and particularly in the learned languages.

What preferment he had in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> during this time, does not appear; but in 1176 he was promoted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> Henry II. to the bishopric of Chartres in France, where he died in 1182.

He wrote several books; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> of which are, his Life of St Thomas of Canterbury, a collection of letters, and Polycraticon.\n\nPope John XXII, a native of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAHORS\">Cahors</a>, before called James d'Euze, was well skilled in the civil and canon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>; and was elected pope after the death of Clement V. on the 7th of August 1316.

Under this pope arose the famous question among the cordeliers, called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> of the cordeliers; which was, Whether those monks had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the things given them, at the time they were making <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of them? for example, Whether the bread belonged to them when they were eating it, or to the pope, or to the Roman church? This frivolous question gave great employment to the pope; as well as those which turned upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, form, and stuff, of their habits, whether they ought to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>, gray, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>; whether the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COWL\">cowl</a> ought to be pointed or round, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> or small; whether their robes ought to be full, short, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a>; of cloth, or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SERGE\">serge</a>, &c. The disputes on all these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> trifles were carried so far between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a> brothers, that some of them were burned upon the occasion.

He was born at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> in 1574, and was educated at the public school there under the great Camden. He was descended from a Scottish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>; and his father, who lost his estate under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>, dying before our poet was born, and his mother marrying a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRICKLAYER\">bricklayer</a> for her second husband, Ben was taken from school to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> at his father-in-law's trade. Not being captivated with this employment, he went into the Low Countries, and distinguished himself in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> capacity. On his return to England, he entered himself at St John's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>; and having killed a person in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUEL\">duel</a>, was condemned, and narrowly escaped execution. After this he turned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTOR\">actor</a>; and Shakespeare is said to have first introduced him to the world, by recommending a play of his to the stage, after it had been rejected. His Alchymist gained him such reputation, that in 1619 he was, at the death of Mr Daniel, made poet-laureate to King James I. and master of arts at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>. As we do not find Johnson's economical virtues anywhere recorded, it is the less to be wondered at, that after this we find him petitioning King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a>, on his accession, to enlarge his father's allowance of 100 merks into pounds; and quickly after we learn that he was very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> and sick, lodging in an obscure alley; on which occasion it was, that Charles, being prevailed on in his favour, sent him ten guineas; which Ben receiving laid, \"His majesty has sent me ten guineas, because I am poor, and live in an alley; go and tell him, that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> lives in an alley.\" He died in August 1637, aged 63 years, and was buried in Westminster-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">Abbey</a>. The most complete edition of his works was printed in 1756, in 7 vols 8vo.\n\nJohnson, Dr Samuel, who has been styled the brightest ornament of the 18th century, was born in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LITCHFIELD\">Litchfield</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFFORDSHIRE\">Staffordshire</a>, on the 18th of September S. S. 1729. His father Michael was a bookseller; and must have had some reputation in the city, as he more than once bore the office of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>. By what cautious reasoning he reconciled his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OATHS\">oaths</a> required to be taken by all who occupy such stations, cannot now be known; but it is certain that he was zealously attached to the exiled family, and instilled the same principles into the youthful mind of his son. So much was he in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> in this work, and at so early a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> did he commence it, that when Dr Sacheverel, in his memorable tour through England, came to Litchfield, Mr Johnson carried his son, not then quite three years old, to the cathedral, and placed him on his shoulders, that he might see as well as hear the far-famed preacher.\n\nBut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> prejudices were not the only bad things which young Sam inherited from his father: he derived from the same source a morbid melancholy, which, though it neither depraved his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a>, nor clouded his perspicuity, filled him with dreadful apprehensions of infancy, and rendered him wretched through life.\nJohnson's life. From his nurse he contracted the *serofula* or king's evil, which made its appearance at a very early period, disfigured a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a> naturally well-formed, and deprived him of the sight of one of his eyes.\n\nWhen arrived at a proper age for grammatical instruction, he was placed in the free school of Litchfield, of which one Mr Hunter was then master; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> whom his illustrious pupil thought \"very severe, and wrong-headedly severe,\" because he would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> a boy for not answering questions which he could not expect to be asked. He was, however, a skilful teacher; and Johnson, when he stood in the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of learning, was sensible how much he owed to him; for upon being asked how he had acquired so accurate a knowledge of the Latin tongue, he replied, \"My master beat me very well; without that, Sir, I should have done nothing.\"\n\nAt the age of 15 Johnson was removed from Litchfield to the school of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOURBRIDGE\">Stourbridge</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORCESTERSHIRE\">Worcestershire</a>, at which he remained little more than a year, and then returned home, where he stood two years without any settled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of life or any regular course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>. He read, however, a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> in a deftful manner, as chance threw books in his way, and as inclination directed him through them; so that when in his 19th year he was entered a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMONER\">commoner</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEMBROKE\">Pembroke</a> college, Oxford, his mind was stored with a variety of such knowledge as is not often acquired in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a>, where boys seldom read any books but what are put into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> by their tutors. He had given very early proofs of his poetical genius both in his school exercises and in other occasional compositions: but what is perhaps more remarkable, as it shows that he must have thought much on a subject on which other boys of that age seldom think at all, he had before he was 14 entertained doubts of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of revelation. From the melancholy of his temper these would naturally prey upon his spirits, and give him great uneasiness: but they were happily removed by a proper course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a>; for \"his studies being honest, ended in conviction. He found that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> is true; and what he had learned, he ever afterwards endeavoured to teach.\"","sp":329,"ep":331},{"h":"JOHNSTON","t":"Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARTHUR\">ARTHUR</a>, was born at Caskieben, near Aberdeen, the seat of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, and probably was educated at Aberdeen, as he was afterwards advanced to the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> in that university. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> he chiefly applied himself to was that of physic; and to improve himself in that science, he travelled into foreign parts. He was twice at Rome; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of his residence was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PADUA\">Padua</a>, in which university the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of M.D. was conferred on him in 1610, as appears by a MS. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of verses in the advocate's library in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>. After leaving Padua, he travelled through the rest of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, and over Germany, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>, England, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, and other countries; and at length settled in France; where he met with great applause as a Latin poet. He lived there 20 years, and by two wives had 13 children. After 24 years' absence, he returned into Scotland in 1632. It appears by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> books at Edinburgh, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> before that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> about that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. In the year following, it is very well known that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I. went into Scotland, and made Bishop Laud, then with him, a member of that council; and by this accident, it is probable, that acquaintance began between the doctor and that prelate, which produced his \"Psalterium Davidis Paraphrastum Poetica;\" for we find that, in the same year, the doctor printed a specimen of his Psalms at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, and dedicated them to his lordship.\n\nHe proceeded to perfect the whole, which took him up four years; and the first edition complete was published at Aberdeen in 1637, and at London the same year. In 1641, Dr Johnston being at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, on a visit to one of his daughters who was married to a divine of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of England in that place, was seized with a violent diarrhoea, of which he died in a few days, in the 54th year of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, not without having seen the beginning of those troubles that proved fatal to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a>. He was buried in the place where he died; which gave occasion to the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINES\">lines</a> of his learned friend Wedderburn in his Sapphira on the doctor's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>:\n\nScotia maga, dole, tanti viduata sepulchro\nVatis: is Angligenis contigit altius honos\n\nIn what year Dr Johnston was made physician to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">king</a> does not appear: it is most likely that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> procured him that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> at his coming into England in 1633, at which time he translated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a>'s Song into Latin elegiac <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERSE\">verse</a>, and dedicated it to his majesty. His Psalms were reprinted at Middleburgh, 1642; London, 1657; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a>, 1661; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMSTERDAM\">Amsterdam</a> 1706; Edinburgh, by William Lauder, 1739; and last on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of the Delphin classics, at London, 1741, 8vo, at the expense of Auditor Benson, who dedicated them to his late majesty, and prefixed to this edition <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMOIRS\">memoirs</a> of Dr Johnston, with the testimonies of various learned persons.

He was at first put apprentice to a joiner; but early distinguished himself by his inclination to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGNING\">designing</a>, and was particularly taken notice of for his skill in landscape-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>. This afterwards recommended him to the favour of William <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PEMBROKE\">Pembroke</a>, who sent him abroad with a handsome allowance in order to perfect himself in that branch. He was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> sooner at Rome, than he found himself in his proper sphere: he felt that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> had not formed him to decorate cabinets, but to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> palaces. He dropt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> and conceived Whitehall. In the state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VENICE\">Venice</a> he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the works of Palladio, and learned how beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> may be exerted on a less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a> than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of an empire. How his abilities distinguished themselves in a spot where they certainly had no opportunity to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a>, we are not told, though it would not be the least curious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>; certain it is, that, on the strength of his reputation at Venice, Christian IV invited him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a>, and appointed him his architect; but on what buildings he was employed in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, we are yet to learn. James I. found him at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPENHAGEN\">Copenhagen</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a> took him in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of her architect to Scotland. He served <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a> Henry in the same capacity, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of surveyor-general of the works was granted to him in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVERSION\">reversion</a>. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of that prince, with whom at least all his lamented qualities did not die, Jones travelled once more into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, and, afflicted by ripeness of judgment, perfected his taste. To the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> between these voyages Mr Walpole is inclined to assign those buildings of Inigo, which are less pure, and border too much upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BASTARD\">bastard</a> style, which one may call <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KING\">King</a> James's Gothic. Inigo's designs of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> are not Gothic, but have a littleness of parts, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of ornaments, with which the revival of the Grecian taste was encumbered, and which he shook off in his grander designs. The surveyor's place fell, and he returned to England; and, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a> was not all he had learned at Rome, with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of Roman disinterestedness he gave up the profits of his office, which he found extremely in debt; and prevailed upon the comptroller and paymaster to imitate his example, till the whole arrears were cleared.\n\nIn 1620, he was employed in a manner very unworthy of his genius: King James set him upon discovering, that is, gulling, who were the founders of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONEHENGE\">Stonehenge</a>. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> were all Romanized; consequently, his partiality to his favourite people, which ought rather to have prevented him from charging them with that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of barbarous clumsiness, made him conclude it a Roman temple.\n\nIn the same year Jones was appointed one of the commissioners for the repair of St Paul's; but which was not commenced till the year 1633, when Laud, then bishop of London, laid the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, and Inigo the fourth. In the restoration of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CATHEDRAL\">cathedral</a>, he made two capital faults. He first renewed the sides with very bad Gothic; and then added a Roman portico, magnificent and beautiful indeed, but which had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> parts that remained, and made his own Gothic appear ten times heavier. He committed the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WINCHESTER\">Winchester</a>, thrusting a screen in the Roman or Grecian taste into the middle of that cathedral. Jones indeed was by no means successful when he attempted Gothic. The chapel of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINCOLN\">Lincoln</a>'s-Inn has none of the characteristics of that architecture. The cloister beneath seems oppressed by the weight of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> above.\n\nThe authors of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a> of Jones place the erecting of the Banqueting-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> in the reign of King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a>; but it appears, from the accounts of Nicholas Stone, that it was begun in 1619, and finished in two years\u2014a small part of the pile designed for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of our kings; but so complete in itself, that it stands a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of the most pure and beautiful taste. Several plates of the intended palace at Whitehall have been given; but Mr Walpole thinks, from no finished design. The four great sheets are evidently made up from general hints; nor could such a source of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> and taste as the mind of Inigo ever produce so much fancies. The whole fabric, however, was so glorious an idea, that one forgets for a moment (says Mr Walpole), in the regret for its not being executed, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of our liberties, obtained by a melancholy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> that passed before the windows of that very Banqueting-house.\n\nIn 1623 he was employed at Somerset-house, where a chapel was to be fitted up for the Infanta, the intended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BRIDE\">bride</a> of the prince. The chapel is still in being. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> to the river, part only of what was designed, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>-gate, were erected afterwards on the designs of Inigo, as was the gate at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a>-stairs.\n\nOn the accession of Charles, Jones was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in\nhis posts under both king and queen. His fee as surveyor was \u00a33. 4d. a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, with an allowance of \u00a361 a-year for house-rent, besides a clerk, and incidental expenses. What greater rewards he had, are not upon record.\n\nDuring the prosperous state of the king's affairs, the pleasures of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> were carried on with much taste and magnificence. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">Poetry</a>, painting, music, and architecture, were all called in to make them rational amusements. Mr Walpole is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that the celebrated festivals of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIV. were copied from the shows exhibited at Whitehall, in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the most polite court in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. Ben Johnson was the laureat; Inigo Jones the inventor of the decorations; Lanier and Farnolco composed the symphonies; the king, the queen, and the young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>, danced in the interludes. We have accounts of many of those entertainments, called masques; they had been introduced by Anne of Denmark. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURLINGTON\">Burlington</a> had a folio of the designs for these solemnities, by Inigo's own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, consisting of habits, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MASKS\">masks</a>, scenes, &c. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> of these masks was a little interrupted by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> that broke out between the composers, Inigo and Ben, in which whoever was the aggressor, the turbulent temper of Johnson took care to be most in the wrong.\n\nThe works of Inigo Jones are not scarce; Surgeon's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HALL\">hall</a> is one of his best works. One of the most admired is the arcade of Covent-garden, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a>: \"Two structures (says Mr Walpole), of which I want taste to see the beauties. In the arcade there is nothing remarkable; the pilasters are as arrant and homely stripes as any plasterer would make. The barn-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> over the portico of the church strikes my eyes with as little idea of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, as it could do if it covered nothing but a barn. It must be owned, that the defect is not in the architecture, but in the order.\u2014Whoever saw a beautiful Tuscan building? Would the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> have chosen that order for a temple?\" The expense of building that church was \u00a3500.\n\nAmbrosebury in Wiltshire was designed by Jones, but executed by his scholar Webb. Jones was one of the first that observed the same diminution of pilasters as in pillars. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LINDSEY\">Lindsey</a>-house in Lincoln's-Inn Fields, which he built, owes its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> to this singularity. In 1618, a special <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> was issued to the lord-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a>, the earls of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORCESTER\">Worcester</a>, Pembroke, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ARUNDEL\">Arundel</a>, and others, to plant and reduce to uniformity, Lincoln's-Inn Fields, as it shall be drawn by way of map, or ground-plot, by Inigo Jones, surveyor-general of the works. That <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> is laid out with a regard to so trifling a singularity, as to be of the exact dimensions of one of the pyramids: this would have been admired in those ages when the keep at Kenilworth Castle was erected in the form of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>-fetter, and the Escorial in the shape of St Laurence's gridiron.\n\nColehill in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BERKSHIRE\">Berkshire</a>, the seat of Sir Matthew Pleydell, built in 1650, and Cobham-hall in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KENT\">Kent</a>, were Jones's. He was employed to rebuild Castle Ashby, and finished one front: but the civil war interrupted his progress there and at Stoke-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARK\">park</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTHAMPTONSHIRE\">Northamptonshire</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHAFTESBURY\">Shaftesbury</a>-house, now the London Lying-in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a>, on the east side of Aldergate-street, is a\n\nbeautiful front. The Grange, the seat of the lord chancellor Henley in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAMPSHIRE\">Hampshire</a>, is entirely of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>. It is not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> house, but by far one of the best proofs of his taste. The hall, which opens to a small vestibule with a cupola, and the staircase adjoining, are beautiful models of the purest and most classic antiquity. The gate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEAUFORT\">Beaufort</a>-garden at Chelsea, designed by Jones, was purchased by Lord Burlington, and transported to Chilwick. He drew a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> for a palace at Newmarket; but not that wretched hovel that stands there at present. One of the most beautiful of his works is the queen's house at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GREENWICH\">Greenwich</a>. The first idea of the hospital is said to have been taken from his papers by his scholar Webb. Heriot's hospital in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, and the improvements made in his time on Glamis castle in Forfarshire in Scotland, are specimens of the designs of Inigo Jones.\n\nInigo taunted early the misfortunes of his master. He was not only a favourite, but a Roman Catholic: in 1646 he paid \u00a345. for his delinquency and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEQUESTRATION\">sequestration</a>. Whether it was before or after this fine, it is uncertain, that he and Stone the mason buried their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> stock in Scotland yard; but an order being published to encourage the informers of such concealments, and four persons being privy to the spot where the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> was hid, it was taken up, and reburied in Lambeth-marsh. Grief, misfortunes, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, put an end to his life at Somerset-house, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a> 21, 1651. Several of his designs have been published by Mr Kent, Mr Colin Campbell, and Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WARE\">Ware</a>. He left in MS. some curious notes on Palladio's architecture, which are inserted in an edition of Palladio published in 1714.\n\nJones, Sir William, the son of William Jones Esq., an eminent mathematician, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> with the great Newton, was born in London on the 28th of September 1746, and received the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RUDIMENTS\">rudiments</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HARROW\">Harrow</a> school, under the tuition of Dr Robert Sumner, whom he has celebrated in a eulogium which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> probably be coeval with time. From Harrow school he went to University <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a>, where the rapidity of his literary acquisitions excited the admiration of all.\n\nHe travelled through France at the age of 23, taking up his residence for some time at Nice, where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, and the various forms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, became the favourite objects of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>. A wish to relieve his mother from the burden of his education, made him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> for a fellowship in his college, but having no immediate prospect of obtaining it, he in 1765 became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a> to young Lord Althorp, afterwards Earl Spencer, in which situation he was introduced to the best of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>, and had also leisure to prosecute the acquisition of knowledge, and the farther cultivation of his intellectual powers, which were objects ever dear to him.\n\nHe obtained next year, the fellowship he expected, and was thus raised to a state which he could not help viewing as independent. Being at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPA\">Spa</a> with his pupil in the year 1767, he employed much of his time in making himself acquainted with the German <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>; and in the following year he was requested by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of Grafton's under-secretary, to undertake a translation of a Persian MS. of the life of Nadir Shah, into the French language, of which the king of Denmark was anxious.\nanxious to have a version. This, his first publication, appeared in 1770, with the addition of a treatise on oriental poetry, which was very much admired, on account of the elegance of the French style and the accuracy of the translation. For this excellent publication it appears that he received nothing more than a diploma from his Danish majesty, constituting him a member of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> of Copenhagen, with a warm recommendation to the notice of his own sovereign.\n\nThat he might be enabled to gratify his commendable ambition, he now began to think seriously of some profession through life; and, as he had conceived an early predilection for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, he made that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his choice; and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of September 1770, he entered at the Temple. Yet the studies of his profession did not prevent him from making those literary advances, in which he took delight, and oriental literature still continued a favourite object. When the life of Zoroaster by Anquetil du Perron made its appearance, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> discourse to which the university of Oxford had been attacked, our author defended it in a pamphlet written with severity and with elegance. In 1772, he published a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of poems, being translations from the Asiatic poets, remarkable for the grace and brilliancy of their style; and in 1774 appeared his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> \"De Poesi Afiatica,\" the beauty and purity of the Latin in which it is composed, exciting the admiration of men of literature both at home and abroad. He was called to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> in the beginning of 1774, but declined to act in that capacity without a previous knowledge of the actual business of the profession. He was appointed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMISSIONER\">commissioner</a> of bankrupts in 1776, about which period he addressed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Lord Althorpe, in which he beautifully expresses his ardent wish to have constitutional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> established by constitutional means.\n\nHis translation of the speeches of Iseus, on account of his elegant style, his profound critical and historical knowledge, commanded the admiration of every competent judge. Soon after this his practice at the bar increased with rapidity; but he had little reason to flatter himself with the prospect of advancement in professional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and dignity, because he was known to be convinced of the injustice of the British cause respecting the American war, which he was at no pains to conceal; and therefore an opponent of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of those who had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of public affairs, had little pretension to look for. In 1780 he became a candidate to succeed to Sir Roger Newdigate as representative in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> for the university of Oxford, in which he was respectfully supported; but his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> sentiments were ill suited to secure him a majority, which made him decline the contest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a>. He soon after published a pamphlet entitled \"An Inquiry into the legal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of suppressing riots, with a constitutional plan of future <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>,\" recommending the propriety of making every citizen a soldier in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of imminent danger. He next published a translation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> ancient poems of the highest reputation in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>, which, with an ode on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> of Lord Althorpe, procured for him the highest reputation. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> on the laws of bailments was also much admired, as was his speech at the London tavern.\n\nin defence of a parliamentary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFORM\">reform</a> in 1782. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, he drew up a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIALOGUE\">dialogue</a> between a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARMER\">farmer</a> and a country <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> on the principles of government, published in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEAN\">dean</a> of St Asaph, for which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDICTMENT\">indictment</a> was preferred against that clergyman. In a letter to Lord Kenyon, Mr Jones avowed himself to be the author, and asserted the principles it contained to be perfectly agreeable to the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>; but it appears that he afterwards relaxed considerably in his political ardour.\n\nAfter the resignation of Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a>, and appointment of Lord Shelburne, Mr Jones was nominated one of the judges in the British territories of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, an appointment which he had long wished for, as it would afford him an opportunity of prosecuting his favourite researches into oriental literature. He was chosen a judge in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1783, and on the 20th of that month the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KNIGHTHOOD\">knighthood</a> was conferred upon him. He arrived at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-CALCUTTA\">Calcutta</a> in September, and entered upon his office in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a>, opening the sessions with a very elegant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a>. Here he planned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> of a society similar to the Royal Society of London, many valuable labours and researches of which are already in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the public. He collected materials for a complete digest of the Hindoo and Mahometan laws, which interesting work he did not live to bring to a conclusion. The publication of the \"Asiatic Researches\" occupied much of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. In 1789 he translated an ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> drama called \"Sacontala,\" which has been considered as an interesting curiosity. In 1794 he gave the world his \"Ordinances of Menu,\" a famous Indian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LEGISLATOR\">legislator</a>, containing a system of duties both civil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a>.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> of India proving unfavourable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LADY\">Lady</a> Jones, obliged her to return to England, whither Sir William soon desirous to follow her.

He has scarcely ever been equalled as a linguist, for he is said to have been more or less acquainted with about 28 different languages. Taste and elegance marked all his exertions, and he might have risen as a poet to the very first rank. Great as his knowledge was, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> were not inferior.

The father, who had provoked the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GODDESS\">goddess</a> by killing her favourite stag, heard this with the greatest horror and indignation; and rather than to shed the blood of his daughter, he commanded one of his heralds, as chief of the Grecian forces, to order all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">assembly</a> to depart each to his respective home.

It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol0.html#article-COMMONLY\">commonly</a> said that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a> is healthy; and yet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a>, when he had taken this island, lost most of his men by sickness; and for that reason was forced to abandon it. This happened in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a>. It is subject to storms and hurricanes, like the rest of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ISLANDS\">islands</a>. It lies to the east of Hispaniola, at the distance of 30 miles.\n\nJuan de Porto Rico, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> town of the island of Porto Rico, with a good harbour defended by several forts, and a bishop's see. It is seated on the north coast of the island, in W. Long. 65. 35. N. Lat. 18. 30.\n\nJuan Fernandez, an island in the great South <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, in S. Lat. 33. 40. and W. Long. 78. 30. from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. It was formerly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> for the buccaneers who annoyed the western coast of the Spanish continent. They were led to resort hither from the multitude of goats which it nourished; to deprive their enemies of which advantage, the Spaniards transported a considerable number of dogs, which increasing greatly, have almost exterminated the goats, who now only find security among the steep mountains in the northern parts, which are inaccessible to their pursuers. There are instances of two men living, at different times, alone on this island for many years; the one a Mafquito <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a>; the other Alexander Selkirk, a Scotchman, who was, after five years, taken on board an English ship, which touched here in about 1712, and brought back to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of this recluse, Daniel Defoe is said to have conceived the idea of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> the adventures of Robinson Crusoe. This island was very propitious to the remains of Commodore Anson's squadron in 1741, after having been buffeted with tempests, and debilitated by an inevitable scarcity, during a three months' passage round <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">Horn</a>; they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> here three months; during which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the dying crews, who on their arrival could scarcely with one united effort heave the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCHOR\">anchor</a>, were restored to perfect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>. Captain Carteret, in the Swallow, in 1767, having met with many difficulties and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-IMPEDIMENTS\">impediments</a> in his passage into the South sea, by the straits of Magellan, attempted to make this island in order to recruit the health of his men; but he found it fortified by the Spaniards, and therefore chose rather to proceed to the island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALACCA\">Malacca</a>. But M. de Bougainville that same year is said to have touched here for refreshments, although in the narrative of the voyage the fact is cautiously suppressed. This island is not quite 15 miles long and about six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>; its only safe harbour is on the north side. It is said to have plenty of excellent water, and to abound with a great variety of excellent vegetables highly antiscorbutic; besides which, Commodore Anson sowed a variety of garden-seeds, and planted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> of plums, apricots, and peaches, which he was many years afterwards informed had thriven greatly; and now doubtless form a very valuable addition to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> productions of this spot. Vast shoals of fish of various\nvarious kinds frequent this coast, particularly cod of a prodigious size. There are but few birds here, and those few are of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> well known and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a>.\n\nJuan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLANCO\">Blanco</a>, or White Jack, a Spanish name for platinum.

He had succeeded his father Hiempal, and he favoured the cause of Pompey against Julius Caesar. He defeated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CURIO\">Curio</a> whom Caesar had sent to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, and after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHARSALIA\">Pharsalia</a> he joined his forces to those of Scipio. He was conquered in a battle at Thapsus, and totally abandoned by his subjects. He killed himself with Petreius, who had shared his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOOD_FORTUNE\">good fortune</a> and his adversity, in the year of Rome 707. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> became a Roman province, of which Sallust was the first governor.\n\nJuba II, son of the former, was led among the captives to Rome to adorn the triumph of Caesar. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a> was the source of the greatest honours, and his application to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> procured him more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> than he would have obtained from the inheritance of a kingdom. He gained the heart of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> by the courteousness of his manners, and Augustus rewarded his fidelity by giving him in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> Cleopatra the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> of Antony, and conferring upon him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of king, and making him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of all the territories which his father once possessed, in the year of Rome 723. His popularity was so great, that the Mauritanians rewarded his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> by making him one of their gods. The Athenians raised him a statue, and the Ethiopians worshipped him as a deity. Juba wrote an history of Rome in Greek, which is often quoted and commended by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENTS\">ancients</a>. Of it only few fragments remain. He also wrote on the history of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>, and the antiquities of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSYRIA\">Assyria</a>, chiefly collected from Berolus. Besides these, he composed some treatises upon the drama, Roman antiquities, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of animals, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a>, &c. now lost.\n\nJubilee, among the Jews, denotes every fiftieth year; being that following the revolution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SEVEN\">seven</a> weeks of years; at which time all the slaves were made free, and all lands reverted to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> owners. The jubilees were not regarded after the Babylonish captivity.\n\nThe word, according to some authors, comes from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> jobel, which signifies fifty; but this must be a mistake, for the Hebrew \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc, jobel does not signify fifty; neither do its letters, taken as cyphers, or according to their numerical powers, make that number; being 10, 6, 2, and 30, that is, 48.\u2014Others say, that jobel signifies a ram, and that the jubilee was thus called, because proclaimed with a ram's horn, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of the ram that appeared to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a> in the thicket. Maimon chooses to derive the word from jabal, the first inventor of musical instruments, which, for that reason, were called by his name; whence the words jobel and jubilee came to signify the year of deliverance and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REMISSION\">remission</a>, because proclaimed with the sound of one of those instruments which at first was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> more than the horn of a ram. Others derive jobel from \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc, jabal in hiphil \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc, hobal, which signifies to recall or return; because this year restored all slaves to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, &c. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> of this festival is in Lev. xxv. 8, 17.\n\nThe learned are divided about the year of jubilee; some maintaining that it was every forty-ninth, and others that it was every fiftieth year. The ground of the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> is chiefly this, that the forty-ninth year being of course a sabbatical year, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> the jubilee had been kept on the fiftieth, the land must have had two sabbaths, or have lain fallow two years, which, without a miracle, would have produced a dearth. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, it is alleged, that the Scripture expressly declares for the fiftieth year, Lev. xxv. 19, 11. And besides, if the jubilee and sabbatical year had been the same, there would have been no need of a prohibition to sow, reap, &c. because this kind of labour was prohibited by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of the sabbatical year, Lev. xxv. 4, 5.\n\nThe authors of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">Universal</a> History, book i. chap. 7, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> R, endeavour to reconcile these opinions, by observing, that as the jubilee began in the fifth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of the civil year, which was the seventh of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a>, it might be said to be either the forty-ninth or fiftieth, according as one or other of these computations was followed. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of the law of the jubilee was to prevent the too great oppressions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, as well as their being liable to perpetual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>. By this means a kind of equality was preserved through all the families of Israel, and the distinction of tribes was also preserved, that they might be able, when there was occasion, on the jubilee-year, to prove their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to the inheritance of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>. It served also, like the Olympiads of the Greeks, and the Lustra of the Romans, for the readier computation of time. The jubilee has also been supposed to be typical of the gospel state and dispensation, described by Isaiah, lxi. ver. 1, 2. in reference to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, as the \"acceptable year of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>.\"\n\nJubilee, in a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, denotes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> solemnity or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>, celebrated at Rome, wherein the pope grants a plenary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> to all sinners; at least to as many as visit the churches of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> and St Paul at Rome.\n\nThe jubilee was first established by Boniface VII. in 1300, in favour of those who should go <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AD\">ad</a> limina apostolorum; and it was only to return every hundred years. But the first celebration brought in such store of wealth to Rome, that the Germans called this the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> year; which occasioned Clement VI. in 1343, to reduce the period of the jubilee to fifty years. Urban VI. in 1389, appointed it to be held every thirty-five years, that being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of our Saviour; and Paul II. and Sixtus IV. in 1475, brought it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to every twenty-five, that every person might have the benefit of it once in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIFE\">life</a>. Boniface IX. granted the privilege of holding jubilees to several princes and monasteries; for instance, to the monks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTERBURY\">Canterbury</a>, who had a jubilee every fifty years; when people flocked from all parts to visit the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOMB\">tomb</a> of Thomas \u00e0 Becket. Jubilees are now become more frequent, and the pope grants them as often as the church or himself have occasion for them. There is usually one at the inauguration of a new pope. To be entitled to the privileges of the jubilee, the bull enjoins fasting, alms, and prayers. It gives the priests a full power to absolve in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, even those otherwise referred to the pope; to make commutations of vows, &c. in which it differs from a plenary indulgence. During the time of jubilees, all other indulgences are suspended.\n\nOne of our kings, viz. Edward III., caused his birthday to be observed in manner of a jubilee, when he\nbecame fifty years of age, in 1362, but never before or after. This he did by releasing prisoners, pardoning all offences except <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a>, making good laws, and granting many privileges to the people.\n\nThere are particular jubilees in certain cities, when several of their feasts <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> on the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>: at Puy en Velay, for instance, when the feast of the Annunciation happens on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol0.html#article-GOOD_FRIDAY\">Good-Friday</a>; and at Lyons when the feast of St John Baptist concurs with the feast of Corpus Christi.\n\nIn 1649, the Jesuits celebrated a solemn jubilee at Rome; that being the centenary or hundredth year from their institution; and the same ceremony was observed in all their houses throughout the world.","sp":418,"ep":420},{"h":"JUCATAN","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-YUCATAN\">YUCATAN</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of New <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">North</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PENINSULA\">peninsula</a>.

They lived without pomp or re-\ntinue, unless their own fortunes enabled them to do it;\nfor the revenues of their office consisted in voluntary\npresents from the people. They <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> from the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Joshua till the beginning of the reign of Saul,\nbeing a space of about 339 years.\n\nJudges, for ordinary affairs, civil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a>,\nwere appointed by Moses in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CITY\">city</a> to terminate\ndifferences; in affairs of greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, the dif-\nferences were referred to the priests of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AARON\">Aaron</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>,\nand the judge of the people or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a> at that time\nestablished.

In\nthe time of this peculiar polity, there were several remark-\nable occurrences, which are recorded in this book. It\nacquaints us with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> impiety of a new genera-\ntion which sprung up after the death of Joshua; and\ngives us a short view of the dispensations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> to-\nwards this people, sometimes relieving and delivering\nthem, and at others severely chastising them by the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of their enemies.\n\nSelect Judges (Judices selecti), in Antiquity, were\npersons summoned by the praetor to give their verdict\nin criminal matters in the Roman courts, as juries do\nin ours. No person could be regularly admitted into\nthis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> till he was 25 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AGE\">age</a>. The Sortitio\nJudicum, or impanelling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JURY\">jury</a>, was the office of\nthe Judex Questionis, and was performed after both\nparties were come into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>, for each had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to\nreject or challenge whom they pleased, others being\nsubstituted in their room. The number of the Judices\nselecti varied, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>.\nWhen the proper number appeared, they were sworn,\ntook their places in the judicellia, and heard the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>.\n\nJudgement, among logicians, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> or ra-\nther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>, whereby it compares its i-\ndeas, and perceives their agreement or disagreement.\nSee <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">Metaphysics</a>; and Logic, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">Part</a> II.\n\nJudgement, in Law, is the sentence pronounced by\nthe court upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> contained in the record.\nJudgements are of four sorts. First, where the facts are\nconfessed by the parties, and the law determined by\nthe court; as in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of judgement upon demurrer: se-\ncondly, where the law is admitted by the parties, and\nthe facts disputed; as in the case of judgement on ver-\ndict; thirdly, where both the fact and the law arising\nthereon are admitted by the defendant; which is the judgement\ncase of judgements by confession or default: or, lastly,\nwhere the plaintiff is convinced that either fact, or\nlaw, or both, are insufficient to support his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>,\nand therefore abandons or withdraws his prosecution;\nwhich is the case in judgements upon a nonuit or re-\ntraxit.\n\nThe judgement, though pronounced or awarded by\nthe judges, is not their determination or sentence, but\nthe determination and sentence of the law. It is the\nconclusion that naturally and regularly follows from\nthe premises of law and fact, which stands thus: A\u2014\ngainst him who hath rode over my corn, I may recover\ndamages by law: but A hath rode over my corn;\ntherefore I shall recover damages against A. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">If</a> the\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">major</a> proposition be denied, this is a demurrer in law:\nif the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MINOR\">minor</a>, it is then an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> of fact: but if both be\nconfessed or determined to be right, the conclusion\nor judgement of the court cannot but follow. Which\njudgement or conclusion depends not therefore on the\narbitrary caprice of the judge, but on the settled and\ninvariable principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>. The judgement, in\nshort, is the remedy prescribed by law for the redress\nof injuries; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> or action is the vehicle or\nmeans of administering it. What that remedy may be,\nis indeed the result of deliberation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> to point\nout; and therefore the style of the judgement is, not\nthat it is decreed or resolved by the court, for then the\njudgement might appear to be their own; but, \"it is\nconsidered,\" consideratum est per curiam, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>-\ntiff do recover his damages, his debt, his possession,\nand the like; which implies that the judgement is none\nof their own; but the act of law, pronounced and de-\nclared by the court, after due deliberation and inquiry.\nSee Blackft. Comment. iii. 396.\n\nJudgement, in criminal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, is the next stage of\nprosecution, after Trial, and Conviction are past, in\nsuch crimes and misdemeanors as are either too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>\nor too low to be included within the benefit of clergy.\nFor when, upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> charge, the Jury have\nbrought in their Verdict guilty in the presence of the\nprisoner; he is either immediately, or at a convenient\ntime soon after, asked by the court, if he has any\nthing to offer why judgement should not be awarded\nagainst him? And in case the defendant be found guil-\nty of a misdemeanor (the trial of which may, and\ndoes usually, happen in his absence, after he has once\nappeared), a capias is awarded and issued, to bring\nhim in to receive his judgement; and if he absconds, he\nmay be prosecuted even to outlawry. But whenever he\nappears in person, upon either a capital or inferior con-\nviction, he may at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, as well as at his arraign-\nment, offer any exceptions to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDICTMENT\">indictment</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARREST\">arrest</a>\nor stay of judgement: as for want of sufficient certainty\nin setting forth either the person, the time, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>,\nor the offence. And if the objections be valid, the\nwhole proceedings shall be set aside; but the party may\nbe indicted again. And we may take notice, 1. That\nnone of the statutes of jeofails, for amendment of er-\nrors, extend to indictments or proceedings in criminal\ncases; and therefore a defective indictment is not aided\nby a verdict, as defective pleadings in civil cases are.\n2. That, in favour of life, great strictness has at all\ntimes been observed, in every point of an indictment. Comment.\nSir Matthew Hale indeed complains, \"that this strict-\nness\nJUDGEMENTS are grown to be a blemish and inconvenience in the law; and the administration thereof: for that more offenders escape by the over-easy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> given to exceptions in indictments, than by their own innocence; and many times gross murders, burglaries, robberies, and other heinous and crying offences, remain unpunished by these unseemly niceties: to the reproach of the law, to the shame of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, to the encouragement of villany, and to the dishonour of God.\" And yet, notwithstanding this laudable zeal, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MAN\">man</a> was more tender of life than this truly excellent judge.\n\nA <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> also may be pleaded in arrest of judgement: and it has the same advantage when pleaded here as when pleaded upon ARRAIGNMENT; viz. the saving the ATTAINERD, and, of course, the CORRUPTION OF BLOOD: which nothing can reftore but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, when a pardon is not pleaded till after sentence. And certainly, upon all accounts, when a man hath obtained a pardon, he is in the right to plead it as soon as possible. See PARDON.\n\nPraying the benefit of clergy may also be ranked among the motions in arrest of judgement. See Benefit of CLERGY.\n\nIf all these resources fail, the court must pronounce that judgement which the law hath annexed to the crime. Of these some are capital, which extend to the life of the offender, and consist generally in being hanged by the neck till dead; though in very atrocious crimes other circumstances of terror, pain, or disgrace, are superadded: as, in treasons of all kinds, being drawn or dragged to the place of execution; in high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a> affecting the king's person or government, disembowelling alive, beheading, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUARTERING\">quartering</a>; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a>, a public dissection. And in case of any treason committed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a>, the judgement is, to be burned alive. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> of the English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> has authorized, by a tacit consent, an almost general mitigation of such parts of these judgements as favour of torture or cruelty: a fledge or hurdle being usually allowed to such traitors as are condemned to be drawn; and there being very few instances (and those accidental or by negligence) of any person's being disembowelled or burned, till previously deprived of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> by strangling. Some punishments consist in exile or banishment, by abjuration of the realm, or transportation beyond the seas: others, in loss of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, by perpetual or temporary imprisonment. Some extend to confiscation, by forfeiture of lands, or moveables, or both, or of the profits of lands for life; others induce a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DISABILITY\">disability</a> of holding offices or employments, being heirs, executors, and the like. Some, though rarely, occasion a mutilation or dismemberment, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> or ears: others fix a lasting stigma on the offender, by slitting the nostrils or branding in the hand or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FACE\">face</a>. Some are merely pecuniary, by stated or discretionary fines: and, lastly, there are others that consist principally in their ignominy, though most of them are mixed with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of corporeal pain; and these are inflicted chiefly for such crimes as either arise from indigence, or render even opulence disgraceful. Such as whipping, hard labour in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> of correction, the pillory, the stocks, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DUCKING\">ducking</a>-stool.\n\nDisgusting as this catalogue may seem, it will afford <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> to a British reader, and do <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to the British laws, to compare it with that shocking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> of death and torment to be met with in the criminal codes of almost every other nation in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. And it is moreover one of the glories of our law, that the nature, though not always the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> or degree, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> is ascertained for every offence; and that it is not left in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> of any judge, nor even of a jury, to alter that judgement which the law has beforehand ordained for every subject alike, without respect of persons. For if judgements were to be the private opinions of the judge, men would then be slaves to their magistrates; and would live in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>, without knowing exactly the conditions and obligations which it lays them under. And, besides, as this prevents oppression on the one hand; so, on the other, it stifles all hopes of impunity or mitigation, with which an offender might flatter himself if his punishment depended on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-DISCRETION\">discretion</a> of the court. Whereas, where an established penalty is annexed to crimes, the criminal may read their certain consequence in that law, which ought to be the unvaried rule, as it is the inflexible judge, of his actions.\n\nJUDGEMENT OF GOD.

His hopes were frustrated; Jugurtha showed himself brave and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>, and he endeared himself to the Roman general. Micipha appointed him successor to his kingdom with his two sons; but the kindness of the father proved fatal to the children.

See ANATOMY, BLOOD, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PLANTS\">PLANTS</a>, SAP, &c.\n\nThe juices of several plants are expressed to obtain their essential salts, and for several medicinal purposes, with intention either to be used without further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a>, or to be made into syrups and extracts. The general method of extracting their juices is, by pounding the plant in a marble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a>, and then by putting it into a press. Thus is obtained a muddy and green liquor, which generally requires to be clarified, as we shall soon observe. The juices of all plants are not extracted with equal ease. Some plants, even when fresh, contain so little juice, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> must be added while they are pounded, otherwise scarcely any juice would be obtained by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>. Other plants which contain a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of juice, furnish by expression but a small quantity of it, because they contain also much mucilage, which renders the juice so viscid that it cannot flow. Water must also be added to these plants to obtain their juice. The juices thus obtained from vegetables by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> method, are not, properly speaking, one of their principles, but rather a collection of all the proximate principles of plants which are soluble in water; such as the faponaceous extractive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, the mucilage, the odoriferous principle, all the saline and saccharine substances; all which are dissolved in the water of the vegetation of the plants. Besides all these matters, the juice contains some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the resinous substance, and the green colouring matter, which in almost all vegetables is of a resinous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. These two latter substances, not being soluble in water, are only interposed between the parts of the other principles which are dissolved in the juice, and consequently disturb its transparency. They nevertheless adhere together in a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, and so strongly in most juices, that they cannot be separated by filtration alone. When therefore these juices are to be clarified, some previous preparations must be used by which the filtration may be facilitated. Juices which are acid, and not very mucilaginous, are spontaneously clarified by rest and gentle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>. The juices of most antiseptic plants abounding in saline volatile principles, may be disposed to filtration merely by immersion in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> water; and as they may be contained in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> bottles, while they are thus heated in a water bath, their saline volatile part, in which their medicinal qualities chiefly consist, may thus be preserved. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">Fermentation</a> is also an effectual method of clarifying juices which are susceptible of it; for all liquors which have fermented, clarify spontaneously after fermentation. But this method is not used to clarify juices, because many of them are susceptible of only an imperfect fermentation, and because the qualities of most of them are injured by that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>. The method of clarification most generally used, and indispensably necessary for those juices which contain much mucilage, is boiling with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>. This matter, which has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of coagulating in boiling water, and of uniting with mucilage, does accordingly, when added to the juice of plants, unite with and coagulate their mucilage, and separates it from the juice in form of scum, together with the greatest part of the resinous and earthy matters which disturb its transparency. And as any of these resinous matters which may remain in the liquor, after this boiling with the whites of eggs, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> longer retained by the mucilage, they may easily be separated by filtration.\n\nThe juices, especially before they are clarified, contain almost all the same principles as the plant itself; because in the operation by which they are extracted, no decomposition happens, but every thing remains, as to its nature, in the same state as in the plant. The principles contained in the juice are only separated from the grosser oily, earthy, and resinous parts, which compose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> matter that remains under the press. These juices, when well prepared, have therefore the same medicinal qualities as the plants from which they are obtained. They must evidently differ from each other as to the nature and proportions of the principles with which they are impregnated, as much as the plants from which they are extracted differ from each other in those respects.\n\nMost vegetable juices coagulate when they are exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, whether they are drawn out of the plant by wounds, or naturally run out; though what is called naturally running out, is generally the effect of a wound in the plant, from a sort of tumor, or some other internal cause. Different parts of the same plant yield different juices. The same veins in their course through the different parts of the plant yield juices of\nJuice. a different appearance. Thus the juice in the root of the cow-parsnip is of a brimstone <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>; but in the stalk it is white.\n\nAmong those juices of vegetables which are clammy and readily coagulate, there are some which readily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> with a whey. The great wild lettuce, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> of opium, yields the greatest plenty of milky juice of any known British plant. When the stalk is wounded with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>, the juice flows out readily like a thick cream, and is white and ropy; but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-IF\">if</a> these wounds are made at the top of the stalks, the juice that flows out of them is dished with a purple tinge, as if cream had been sprinkled over with a few drops of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> wine. Some little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> after letting this out, it becomes much more purple, and thickens; and finally, the thicker part of it separates, and the thin whey sticks at top. The whey or thin part of this separated matter is easily pressed out from the curd by squeezing between the fingers, and the curd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> then remain white; and on washing with water it becomes like rags. The purple whey (for in this is contained all the colour) soon dries into a purple cake, and may be crumbled between the fingers into a powder of the same colour. The white curd being dried and kept for some time, becomes hard and brittle. It breaks with a thinning surface like resin, and is inflammable; taking fire at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> all away with a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>. The same thick part being held over a gentle heat, will draw out into tough <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LONG\">long</a> threads, melting like wax. The purple cake made from the whey is quite different from this; and when held to a candle scarce flames at all, but burns to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> coal. The whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of the plant seems also to consist in this thin part of its juice: for the coagulum or curd, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-LOOKING\">looking</a> like wax or resin, has no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> at all; whereas the purple cake made from the serum is extremely bitter, and of a taste somewhat resembling that of opium.\n\nOf the same kind with the wild lettuce are the throatwort, spurge, and many other plants. These are all replete with a milky juice which separates into curds and whey like that already described. But this, though a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of nature, is not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a>; for there are many plants which yield the like milky juices without any separation ensuing upon their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a>. The white juice of the foxglove never separates, but dries into an uniform cake: the common red wild poppy bleeds freely with a milky juice; and the heads or capitules of feed bleed not less freely than the rest of the plant, even after the flower is fallen. This juice, on being received into a shell or other small vessel, soon changes its white to a deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> colour, and dries into a cake which seems resinous and oily, but no whey separates from it. The tragopogon, or goat's-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a>, when wounded, bleeds freely a milky juice; it is at first white, but becomes immediately yellow, and then more and more red, till at length it is wholly of a dusky red. It never separates, but dries together into one cake; and is oily and resinous, but of an insipid taste. The great bindweed also bleeds freely a white juice; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-FLOWERS\">flowers</a>, as well as the stalks and leaves, affording this liquor. It is of a sharp taste; and as many of the purging plants are of this class, it would be worth trying whether this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> is not purgative.\n\nThese juices, as well as the generality of others which bleed from plants, are white like milk; but there are some of other colours. The juice of the great celandine is of a fine yellow colour; it flows from the plant of the thickness of cream, and soon dries into a hard cake, without any whey separating from it. Another yellow juice is yielded by the seed-vessels of the yellow centaury in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JULY\">July</a>, when the seeds are full grown. This is very clammy; it soon hardens altogether into a cake without any whey separating from it. It sticks to the fingers like birdlime, is of the colour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a>, and will never become harder than soft wax if dried in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SHADE\">shade</a>; but if laid in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SUN\">sun</a>, it immediately becomes hard like resin. These cakes burn like wax, and emit a very pleasant smell. The great angelica also yields a yellowish juice on being wounded; and this will not harden at all, but if kept several years will still be soft and clammy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> out into threads or half melted resin.\n\nAnother kind of juices very different from all these, are those of a gummy nature. Some of these remain liquid a long time, and are not to be dried without the assistance of heat; the others very quickly harden of themselves, and are not inflammable. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> of the juice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol0.html#article-RHUBARB\">rhubarb</a> leaves soon hardens; and is afterwards soluble in common water, and sparkles when put into the flame of a candle. The clusters of the common honeyuckle are full of a liquid gum. This they frequently throw out, and it falls upon the leaves, where it retains its own form. The red hairs of the ros folis are all terminated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> bladders of a thin watery fluid. This is also a liquid gum; it sticks to the fingers, draws out into long threads, and stands the force of the sun all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. In the centre of each of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEW\">dew</a>-drops there is a small red bladder, which stands immediately on the summit of the red <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, and contains a purple juice which may be squeezed out of it. The pinguicula, or butterwort, has also a gummy matter on its leaves in much greater quantity than the ros folis.\n\nSome plants yield juices which are manifestly of an oily nature. These, when rubbed, are not at all of a clammy nature, but make the fingers glip and slippery, and do not all harden on being exposed to the air. If the stalk of eleocharis be wounded, there flows out an oily juice <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-SWIMMING\">swimming</a> upon a watery one. The stalks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol0.html#article-HEMLOCK\">hemlock</a> also afford a similar oily liquor swimming upon the other; and in like manner the white mullein, the berries of ivy, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>, juniper, dog-berry tree, and the fruit of the olive, when wounded, show their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> floating on the watery juice. Some of these oily juices, however, harden into a kind of resin. Our ivy yields such a juice very abundantly; and the juice of the small purple-berried juniper is of the same kind, being hard and fat, and not very gummy. If the bark of the common ivy is wounded in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>, there will ooze out a tough and greasy matter of a yellowish colour, which, taken up between the fingers, feels not at all gummy or sticking, but melts in handling into a sort of oil, which in process of time hardens and crusts upon the wounds, and looks like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>. It burns with a lasting flame, and smells very strong. The tops of the wild lettuce, and\nthe leaves growing near the tops, if examined with a magnifying glass, show a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of small bladders or drops of an oily juice of a brownish colour, hardening into a kind of resin; they are easily wiped off when of any size, and are truly an oily juice a little hardened. It is probable also, that the fine blue flour or powder, called the bloom, upon the surface of our common plums, is no other than such an oily juice exuding from their pores in small particles, and hardening into a sort of resin.","sp":424,"ep":426},{"h":"JUJUBE","t":"in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MATERIA_MEDICA\">Materia Medica</a>, the name of a fruit of the pulpy kind, produced on a tree which Linnaeus makes a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of rhamnus.

He made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol0.html#article-NO\">no</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-USE\">use</a> of violence, however, for this purpose; for he knew that violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> had always rendered it more flourishing; he therefore behaved with a polite mildness to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>; recalled all who had been banished on account of religion under the reign of Constantius; and undertook to pervert them by his carelessness, and by temporal advantages and mortifications covered over by artful pretences; but he forbade Christians to plead before courts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> to enjoy any public employments. He even prohibited their teaching polite literature; well knowing the great advantages they drew from profane authors in their attacks upon Paganism and irreligion. Though he on all occasions showed a sovereign contempt for the Christians, whom he always called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-GALILEANS\">Galileans</a>, yet he was sensible of the advantage they obtained by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> and the purity of their manners; and therefore incessantly proposed their example to the Pagan priests. At last, however, when he found that all other methods failed, he gave public employments to the most cruel enemies of the Christians, when the cities in most of the provinces were filled with tumults and seditions, and many of them were put to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>:\n\nThough it has been pleaded by Julian's apologists, that the behaviour of the Christians furnished sufficient pretence for most of his proceedings against them, and the animosities among themselves furnished him with the means; that they were continually prone to sedition, and made a merit of insulting the public worship; and, finally, that they made no scruple of declaring, that want of numbers alone prevented them from engaging in an open rebellion. Historians mention, that Julian attempted to prove the falsehood of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>'s prediction with respect to the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>; and resolved to have that edifice rebuilt by the Jews, about 350 years after its destruction by Titus; but all their endeavours served only the more perfectly to verify what had been foretold by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ; for the Jews, who had assembled from all parts to Jerusalem, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a> the foundations, flames of fire burst forth and consumed the workmen*. However, the Jews, who were obstinately bent on accomplishing that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, made several attempts; but it is said, that all who endeavoured to lay the foundation perished by these flames, which at last obliged them entirely to abandon the work. Julian being mortally wounded in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> with the Persians, it is said, that he then caught in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> some of the blood which flowed from his wound; and throwing it towards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, cried, \"Thou Galilean hast conquered.\" But notwithstanding this popular report, Theodoret relates, that Julian discovered a different disposition; and employed his last moments in conversing with Maximus the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>.

It must, however, be acknowledged, that he was learned, liberal, temperate, brave, vigilant, and a lover of justice; but, on the other hand, he had apostatized to Paganism; was an enemy to the Christian religion; and was, in fact, a persecutor, though not of the most fanatical class. We have several of his discourses or orations; some of his letters; a treatise intitled Misopogon, which is a satire on the inhabitants of Antioch; and some other pieces, all written in an elegant style. They were published in Greek and Latin by Father Petavius in 1632 in quarto; and of which Spanheimius gave a fine edition in folio in 1696. His most famous work was that composed against the Christians, of which there are some fragments in Cyril's refutation of it.\n\nJULIAN <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PERIOD\">Period</a>, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">Chronology</a>, a period so called, as being adapted to the Julian year.\n\nIt is made to commence before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a> of the world.

The town is small but well fortified, and neatly built; the houses are of brick, and the streets broad and regular. The citadel is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> and very strong, containing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol0.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> dukes, and a spacious piazza.
