[{"h":"AUCUBA","t":"One species; viz. japonica. Japan.\n\n1328. LITTORELLA.\n\nOne species; viz. * lacustris.\n\n1275. CICCA.\n\nOne species; viz. difticha. India.\n\n1052. BETULA, or Birch-tree.\n\nEight species; viz. * alba, * alnus, * nana, dalecarlica, nigra, lenta, pumila, incana. Europe, N. America.\n\n1053. BUXUS, or Box-tree.\n\nOne species; viz. sempervirens.\u2014The wood is very hard and smooth, and not apt to warp, and therefore well adapted for the use of the turner. Combs, mathematical instruments, knife handles, and button moulds, are made of it. An empyreumatic oil, distilled from the shavings, is often used as a topical application for the piles, and seldom fails to procure ease. It will frequently relieve the toothache, and has been given internally in epilepsies. The leaves, powdered, destroy worms. In the south of Europe it is cultivated in gardens and kept in flower-pots, with as much attention as we bestow upon myrtle.\n\n1054. URTICA, or Nettle.\n\n28 species; viz. * dioica, * pilulifer, * urens, balsamica, dodartii, pumila, grandiflora, cannabina, alienata, cylindrica, parietaria, ciliaris, spicata, macrophylla, rhombea, seftuans, capitata, divaricata, canadenfis, interrupta, nivea, baccifera, arborea, capensis, frutefcens, filumans, japonica, villosa. Europe, N. America, E. and W. Indies.\n\n* U. leaves opposite, heart-shaped; bunches in pairs. \u2014This species is the common nettle. Its stings are very curious microscopic objects. They consist of an exceedingly fine-pointed tapering hollow substance, with a perforation at the point, and a bag at the base; or they are sharp tubes seated upon a bag. When the sharp point of the tube, that is to say the sting, is pressed upon, it readily punctures the skin, and the same pressure forces up an acrimonious fluid from the bag, which is squirted into the wound, and produces an effect which most persons have experienced. The plant was formerly used as an astringent, but is now disregarded. A stalk of it, when the leaves are in their prime, put into milk, coagulates it, and may serve to prepare it for being made into cheese. A leaf, put upon the tongue, and then pressed against the roof of the mouth, is pretty efficacious in stopping a bleeding at the nose. Paralytic limbs have been recovered by flogging them with nettles. The young shoots are gathered early in the spring to boil in broth or gruel. Cows eat the leaves when they are a little withered. The leaves are cut to pieces to mix with the food of young turkeys and other poultry. Cows, horses, sheep, goats, and swine, refuse them. Affes are fond of it, and cows eat it in hay. The stalks may be dressed like flax or hemp for making cloth or paper. In Kamchatka they make use of no other material in the manufacture of cordage or sailcloth, and linen, and consider these fabrics, when produced from nettles, as superior in every respect to those made from hemp and flax. As the nettle seems of all plants the most congenial to our soil and climate, growing in all situations both fertile and barren, in spite of every attempt to extirpate it; and as there exists no doubt, that as a material of manufacture, it is not inferior to either flax or hemp, it is a singular circumstance that it has never come into general use. This, perhaps, is chiefly to be accounted for from the difficulty of collecting its seeds and handling it; difficulties however, which a little attention and industry would probably soon enable us to overcome.\n\n1055. MORUS, or Mulberry-tree.\n\nSeven species; viz. alba, nigra, papyrifera, rubra, indica, tatarica, tinctoria. Italy, China, Japan, America.\u2014The mulberry is chiefly remarkable on account of the value of its leaves, as the food of that valuable insect the silk-worm. The M. alba or white mulberry, with leaves obliquely heart-shaped and level, grows in Britain in the open air, as far northward as the frith of Forth, and silk-worms may be fed with it. The fruit of the black mulberry has the common qualities of other sweet fruits, abating heat, quenching thirst, and promoting the greater secretions; a syrup, made from the juice, is kept by the apothecaries. The bark of the roots has been in considerable esteem as a cure for worms; its taste is bitter and somewhat astringent.\n\nORDER V. PENTANDRIA.\n\n1277. NEPHELIUM.\n\nOne species; viz. lappaceum. India.\n\n1056. XANTHIUM, or Leffer Burdock.\n\nFive species; viz. * strumarium, orientale, echinatum, spinosum, fruticosum. S. Europe, Ceylon, China, Peru.\nMonoeia.\n\n* X. stem thornless, leaves heart-shaped, three-fibred.\u2014The leaves are bitter and astringent. A decoction of the whole plant affords a showy yellow colour; but it is better if only the flowers are used. Horses and goats eat it. Cows, sheep, and swine, refuse it.\n\n1057. Ambrosia.\n\nFour species; viz. trifida, elatior, artemisiifolia, maritima.\n\n1058. Parthenium, or Bafe Feverfew.\n\nTwo species; viz. hysterophorus, integrifolium. Virginia, Jamaica.\n\n1059. Iva, or False Jesuits-Bark tree.\n\nTwo species; viz. annua, fruticescens. Virginia, Carolina, Jamaica.\n\n1329. Clibadium.\n\nOne species; viz. furianum. Surinam.\n\n1060. Amaranthus, or Flower-gentle.\n\n24 species; viz. albus, gracicus, melancholicus, tricolor, polygamus, gangeticus, mongolius, triflora, lividus, olivaceus, bitum, viridis, deltoideus, polygonoideus, fuscans, hybrida, paniculatus, sanguineus, retroflexus, flavus, hypochondriacus, cruentus, caudatus, spinosus. Europe, E. and W. Indies, America.\n\n1276. Leea.\n\nTwo species; viz. aquata, crispa. Jamaica.\n\nOrder VI. Hexandria.\n\n1062. Zizania, or Water-oats, Tare-grass.\n\nThree species; viz. aquatica, palustris, terrestris. Malabar, N. America, Jamaica.\n\n1063. Pharus.\n\nOne species; viz. latifolius. Jamaica, S. Amer.\n\nOrder VII. Heptandria.\n\n1064. Guettarda.\n\nOne species; viz. speciosa. Java, W. Indies.\n\nOrder VIII. Polyandria.\n\n1065. Ceratophyllum, or Hornwort.\n\nTwo species; viz. * demersum, * submersum.\n\n1066. Myriophyllum, or Water Milfoil.\n\nTwo species; viz. * spicatum, * verticillatum.\n\n1066. Sagittaria, or Arrowhead.\n\nFive species; viz. * sagittifolia, obtusifolia, lancifolia, acutifolia, triflora. Europe, Asia, America.\n\n* S. leaves arrow-shaped, acute.\u2014It grows in ditches and on the banks of slow running rivers. There is always a bulb at the lower part of the root, growing in the solid earth beneath the mud. This bulb constitutes a considerable part of the food of the Chinese, and upon that account they cultivate it. Horses, goats, and swine, eat it. Cows are not fond of it.\n\n1156. Begonia.\n\nThree species; viz. ferruginea, capensis, urtica. Cape, E. and W. Indies.\n\n1098. Theligonum, or Dog's-cabbage.\n\nOne species; viz. cynocrambe. S. of Europe.\n\n1069. Poterium, or Garden Burnet.\n\nThree species; viz. * fanguiflora, hybridum, spinosum.\n\n* P. without thorns; stems somewhat angular.\u2014The fanguiflora leaves and seeds of this plant are mildly astringent, and ba. have been used in dysenteries and hemorrhages. The seeds, when bruised, smell like cucumbers. There are large tracts of the finest parts of what are called the South Downs in England, upon which this plant forms half the indigenous pasturage. It seems to grow naturally (without being sown) only on chalky soils; but it will flourish, when sown, on any soil; on sand, clay, peat, &c. It is chiefly valuable for sheep pastures that are to be kept fully stocked. It forms a fine herbage when close cut; but when suffered to run to a height it is rather coarse.\n\n1070. Quercus, or Oak-tree.\n\n20 species; viz. * phellos, molucca, glabra, acuta, glauca, cuspidata, ferrata, ilex, suber, coccifera, prunus, dentata, nigra, rubra, alba, cecilus, * robur, egilops, ceris, * femina.\n\n* O. leaves on leaf-stalks, oblong, broadest towards robur. The end, indentations rather acute, angles blunt; fruit nearly fitting.\n\n* Q. leaves oblong, on short leaf-stalks, blunt, wing-feminae, cleft, with indentations; fruit mostly solitary, on long fruit-stalks. Withering, vol. iii. p. 387. The oak is a native of the temperate climates. It loves hilly better than boggy ground, and thrives best, while young, in large plantations. Its roots descend deep into the earth, and therefore will not bear to be transplanted. Much lopping destroys it. Grasps will hardly grow beneath it. The wood is hard, tough, tolerably flexible, not easily splintering; and therefore is preferred before all other timber for building ships of war. It is well adapted to almost every purpose of the carpenter; but an attempt to enumerate the uses of this well-known wood, would be equally superfluous and difficult. Oak saw-dust is the principal indigenous vegetable used in dyeing fullan. All the varieties of drabs and different shades of brown are made with oak saw-dust, differently managed and compounded. The balls or oak apples are likewise used in dyeing, as a substitute for galls. The black, got from them by the addition of copperas, is more beautiful than that from galls, but not so durable. The bark is universally used to tan leather; and it is said that the saw-dust has been used for the same purpose with equal success. The bark is used to make writing ink. Its astringent properties might be rendered useful in medicine. An infusion of it with a small quantity of copperas, is used by the common people to dye woollen of a purplish blue: the colour, though not very bright, is durable. The balls or galls upon the leaves, are occasioned by a small insect with four wings, called cynips querci folii, which deposits an egg in the substance of the leaf by making a small perforation on the under surface. The ball presently begins to grow, and the egg in the centre of it changes to a worm; this worm again changes to a nymph, and the nymph to the flying insect, with four wings. Horses, cows, sheep, and goats, eat the leaves. Swine and deer fatten on the acorns. The oak grows in a good soil sometimes to a most immense size. At Little Shelfley in Worcestershire,\nshire, an oak measured close to the ground nearly 48 feet, and about two yards from the ground 22 feet four inches. Lightfoot mentions one growing near Ludlow in Shropshire in 1764, the trunk of which measured 68 feet in girth, and 23 in length; so that allowing 90 square feet for the larger branches, it contained 1455 feet of timber. An oak near Welbeck measured in girth, at 11 feet from the ground, 38 feet; and one growing at Cowthorpe near Wetherby, Yorkshire, measured 48 feet in circumference at three feet from the ground, and 78 feet close to the ground.\n\n1071. Juglans, or Walnut-tree.\n\nFive species; viz. regia, alba, nigra, cinerea, baccata. Persia, N. America.\u2014This tree, when planted in Scotland, seldom ripens its fruit.\n\n1072. Fagus, or Beech, Sweet Chestnut.\n\nThree species; viz. * caflanea, pumila, * sylvatica. Europe, N. America.\n\n* F. leaves spear-shaped, with tapering serratures, naked underneath.\u2014In the shade of this species, called the chestnut, nothing will thrive. The wood is applicable to the same uses that oak is. Pipes made of it convey water under ground, are said to last longer than those made of oak. Poles for palisades, &c., made of it without removing the bark, also last very long. Some of the oldest buildings in London are said to be constructed of the wood of the chestnut tree. At Tortworth in Gloucestershire, there is a tree 52 feet round, which is proved to have stood since the year 1150, and was then very old. It is supposed to be 1100 years old. In 1759, its girth, at six feet from the ground, was 46 feet six inches. The nuts are used to whiten linen cloth, and to make starch. They constitute a great proportion of the food of the common people in the south of Europe; and hogs, feeding on them as they run wild in the forests, are reckoned particularly excellent.\n\nSylvatica. * F. leaves egg-shaped; indistinctly serrated. Common beech.\u2014This tree is large and beautiful, but no verdure is found under its shade. It retains its old leaves during the winter, and may be trained to form very lofty hedges. The wood is brittle, soon decays in the air, but endures under water. It is formed into tool handles, planes, mallets, chairs, and bedsteads. Split into thin layers, it is used to make scabbards for swords. It is excellent fuel, and its ashes afford much potash. The leaves, gathered in autumn before they are much injured by frost, make much better mattocks than straw or chaff, and last seven or eight years. The nuts or malt, when eaten, occasion giddiness and headache; but when well dried and powdered, make wholesome bread. They are sometimes roasted and substituted for coffee. They fatten swine, and are devoured greedily by mice, squirrels, and birds. The poor people in Silecia use the expressed oil instead of butter. Sheep and goats eat the leaves.\n\n1073. Carpinus, Hornbeam-tree.\n\nTwo species; viz. * betulus, ofrya. Europe, N. America.\n\nBetulus. C. scales of the cones flat.\u2014This, which is the common hornbeam, loves a poor stiff soil on the sides of hills, is easily transplanted, and bears lopping. Cattle eat the leaves, but no pasture grows under its shade. The wood burns like a candle: it is very white, very tough, harder than hawthorn, and capable of supporting a great weight. It is useful in turning, and for many implements of husbandry. Coggs for millwheels made of it are superior to those of yew. The inner bark is used in Scandinavia to dye yellow.\n\n1074. Corylus, Hazel or Nut-tree.\n\nTwo species; viz. * avellana, colurna. Europe, N. America.\n\n* C.\u2014This wood is profitably planted in many places avellana, in hedges and coppices, for the purpose of cutting down portions in rotation, to be converted into charcoal for forges. The wood is used for fishing-rods, walking-sticks, hoops, &c. The roots are preferred where beautiful wood is wanted for inlaying or staining. It is a practice in Italy, to put chips of hazel into turbid wine to clear it, which it does in 24 hours. In countries where yeast is scarce, they twist together hazel twigs, so as to leave a multitude of chinks: these they steep in their ale while it is fermenting; then hang them up to dry, and when they brew again they put them into the wort instead of yeast. Charcoal of hazel, when used in drawing, leaves stains which are easily rubbed out. The nuts, which are agreeable to most people, afford, by pressure, an oil for the use of painters.\n\n1075. Platanus, or Plane-tree.\n\nTwo species; viz. orientalis, occidentalis. Levant, N. America.\n\n1076. Liquidambar, or Sweet Gum.\n\nTwo species; viz. styraciflua, peregrina. Levant, N. America.\u2014The resinous juice of the former of these species, brought from America, was once used as a perfume, but is now neglected.\n\nORDER IX. MONADELPHIA.\n\n1077. Pinus, or Pine-tree.\n\n12 species; viz. * sylvestris, pinea, taeda, cembra, strobos, cedrus, larix, picea, balliana, canadensis, abies, orientalis. Europe, north of Asia, America.\n\n* P. leaves in long pairs, rigid; cones egg-conical, mostly in pairs, as long as the leaves; scales oblong, blunt. Scotch fir.\u2014This species, which is a native of our island, flourishes best on a poor sandy soil. In a grove the trunk is tall and naked; in open places branched. It does not bear the leaf clipping, as the terminating buds send forth the branches. The roots spread near the surface of the earth, except the central root, which pushes perpendicularly downwards. If it is either broken off or interrupted in its passage, the stem ceases to shoot upwards, and the tree remains a dwarf. Hence it is apt to suffer by transplanting. The bark will tan leather. In the north of Europe bread is thus made from it by the inhabitants: They choose a straight tree, as these have least resin, and strip off the bark in the spring, when it separates most readily. This they first dry gently in the shade; then in a greater heat, and reduce it to powder. With this powder they mix a small quantity of corn meal, and with water they knead it into bread. This they eat, not only in times of scarcity, but at other times, from an apprehension, that long disuse might render it disagreeable.\ngreable to them. Their children are very fond of the fresh bark in the spring time, either shaved with a knife or grated with a rasp. The young shoots, distilled, afford a fragrant essential oil. Sheep and goats are not fond of it. Horses refuse it. Burnt with a close smothering fire, the wood of this species yields tar. The species called larix has risen into considerable reputation in this country, on account of its beauty, rapid growth, and the value of the timber. It is extremely hardy, growing in Siberia almost to the coasts of the Icy sea; but this very hardness, or capacity of vegetating with a very small degree of heat, renders it in this country delicate when young. The first warmth of the spring is sufficient to bring forth its buds, which are thus, by the unsteadiness of our climate, exposed to frequent pernicious frosts. In this way nurserymen often suffer great losses by the larix, in consequence of an early spring and a premature vegetation, which is afterwards nipt by frosty weather. From the trees of the genus pinus the different turpentine are extracted by bleeding the trees, by wounds in the bark or branches.\n\n1079. Cupressus, or Cyprifir-tree.\n\nSix species; viz. sempervirens, difficula, thyoides, juniperoides, pendula, japonica. Crete, Cape, Japan, N. America.\n\n1080. Plukenetia.\n\nOne species; viz. volubilis. E. and W. Indies.\n\n1081. Dalechampia.\n\nTwo species; viz. colorata, scandens. W. Indies, New Granada.\n\n1082. Acalypha.\n\nFive species; viz. virginica, virgata, indica, villosa, australis. N. America, E. and W. Indies.\n\n1083. Croton, or Bafe Ricinus, Tallow-tree.\n\n23 species; viz. variegatum, calcarilla, castaneifolium, paludum, glabellum, tinctorum, glandulosum, argenteum, febriferum, japonicum, acutum, tiglium, lucidum, lacciferum, ballaniferum, aromaticum, humile, ricinocarpus, moluccanum, flavens, capenfe, lotum, spinosum. China, Japan, W. Indies, N. America.\n\n1079. Cupania.\n\nOne species; viz., americana. W. Indies, Coromandel.\n\n1084. Jatropha, or Caffada, Manibot.\n\nNine species; viz. golypifolia, moluccana, curcas, multifida, manihot, janipha, urens, herbacea, elaffica. Africa, S. America.\n\n1085. Ricinus.\n\nFour species; viz. inermis, communis, tanarius, mappa. Vera Cruz.\u2014The species called R. communis produces nuts about the size of small beans, which like bitter almonds are deleterious. An oil is obtained from them by expression, called castor oil, which is used as a safe and mild laxative; half an ounce or an ounce for an adult, and a dram for an infant.\n\n1086. Sterculia.\n\nThree species; viz. balanghas, foetida, platanifoliun. Arabia, E. and W. Indies, China.\n\n1088. Hippomane.\n\nThree species; viz. mancinella, biglandulosa, spinosa.\n\n1279. Stillingia.\n\nOne species; viz. ilylvatica. Carolina.\n\n1278. Gnetum.\n\nOne species; viz. gnemon. India.\n\n1087. Hura, or Sandbox-tree.\n\nOne species; viz. crepitans. Mexico, W. Indies.\n\nOrder X. SYNGENESIA.\n\n1089. Trichosanthes, or Serpent-cucumber.\n\nFour species; viz. anguina, nervifolia, cucumerina, amara. E. Indies, China.\n\n1090. Momordica, or Male Balfam-apple.\n\nEight species; viz. balsamina, charantia, operculata, luffa, cylindrica, trifolia, pedata, claterium. S. Europe, India, America.\n\n1091. Cucurbita, of Gourd.\n\nSeven species; viz. lagenaria, hiflida, ovifera, pepo, verrucosa, melopepo, citrullus. E. and W. Indies, America.\n\n1092. Cucumis, or Cucumber.\n\n13 species; viz. colocynthis, prophetarum, anguria, africanus, acutangulus, melo, dudaim, chate, fatius, anguinus, flexuosus, comonum, maderaspata- nus. Levant, India, Africa, Jamaica.\u2014The species called sativus, is the ordinary garden cucumber. It is less apt to grow rancid by keeping than others of the class. The C. colocynthis, called colocyninitida or bitter apple, is a native of Turkey. The fruit is about the size of an orange. Its medullary part, freed from the rind and seeds, is light, white, and spongy, composed of membranous leaves, of an extremely bitter, nauseous, acrimonious taste. Colocynth is one of the most powerful and violent cathartics; but is accounted dangerous by the best physicians. The best mode of abating its virulence, consists of triturating it with gummy farinaceous substances, or oily feeds. Without this precaution, a few grains of it will often disorder the body, and even occasion a discharge of blood. The C. melo is used in hot countries as a cooling and agreeable food.\n\n1093. Bryonia, or Bryony.\n\n11 species; viz. alba, dioica, palmata, grandis, cordifolia, laciniota, africana, cretica, icabra, icabrella, japonica. Crete, Africa, E. Indies.\n\n* B. leaves hand-shaped, rough on both sides, with callous points; male and female flowers on different plants.\u2014The root is purgative and acrid. A dram of dioica, it in substance, or half an ounce of it infused in wine, is a full dose. A cold infusion of the root in water is used externally in sciatic pains. A cataplasm of it is a most powerful detergent. A decoction, made with one pound of the fresh root, is the best purge for horned cattle. The plant is rough, growing on dry banks under hedges, and climbing upon the bushes. The roots are large, sometimes as thick as a man's thigh. Their juice, when fresh, soon excoriates the skin, but in drying they lose much of their acrimony.\n\n1094.\n1094. *Sicyos*, or Single-seeded Cucumber. Three species; viz. angulata, laciniata, garcini. America.\n\n**Order XI. Gynandria.**\n\n1095. *Andrachne*, or Bafe Orpine. Two species; viz. telephioides, fruticosa.

Salix, or Willow.\n\n34 species; viz. * acuminata, * alba, * amygdalina, * aurita, * caprea, * cinerea, * fragilis, * fusca, * herbacea, * lanata, * lapponum, * monandra, * myr-\n\nfinites, * pentandra, * repens, * reticulata, * retusa, * rosmarinifolia, * rubra, * triandra, * viminalis, * vitellina, * phylicifolia, * japonica, * haftata, * egyptiaca, * babylonica, * helix, * arbulcula, * myrtilloides, * integra, * glauca, * arenaria, * incubacea. Europe, America.\n\n* S. leaves strap-shaped, upper leaves oblique; catkins monandra. downy; one stamen.\u2014Rose willow, or purple willow. Withering. Called by Linnaeus, S. purpurea. Baskets, cradles, and all sorts of twig work are made of its long slender and flexible shoots.\n\n* S. leaves oblong, spear-shaped; flowers with three-triandra, flamens, sometimes two. Smooth willow.\u2014The bark, in doses of one or two drams, cures agues.\n\n* S. leaves egg-shaped, acute; flowers with five sta-pentandra. mens. Sweet willow, or bay-leaved willow. Called by Linnaeus S. bermophroditica. The wood crackles greatly in the fire. The dried leaves afford a yellow dye. Used in Yorkshire to make the large sort of baskets.\n\n* S. leaves egg-pear-shaped, acute, smooth above, fer-vitellina.\nnature like brittle. **Yellow willow**.\u2014The wood is white and very tough. The hoots are used by basket-makers.\n\n* S. leaves egg-spear-shaped; leaf-stalks toothed with glands. **Crack willow**.\u2014A quick grower, and bears cropping. Thrives in any soil if moist. The bark in doses of one or two drams cures agues.\n\n* S. leaves trap-spear-shaped, acute. **Red willow**.\u2014The twigs much sought after by basket-makers.\n\n* S. leaves spear-strap-shaped, very long, acute, silky underneath; branches rod-like. **Ozier**.\u2014Much used for making hoops, and the larger baskets. Is planted to prevent the banks of rivers from being washed away by torrents.\n\n* S. leaves spear-shaped, tapering to a point, ferrated, downy on both sides; the lowermost ferratures glandular. **White willow**.\u2014Grows quick, and bears lopping. The bark collected in summer when full of sap, and dried by a gentle heat, is extremely valuable, as a substitute for Peruvian bark, in the cure of intermittent fevers. It will tan leather. Horses, cows, sheep, and goats, eat the leaves and young hoots. If a shady walk with willows is wanted, male sets only ought to be planted, otherwise they will speedily multiply so as to form a thicket instead of a grove.\n\n**Order III. TRIANDRIA.**\n\n1101. **Empetrum**, or Berry-bearing Heath.\n\nTwo species; viz. * nigrum, album.\n\n* E. with stems trailing.\u2014The berries boiled with alum afford a dark purple dye. Eaten in quantities they occasion headache.\n\n1101. **Osyrus**, or Poets-caffia.\n\nTwo species; viz. alba, japonica. South Europe, Japan.\n\n1431. **Maba**.\n\nOne species; viz. elliptica. Tongataboo, Namoka.\n\n1331. **Restis**.\n\nNine species; viz. paniculatus, verticillaris, dichotomus, vimineus, triflorus, simplex, elegia, cernuus, tectorum. C. of G.

East and West Indies.\n\n**Order IV. TETRANDRIA.**\n\n1103. **Trophis**.\n\nOne species; viz. americana. Jamaica.\n\n1104. **Batis**.\n\nOne species; viz. maritima. Jamaica.\n\n1105. **Viscum**, or Mistletoe.\n\nNine species; viz. * album, rubrum, purpureum, opuntioides, capense, verticillatum, pauciflorum, terrestre, rotundifolium. Europe, Cape, West Indies, North America.\n\n* V. leaves spear-shaped, blunt; stem forked; spikes axillary. **White mistletoe**.\u2014A singular parasitical evergreen plant. The barren plant opposite to the fertile one. The root infinuates itself into the substance of the tree on which it grows. Blossom greenish white. Berries whitish. Birdlime may be made from the berries or the bark. Birds having swallowed the berries, void them unchanged upon trees, where they take root. No art has hitherto been able to make them take root in the earth. Sheep eat it greedily; and in the southern English counties, where chiefly it grows, it is often torn from the trees to feed them. It is said to preserve them from the rot. If the berries, when fully ripe, be rubbed on the smooth bark of almost any tree, they will adhere closely, and produce plants the following winter.\n\n1432. **Montinia**.\n\nOne species; viz. acris. C. of G. Hope.\n\n1106. **Hippophae**, or Sea-buckthorn.\n\nTwo species; viz. * rhamnoides, canadensis.\n\n* H. leaves spear-shaped.\u2014Cows refuse it. Horses, rham-goats, and sheep eat it. The berries are very acid, with noideis; an austere vinous flavour. The fishermen of the gulf of Bothnia prepare a rob from them, which imparts a grateful flavor to fresh fish. In sunny and sandy situations it is planted for hedges.\n\n1107. **Myrica**, or Candle-berry Myrtle, Gale.\n\nSeven species; viz. * gale, cerifera, athiopica, quer-cifolia, cordifolia, trifoliata. Europe, Madeira, Cape, North America.\n\n* M. leaves spear-shaped, somewhat ferrated; stem shrub-like. **Sweet willow**, Dutch myrtle, gale, goule.\u2014Dyed in autumn, it dyes wool yellow. It is used to tan calf-skins. The Welsh lay bunches of it under their beds to keep off fleas and moths, and give it as a vermifuge in powder and infusion, applying it also externally to the abdomen. Its essential oil rises in distillation. The catkins boiled in water throw up a waxy fecum fit to make candles. From the M. cerifera the myrtle candles are prepared.\n\n**Order V. PENTANDRIA.**\n\n1108. **Pistacia**, or Pistacia-nut.\n\nFive species; viz. trifolia, narbonensis, vera, terebinthus, lentiscus. South Europe, Barbary, Persia, India.\n\nThe P. vera, with leaves unequal winged, leaflets nearly egg-shaped, bent back, produces a moderately large nut, containing a pale greenish kernel, with a reddish skin. The tree grows spontaneously in Persia, Arabia, and the Archipelago; and has been found able to produce fruit in England. Pistachio nuts have a pleasant, sweet, unctuous taste, resembling almonds, and are esteemed by some in certain weaknesses, and in emaciated habits.\n\nThe P. lentiscus with leaves abruptly winged, and spear-shaped leaflets, in like manner bears our winters. The wood is brought to us in thick knotty pieces, with an ash-coloured bark and white within, of a rough somewhat pungent taste, and a grateful but faint smell. A decoction of it, under the pompous appellation of aurum potabile, potable gold, is recommended by the Germans in catarrhs, nausea, and weaknesses of stomach. In the island of Chio, this tree affords mastic, which is a resinous substance brought from thence in small yellowish transparent grains or tears of a pleasant smell, especially when heated. It is recommended in old coughs, dysenteries and all cases of laxity.\n\n1109.\n1109. Zanthoxylum.\n\nTwo species; viz., clava herculis, trifoliatum.\n\n1111. Astronium.\n\nOne species; viz., graveolens. South America.\n\n1281. Canarium.\n\nOne species; viz., commune. India.\n\n1110. Antidesma, or Chinese Laurel.\n\nOne species; viz., alexiteria. E.

Acnida, or Virginian Hemp.\n\nOne species; viz., cannabina, Virginia.\n\n1115. Cannabis, or Hemp.\n\nOne species; viz., sativa. India. See Agriculture Index.\n\n1116. Humulus, or Hops.\n\nOne species; viz., *lupulus. Europe.\u2014Cultivated in England to preserve malt liquors. The young shoots are eaten in the spring instead of asparagus. Strong cloth is in Sweden made from the stalks, which are soaked in water all winter, and in the spring dried like flax. A decoction of the roots, or from 20 to 30 grains of the extract, is said to be sudorific.\n\n1117. Zanonia.\n\nOne species; viz., indica. Coast of Malabar.\n\n1118. Fevillea.\n\nTwo species; viz., trilobata, cordifolia. W. Indies.\n\nOrder VI. Hexandria.\n\n1119. Tamus, or Black Bryony.\n\nTwo species; viz., *communis, cretica. South Europe, Cape.\n\n1120. Smilax, or Rough Bindweed.\n\n14 species; viz., alpina, excellia, zeilanica, farfaparilla, china, rotundifolia, laurifolia, tannoides, caduca, bona nox, herbacea, tetragona, lanceolata, pseudochina. South Europe, East Indies, North America.\n\n1121. Rajania.\n\nFive species; viz., haftata, cordata, quinquefolia, quinata, hexaphylla. Japan, North America, West Indies.\n\n1122. Dioscorea, or Indian Yam.\n\n12 species; viz., pentaphylla, triphylla, trifida, aculeata, alata, bulbifera, sativa, villosa, oppotitfolia, septemloba, quinquelobata, japonica. East and West Indies, North America.\n\nOrder VII. Octandria.\n\n1123. Populus, or Poplar tree.\n\nFive species; viz., *alba, *nigra, *tremula, balsamifera, heterophylla. S. Asia, Italy, Archipelago, N. America.\n\n* P. leaves nearly triangular, toothed, and angular; cottony underneath. White poplar.\u2014It loves low situations, and flourishes best in clay. It grows quick and bears cropping, but is unfavourable to pasturage. The wood is soft, white, and stringy, and makes good wainscoting, being little subject to swell or shrink. Floors, laths, packing boxes, and turners ware, are made of it. Horses, sheep, and goats eat it. Cows are not fond of it.\n\n* P. leaves circular, toothed, and angular; smooth on tremula, both sides. Alp, alpen tree, trembling poplar.\u2014This tree grows in all soils, but worst in clay. It impoverishes the land, destroys the grass; and the numerous shoots of the roots spread so near the surface of the earth, that they permit nothing else to grow; but rise in all quarters, whether they are wanted or not. It is easily transplanted. The wood is extremely light, white, smooth, woolly, soft, durable in the air. The bark is the principal food of beavers. The bark of the young trees is made into torches.\n\n* P. leaves trefoil-shaped, tapering to a point, serrated, nigra, smooth on both sides. Black poplar.\u2014It loves a moist black soil, grows rapidly, and bears cropping. The bark being light like cork, supports the nets of fishermen. Cattle eat it.\n\n1124. Rhodiola, or Rose-root.\n\nOne species; viz., *rofeae.\u2014The root, particularly when dried, has the fragrance of a rose; but cultivated in a garden it loses most of its sweetness.\n\n1433. Margaritaria.\n\nOne species; viz., nobilis. Surinam.\n\nOrder VIII. Enneandra.\n\n1125. Mercurialis, or Mercury.\n\nThree species; viz., *annua, *perennis, tomentosa. Europe.\n\n* M. stem undivided, leaves rough. Dogs mercury.\u2014perennis. It is noxious to sheep, and deleterious to man. In drying, it turns blue. Steeped in water it affords a fine deep blue colour; which, however, is destructible both by alkalies and acids.\n\n1126. Hydrocharis, or Frogs-bit.\n\nOne species; viz., *morbus ranee.\n\nOrder IX. Decandria.\n\n1127. Carica, or Papaw tree.\n\nTwo species; viz., papaya, polopofa. E. and W. Indies.\n\n1128. Kiggelaria.\n\nOne species; viz., africana. C. of G. Hope.\n\n1130.

Boots seem to have taken their name from the resemblance they bear to a sort of jacks or leathern bottles formerly in use, and called botte, in the old French boots. Borel derives the name from the old French word bot, a stump, by reason the boot gives the leg this appearance. The Chinese have a kind of boots made of silk or fine stuff lined with cotton, a full inch thick, which they always wear at home. This people are always booted; and when a visit is made them, if they happen to be without their boots, their guest must wait till they put them on. They never stir out of doors without their boots on; and their scrupulousness in this respect is the more remarkable as they are always carried in their chairs.\n\nThe boot was much used by the ancients, by the foot as well as by the horsemen. It was called by the ancient Romans orea; in middle-age writers, greva, gambria, bainberga, bembarga or bembarga. The boot is said to have been the invention of the Carians. It was at first made of leather, afterwards of brass or iron, and was proof both against cuts and thrusts. It was from this that Homer calls the Greeks brazen-booted. The boot only covered half the leg; some say the right leg, which was more advanced than the left, it being advanced forwards in an attack with the sword; but in reality it appears to have been used on either leg, and sometimes on both. Those who fought with darts or other missile weapons, advanced the left leg foremost, so that this only was booted.\n\nFishing-Boots, are a thick strong sort used in dragging ponds and the like. Hunting-boots, a thinner kind used by sportsmen. Jack-boots, a kind of very strong boots used by the troopers.\n\nBoot, is likewise a kind of torture for criminals; to extort a confession, by means of a boot, stocking, or buckskin of parchment; which being put on the leg moist, and brought near the fire, in shrinking squeezes the leg violently, and occasions intolerable pain.\n\nThere is also another kind of boot; consisting of four thick strong boards bound round with cords: two of these are put between the criminal's legs, and the two others placed one on the outside of one leg and the other on the other; then squeezing the legs against the boards by the cords, the criminal's bones are severely pinched, or even broken, &c.\n\nThe boot is now disused in England and Scotland; but it subsists still in some other countries.\n\nBoot-Tree, or Boot-last, an instrument used by shoemakers to widen the leg of a boot.

He was intended for the church; but running away from school to Dublin, he there commenced actor. His first appearance was in the part of Oroonoko, in which he came off with every testimonial of approbation from the audience. From this time he continued daily improving; and, after two successful campaigns in that kingdom, conceived thoughts of returning to his native country, and making a trial of his abilities on the English stage. To this end, he first, by letter, reconciled himself to his friends; and then, as a farther step towards injuring his success, obtained a recommendation from Lord Fitzhardinge (one of the lords of the bedchamber to Prince George of Denmark) to Mr Betterton, who with great candour and good nature took him under his care, and gave him all the assistance in his\nhis power. The first part Mr Booth appeared in at London was that of Maximus in Lord Rochester's Valentinian, his reception in which exceeded even his most sanguine expectations; and very soon after his performance of Artaban, in Rowe's Ambitious Stepmother, which was a new tragedy, established his reputation as second at least to his great instructor. Pyrrhus, in the Distressed Mother, was another part in which he shone without a rival. But he was indebted to a happy coincidence of merit and chance, for that height of fame which he at length attained in the character of Cato, as drawn by Mr Addison, in 1712. For this play being considered as a party one, the Whigs, in favour of whose principles it was apparently written, thought it their duty strongly to support it, while at the same time the Tories, who had too much sense to appear to consider it as a reflection on their administration, were still more vehement in their approbation of it, which they carried to such a height, as even to make a collection of 50 guineas in the boxes during the performance, and present them to Mr Booth, with this compliment, \"That it was a slight acknowledgment for his honest opposition to a perpetual dictator, and his dying so bravely in the cause of liberty.\" Besides this, he had a present of an equal sum from the managers, in consideration of the great success of the play, which they attributed in a good measure to his extraordinary merit in the performance; and certain it is, that no one since that time has ever equaled, or even nearly approached, his excellence in that character.\n\nBut these were not the only advantages which were to accrue to Mr Booth from his success in this part; for Lord Bolingbroke, then one of the principal secretaries of state, in a little time after procured a special licence from Queen Anne, recalling all the former ones, and nominating Mr Booth as joint manager with Wilkes, Cibber, and Doggett; none of whom were pleased at it; but the last especially took such disgust as to withdraw himself from any further share in the management. In 1704, Mr Booth had married a daughter of Sir William Barkham Bart. who died in 1710, without issue. Being now established in the management, he once more turned his thoughts towards matrimony; and in the year 1719 united himself to the celebrated Miss Hester Santlow, a woman of a most amiable disposition, whose great merit as an actress, added to the utmost discretion and prudential economy, had enabled her to save up a considerable fortune. During the 20 years in which Mr Booth continued a manager, the theatre was in the greatest credit; and his illness and death, which happened on the 10th of May 1733, contributed not a little to its decline.\n\nMr Booth wrote a dramatic entertainment called Dido and \u00c6neas; but his masterpiece was a Latin inscription to the memory of Mr William Smith, a celebrated actor, who died while he was young.\u2014As an actor, his excellency lay wholly in tragedy, not being able to endure such parts as had not strong passion to inspire him. And even in this walk, dignity rather than complacency, rage rather than tenderness, seemed to be his taste. For a particular idea of his abilities, we must refer to the description Mr Cibber has given of him in his Apology; and the admirable character drawn of him by that excellent judge of dramatic perfection, Aaron Hill, Esq. in a political paper published by him called the Prompter, which may be seen at length in Theophrastus, Cibber's Lives of the Poets, and Chetwood's History of the Stage.\u2014His character as a man was adorned with many amiable qualities, among which, a goodness of heart, the basis of every virtue, was remarkably conspicuous; and so particularly was he distinguished and careful, and his company sought by the great, that, as Chetwood relates of him, not one nobleman in the kingdom had so many sets of horses at command as he had.","sp":33,"ep":34},{"h":"BOOTY","t":"whatever is taken from an enemy in time of war.\u2014Among the Greeks, the booty was divided in common among the army, the general only claiming a larger share.

The generals who piqued themselves on their probity carried it wholly to the public treasury. Sometimes indeed they divided it among the soldiery, to animate them, and serve in lieu of a reward. But this distribution depended on the generals, who were to conduct themselves herein with great equity and moderation; otherwise it became a crime of peculate to lay hands on the pillage, as regularly belonging only to the state. The consuls Romulus and Vatinius were condemned for having sold the booty taken from the Equi.\u2014Among the Jews, the booty was divided equally between the army and the people, though under the kings a different kind of distribution obtained.\u2014Among the Mahometans, two thirds of the spoils are allowed to the army; the other third to God, to Mahomet and his relations, and to the orphans, the poor, and the pilgrims.\u2014Among us, formerly the booty was divided among the soldiery.

The place where it is found is said to be a small valley surrounded with snowy mountains, in which is a lake about six miles in circumference; the water of which is constantly so hot that the hand cannot bear it for any time. Around this lake the ground is perfectly barren, not producing even a blade of grass; and the earth is so full of a saline matter, that after falls of rain or snow it concretes in white flakes on the surface like the natron of Hindoostan. On the banks of this lake, in the winter season, when the falls of snow begin, the earth is formed into small reservoirs six inches high: when these are filled with snow, the hot water from the lake is thrown upon it; which, together with the water from the melted snow, remains in the reservoir, to be partly absorbed by the earth and partly evaporated by the sun; after which there remains at the bottom a cake of sometimes half an inch thick of crude borax, which is taken up and referred for use. It can only be made in the winter season, because the falls of snow are indispensably requisite, and also because the saline appearances upon the earth are strongest at that time. When once it has been made on any spot, it cannot be made again on the same until the snow has fallen and dissolved three or four times, when the saline efflorescence appears as before.

In his Introduction to Knowledge, he says, that he was a student of Oxford; but of what college he does not mention. He left the university without a degree, and entered himself a brother of a Carthusian convent in or near London; but not liking the severe discipline of that order, he returned to Oxford and applied himself to the study of physic. Some time after, he embarked for the continent; and, as he himself expresses it, \"travelled through and round about Christendom, and out of Christendom into some parts of Africa.\" In the years 1541 and 1542, he resided at Montpelier in France, where he was made doctor of physic, and after his return to England was incorporated into the same degree at Oxford. From the preface to his introduction above mentioned, it appears that he had been in Scotland, which probably was soon after his return from France. Having now satisfied his inclination for travelling, he settled first at Pevensey where he was born, afterwards at Winchester, and finally in London, where he is said to have become a fellow of the college of physicians, and first physician to King Henry VIII. But notwithstanding his eminence in his profession, he had the misfortune to spend the latter end of his life in the Fleet prison, where he died in the year 1549. As to his character, Wood says, that \"he was esteemed a noted poet, a witty and ingenious person, and an excellent physician.\" Pits call him a man of sufficient learning, but too volatile and inconstant. Bale and some others, on the contrary, abuse him grossly. His writings are, 1. A book of the introduction of knowledge, the which doth teach man to speak part of all manner of languages, &c.

They turn the small ends of the poles about five or six inches in length, to the size they intend to bore the bigger ends about the same depth, viz. five or six inches. This is designed to make a joint to shut each pair of poles together, the concave part being the female part, and the other the male of the joint. In turning the male part, they turn the channel in it, or a small groove at a certain distance from the end; and in the female part they bore a small hole to fit over this channel. This being done, they bore the poles through; and to prevent them from boring out at the side, they stick great nails at each end to be a guide in boring.

He was put early to school at Penzance, and in 1709 removed to Plymouth. March 1712-13, he was entered of Exeter college, Oxford; and, June 1719, took a master of arts degree. In 1720, he was ordained a priest; and, in 1722, instituted to the rectory of Ludgvan in Cornwall. In 1732, lord chancellor King presented him to the vicarage of St Just, his native parish; and this, with the rectory aforesaid, were all the preferments he ever had. In the parish of Ludgvan were rich copper works, which abound with mineral and metallic fossils; and these, being a man of an active and inquisitive turn, he collected from time to time, and thence was led to study at large the natural history of his native county. He was struck at the same time with the numerous monuments of remote antiquity that are to be met with in Cornwall; and, enlarging therefore his plan, he determined to gain as accurate an acquaintance as possible with the Druid learning, and with the religion and customs of the ancient Britons, before their conversion to Christianity. In 1750 he was admitted a fellow of the Royal Society; and, in 1753, published\nin folio at Oxford his \"Antiquities of Cornwall;\" a second edition of which was published, in the same form, at London, 1769, with this title, \"Antiquities, historical and monumental, of the county of Cornwall; consisting of several essays on the ancient inhabitants, Druid superstition, customs and remains of the most remote antiquity in Britain and the British isles, exemplified and proved by monuments now extant in Cornwall and the Scilly islands; with a vocabulary of the Cornu-British language.

This was the extension of a paper which had been read before the Royal Society in 1753. In 1758 came out his \"Natural history of Cornwall; Oxf.\" fol. After these publications, he sent a variety of fossils and remains of antiquity which he had described in his works, to be repolished in the Ashmolean museum: for which, and other benefactions of the same kind, he received the thanks of the university, in a letter from the vice-chancellor, Nov. 18. 1758; and, March 1766, the degree of doctor of laws. He died in 1772, aged 77 years, leaving two sons out of six, whom he had by a lady he married in 1724. Besides his literary connexions with many ingenious and learned men, he had a particular correspondence with Mr Pope; and there is still existing a large collection of letters written by that poet to Dr Borlase. He furnished Pope with many of the materials which formed his grotto at Twickenham, consisting of curious fossils; and there may at present be seen Dr Borlase's name in capitals, composed of crystals, in the grotto. On which occasion Pope says to Borlase in a letter, \"I am much obliged to you for your valuable collection of Cornish diamonds: I have placed them where they may best represent yourself, in a shade, but shining;\" alluding to the obscurity of the doctor's situation, and the brilliancy of his talents. Besides the above works, he sent many curious papers to the Philosophical Transactions, and had in contemplation several other works.","sp":37,"ep":38},{"h":"BORNE","t":"a market town of Lincolnshire in England.

It is thought to be the largest island in the world, next to New Holland; being 1,500 miles in circumference. It is seated under the equator, that line cutting it almost through the middle. It is almost of a circular figure; abounds with gold; and the finest diamonds in the Indies are found in its rivers, being probably washed down from the hills by torrents. Here are also mines of iron and tin, and leadstones. Bird's nests are to be had in this island, which are eatable, and reckoned a great delicacy. The beasts are, oxen, buffaloes, deer, goats, elephants, tigers, and monkeys. This island has fine rivers, especially towards the west and south. In their monsoon from April to September, the wind is westerly; and they have continual heavy rains, attended with violent storms of thunder and lightning. The rainy season continues for eight months of the year; and as during that time all the flat country near the coast is overflowed, the air is rendered very unhealthy, and the inhabitants are forced to build their houses on floats, which they make fast to trees. The houses have but one floor, with partitions made with cane; and the roofs are covered with palmetto leaves, the eaves of which reach within four or five feet of the bottom. The west and north coasts of the island are almost deserted, and the east is but little known. The inland parts are very mountainous; and the southeast, for many leagues together, is a flanking morass, which, being overflowed in the wet season, is very unhealthy.\n\nThe Portuguese, who first discovered Borneo, had arrived in the Indies about 30 years before they knew anything of it more than the name, and its situation, by reason of their frequently pausing by its coast. At last one Captain Edward Corril had orders to examine it more narrowly; and being once acquainted with the worth of the country, they made frequent voyages thither. They found the coasts inhabited by Malayan Moors, who had certainly established themselves there by conquest; but the original inhabitants still remain in the mountains, and are styled Beajus, which in the Malay language signifies a wild man. The most authentic account of these people is the following, which was extracted from the papers of Father Antonio Ventimiglia, an Italian missionary. He was sent to Borneo from Macao, on board a Portuguese ship, converted great numbers to Christianity, and died on the island about the year 1691. The Beajus have no kings, but many little chiefs. Some are subject to the Moorish kings, and pay them tribute; but such as live far up the country are altogether independent, and live according to their own customs. They are generally very superstitious, and much addicted to augury. They do not adore idols; but their sacrifices of sweet wood and perfumes are offered to one God, who, they believe, rewards the just in heaven, and punishes the wicked in hell. They marry but one wife; and look upon any breach of conjugal faith, either in the man or woman, as a capital offence. The Beajus are naturally honest and industrious, and have a brotherly affection for one another. They have a notion of property, which yet does not render them covetous. They sow and cultivate their lands; but in the time of harvest, each reaps as much as will serve his family, and the rest belongs to the tribe in common; by which means they prevent necessity or disputes. With the Moors on the coasts the Portuguese for some time carried on a considerable trade, and at their request settled a factory there; which, however, was afterwards surprised and plundered by the Moors, who put most of\nBornholm, the people to the sword.

The northern part is poor, and like the rest of the provinces of Zaara: but all the rest is well watered by springs and rivers that tumble down with a dreadful noise from the mountains; rendering the country prolific in corn, grapes, and fruits, and giving it a pleasing aspect. The eastern and western frontiers are divided into mountains and valleys, the latter being all covered with flocks of cattle, fields of rice and millet, and many of the mountains with wood, fruit-trees, and cotton. On the north-west stands the mountain of Tariton, having plenty of good iron mines; and on the south flows the river Niger, which, it is said, after running a great many leagues under a long chain of mountains, rears up its head again, and mingles its streams with the waters of the lake Bornou in its course, from whence it washes the walls of the capital of this kingdom. The compilers of the Universal History, however, are of opinion, that in these mountains the river Niger hath its source, because no river hath been traced to the eastward, except the Nile, which runs in a different course from north to south, and the White river, on the western frontiers of Abyssinia, which is a branch of the Nile. The eastern and western parts of Bornou are inhabited by a people of a roving disposition, who live in tents, and have their women, children, and every thing else, in common; the word property, or any idea equivalent to it, being utterly unknown among them. They have neither religion, laws, government, nor any degree of subordination; and hence they have been supposed by Cluverius to be the lineal descendents of the ancient Garamantes, and this to have been the residence of that people. In these parts, the natives are almost to a man shepherds and husbandmen. In summer they go naked, except a short apron before; but in winter they are warmly clothed with the softest sheep-skins, of which they also form their bedclothes; and indeed this is scarce a sufficient defence against the inclemency of the weather at certain seasons of the year, when a cold piercing wind blows from the northern mountains that chills the blood in proportion as the pores of the body have been opened by the scorching heats of summer.\n\nBaudrand and Draper affirm, that the natives are scarce superior in their understanding to brutes; not even having any names whereby to distinguish each other, except what they take from some personal defect or singularity; such as lean, fat, squinting, humpbacked, &c. In the towns, however, it is acknowledged that they are something more civilized and polite, being many of them merchants; but of these towns, or indeed of the kingdom in general, very little is known.\n\nBOROM\u00c6US.

It is said to be about 100 leagues distant from Ferro, probably well, though no writer has pretended to lay down its exact situation. Here it is affirmed several ships have touched by accident, and all agree in their relations of the state of the inhabitants and island. They affirm, that it is perpetually clothed with a great variety of wood, chiefly fruit-trees: that the valleys are in a perpetual state of verdure; and continually decked with flowers, grapes, and plants, the spontaneous productions of the earth; or with corn and pulse, cultivated with great care by the inhabitants: that the soil is so prolific as to raise large quantities of corn for exportation; and that the ships that call here never fail of meeting with refreshments of every kind.

Afterwards, as Vertegan informs us, borough came to signify a town that had something of a wall or enclosure about it: so that all places which among our ancestors, had the denomination borough, were one way or other fenced or fortified. But, in later times, the same appellation was also bestowed on several of the ville ingeniores, or country towns of more than ordinary note, though not walled.\n\nThe ancient Saxons, according to Spelman, gave the name burgh to those called, in other countries, cities. But divers canons being made for removing the\nBorough\n\nepiscopal fees from villages and small towns to the chief cities, the name city became attributed to episcopal towns, and that of borough retained to all the rest; though these too had the appearance of cities, as being governed by their mayors, and having laws of their own making, and sending representatives to parliament, and being fortified with a wall and castle, and the like.\n\nBorough, or burgh, is now particularly appropriated to such towns and villages as send burgesses or representatives to parliament. Boroughs are equally such, whether they be incorporate or not; there being great numbers of our English boroughs not incorporated; and, on the contrary, several corporations that are not boroughs; e.g., Kingston, Deal, Kendal, &c.\n\nBoroughs, in Scotland. See Law.\n\nRoyal Boroughs, in Scotland, are corporations made for the advantage of trade, by charters granted by several of their kings; having the privilege of sending commissioners to represent them in parliament, besides other peculiar privileges. The royal boroughs are not only so many distinct corporations, but do also constitute one entire body, governed by, and accountable to, one general court, anciently called the court of four boroughs, held yearly to treat and determine concerning matters relating to the common advantage of all boroughs. The four boroughs which composed this court were, Edinburgh, Stirling, Roxburgh, and Berwick; which two last falling into the hands of the English, Linlithgow and Lanark were put in their places; with a saving to the former whenever they should return to their allegiance. But this court not being sufficient to answer the necessities of the royal boroughs, they were all empowered under James III. in 1487, to send commissioners to a yearly convention of their own, which was then appointed to be held at Inverkeithing, but is now held at Edinburgh, under the denomination of the convention of boroughs, vested with great power, and having for their object the benefit of trade, and the general interest of the boroughs.\n\nBorough-Courts, are certain courts held in boroughs, by prescription, charter, or act of parliament: such are the sheriff's court, and court of hustings, in London.\n\nBorough-English, a customary descent of lands or tenements, in some ancient boroughs and copyhold manors, by which the youngest son, and not the eldest, succeeds to the burgage tenement on the death of his father. For which Littleton gives this reason; because the younger son, by reason of his tender age, is not so capable as the rest of his brethren to help himself. Other authors have indeed given a much stranger reason for this custom; as if the lord of the fee had anciently a right to break the seventh commandment with his tenant's wife on her wedding night; and that therefore the tenement descended, not to the eldest, but to the youngest son, who was more certainly the offspring of the tenant. But it cannot be proved that this custom ever prevailed in England, though it certainly did in Scotland, (under the name of mercebeta, or marcete), till abolished by Malcolm III. But perhaps a more rational account than either may be brought from the practice of the Tartars; among whom, according to Father Duhalde, this custom of descent to the youngest son also prevails. That nation is composed totally of shepherds and herdsmen; and the elder sons, as soon as they are capable of leading a pastoral life, migrate from their father with a certain allotment of cattle, and go to seek a new habitation. The youngest son, therefore, who continues late with his father, is naturally the heir of his house, the rest being already provided for. And thus we find, that among many other northern nations it was the custom for all the sons but one to migrate from the father, which one became his heir. So that possibly this custom, wherever it prevails, may be the remnant of that pastoral state of the ancient Britons and Germans which Caesar and Tacitus describe.\n\nBorough-head, or Head-borough, called also borough-holder, or burfholder, the chief man of the decenna, or hundred, chosen to speak and act in behalf of the rest.","sp":39,"ep":40},{"h":"BOROUGHBRIDGE","t":"a town in the north riding of Yorkshire in England, seated on the river Yore, over which there is a handsome stone bridge.

He was the son of Gilbert Borromeus count of Arona and of Mary of Medicis, and was born at the castle of Arona upon Lake Maggiore in the Milanese, in October 1538. When he was about 12 years old, Julius Caesar Borromeus resigned an abbacy to him of a considerable revenue, which was considered as an hereditary inheritance of the family; which Charles accepted, but applied the revenue wholly in charity to the poor. Having acquired a sufficient knowledge of the languages at Milan, he studied the civil and canon law at Pavia, where he lived like another Lot in Sodom, preferring his innocence among a thousand fairs by which it was endangered. He received great advantage from the company and conversation of Francis Alciat, one of the most learned men of the age, for whom he afterwards procured the purple. He would accept no new benefice but upon condition that he should be at liberty to apply the revenue to public uses. In the year 1554, Charles being then 16 years old, his father died, an event which brought him back to the castle of Arona; where, though he had an elder brother, Count Frederick, he was requested by the family to take upon him the management of the domestic affairs, to which at length he consented.\n\nAfter some time he returned again to his studies, which, in the year 1559, being then just 21, he finished by a solemn act, and took his doctor's degree. The promotion of his uncle to the pontificate, by the name of Pius IV., which happened the year following, seemed to have very little effect upon him; but he was very soon made protonotary, and entrusted both with the public and privy seal of the ecclesiastical state: he was also, at the same time, created cardinal deacon, and soon after archbishop of Milan. In obedience to the will of his uncle the pope, he lived in great splendour, having a brilliant retinue and a great number of domestics; yet his own temperance and humility were never brought into question. In order to render even his amusements useful, he established an academy of select and learned persons, as well ecclesiastics as laics, from among his household and dependants, who were employed in some exercise which tended to inspire a love of virtue, and to form a just taste. Each of them was to write upon some chosen subject, either in verse or in prose, and to communicate to each other in frequent conferences the fruits of their studies. The works produced by this society have been published in many volumes, under the title of Novae Vaticanae, because these useful assemblies were held at the Vatican, and at night, after the bustle of the day was over. About this time Charles also formed a design of founding a college at Pavia, which should at the same time be a school of science and an asylum from the vices and vanities of the world. In prosecution of this design, he raised a large edifice upon the foundations of several houses which belonged to the family of Borromeus in that city; he obtained from the pope several benefices, which he attached to his building; he provided it with all things necessary for the young scholars out of his own revenue; and he dedicated his Borromeus college to St. Justina virgin and martyr.\n\nUpon the death of his only brother Frederick, his relations, his friends, and even the pope himself, advised him to change his state, to quit the church, and marry, that his family might not become extinct. Charles, however, contrary to this advice and the expectations of the world, received the priesthood, and addressed the pope in these terms; \"Do not complain of me, Holy Father, for I have taken a spouse whom I love and on whom my wishes have been long fixed.\" From this time he became more fervent in exercises of piety and ecclesiastical knowledge: He perceived that some literati who had departed from the faith had also corrupted the writings of some holy doctors of the church, and he thought he should render religion good service if he could restore the genuine reading: He therefore employed Achilles Statius, a Portuguese of great learning, in this work, whom for that purpose he retained at Rome. To his zeal and attention also is owing the congregation of eight cardinals, still subsisting, to resolve doubts and obviate difficulties which should arise in explanations of the council of Trent.\n\nThere was a very intimate friendship between Borromeus and Don Bartholomew des Martyrs archbishop of Prague, and author of a work entitled Stimulus Pannonum. This work falling into Borromeus's hands gave him an earnest desire to become a preacher, as he was now convinced that preaching was one of the principal duties of a prelate. An almost inconceivable multiplicity of business, ill health, a feeble voice, and a difficult pronunciation, were no insuperable obstacles to his design, yet he surmounted them all; and though his beginnings were weak, yet perseverance crowned them with success.\n\nHaving obtained permission to visit his church, which the pope had hitherto refused as he found his presence necessary at Rome, he prepared to set out for Milan. He had before sent thither his grand vicar Ormanetus, whose labours at first had not been unsuccessful, but who soon found oppositions so pertinacious and obstinate as put an end to his hopes: Borromeus therefore saw the necessity of going in person, and he was received with the most distinguished honours. He was, however, soon recalled to Rome, where many things made his presence necessary: the pope was gradually dying; and Charles arrived just time enough to administer to him the last sacraments.\n\nPius IV. died on the 7th of January 1566, and 28 days afterwards Cardinal Alexandrine mounted the papal chair, and assumed the name of Pius V., the skill and diligence of Borromeus having contributed not a little to prevent the cabals of the conclave.\n\nAs soon as this event had taken place, and all was quiet at Rome, Borromeus gave himself wholly up to the reformation of his diocese, where the most flagitious irregularities were openly practised, having first made another reform in his own family. He began by making pastoral visits in his metropolis, where the canons were not distinguished for the purity of their manners. He soon restored proper decency and dignity to divine service, by a variety of wise and necessary regulations: In conformity to the decrees of the council of Trent, he cleared the cathedral of many pompous\npompous tombs, rich ornaments, banners, arms, and in general of all the trophies with which the vanity of man had disfigured the house of God; and in order to give a sanction to his zeal by his example, he spared not the monuments of his nearest relations. Nor did his zeal stop here: he divided the nave of the church through its whole length into two parts, by strong thick planks, that the two sexes, being separated, might perform their devotions without any attention to each other, and with a modesty and recollection more suitable to the place.\n\nThis pastoral care extended from the cathedral to the collegiate churches, and even to the fraternities or societies of penitents, particularly that of St John the Baptist. The duty of this society was to attend criminals to the place of punishment, to assist, comfort, and prepare them for death; but the spirit of the institution was now forgotten, and the wretches who were condemned to death were commonly dragged to execution like beasts, without any spiritual assistance or consolation. But the archbishop revived the original fervour of this order, in the exercise of their peculiar duty, and persuaded many of the nobility and principal persons of the city to become members of a society appropriated to so eminent a branch of Christian charity. The reformation of the monasteries followed that of the churches, and the vigilance of the pastor soon extended itself from the city to the country round it, which abounded with irregularities that required his correction. The great abuses and irregularities which had overrun the church at this time arose principally from the gross ignorance of the clergy; in order therefore to attack these evils at their root, Charles established seminaries, colleges, and communities, for the education of young persons intended for holy orders. He met with many difficulties, and much opposition in his endeavours to bring about a reformation of manners; but he prevailed against every obstacle by an inflexible constancy, tempered with great sweetness of manners.\n\nThe governor of the province, and many of the senators, were apprehensive that the cardinal's ordinances and proceedings would encroach upon the civil jurisdiction, and become inconsistent with the rights of his Catholic majesty, to whom the duchy of Milan was then in subjection. And this was a fruitful source of remonstrances, representations, and complaints, which long troubled the courts of Rome and Madrid, and which the king of Spain, Philip II., referred entirely to the decision of the pope. But Borromeus had a more formidable opposition to struggle with, that of several religious orders, particularly the Brothers of Humility. Three provosts of the society entered into a conspiracy to cut him off; and one of their confederates, called Jerom Donat, whose surname was Farina, took upon him to carry the design into execution. For this purpose he mixed with the crowd that went into the archiepiscopal chapel, where the cardinal spent an hour every evening in prayer with his domestics and other pious persons; and having watched his opportunity, he fired a harquebus at him, which was loaded with a ball suited to the bore of the piece, and with a considerable charge of leaden shot. It is said that the ball struck him on the spinal bone, but fell down at his feet without doing any other damage than soil-\n\ning his rochet, and that one of the shot penetrated his clothes to the skin, and there stopped, without imprinting any wound, which was considered as a miracle, especially as the other shot tore away part of a wall, and went quite through a table.\n\nIn the year 1576, the city and diocese of Milan were visited by the plague, which swept away incredible numbers; and the behaviour of Borromeus, on this occasion, was truly Christian and heroic: He not only continued on the spot, but he went about giving directions for accommodating the sick, and burying the dead, with a zeal and attention that were at once ardent and deliberate, minute and comprehensive; and his example stimulated others to join in the good work. He avoided no danger, and he spared no expense; nor did he content himself with establishing proper regulations in the city, but went out into all the neighbouring parishes where the contagion raged, distributing money to the poor, ordering proper accommodations for the sick, and punishing those, especially the clergy, who were remiss in the duties of their calling. Charles, notwithstanding the fatigue and perplexity which he suffered by thus executing his pastoral charge, abated nothing of the usual austerity of his life, nor omitted any of his stated devotions; for, whatever approached to luxury or magnificence, he considered as incompatible with the propriety of his character. It happened, that being once on a visit to the archbishop of Sienna at his palace, a very sumptuous entertainment was provided for him. Borromeus, though he had been used to content himself with bread and water, yet sat down at the table, where however he ate but little, and gave sufficient intimation that he was much displeased with such ostentatious prodigality; but what was his surprise when he saw the table again covered with a dessert, consisting of whatever was most rare, exquisite, and costly! He immediately rose hastily from his seat, as if he had suddenly recollected some pressing business, and gave orders for his departure, notwithstanding the rain, and the most earnest entreaties of the archbishop. \"My Lord,\" said the cardinal, \"if I should tarry here to-night, you would give me another such treat as that I have just seen, and the poor will then suffer another loss, great numbers of whom might have been fed with the superfluities that have been now set before us.\"\n\nThe continual labours and austerities of Borromeus naturally shortened his life; he went to Vercal to put an end, if possible, to the divisions which threatened the most fatal consequences; and, when he was there, he received a message from the duke of Savoy, requesting his presence at Turin. From Turin he retired to a place called the Sepulchre, on the mountain Varais, where he was seized with an intermittent fever, which scarce permitted him to return alive to Milan, where he arrived on the 3rd of November 1584, and died the next day. He was lamented by the city and the whole province with such marks of sincere sorrow as are rarely seen; and he was immediately worshipped as a saint without waiting for the pope's approbation. The pope, however, when he was told of it by Cardinal Baronius, gave directions that the devotion of the people should not be restrained, though Borromeus was not canonized till the 1st of November 1610, in the pontificate of Leo XI. Since that time many churches\nBorromeus, churches and chapels have been erected in honour of Borrowing; this saint, and many religious societies instituted and put under his protection.\n\nThe foregoing particulars are extracted from an account of the life of Borromeus, written some years ago by Father Anthony Touron. Upon a comparison of this life with that written by Ribadeneira a Spanish Jesuit above a century ago, it appears that the improvement of knowledge has made a very striking difference in this kind of biography. Ribadeneira, who lived in the midst of ignorance and superstition, did not suspect that the time was at hand when the incredible and ridiculous fables he recites could not be believed: his life of this saint therefore abounds with particulars which Touron has justly omitted. We are told that a miraculous light was seen over the chamber of Borromeus's mother when she was in labour: That Borromeus, seeing two persons carried violently down a rapid river on their horses, and just ready to perish, caused their horses suddenly to leap with them out of the water, by giving them his benediction: That Octavian Varese, a gentleman of Milan, who was confined to his bed by sickness, when Borromeus died became instantly well, by recommending himself to the saint's intercession. That a daughter of Julius Bonacina was instantly cured of a disorder in her eye, which had taken away the sight of it, by performing an act of devotion in honour of this saint: That a count of Ferrara was instantly seized with a violent disease upon speaking irreverently of Borromeus's picture, but was cured upon confessing his fault. It would certainly be a work of infinite service to the Roman church, to new-write the lives of her saints in such a manner as can now be believed, since the lives already written might by that means be gradually superseded, which are a better antidote against Popery than the arguments of the best reasoner in the world.","sp":40,"ep":43},{"h":"BORROWING AND HIRING","t":"in Law, are contracts by which a qualified property may be transferred to the hirer or borrower; in which there is only this difference, that hiring is always for a price or stipend, or additional recompense; borrowing is merely gratuitous. But the law in both cases is the same. They are both contracts, whereby the possession and transient property is transferred for a particular time or use, on condition and agreement to restore the goods so hired or borrowed, as soon as the time is expired, or the use performed, together with the price or stipend (in case of hiring) either expressly agreed upon by the parties, or left to be implied by law, according to the value of the service. By this mutual contract, the hirer or borrower gains a temporary property in the thing hired, accompanied with an implied condition to use it with moderation, and not to abuse it; and the owner or lender retains a reverification interest in the same, and acquires a new property in the price or reward. Thus, if a man hires or borrows a horse for a month, he has the possession and a qualified property therein during that period; on the expiration of which his qualified property determines, and the owner becomes (in case of hiring) entitled also to the premium or price for which the horse was hired.\n\nThere is one species of this price or reward the most usual of any, but concerning which many good and learned men have in former times very much perplexed themselves and other people, by raising doubts about Borrowing's legality in foro conscientiae. That is, when money is lent on a contract to receive not only the principal sum again, but also an increase by way of compensation for the use, which is generally called interest by those who think it lawful, and usury by those who do not so.

Each tithing formed a little state or commonwealth within itself, and chose one of its most respectable members for its head, who was sometimes called the alderman of such a tithing or freeburgh, on account of his age and experience, but most commonly borseholder, from the Saxon words borb, \"a surety,\" and alder, \"a head or chief.\" This magistrate had authority to call together the members of his tithing, to preside in their meetings, and to put their sentences in execution. The members of each tithing, with their tithing-man or borseholder at their head, constituted a court of justice, in which all the little controversies arising within the tithing were determined.

Having early entered into the navy, he was, in 1740, captain of the Shoreham; and behaved with great intrepidity as a volunteer under Admiral Vernon, Boscowen, at the taking of Porto Bello. At the siege of Carthagena, in March 1740-1, he had the command of a party of seamen who resolutely attacked and took a battery of twenty-four pounders, though exposed to the fire of another fort of five guns. Lord Aubrey Beauclerk being killed at the attack of Boca-Chica, Captain Boscowen succeeded him in the command of the Prince Frederic of 70 guns. In May 1742, he returned to England, and married Frances daughter of William Glanville, Esq.; and the same year was elected representative for Truro in Cornwall. In 1744, he was made captain of the Dreadnought of 60 guns; and soon after he took the Medea, a French man of war commanded by M. Hoquart, the first king's ship taken in that war. May 3, 1747, he signalized himself under the admirals Anson and Warren, in an engagement with the French fleet off Cape Finisterre, and was wounded in the shoulder with a musket ball. Here M. Hoquart, who then commanded the Diamond of 56 guns, again became his prisoner; and all the French ships of war, which were ten in number, were taken. On the 15th of July he was made rear-admiral of the blue, and commander in chief of the land and sea forces employed on an expedition to the East Indies; and, on the 4th of November, sailed from St Helen's, with six ships of the line, five frigates, and 2000 soldiers. On the 29th of July 1748, he arrived at St David's, and soon after laid siege to Pondicherry; but the men growing sickly, and the monsoons being expected, the siege was raised, and Mr Boscowen showed himself as much the general as the admiral in his retreat. Soon after he had news of the peace, and Madras was delivered up to him by the French. In April 1750, he arrived at St Helen's in the Exeter, and found that in his absence he had been appointed rear-admiral of the white. He was the next year made one of the lords commissioners of the admiralty, and chosen an elder brother of the Trinity-house. In February 1755, he was appointed vice-admiral of the blue. On the 19th of April, failing in order to intercept a French squadron bound to North America, he fell in with the Alcide and Leys of 64 guns each, which were both taken: on this occasion M. Hoquart became his prisoner a third time, and he returned to Spithead with his prizes and 1500 prisoners. In 1756, he was appointed vice-admiral of the white; and in 1758, admiral of the blue, and commander in chief of the expedition to Cape Breton; when, in conjunction with General Amherst, and a body of troops from New England, the important fortress of Louisbourg and the whole island of Cape Breton was taken, for which he afterwards received the thanks of the house of commons. In 1759, being appointed to command in the Mediterranean, he arrived at Gibraltar, where hearing that the Toulon fleet, under M. de la Clue, had passed the Straits, in order to join that at Brest, he got under sail, and on the 18th of August saw, pursued, and engaged the enemy. His ship, the Namur of 90 guns, losing her main-mast, he shifted his flag to the Newark; and, after a sharp engagement, took three large ships, and burnt two in Lagos bay, and the same year arrived at Spithead with his prizes and 2000 prisoners.

These are certainly entitled to much of our confidence; and when the names of M. de la Lande, M. Fabroni, Stay, and Zamagna are mentioned, we may be thought fastidious, in implying the least distrust of their testimony. It is our respect for the public and for truth, and it is our knowledge of the nature of eulogies, which have made us so.\n\nWe have, therefore, endeavoured, rather to relate the incidents in the life of Bosovich, than to give a transcript of friendly effusion; and yet perhaps it may be discovered, that our portrait is luminous with eulogium, whilst its outlines are poorly defined.\n\nBosovich was born on the 11th of May 1711, at Ragusa, a sea port on the coast of the Adriatic, and capital of a small republic of the same name, under the protection of the Turks and the Venetians. We know so little of his parents, that we can only conjecture at their circumstances and capacity, from the education which they gave to their son being liberal and judicious.\n\nIt does not appear that our author gave any tokens of superior genius, till he was sent to learn grammar and philosophy in the schools of the Jesuits, who were at that time the principal teachers in Ragusa, and throughout Italy. Amongst them, his docility and obedience could not pass unnoticed, but were sufficient to mark him as a likely subject for future eminence, and consequently to procure to him particular attention. In his 15th year, after he had gone through the ordinary course of education, and when it was necessary to determine his further pursuits, application was made to admit him into the order; and for the reasons we have mentioned, was readily complied with. This was agreeable to his own inclination, and proved the source of that distinction in learning to which he afterwards attained.\n\nThe Jesuits, it is well known, had much interest and authority to promote in the city of Rome; whither it was customary in them to send those members whom they knew to be qualified for that purpose, and those youths of whom they had great expectations, for more instruction. As Bosovich was sent there in the year 1723, we may reasonably imagine he had profited much by his teachers, and was signalized for his abilities. This zeal in the cultivation of youth, which the Jesuits ever preserved, and which perhaps tended more to the preservation of their power than all their religious artifices, was attended with consequences the most beneficial to humanity; and when we recollect how many and how great the geniuses were which it discovered, and fostered and brought to maturity, we are almost induced to believe that it counterbalanced all the ill effects of their order. Had this education been confined to some limited sphere; had it embraced the prattling doctrines of casuistry and the unwieldy mass of cloistered theology alone; unfortunate and melancholy for the world would have been this zeal: no refuge for the venial penitent, no security against boisterous fecundity would have remained; an unmannerly lethargy would have debauched the mind, and the moral and the intellectual world would have sunk to a dread chaos of confusion. But the Jesuits knew well the benignant influence of literature, and the salutary elevation of science; they saw that wealth, and power, and honour,\nnour, followed philosophy; and that philosophy had driven famine, wretchedness, and vice, from their habitations. We dare not say that the interest and aggrandizement of their order were secondary considerations, but we will avow it as our opinion, that the short reign of the Jesuits, and the objects at which they aimed, and above all the means which they employed, were more instructive, promised better, and effected more to humanity, than all the accumulated humility and sanctity of all the religious societies of the Roman church. We have been led into this digression by the coincidence of certain considerations operating at the time on our minds. Bofcovich was of the order of Jesuits; that order is no more; its destruction took place in his life-time; gratitude for the delight and the instruction we have received from him and many others of the order; the present disposition among mankind to detract from its merits, to magnify its imperfections, and to confound it with the fanatical and enthusiastic groups of every persuasion which have disgraced the name and the dignity of religion. But to return; our author on his arrival in Rome, entered the novitiate of the order, where his studies wore a new aspect, but were still pursued with diligence. Christian morality, the rules and constitutions of the order, claimed his attention for two years; after which he was instructed in rhetoric, and became well versed in general literature, in a particular manner in Latin poetry, which at that time was very much cultivated.\n\nFrom the noviciate he was sent to the Roman college to study mathematics and physics. It was in these sciences that his elevated genius and uncommon abilities shone forth so conspicuously, and procured to him the admiration of his superiors. In three years' time he was able to give private lessons on mathematics; and was then exempted from a law, by which the novices were bound to teach Latin and the belles lettres for five years before they commenced the study of theology. This exemption was in consequence of his great predilection to the mathematics, of which he was soon afterwards made public professor. It would appear to us, that the science of theology, as it was then incultuated, had little attraction for the mind of Bofcovich; for it is not likely that a mind intimately acquainted with truth, and accustomed to find her ever plain and unadulterated, could relish the retiring obscurities of philosophy, or the flimsy deceptions of a mystical religion; nor can we wonder, that during the four years in which he was constrained to the study, he should become more familiar with Leibnitz, Maclaurin, and Newton, than with Loyola, and Laynez, and Aquaviva.\n\nFor the professorship of mathematics he was eminently qualified, as, besides a thorough knowledge of all the modern productions in the science, he had acquired a primitive severity of demonstration by studying the works of the ancient geometricians; and he conjoined withal an obliging accommodation of his own powers to the deficiencies of his pupils. It was for their benefit he at this time composed elementary treatises on arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. But notwithstanding the arduous duties of his situation which he invariably fulfilled, he found time to instruct and enlighten more than boys; for about this period, he entertained some of those original notions which were destined to grow up into system, and one day to astonish the whole world of science. These, as they grew, were strengthened by solid arguments in the public disputations, by anticipating obstructions, overcoming and removing them, and by mighty efforts in extending and applying them to the most remote and directive actions of the universe. The animating spirit of discovery and invention led him to consider every portion of physical science; and indeed so versatile and so vigorous was his mind, we would be at a loss to specify one portion, which, within a few years, it did not comprehend, elucidate, and advance. In confirmation of this we beg to present our readers with an enumeration of the principal subjects to which he turned his attention, and concerning which he published dissertations whilst he continued in the professorship. The transit of Mercury over the sun; the spots in the sun; the aurora borealis; the construction of spheric trigonometry; the figure of the earth; a new telescope to determine celestial objects; the ancient arguments for the rotundity of the earth; oscillating circles; on infinites and infinitely little quantities; the motion of bodies in unresisting spaces; the aberration of the fixed stars; the inequalities in terrestrial gravity; on astronomy; on the limits of certainty in astronomical observations; on the solid of greatest attraction; the cycloid; the logistic curve lines; the vises vivae; the comets; light; tides; the rainbow; the calculation of fractions; the centre of gravity; the moon's atmosphere; the law of continuity; lenses and dioptrical telescopes; the objective micrometer; the divisibility of matter. Some of these are short, but all of them contain curious and valuable matter. It is only by perusing them we are able to discover the gradual progress of his mind; and to understand the manner in which he arrived at the theory of natural philosophy, which alone will render his name immortal.\n\nAbout this time a taste for philosophical poetry was much prevalent amongst the learned, and some of our author's acquaintances had laboured in it with success. Of these we may mention Father Noceti who wrote on the rainbow and the aurora borealis, and the justly celebrated Benedict Stay, whose poems on the philosophy of Descartes, and on the more modern philosophy, are excellent examples of fine Latin composition and scientific investigation. Bofcovich published their works with annotations and supplements, in which a splendid fund of information and learning is displayed.\n\nBy such undertakings, the fame of our author was widely diffused, and he became an object of general admiration. The learned societies of many countries in Europe conferred on him unfolicited honours, and several foreign princes invited him to their courts. His opinions on various subjects of civil architecture, topography, and hydrodynamics, were asked and entertained by Pope Benedict XIV. John V. of Portugal, and others. These necessarily required his presence in different states, where he never failed to increase his reputation, and often terminated disputes which might otherwise have gone on to open warfare.\n\nHe was employed to correct the maps of the papal dominions, and to measure a degree of the meridian passing\npassing through them. In this he was assisted by an English Jesuit, Christopher Maire. An account of their expedition was printed at Rome and Paris, and is interspersed with some curious anecdotes, concerning the opinions which the peasants of the Apennines formed of them, and the operations which they had to perform; but it is valuable on account of the accurate detail which is given of their observations.\n\nIn the year 1757, he was sent to Vienna by the republic of Lucca, to reconcile some differences concerning the draining of a lake, in which the grand duke of Tuscany the emperor Francis I. and that republic, were concerned. It was after he had succeeded in the object of his visit to that city, that he published there his \"Theoria Philosophiae Naturalis\" in 1758; and that he gained the esteem of the empress queen.\n\nAnother occasion for his mediating powers soon presented itself, and which more nearly interested him, as his native city of Ragusa required them. It had been suspected by the British government, that some ships of war were fitted out at that port for the service of the French, thereby infringing the neutrality. Such a suspicion having no just foundation, alarmed the senate of Ragusa, and required speedy removal, as the consequences of it might be extremely prejudicial to their commerce. Bofcovich, who had often been successful in similar circumstances for other powers, appeared to them the most proper person for this purpose, and was accordingly intrusted with it. He repaired to London, and here also effected the object of his mission with honour to himself. He visited the Royal Society, which received him with distinguishing marks of respect, and which he soon afterwards complimented with an excellent Latin poem on the solar and lunar eclipses. This was in the year 1760, when Dr Johnson was in London. Mr Murphy speaks of an interview which took place between our author and Johnson; but in order to magnify the unruly powers of the tremendous companion, he rather unhandsomely tells us of the easy count with which a priest might travel through Italy and France. We are unwilling to mention what effects on some minds may have been produced by the formidable society of a Johnson; but if they are a contempt of elegant simplicity and ingenuous ease, and an affected devotion to repulsive pomp and authoritative ostentation, be our lot far from his influence, amid the peace and liberty of social life.\n\nBofcovich was invited by the Royal Society to be of the party of their members sent to America, to observe the transit of Venus over the sun's disk, which happened in the year 1762. The nature of his embassy, and the necessity of returning home, however, prevented his acceptance of the invitation. Soon after his return, and when his embassy was fulfilled, he was appointed by the senate of Milan to the mathematical chair in the university of Pavia, and to superintend the observatory of the royal college of Brera. He continued in this situation for five years, when he was made professor of astronomy and optics in the Palatine schools of Milan by the empress queen; who also requested him to continue his attention to the observatory. This he expected to be the most agreeable part of his life. Admired by the learned; beloved by his friends; having an adequate income, and a constitution found and vigorous; he promised to himself, happy, because useful Bofcovich, days, in the tranquil cultivation of the sciences; but a cloud long impending now burst over his head, and these bright days never came.\n\nThe mysterious regulation in the political constitution of the Jesuits, though it had attracted the keen curiosity of the world, had, for very substantial reasons never been explored; nay, such was the influence of the order over the minds of the most enlightened statesmen, that this impenetrable mystery was held sacred by the civil power in many countries, as if no danger could exist in what was not understood. But the rapid progress of science, and the gradual decay of superstition, required some evidence of security, and some proof that it was ever necessary to conceal good intentions, and to cover virtuous principles with any other garb than what truth could bestow. These it is well known, the Jesuits either could not, or were unwilling to give; and they, therefore, justly incurred the suspicion of men. The most trivial circumstances would augment this suspicion, and the least deviation from rectitude in any of the order would serve to justify it; these were not wanting, and soon became invincible; the interest of the Jesuits rapidly declined for many years, and at last, in 1773, their order was totally abolished.\n\nNo exemption from the edict for its downfall could be procured: all who held offices were dismissed; and Bofcovich sought refuge in the city of Paris. Thither indeed he was invited by the minister, (we believe Turgot) by whose means he was made one of the directors of optics for the sea service, and received a pension: but it does not seem that his situation was agreeable to him; for it is well known that the peculiar nature of his circumstances was the sole cause of his long residence in Paris.\n\nWhether his dislike arose from the envy of some of the French, his own irritability of temper, or the incongruity of the prevailing manners with his own, we cannot determine: but it is reasonable to imagine, that the ruin of his order, and the subsidence of his own importance, would leave some indelible mark in his mind; and perhaps when he contemplated the apparent levity and the real skepticism of the age, he might be brought to fear that the degradation or the downfall of the world was concomitant. Sentiments very opposite to those of the French, would thence naturally arise; morosity and discontent would invade him, and wished to revisit the scenes of his youth. Be all this, however, as it may, certain it is, he applied for leave of absence for two years, after he had resided in Paris for ten years: this he easily procured, and accordingly set out for Bassano in the republic of Venice. At this place he published in five vols. quarto, a collection of the works which he had finished in Paris. This forms a body of optical and astronomical knowledge, well worthy the attention of the philosophical and mechanical cultivators of the sciences. It may be worth mentioning, that by proceeding on the principles contained in one of the dissertations in this collection, an amiable philosopher of our own country (Dr. Robison) believed it possible to ascertain the motions of the earth, though the observer should be confined in a cellar; in prosecuting the subject, however, he\nBosovich found that an error into which Bosovich had fallen, concerning the aberration of light, undermined the principles on which he had erected such a wonderful but legitimate problem. The candid and very interesting acknowledgement of the error, and his extreme disappointment in the discovery of it, which the doctor made in the 3rd vol. of the Edinburgh Transactions, is at once an evidence of his own liberality, and an undefeasible testimony to Bosovich's genius.\n\nWe beg to recommend to our readers the perusal of the works which we have now mentioned; they would tend to form the mind to the true mode of investigating the phenomena of nature, and will satisfactorily shew that this mode is always rewarded by discovery. The following is a pretty just account of their contents: A new instrument for determining the refracting and diverging forces of diaphanous bodies; a demonstration of the fallacy of the Newtonian analogy between light and sound; the algebraic formula regarding the focuses of lenses, and their applications for calculating the sphericity of those which are to be used in achromatic telescopes; the corrections to be made in ocular lenses, and the error of the sphericity of certain glasses; the causes which hinder the exact union of the solar rays by means of the great burning glasses, and the determination of the loss arising from it; the method of determining the different velocities of light passing through different mediums by means of two dioptrical telescopes, one common, the other of a new kind, containing water between the objective glasses and the place of the image; a new kind of objective micrometers; the defects and inutility of a dioptrical telescope proposed and made at Paris, which gives two images of the same object, the one direct, the other inverted, with two contrary motions of moveable objects; maladies haunting in the atmosphere, as hail of an extraordinary size, seen on the sun with the telescope, and resembling spots; the astronomical refractions, and various methods for determining them; various methods for determining the orbits of comets and of the new planet, with copious applications of these doctrines to other astronomical subjects, and still more generally to geometry and to the science of calculation; the errors, the rectifications, and the use of quadrants, of sextants, of astronomical sectors, of the meridian line, of telescopes called the instruments of transit, of the meridian, and of the parallactic machine; the trigonometrical differential formulae, which are of so much use in astronomy; the use of the micrometrical rhombus, extended to whatever oblique position; the error arising from refractions in using the astronomical ring for a sundial, and the correction to be made; the appearing and the disappearing of Saturn's ring; the methods of determining the rotation of the sun by means of the spots, proposed formerly by the author, and now perfected; the greatest exactness possible in determining the length of a pendulum oscillating every second of middle time by the comparison of terrestrial and celestial gravity; a compend of astronomy for the use of the marine, containing the elements of the heavenly motions, and of the astronomical instruments, to be explained to a prince in the course of one month; a method for determining the altitudes of the poles with the greatest exactness, by means of a gnomon alone, where other instruments are not to be had; the determination of the illuminated edge of the moon to be observed on the meridian; a method of using the retrograde return of Venus to the same longitude, for determining the least certain elements of her orbit; a method for correcting the elements of a comet, of which the longitude of the node is given, and the inclination of the orbit has been found nearly; another method for the same purpose, and for finding the elliptical orbit, when the parabolic one does not agree with the observations; a method for correcting the elements of a planet by three observations; the projection of an orbit inclined in the plane of the ecliptic; the projection of an orbit inclined in any other plane; the calculation of the aberration of the stars, arising from the successive propagation of light; some beautiful theorems belonging to triangles, which are of great use in astronomy, reduced to most simple demonstrations.\n\nAfter the publication of these works, our author left Baffano, and went to Rome to visit the companions of his youth. From Rome he proceeded to Milan, where he revised some of his own works, and prepared for publication the two last volumes of Stay's poems.\n\nIn such occupations, and amidst friends whom equal misfortune and temporary separation had still more endeared, he had remained happy, and might perhaps have been still further useful to the world; but his leave of absence was now nearly expired, and his dislike to a residence in Paris was augmented by the contrast which his present abode afforded. He was too delicate to apply for more leave of absence; and though he was sensible of the gratitude which he owed to France, he could not reconcile it with the destruction of his own repose. About this time also he had several attacks of gout, but he would admit no medical aid. Under these distresses, and others which we have before mentioned, our illustrious author at last sunk: a melancholy depopulation seized on and subjugated his mind, so that for five months he remained perfectly fatuous; and an imposthume having burst in his breast, terminated his existence on the 13th of February 1787, in the 76th year of his age.\n\nThe following inscription was composed by Benedict Stay, and engraved on marble by order of the senate of Ragusa, in memory of their useful citizen the illustrious Bosovich.\n\nRogerio Nicolai F.

Mandante\n\nMulte\nBesides the works which we have mentioned, he wrote several others on various subjects, as, on the project of turning the navigation to Rome from Fiumicino to Maccarese; a third on two torrents in the territory of Perugia; a fourth on the bulwarks on the river Ponaro; a fifth on the river Sidone in the territory of Placentia; a sixth on the entrance into the sea of the Adige. He wrote other such works on the bulwarks of the Po; on the harbours of Ancona, of Rimini, of Magna Vacca, and Savona, besides others, almost all which were printed. He had likewise received a commission from Clement XIII. to visit the Pompin lakes, on the draining of which he drew up his opinion in writing, to which he added further elucidations at the desire of Pius VI.\n\nWe have spoken of Boscovich as the founder of a new system of natural philosophy, which has occupied much of the attention of the learned, and which alone will render the name of its author immortal. It becomes us therefore to give such a synopsis of it, as may satisfy the general reader, or induce the student to search for more information in the work from which we ourselves have derived it.\n\nIn a subject so abstruse and remote from observation as many of the principles which we have to consider in this theory, much difficulty in investigation is to be expected, and perhaps the metaphorical language which we are constrained to employ, will tend not a little to embarrass and mislead us. We are also aware of the many obstructions which a theory of such magnitude has to encounter in the improved mode of philosophising of the present day; we are aware that at the bare mention of a new theory in natural philosophy, some of our readers will revolt from our page, affect a contempt of our labours, and call to their aid the authority of Bacon. But we would ask such, from whence does their spirit arise? we have found it in those who never studied a page of Bacon; and we have known it accompanied by indolence, and by a supine indifference to aught that dignifies and elevates humanity. It is surely no hard matter to condemn a theory, merely because it is a theory; nor is it at all demonstrable that such condemnation requires any great effort of genius or understanding. Now the spirit of Bacon is a spirit of zeal, and labour, and perseverance, and above all, of investigation. Not then from his writings has this contempt arisen, but from a total ignorance of them; not from his doctrine, but from an imaginary inspiration of his principles.\nWe have reason to believe that the theory of Bofcovich would have received the sanction of the illustrious Bacon; because the foundation on which it is erected is consecrated by irradiation from his works. Be this, however, as it may, we are convinced that such an example of true genius will be acceptable to every friend of humanity, and to every cultivator of science.\n\nThat we may do justice to our author in giving a synopsis of his theory, we shall follow the order which he himself has adopted; and shall subjoin some general observations and remarks which have occurred to us in the course of the work.\n\nBofcovich's Theoria Philosophiae Naturalis is divided into three parts, of which the first contains the explication of the theory, its analytic deduction, and its vindication.\n\nThe second contains the application of the theory to mechanics, and\n\nThe third the application of the theory to physics. Of these in order, and first of the explication of the theory.\n\nThis theory has something in common with the Leibnitzian and the Newtonian.\n\nWith the former it admits that the elements of matter are simple and inextended; but it differs from it, in denying the continued extension of the elements, and in asserting that the elements are perfectly homogeneous.\n\nLike the Newtonian, it allows the existence of mutual powers or forces, which vary according to the distance by certain laws; but it goes further, in that it affirms these powers are both repulsive and attractive, and that when either of these terminates the other begins; but it differs from the Newtonian in explaining by one principle phenomena to which the latter applies three.\n\nThis one principle may be expressed by an algebraic formula, or by one continued geometrical curve; and it is the law by which the powers of repulsion and attraction act. As continued extension of bodies is rejected from this theory, it is obvious, that as on the one hand a repulsive power must render it impossible, so on the other an attractive power must give rise to the apparent examples of it, to the phenomena of cohesion: this accordingly is one essential characteristic of the theory.\n\nFrom these few remarks we may deduce the principles of the theory.\n\nThe first elements or atoms of matter are indivisible, inextended, but simple, homogeneous, and finite in number. They are dispersed in an immense space, in such a manner as that any two or more may be distant from each other any assignable interval. This interval may be indefinitely augmented or diminished, but cannot entirely vanish. Actual contact of the atoms is therefore impossible, seeing that the repulsive power which prevents the entire vanishing of the interval, must be sufficient to destroy the greatest velocities by which the atoms tend to unite. The repulsive power must encircle every atom, must be equal at equal distances from the atoms, and moreover, must increase as the distance from the atoms diminishes. On the contrary, if the distance from the atoms increases the repulsive power will diminish, and at last become equal to nothing, or vanish: then, and not till then, an attractive power commences, increases, diminishes, vanishes. But the theory does not stop here; for it supposes, that a repulsive power succeeds to the second or attractive, increases, diminishes, vanishes; and that there are several alternations of this kind, till at the last an attractive power prevails, and though diminishing sensibly, as the squares of the distances increase, extends to the most distant regions of our system.\n\nSuch a process as we have now mentioned may seem a geometrically complicated and confused; but the curve line which expresses it is so simple, that we are persuaded, our readers, though unacquainted with geometry, will comprehend it, and hence will be able to understand the theory itself.\n\nWe shall now proceed therefore to exhibit this curve, and to show in what manner it elucidates the principles of the theory.\n\nThe axis C'AC has an asymptote of a curve in the point A, viz. the indefinite right line AB; on each side of which are placed two equal and similar branches of a curve, viz. D'E'F'G', &c. and DEFGHKL MNOPQRSTV; the latter of these having the asymptotical arch ED, though indefinitely produced towards the right line AB, will never touch it; but it accedes to the axis C'AC, and touches it in some point E. From this point it recedes on the opposite side of the axis to some point F, bends again to the axis C'AC, and cuts it in the point G; from this it recedes in a similar manner, on the side of the axis from whence it originated, and arrives at the point H. From the point H it bends to the axis C'AC, and cuts it in the point I; and so on in alternate fits of accession and recession till it has completed the remaining arches IKL,LMN,NOP,PQR,RST; after which it becomes asymptotical, forming the arch TpV, which approaches the axis C'AC on the side opposite that from which it originated, in such a manner as that the distances from the axis shall be in the reciprocal duplicate ratios of the distances from the asymptote BA.\n\nNow, if we raise and let fall perpendiculars on the axis C'AC in the points a, b, d, &c., the segments of the axis so formed, viz. Aa, Ab, Ad, &c., are abscissas, and will represent the distances between any two atoms or points of matter; and the perpendiculars so constructed, viz. ag, br, db, are ordinates, and will represent the intensity of the repulsive or attractive powers, according to their situation with respect to the axis C'AC; for, if on the same side with the asymptote AB as ag, br, they represent the former; and if on the side opposite to the asymptote, as db, the latter power.\n\nFrom what we have said, it is manifest, that the ordinate ag may be increased beyond any assignable limit, provided the corresponding abscissa Aa be diminished beyond any assignable limit; seeing that the limb of the curve ED is asymptotical which terminates the ordinate ag, and consequently never touches the right line AB; but that, if the abscissa be increased as to Ab, then the ordinate will be diminished to br; and that by perpetually increasing the abscissa to the point E, the ordinate will be perpetually diminished till at the point E it will totally vanish.\n\nMoreover, if we shall increase the abscissa to Ad, we shall find that on the opposite side of the axis C'AC, there will appear the ordinate db, which, by continuing the\nBofcovich's the same increase of the abscissa will increase to the point F, and then will diminish perpetually, as it approaches to the point G, where it will totally vanish.\n\nIf the abscissa be still increased, an ordinate arises on the opposite side, increases to H, diminishes to I, and vanishes, appears again, increasing to K, diminishing to L, vanishing; and so on through all the remaining points and situations of the curve, till at length coming to \\( p \\) o and \\( s \\) v, it continues to diminish perpetually, but never again totally vanishes.\n\nSuch then is the nature of the curve, and such, it must be admitted, will comply with the description of the repulsive and attractive powers, and the manner in which they alternate, to essential to the theory. The first power or that next the atoms is repulsive, and is greatest at the least distances from them; by increasing the distances it diminishes, vanishes; is succeeded by attraction, which increases, diminishes, vanishes; is in like manner succeeded by repulsion; and those two powers alternate repeatedly; when the attraction succeeding, constitutes the general gravity of Sir Isaac Newton, and reaches to the planets, and the far distant comets of the system of the sun.\n\nIt is obvious, that the transitions which we have described must occur in the infensible distances, being all comprehended between the atoms and the exterior attractive power; but it is also obvious that this law of the forces differs much from the Newtonian gravity, as the curve which expresses the latter is a hyperbola of the third order, lying all on one side of its axis which it never cuts; consequently it does not admit of any transitions, as we have before hinted at. It is of consequence to remember this distinction, for we shall find that on it depends much of our reasoning in the application of the theory to physics.\n\nSome further explanation of the curve remains to be given in the second part: in the meantime we proceed to take notice of certain geometrical properties essential to it, answering the conditions of the principles of the theory.\n\nBofcovich, in an after part of the work, demonstrates strictly that the curve is possessed of these properties; but we do not think it necessary to detail his demonstration, as it is only accessible to those who are versed in the high geometry, and as we imagine that a bare statement of the conditions required will satisfy the generality of our readers.\n\nThe conditions necessary in the curve are six in number. First, That it be regular, simple, and not an aggregate of arches of different curves. Secondly, That it shall cut the axis C'AC in certain given points only, and at the two distances AE', AE; AC', AG, &c., which are equal on both sides of the asymptote, the right line AB. Thirdly, That there shall be ordinates to correspond to every abscissa. Fourthly, That there shall be equal ordinates at equal abscissas on each side of AB. Fifthly, That the right line AB be an asymptote to the curves on each side of it; the area BAED asymptotical and therefore indefinite. Sixthly, That the arches which are terminated by any two intersections may be varied in any manner, recede from the axis C'AC to any distance, and accede to whatever arches of whatever curves, cutting, touching, or oscillating them whereforever and howsoever we please.\n\nIf these conditions be answered, it must be evident Bofcovich's that by this curve we can express any intensity of any force, in any direction we please; and of consequence, that by one law of the forces, every thing in the universe, connected in any manner with motion, may be explained.\n\nWe come now to consider the analytic deduction of the theory, in which we shall follow closely the steps of Bofcovich.\n\nBofcovich sets out, by examining the nature of the law of continuity, and the principles on which it is founded. In the year 1745 he published a dissertation De Viribus vivir, in which he was led to consider the phenomenon of the collision of bodies, and in consequence, the dilemma into which former philosophers had fallen by their mode of investigating it, and the breach of the law of continuity which some had allowed to extricate themselves from the dilemma.\n\nMaclaurin, of whom Bofcovich speaks in terms of the highest respect, \"Summus nostris axi geometra et philosophus,\" was the principal advocate for the breach of the law of continuity in the collision of bodies, and spoke with some indignation of those who asserted that this law was universal. He of course, believed in the production of motion by impulse, and in the immediate contact of bodies. Now, Bofcovich, as we have before mentioned, rejects both of these suppositions, and consequently explains the phenomenon in a very different manner from Maclaurin, and endeavours to prove that the law of continuity is universal, and that no instance of a breach of it is ever observable or possible.\n\nBefore proceeding to his reasoning on this subject, we shall explain what is meant by the law of continuity, and give one example of it, to which all others are referable.\n\nThe law of continuity (says Bofcovich) consists in this, that any quantity whilst passing from one magnitude to another, must pass through all the intermediate magnitudes of the same kind; or, according to the law of continuity, all changes in nature are produced by infensible and infinitely small degrees; so that no body can in any case pass from motion to rest, or from rest to motion, without passing through all possible intermediate degrees of motion. Maclaurin's Newton, b. i., c. 4.\n\nLet there be a right line AB (fig. 2.), to which another line CDE is related; let AB represent the time, and from any points of it, F, H let there be erected the perpendiculars FG, HI, which (ordinates) may represent any quantities continually variable, and will correspond to the moments of time F, H; but to the intermediate moments K, M, other magnitudes KL, MN, will correspond; and if from the point G, to the point I there goes a continued and finite part of the line CDE, it is evident that there is no intermediate point of the line AB, as K, to which some ordinate KL does not correspond; and conversely that there is no ordinate of magnitude intermediate betwixt FG, HI which does not correspond to some point intermediate betwixt F, H. Now the variable quantity expressed by this variable ordinate, changes according to the law of continuity; because from the magnitude FG, which it has in the moment of time F, to the magnitude HI, which it has in the moment of time H, it passes...\nBolcovich's passes through all the intermediate magnitudes KI, MN corresponding to the intermediate moments K, M, and to every moment a determinate magnitude corresponds.\n\nThis then may be sufficient to explain the nature of the law of continuity, about which we may remark there can be no ambiguity; for the terms which express it are precise, it is a matter of fact, and one example of it is enough to give us an adequate idea of it. We proceed, therefore, to consider on what its universality is founded; and here two questions naturally occur: Have we discovered the universality of this law by a laborious induction? or does it necessarily result from the nature of continuity? Bolcovich answers both of these questions in the affirmative.\n\n1. It is discovered by induction. Here we beg to transcribe the words of our author, as much more satisfactory than anything we can give: \"Quin immo in motibus ipsis continuitas servatur etiam in eo, quod motus omnes in lineis continuis fiant nufquam abrupti. Plurimos ejusmodi motus videmus. Planetae et cometae in lineis continuis cursum peragunt fium, et omnes retrogradationes fiant paulatim, ac in stationibus semper exiguas quidem motus, sed tamen habent semper, atque line etiam dies paulatim per auroram venit, per velpterimum crepuculum abit, solis diameter non per faltem, fed continuo motu supra horizonem ascendet, vel descendit. Gravia itidem obliqu\u00e8 projec ta in lineis itidem pariter continuis motus exercent fuos, minime in parabolis secula aeris resistentia, vel ea considerata, in orbibus ad hyperbolas potius accedentibus, et quidem semper cum aliqua exigua obliquitate proficisciuntur, cum infinitatis infinitam improbabilitatem habeat motus accuratae verticalis inter infinitates infinitas inclinationes, licet exiguas, et sub fenum non cadentes, fortuito obviens, qui quidem motus in hypothese telluris motae a parabolici plurimum ditan, et curvam continuum exhibent etiam pro casu projectionis accuratae verticalis, quo quiescente penitus tellure, et nulla ventorum vi deflestante motum, habetur ascensus rectilineus, vel deflexus. Immo omnes alii motus a gravitate pendentes, omnes ab elasticitate, a vi magnetica, continuitatem itidem servant, cum eam servent vires illae ipse, quibus gignuntur. Nam gravitas, cum decrescat in ratione reciproca duplicata distantiarum, et distanti\u00e6 per faltem mutari non possint, mutatur per omnes intermedias magnitudines. Vide mus pariter vim magneticae a distantiis pendere lege continua; vim elasticam ab inflexione, uti in laminis, vel a distanti\u00e6, ut in particularis \u00e6ris compressi. In his, et omnibus ejusmodi variis, sed motibus, quos gignunt, continuitas habetur semper, tam in lineis, quam delocribuntur, quam in velocitatisbus, qu\u00e6 pariter per omnes intermedias magnitudines mutantur, ut videre est in pendulis, in ascensiis corporum gravi\u00e6m, et in aliis mille ejusmodi, in quibus mutationes velocitatis fiant gradatim, nec retro cursus reflectitur, nisi immuta velocitate per omnes gradus. Ea diligentissime continuitatem servant omnia. Hinc nec ulli in natura libis motibus habentur anguli, sed semper mutatio directionis fit paulatim, nec vero anguli exacti habentur in corporibus ipsis, in quibus uterque videatur tenuis acies, vel cuspidis, microscopii saltem ope videri folet curvatura, quam etiam habent alvei fluviorum semper, habent arborum folia, et frondes, ac rami, habent la-\n\npides quicunque, nisi forte alicubi cuspides continuae Bolcovich's occurrant, vel primi generis, quas natura videtur affec tare in spinis, vel secundi generis, quas videtur affectare in avium ungibus, et rostro, in quibus tamen ma nente in ipsa cuspidi unica tangente continuitatem fer vari videbimus infra. Infinitum effect singula persequi, in quibus continuitas in natura observatur. Satis est generaliter provocare ad exhibendum caenum in natura, in quo continuitas non fervet, qui omnino exhiberi non poterit.\" (Theoria, p. 18.)\n\nFrom these and other examples, in which the law of continuity is manifestly held, Bolcovich infers, that it is universal; and that in so far as induction supports us, we are at liberty to apply it in the explanation of phenomena. Nay, we are by the same principle compelled to admit it in cases where observation fails us; because to imagine that in such cases this law is broken and some other is adopted, is to transgress one of the fundamental principles of true philosophy; it is to multiply causes unnecessarily; it is to limit the power of the Creator by the imperfection of our own senses; and it will plunge us into difficulties which no effort of human reason will remove. Besides this, it is very easy to conceive that the law is permanent; and as no absurdity, therefore, accompanies the supposition, and no fact can be brought to overthrow it, whereas the contrary is unsupported by any fact, but is plainly repugnant to all, it is surely rational to make use of it, and to hold it as the general principle, till some higher one be discovered on which it depends.\n\nFrom induction alone, therefore, we may infer the universality of the law; but Bolcovich has other arguments which he calls positive, to support and evince it. This leads us to the second question, Does this universality necessarily arise from the nature of continuity?\n\nThe limit which joins the precedent and consequent of anything, is common to both, and is therefore indivisible. Thus, a superficies separating two solids, wants thickness, and is that in which a transition from the one to the other occurs; a line dividing two parts of a continued superficies wants breadth; a point discriminating two segments of a continued line wants every dimension. So it is with regard to time, for the limit of two conjunct portions is common to both, and indivisible; and, as every change of a variable quantity from one magnitude to another must be made in time, so every change must be influenced by the continuity of time. But to every moment of time, a certain magnitude of the variable quantity corresponds, and the limit of two moments of time is common and indivisible; therefore, the limit of two magnitudes corresponding to these two moments, must be common and indivisible. Moreover, it is impossible for any quantity to have two magnitudes at the same time, and when continually varying, that it shall have the same magnitude at different times; much more impossible, therefore, that in the limit of two moments of time it shall have two magnitudes, the one corresponding to the precedent, and the other to the consequent moment, or shall not have gone through the intermediate magnitudes in the intermediate moments of time. For the same reason, a body cannot have two velocities at the same time, and therefore cannot have two velocities in the limit common to two moments of time; and when continually changing its velocity, cannot have the same\nBofcovich's same velocity in different moments of time, but must go through all the intermediate velocities in the intermediate moments of time. Hence then, in passing from the magnitude 8 to the magnitude 12, the variable quantity passes through the magnitudes 9, 10, 11. In going from the velocity 7 to the velocity 11, a body must go through the velocities 8, 9, 10. The increase of temperature goes on gradually; the mercury in the thermometer rises gradually, going through every intermediate degree from one to another. Now as this reasoning is uninfluenced by any considerations of the hardness, softness, elasticity or other property of bodies; these, it is evident, do not influence the universality of the law as resulting from the nature of continuity.\n\nFrom these arguments, therefore, and from induction, Bofcovich concludes, that the law of continuity is essentially universal, and that a breach of it is metaphysically impossible. The use made of this deduction in explaining the collision of bodies, must at once be understood by our philosophical readers. If in this and all other phenomena, the law of continuity is preserved, there can no actual contact take place amongst bodies; and it is from the universality of the law fo established that Bofcovich derives this original principle of his theory.\n\nTo apply this then in the collision of bodies, we argue in the following manner. Since the bodies cannot come into immediate contact with the preceding velocities, it is necessary that their respective velocities be changed before contact, that either the velocity of the antecedent body shall be augmented, or that the velocity of the consequent body shall be diminished, or that both of these changes shall occur. Now the cause operating betwixt the bodies, so as to retard the one, and to accelerate the other, must be a power, and must act from the bodies, and must also be sufficient to overcome the greatest velocities with which the bodies tend to unite, and be mutual, because action and reaction are equal. In fine, this is the interior repulsive power according to the definition. This mode of explaining the phenomenon, we may observe, is general, seeing that no hardness, softness, or elasticity of the bodies, has any influence on the general principle from which it is deduced; but these properties will influence the particular cases of the phenomenon, and cause certain modifications, which, however, do not concern us at present.\n\nIn this manner we derive evidence for the existence of the interior repulsive power; but for this we have also the light of induction to assist us, as we shall prove in the conclusion of our article.\n\nAs the repulsive power may be increased to infinity, by diminishing to infinity the distances betwixt the atoms of matter, it is obvious, that no part of matter can be contiguous to another part; from which it follows, that the primary elements of matter are simple and uncompounded. From similar arguments, and from others deduced from the absurdities involved in the contrary supposition, Bofcovich maintains, that they are also inextensible and indivisible.\n\nThe existence of an attractive power is allowed on all hands; we need not therefore enumerate Bofcovich's arguments on the subject. For proofs of the transitions from one power to another, we are referred Bofcovich's to the phenomena of effervescence, fermentation, co-System of Natural Philosophy.\nBofcovich's exposition nature considerationis derivata non ad differ-\nmitatem, sed ad conformitatem elementorum nos du-\ncit.\" (Theoria, p. 49.)\n\nIt is from these simple principles which we have enumerated that Bofcovich deduces analytically the whole of his system; and he now proceeds to remove or explain away the objections made to it.\n\nIt has been objected in the first place to the mutual powers, that they are occult qualities, and that they induce action at a distance. But in reply, so far from being occult they are very manifest, an idea of them can easily be formed, their existence is evinced by a positive argument, and their effects are continually before our eyes; we may add also, that the same objection was made to the Newtonian attraction, and that the same arguments serve to remove it from both. As to the mutual powers inducing action at a distance, much indeed may be said, but it is very questionable if all that can be said will ever clear up the obscurity that perpetually involves this inextricable phenomenon.\n\nWe reserve some remarks on the commonly received notions on the subject, for our conclusion; in the meantime, we may affirm, that it is easy to conceive motion produced by the powers we have spoken of, i.e., at a distance, as produced by immediate impulse. We know, indeed, that till of late, philosophers were accustomed to consider the connexion between impulse and motion so essential, and their notions on the subject so clear and fundamental, that whenever they could reduce any phenomenon to that predicament, they flattered themselves every difficulty vanished, and consequently further investigation was superfluous. But we also know, that till of late, water was held to be a simple body, and that when it could be thrown to arise in any chemical experiment, it was customary in chemists to believe it had previously existed in the subjects of their experiment. Do we coincide in this belief in the present day?\n\nIt has been objected, that the theory itself admits a sudden transition from one power to another; but a due inspection of the curve, and the explanation of it which we have given, will convince that this is impossible, for that every change is made by passing through every intermediate degree.\n\nThe principal objections, as might have been expected, have been made to the rejection of contact, to the inextension of the atoms, and to their indivisibility. But it is allowed, that bodies approach so near to each other, as to leave no sensible distance between them; and that the repulsion which we experience is made by the repulsive power which gives us the same sensation as actual contact. We can form no idea, it is true, of an inextended indivisible atom of matter, because all our ideas of matter are associated with extension and parts; and so difficult is it to break the association, we imagine these are essential to it. Bofcovich directs us to consider the nature of a mathematical point, in which there is involved no notion of extension or parts, and that from this we can form an idea of an inextended atom. The notion of an inextended and simple atom is not peculiar to the theory of Bofcovich. Zeno and his followers among the ancients, and the modern Leibnitzians adopted it. But Bofcovich, by denying actual contact and continued extension, gets rid of the absurdities which resulted from their opinions.\n\nSome have asserted that the atoms of this theory do not differ from spirits, because they have not extension, which is the characteristic of matter. Does then extension constitute matter, and the want of it spirit? We apprehend not. The discrimination of matter and spirit consists in these two circumstances: the former is perceptible by our senses, and is incapable of thought and volition; whereas, the latter does not affect our senses, but can both think and will. But the perceptibility of matter arises from its impenetrability, not from continued extension. Besides this, the atoms have repulsive and attractive powers, though they do not therefore resemble spirit. For were we to admit the existence of a kind of being possessed of these active powers, conjoined with inertia, and having at the same time cogitation and volition; it would neither be matter nor spirit, but a tertium quid, distinguished from the former by cogitation and volition, and from the latter by inertia, and by powers which induce impenetrability.\n\nBofcovich treats the other metaphysical objections to his theory in a similar manner; but we think it very unnecessary to dwell longer on them, and shall therefore proceed to the second part of our subject.\n\nII. We are obliged to conciliate in our account of the application of the theory to mechanics, because although very valuable in itself, it can hardly be abridged, and would prove interesting to those only who are versed in mechanical science. There remain, however, some further circumstances of the curve to be considered, which are essential to the fully understanding the theory itself, and the manner in which it is to be applied either to mechanics or to physics. We propose to deliver them in this place in conformity with our author's plan, though they are equally suitable to any of the three parts.\n\nThe circumstances we mean are of three kinds. First, The arches of the curve. Secondly, The areas comprehended betwixt the axis, and the arches which the ordinates generate by continually flowing. Thirdly, The points in which the curve cuts the axis.\n\n1. The arches are either repulsive or attractive, according as they are situated on the same side of the axis with the asymptotic limb ED, or on the side opposite, and terminate the ordinates exhibiting the repulsive or the attractive powers. The arches may bend towards the axis, and turn again from it without touching or cutting it, as in the arch P ef; this bending may be repeated, and may occur on either side of the axis, and it may admit of many varieties in figure and size, so as to express every possible action and mode of action.\n\n2. The areas may be of any magnitude however great or small, or they may be infinite, according as the arches depart more or less from the axis, or become asymptotical with respect to it. The abscissae represent the distances betwixt the atoms, and the ordinates the present force by which they are acting: the areas which the ordinates run through, express the increment or the decrement of the squares of the velocities which are generated. From these principles it is easy to see in what manner the doctrine of dynamics may be applied in the theory. And from this very circumstance it is clear that this theory does not interfere with principles in mechanics which are deduced from reasoning abstractedly.\nBosovich's strictly on space, velocity, and time, and in which the nature and properties of matter have no place. This remark is momentous, because it serves us in forming an adequate opinion of the merits of the theory, and it completely overthrows the skepticism concerning mechanical knowledge into which some have been led by imperfectly understanding the object and the principles of Bosovich. We beg to impress this on the minds of our readers, and to assure them, that though the theory of Bosovich be most satisfactorily established, there will not one fundamental principle in the science of mechanics be overturned. This will no doubt mortify the ignorant skeptic, but it will animate the true student to greater exertions, and it may open to him a field in which glory and fame remain yet to be reaped. To return, the asymptotic area included between any asymptote and ordinate may be either infinite, or finite of any magnitude however great or small; or more generally, the area is infinite if the ordinate increases in the simple reciprocal ratio; but if the ratio be less in any degree, the area is finite.\n\n3. The points in which the curve cuts the axis are of two kinds, one where the transition is from repulsion to attraction, the other where it is from attraction to repulsion. Now these are called limits, and though they have something in common with each other, yet do they essentially differ. They have this in common, that if two atoms be placed at the distance of any limits from each other, no mutual power is exerted by them; consequently if they are respectively at rest, they continue so. But if they be moved from their respective rest, then an essential difference is observable between these two kinds of limits. In the limit of the first kind, viz., where the transition is from repulsion to attraction, the atoms resist further separation, and endeavour to regain their former distance by the attractive power then operating; and they resist nearer approach than the limit, and endeavour to regain their former distance, by the repulsive power then operating. This therefore is called a limit of cohesion, feeling that if an atom be any way removed from it, it endeavours to regain it.\n\nBut in the limit of the second kind, if the distance between the atoms be in the least increased, then will these atoms tend from each other more and more, by the repulsive power then operating; and if the distance between them be in the least diminished, then they will tend to each other more and more, by the attractive power then operating. This therefore is called a limit of non-cohesion, feeling that if an atom be any way removed from it, it departs more and more from it. Now the limits of cohesion may be very strong or very weak; for if the curve cuts the axis perpendicularly, it is evident that the ordinates on each side of the limit are the greatest, and therefore the forces which they express the greatest. On the other hand, if the curve cuts the axis in a very small angle, it is also evident that the ordinates on each side of the limit are very small, and therefore the forces which they express very small; and these in any proportion. Of the limits of non-cohesion we may observe that, in a similar manner, according to the angle formed by the curve in cutting the axis at the points representing them, the atoms will recede from, or accede to each other with greater or smaller velocity, when their respective distance is changed.\n\nThe remarks which we have now made, together with the former explanation of the curve, are sufficient to acquaint our readers with the general principles of the theory, and will serve to exhibit the manner in which it may be applied to mechanics and to physics. Of the former, we have already mentioned, it is difficult to give even an abridgment; we propose then to employ the remainder of this part in enumerating the particular subjects in mechanics to which our author has applied his theory, and in giving our opinion of the degree of success with which his application is attended.\n\nHe commences by showing in what manner masses Combinations of matter may be formed by the atoms, supposing them, first of the combination of two atoms, then of three, and so to the most complicated bodies. He proves that the masses so formed will be possessed of different properties, in consequence of the disposition of the powers which in certain cases will always attract, in others always repel, and in others again will do neither, i.e., will be neutral. From these differences will necessarily result peculiarities in the mode of the action of different masses, and these so endless and diversified, as to include every possible phenomenon in nature. It is easy to conceive that the varieties in figure will readily result from the position of the atoms, and the influence of the powers in respect to each other. Thus a pyramid may be formed of four atoms, and a cube of eight; these smaller or primary masses may be combined to form secondary, and so on to any order. Regular and forming different irregular bodies will thence be formed; and yet it may be shown that the most irregular and complicated may be reduced to the primary or original forms, from whence they were constructed. The crystallization of salts, for example, may in this manner be accounted for, and the reduction of them into the primitive forms be explained on the principles of the theory. These phenomena imply composition and equilibrium of forces, which strictly belong to mechanics; our author therefore proceeds to consider these and other subjects connected with them: as the centre of gravity; the equality of action and reaction; the collision of bodies; the centre of equilibrium; the centre of oscillation; the centre of percussion. In all of these we may observe causing the law of the forces is strictly applicable; that by it mechanical some very difficult problems are solved, and some in-phenomena tricate phenomena explained, with an accuracy and precision highly creditable to Bosovich, and strongly presumptive of the value of his theory. The formul\u00e6 which his investigations afford are certainly curious and interesting to the speculative, and may be useful to the practical mechanic. He adds a few remarks on the pressure and velocity of fluids, which are equally clear, and in our opinion satisfactory.\n\nIII. We have already anticipated some of the principles which more properly belong to this part, in which to physics, we consider his application of the theory to physics. This necessarily comprehends all the general properties of matter, some of which have already engaged our attention when treating of the analytic deduction and vindication of the theory, but still require some particular observations.\n\nThe impenetrability of the atoms is a necessary consequence of the interior repulsive power increasing as ability.\nBofcovich's theory of natural philosophy.\n\nThe distance diminishes; but it also arises from the extension of the atoms, and their indivisibility: because as space is infinitely divisible, it is infinitely improbable that any two atoms should ever meet in the same part of it, though no repulsive power existed, seeing that they may move in an infinite number of the parts of space which are unoccupied. So that, independent of any repulsive power, it is infinitely improbable that any copenetration should occur.\n\nPhysical extension necessarily arises from the impenetrability of the atoms; because by it, no two atoms can occupy the same part of space, and are therefore kept without each other; but it is not mathematical or continued extension, seeing that some space must intervene between all the atoms. Our senses, it is true, cannot perceive this space on account of its smallness; nor more can they perceive the distances between the particles of water or other fluid, and yet from certain phenomena it is demonstrable that such distances exist.\n\nFrom extension arises figurability, seeing that by the combination of the atoms certain forms must be produced: it can be easily shown that, on account of the various limits of cohesion, there may be very different quantities of matter under the same figure; and this involves the consideration of density. The mass of a body is the whole quantity of matter pertaining to it, or the number of atoms which compose it. But it may be remarked that our idea of the mass is very vague, arbitrary, and confused, owing to the apparent heterogeneity of bodies.\n\nThe inertia of bodies is the consequence of the inertia of the atoms and of the mutual powers; and by it we understand the determination to persevere in the same state of rest or uniform motion in a right line, unless forced by something external to change from it.\n\nMobility, one of the general properties of bodies, being essential to the atoms, is so to the masses formed of them. It is a consequence of the mutual powers of the theory. Now all the motion we observe is merely relative, either in respect of the earth, the planetary system, or the system of the fixed stars. From this perhaps we may derive an argument for the universality of the law of continuity in the case of motion, seeing that the instances where the law appears to be broken, must be explained by the combined influence of moving powers which act continually and gradually; and that there is not one example of absolute rest in the universe.\n\nThough continued extension and divisibility be denied to the atoms, it is allowed that they may be infinitely compounded; and hence composition is contrasted with divisibility in the theory.\n\nGeneral gravity, according to the Newtonian principles, is allowed in this theory, as we have before mentioned; and we may now remark, that the objection urged against it, as tending to produce an aggregate of all the matter in the universe, by drawing the planets, comets, and fixed stars, into one portion of space, may be obviated by supposing that a repulsive power succeeds the attractive after it has reached to the comets of our system; or that as by the curve, the line $T \\rho s V$ ceases to be asymptotic, and cuts the axis so as to exhibit an arch of repulsion on the opposite side.\n\nOf all the general properties of matter, that of cohesion is most simply and beautifully explained by this Bofcovich's theory; but as we have already spoken of its limits and their varieties, we need not now enlarge on it. We have to consider certain other properties of bodies, which from not being general have been called secondary. Of these the principal are solidity and fluidity.\n\nSolidity.\u2014Bofcovich imagines that the particles of fluid bodies are spherical, and that their forces are fluidity, more directed to their centres than to their surfaces: by which motion is allowed freely when any force is applied to them from without; and that when at rest all the particles are in equilibrium in respect of each other, but that the pressure of incumbent bodies, and containing vessels, always causes some deviation from it. He says there are three kinds of fluids: one in which the particles or molecules have no mutual power; one in which they have repulsive power, and the other in which they have an attractive power. Of the first we have examples in sand and fine powders; of the second are the elastic fluids, as air; and of the third, all liquors, as water, mercury, &c. Now these three kinds are produced by the original differences in the primary particles which compose them; and we are able on the principles of the theory to specify the causes of the diversity in the phenomena which they exhibit.\n\nSolidity is the consequence of the irregular figure of the particles and their great deviation from sphericity, by which free motion among them is prevented, and their cohesion better secured. Now the diversity in solids arises from the various degrees of strength in the limits of cohesion; and the same principles will give rise to a class of bodies intermediate between solids and fluids, viz. the viscous, whose particles attract each other more strongly than the fluids, and not so strongly as the solids.\n\nIf we imagine the particles to be so formed as to attract on some sides, and to repel on others, and to attract certain particles similarly constructed, and to repel others, we may conceive in what manner the regular bodies denominated organized are compounded; and for these the varieties admitted in the limits of cohesion, situation, and combination of atoms, will abundantly suffice. Humidity is only relative, seeing that water, e.g., adheres to our fingers, and may be easily spread out on glass, wood, &c., whereas it does not affect oleaginous and refrinous bodies: now this is in consequence of the partial arrangement of the powers in different bodies, and the varieties in the combination, &c. of the particles.\n\nOf the chemical operations Bofcovich remarks in general, that they may be all traced to the same principle, the law of the forces, and the differences in the particles which thence arise; and that were they subjected to the observation of our senses, a general reason for them would be discovered; but for this there are required an intimate knowledge of the texture of all the particles, and a power of geometry and analysis which far exceeds the human mind. He explains some of them in the following manner: And first of solution. The particles of some solids have a less attraction for each other than for the particles of some fluids, and consequently when these are applied to each other, the particles of the former will separate and combine with those of the latter, so as to form a mixture in which the two bodies are suspended in combination.\nBut the separation of the particles of the solid can only take place so long as the particles of the fluid are in the sphere of their attraction; and when either of them get beyond it, or when the attraction of the mixture so formed, becomes equivalent to the attraction of the particles of the solid for each other, then no more solution will take place, and the menstruum is said to be saturated. But if into this mixture another solid, whose particles have a greater attraction for the menstruum than those of the former, be thrown, then the menstruum will leave the former solid, or its particles, and adhere or combine with the latter; in which case the former solid in the form of powder will fall to the bottom, or what is called precipitation will occur. In short, he gives pretty nearly the common explanation of the phenomena; and on similar principles he accounts for the mixture of fluids. Now if the particles of two fluids which are mixed together, come into the limits of cohesion, a solid will be thereby generated, of which we have some examples. On the other hand, two solids triturated together may compose a fluid, in consequence of the particles of each departing from the limits of cohesion.\n\nIf we consider that the first limb of the curve exhibits impenetrability, the last gravity, and the intersections the various kinds of cohesion, we may form some notion of the manner in which fermentation, evaporation, deflagration, &c., are caused; for whilst atoms accede to each other with any velocity, they increase the velocity in every attractive arch, but they diminish it in every repulsive arch; whereas on the contrary, whilst they recede from each other, they increase it in every repulsive arch, and diminish it in every attractive arch, until in the former case they arrive at a repulsive arch, or in the latter an attractive one, which is sufficiently strong to extinguish the whole velocity. When they do so, they are reflected in the same course, and oscillate backwards and forwards. Besides this, if bodies composed of particles which have different properties, in consequence of the different situation and combination of the powers, be mixed together, an agitation among them must necessarily arise in order to attain an equilibrium; hence oscillations, perturbations of various kinds, will follow, and cause the great diversity of phenomena which are observed. Now all these take place within the sphere of general gravity, which does not immediately influence the operations. Substances which are dissolved may not only be obtained again by precipitation, but also by evaporation of the menstruum in which they are dissolved. In this latter case the bodies generally assume some regular forms, denominated crystals. Now this arises from the particles coming gradually into the sphere of the attractive power of each other, and consequently attaining to some limit of cohesion by the menstruum, which formerly kept them asunder, being gradually removed; whereas in the former case, where we obtain them by precipitation, the menstruum is suddenly removed from betwixt the particles, which are consequently left beyond the sphere of attraction of each other, and do not therefore assume any regular form. It will follow from this, that the more slowly evaporation is performed, the more regular will be the crystals which are deposited; and this is verified by observation.\n\nWe profess not to understand Bofcovich's notion of the nature of fire; but lest our readers may require it, we beg to transcribe his own words: \"Ignem ego arbitratus esse quoddam fermentationis genus, quo acquirat vel potiflum, vel etiam sola sulphurea sublimia, cum qua fermentat materia lucis vehementissime.\" Fire, in fatis magna copia collecta fit. Ignem autem voco eum, qui non tantum rarefacit motu luo, sed et cadeficit, et lucet; quae omnia habentur, quando materia illa sulphurea fatis fermentecit.\" And he observes in another place, that if fire be excited only by a fermentation of sulphureous substance, where there is none of this substance there is no danger of fire!\n\nBofcovich retains the Newtonian opinion concerning Light, viz. that it is an effluvium or emission from the sun, propagated with immense celerity, and retained in certain bodies, from which it may be extricated by certain means. He holds the atoms of light to be immense, but still finite in number, and endeavours on the principles of his theory to account for the wonderful properties with which light is endowed. In doing so, he makes extensive use of the repulsive power, the varieties in the limits of cohesion, and we may add, with much plausibility and success. Sir Isaac Newton, in explaining the reflexion of light, found it necessary to admit the existence of a repulsive power, for which, however, he had made no provision in his system. The late experiments in optics by Mr Brougham serve to confirm the supposition of the existence of a repulsive power in regard of light at least. Bofcovich refers his reader to his dissertation De Lumine for more information concerning the reflexion, refraction, &c., of light and colours, and for the application of the principles of his theory to them.\n\nHe proceeds to explain many of our sensations; sensations, but we must confess there is very little praiseworthy in his remarks concerning them: indeed we can see no reason why they should be introduced at all into a system of natural philosophy, erected on such or any other foundation which concerns the external world only. In the small example of the ardour of systematic arrangement and application of physical principles to the intellectual world, which Bofcovich has given us, we observe a striking coincidence with the doctrine of Hartley; but our opinion of that doctrine is not in the least meliorated by such coincidence. It is a doctrine which affects to teach more than it is given to man to know; a doctrine by which we are induced to depart from the humble but secure path of observation, and to wander in the boundless incomprehensible field of transcendentals, and which, however harmless its consequences may be, as it augments the vanity of man, prevents the employment of his faculties in the inquiry into familiar truths.\n\nBofcovich adopts Franklin's hypothesis of electricity, which he defends on the principles of his theory; and magnetism, but we must refer our readers to the work itself, for his reasoning on electricity and magnetism. We would only remark, that as our knowledge of these curious phenomena is much augmented even since the time of Bofcovich, his theory was applied to them with disadvantage; but perhaps these very phenomena afford the best proofs of the truth of some of its principles.\n\nWe have now followed Bofcovich through the consideration of his theory, and we flatter ourselves that, remarks.\nBofcovich's in so doing, we have given such an exhibition of its peculiar principles as will at least excite the curiosity of our readers, though it may not gratify it; and indeed, little more could be expected from us in detailing a system of such magnitude, and affecting to comprehend so much. We have however engaged ourselves to give such observations and remarks as may have been suggested to us in the course of the work. In conformity with this, we beg the retropection of our readers to those circumstances in the theory which are most peculiar to it, and which serve to fix on it the characteristic feature of originality. Of these the rejection of contact, as it is the most conspicuous, so it requires the most particular attention, as on it rests the greatest part of the reasoning and fabric of the system.\n\nWe have seen that Bofcovich supports this principle on the universality of the law of continuity, and on the existence of the interior repulsive power. Of the former we have to observe, that the mode of proving it by induction is strictly philosophical, just, and convincing; but that the metaphysical or positive arguments used for the same purpose are by no means so. We do not mean to assert that these arguments have no weight, but only that they are not so far removed from a considerable source of error and misconception, as to prevent all suspicion of their accuracy, and to entitle them to an unqualified application to the subject we consider. It is true indeed, that no appeal to observation can directly determine the question, and therefore, it may be said, we must have recourse to some other authority. But, to us at least, it seems as true, that the proof by induction is the only satisfactory one we can have; and that if we are careful to keep in view that precept of philosophy which teaches us not to multiply causes unnecessarily, and to reason from analogy on the simplicity and steady uniformity of nature, there will be no occasion to have recourse to other authority.\n\nWe are disposed to believe, that the metaphysical arguments which Bofcovich employs may be retorted on the theory itself. Does not the theory seem to admit a breach in the law of continuity, when it denies the continued extension of bodies? Or, as it rejects the divisibility and extension of atoms, must we not imagine and believe, on the faith of the law of continuity, that these atoms are mere nuclei of repulsive powers? Or shall we admit that the law of continuity depends on some higher principle not yet discovered, a principle in which extension or duration are concerned; that where there is neither extension nor duration, the law does not hold; that consequently, in the case of the atoms and their mode of union, this law suffers a breach; i.e., that the metaphysical arguments do not prove its universality, or that a breach of it is impossible? Such are the mysteries into which we are enveloped, when we wander from that path which is assigned to human reason.\n\nAs to the existence of the interior repulsive power, it may be observed, that if it be proved or evinced to us, the impossibility of contact must be admitted. Now we are of opinion that a power of repulsion does exist in the nearest vicinity of many bodies; but we pretend not to know the law by which it operates, or even that it increases to infinity on the diminution of the distance. We are satisfied that it occasions many very curious phenomena, some of which have been explained by it; and we sincerely believe that the investigation of its system of laws and the extent of its influence will fabricate a crown of natural philosophy, as unfading as that of Newton. But we are convinced that were the theory of Bofcovich concerning it tacitly confirmed in, such a crown could never be obtained. Nay we insist further, that though by reasoning it could be determined that such a power does exist, it would be useless to us, till the most laborious induction be practised to discover how far it influences observable phenomena, and how far it may be subjected to human artifice and ingenuity.\n\nThe phenomena which give evidence of the existence of a power of repulsion are chiefly optical; but it belongs not to this article to explain them. We may however just mention that we allude to the experiments of the object-glasses of long telescopes, the brilliancy of dew drops while supported on leaves or rolling on the surface of water, in which it is demonstrable that a certain space intervenes betwixt bodies which are apparently in contact, and that this space can be caused by repulsive power alone. Sir Isaac Newton himself virtually admitted the existence of such a power, as appears from the last question of his optics; indeed it is very certain that the attractive power alone will not produce many of the phenomena of which he speaks.\n\nConcerning the other principles of the theory we have little to remark, seeing that most of them result from those we have now considered. The transitions of the powers are in our opinion to be ascertained only by observation, and this it must be confessed is no easy matter: the phenomena of fermentation, effervescence, &c., to which we are referred for proofs of the existence of these transitions, seem to be easily explained on such a supposition; but it is nevertheless probable that the supposition was prior to the observation of the laws by which these phenomena are regulated. It may be worth while remarking, that if we are able to conceive these transitions as existing, we can also conceive how motion may be produced at a distance, which was held up as an absurdity in the schools. It must be very evident to our readers that the theory of Bofcovich supposes this production of motion, and that any other mode is impossible, seeing that contact is so. But we are not therefore to believe that the repulsive or attractive powers are efficient causes; though they certainly are physical ones, i.e., they are higher principles than the phenomena which succeed them, and may for ought we know depend on some one more general principle which this theory does not comprehend. We do not therefore foresee any dangerous consequences of the supposition of matter acting on matter at a distance; nor can we believe that these two expressions are equivalent or consecutive, viz., if matter act where it is not, it may act when it is not. The one is a reference to space, the other to time, and betwixt these we know no mean of comparison.\n\nWe see then that the theory of Bofcovich is intimately connected with the most abstruse metaphysical inquiries and disputations that can employ the mind of man; in particular, that which attempts to discover the mode in which our perception of the material world is carried on. For such, we confess, we have not talents of investigation, and indeed we are convinced that no investigation has yet been, or ever will be, successful;\nBocovich's ful; but we are also convinced, that if the theory of System of Natural Philosophy will be overturned: as such we prefer it to any that has hitherto been offered to the world. But it is to be considered as valid, in so far only as induction satisfies us of its principles; that it can be satisfactorily applied to the solution of many phenomena where other theories fail us; that it does not in anywise inform us of the nature, or supersede inquiry into the laws of matter. We are of opinion that it was his very intimate knowledge of these laws, and his diligent inquiry into matters of fact, that led Bocovich to the discovery of the law of continuity and of the forces, and made him see the propriety of erecting some new system in which these might bear a part. The merit of Bocovich consists not in having discovered the cause of motion, or on what it depends. He attempted a more humble strain: he investigated familiar operations, and acquainted himself with vulgar things. No mysterious analogy indeed conducted him either to the harmony or to the beauty of the spheres; but then, no stupendous vacuum intercepted his path, and no unruly vortices whirled him from rectitude. That he stopped not where prudence might have directed, and beyond which his guide could go no farther, was the failing of genius elevated by success, the lot of the resplendent few who are dazzled by their own lustre. But it would ill become his followers to attempt continuing to the end on that path which he pointed out; moderate minds should accompany him as their friend, only so long as they perceive he is directed by a friend which is greater than him: let them remember that it is his observations alone which are valuable, the simple arrangement of them which they should esteem; it is the plain narrative of the honest traveller which will assist them, not the pompous fabric of the self-deceived novelist.\n\nThe only theory with which we can properly compare this of Bocovich, is the Newtonian, and in so doing its superiority will appear; but for very obvious reasons we enter not minutely into the comparison, and will only add that in the Newtonian, we must have recourse to the three principles of gravity, Bocovich's cohesion, and fermentation, for the explanation of phenomena; and even these are insufficient in the modern chemistry: but we learn from the former that these are only portions of a more general principle, that they result from one fundamental law, and that to this law may be referred as well the formation of a dew drop, as the rolling of the spheres (a).\n\nSome of the admirers of Bocovich may be surprised that we affirm, his theory gives no information of any one efficient cause in nature, and that all the discovery he has made is, that of some events which precede the Newtonian gravity. We have already borne ample testimony to the merits of Bocovich, and we think we are secure from any suspicion that we endeavour to depreciate the value of his theory; such indeed is far from our thoughts, but we must say it is farther from our thoughts to consider it as the ultimatum in natural philosophy, or that it discloses to us the most supreme process in nature. We will venture farther; for we will maintain, that though all the principles of the theory were established on a firm and invulnerable foundation, as they are not, it would be impossible for anyone to determine what shall be the consequences resulting from them, prior to experience of the regularity and the constancy of the conjunction of events; and that of consequence the same, nay greater, labour of induction and observation is required in the phenomena of the material world; greater, because the objects are increased in number by the discovery which Bocovich has made. But this assertion concerns the laws of nature alone, not the laws of human thought, of which, in our opinion, Bocovich has made too free use. He tells us that one consequence of the interior repulsive power is, the impossibility of contact, and that another is the impenetrability of the atoms. Now it requires no great exertion of understanding to perceive that he is displaying a law of human thought, for these consequences of which he speaks are parts of the same conception, and that no reasoning a priori is employed to determine their connexion; for we cannot possibly imagine, that contact or penetrability of the atoms should\n\n(a) It may be a satisfaction to our readers to know that Sir Isaac Newton entertained notions very similar to those of Bocovich concerning the causes of motion at the insensible distances, though it is to be regretted that he had made no provision for them in his system. The last question in his optics plainly indicates that he himself was convinced that no law by which an attractive force might be supposed to act would be sufficient for the explanation of certain phenomena which take place in the immediate vicinity of the atoms of matter. \"And if all these things are so, then all nature will be very simple, and consistent with itself, effecting all the great motions of the heavenly bodies by the attraction of gravity, which is mutual between all those bodies, and almost all the less motions of its particles by another certain attractive and repulsive force, which is mutual between those particles. Now it seems that these elementary particles not only have in themselves the vis inertiae, and those passive laws of motion which necessarily arise from that force, but that they likewise perpetually receive a motion from certain active principles; such as gravity, and the cause of fermentation, and of the cohesion of bodies. And I consider these principles, not as occult qualities, which are feigned to flow from the specific forms of things, but as universal laws of nature, by which the things themselves were formed. For that truly such principles exist, the phenomena of nature show, although what may be their causes has not as yet been explained. To affirm that every species of things is ended with specific occult qualities, by which they have a certain power, is indeed to say nothing; but to deduce two or three general principles of motion from the phenomena of nature, and then to explain how the properties and action of all corporeal things follow from those principles, this truly would be to have made a great advancement in philosophy, although the causes of those principles were not as yet known. Wherefore I do not hesitate to maintain the above said principles of motion, seeing they extend widely through all nature.\" Newton's Optics.\nshould occur, if such a repulsive power exists, or that\nthe impolibility of the former, and impenetrability,\nshould be caused by any thing else than such a power.\n\nThe most ignorant of the sons of men are as well qua-\nlified to understand this as the greatest philosophers\nwho have adorned humanity; and if it be entitled to\nthe name of discovery, it is one in which all mankind\nhave shared; but for having expressed it in words, and\nincorporated it with others which some kindred genius\nalone could have made, all are indebted to Bofcovich,\nand must acknowledge that in his hands it has served\nto fabricate a lasting monument of genius, industry,\nand sagacity. We are not therefore to consider that\nthese are instances wherein any consequences have been\ndetermined a priori; and they do not affect our atten-\ntion, that prior to experience of the regularity and the\ncontingency of the conjunction of events, it would be im-\npossible for any one to determine a priori what shall be\nthe consequences resulting from the principles of the\ntheory. To illustrate our meaning in the assertion, we\nshall suppose that the transitions of the powers have\nbeen discovered to exist in the constitution of matter;\nand we then ask, if, prior to the knowledge of the phe-\nnomena of fermentation, &c., it could have been de-\ntermined that these phenomena should necessarily re-\nsult from them: we apprehend it could not, and our\nreason is, that we cannot find any mode of connexion\nbetween any transitions of any forces and these pheno-\nmena; for we can conceive the former to exist with-\nout the latter, and this might have been the case, for\nought we know to the contrary; and we think we are\nauthorized in saying, that these transitions are only\nrules or methods observed in the production of such\nphenomena, that they are events prior to fermentation,\n&c., and remain themselves to be accounted for. We\nmay say the same of the repulsive and attractive powers,\nand of all the other principles in the theory which are\nnot laws of human thought. Caution is inexcusable,\nthe labours of every age serve only to add to its mys-\ntery, feeling that they conduct us nearer to the bound-\naries of human observation, and discover to us the de-\nceptive glare of every weak meteor which promised per-\nmanent and enlightening lustre.\n\nWe have seen that the general properties of matter\nmay be well explained by the theory; and so far there-\nfore we must admit that the theory is applicable to the\nobjects of investigation, and may be useful to connect\ntogether some general principles. There remains to\nus to make one remark concerning one of these, viz.,\nNewtonian gravity. The supposition that it terminates\nbeyond the comets of our system, and is succeeded by\nrepulsion, appears to us very unnecessary, not to say\nunlikely, though highly worthy the accommodating\ngenius of Bofcovich. We are of opinion, that the ob-\njections urged against Sir Isaac Newton on this sub-\nject, may be much better and more simply obviated by a\nsupposition which the modern improvements in astrono-\nmy have nearly confirmed, viz., that there are systems\nof suns and revolving planets, similar to, and reaching\nto the limits of, our own; and that those are sufficient\nto counteract the necessary effects of universal gravity\nor attraction. If such be the case, inequalities in our\nsyntactic motions, relative to others, may arise from\nthe varying situations of the other system; and, if we\nconsider the fixed stars as forming these, we may ob-\nserve differences in their positions and magnitudes, in Bofcovich's\nconsequence of such variations. Our astronomical System of\nreaders will perceive that we allude to the apparent Natural\napproach of our sun to the constellation Hercules in\nthe northern hemisphere, the gradual widening of the\nstars in that quarter of the heavens, and the conse-\nquences of it. But without any such confirmation it\nmust be acknowledged, that our supposition is much\nmore probable, and gives a more elevated notion of the\ngreat Artificer's skill than that of Bofcovich, and we are\nthe more anxious to retain it, that one of the principles\nin the theory may not be broken, that the transitions of\nthe powers occur in the insensible distances. We\nrequest the attention of our readers to Bofcovich's\nprovident supposition on another account. Does it\nnot indicate one of the modes by which his theory was\nformed? Does it not plainly show us how far genius\nwill be exerted when observation fails? Does it not\nsatisfactorily demonstrate that part of this splendid\ntheory is the offspring of an imagination heated by\nsyntactic love, and animated by a reconciling enthu-\nsiasm? Indeed when the imagination is the provider,\nthe reason can be well satisfied; for what is wanting\ncan be readily supplied, what is displeasing can be\neasily rejected, what is unshapely can be fashioned to\nconformity, and all can be decorated and adorned, till\nat last there arises some fine fabric to please and to\ndelight. But we require more than delusive orna-\nment, and yet we expect not perfection; we know\nthat every theory of natural philosophy has failed hi-\nthereto, not from a deficiency but rather from a luxu-\nriancy in grandeur, which, surpassing, has eclipsed the\nminute gems that glitter below; no one has failed in\nexplaining the stupendous structure and the mighty\nrollings of worlds, which no eye ever comprehended,\nand no hand ever approached; but take it from its god-\nlike work to the mean purposes and the trivial uses\nof man, and behold the airy phantom shrink from our\nview. It is in explaining familiar circumstances,\nor, so to speak, the events of our neighbourhood, that\nevery one has failed; but it is confining to mankind\nto know, that in every succeeding one, there is a\ngreater approximation to perfection, a greater extent\nand more facility of application; and we will acknow-\nledge that this of Bofcovich, though not totally invul-\nnerable, certainly leaves the least uncovered.\n\nThe observations which we have now made seem to\nus very proper to introduce those we have to offer on\nthe application of the theory to physics. We are of\nopinion that Bofcovich, in his account of solidity and\nfluidity, has rather given a description, and related\nsome properties, than proposed an explanation or de-\nduction on the principles of his theory; but in a\nsystem of such extent, and promising so much, we re-\nquire more than this, and it is our opinion that more\nmay be given. Without pretending that we have com-\nplete success in our attempt, or wishing to preclude\nothers, we offer the following as at least a proba-\nble one.\n\nWe can imagine, that any number of atoms shall\ncome into the limits of cohesion of each other in such\na manner as that a mass of some determined form shall\nbe produced; and that the powers on each side of\nthese limits are so strong, as to withstand considerable\ndivalent force from without. Now in a mass so con-\nstructed\nunphilosophical one; for in a similar manner, and we Bofcovich's venture to say, with as much truth, if matter or its atoms be constructed in the way Bofcovich describes; and if they possess the power of repulsion and attraction, then all matter is fluid, for all the atoms of it will cause fluidity in certain circumstances. We do not deny that when it combines in sufficient quantity with bodies it causes fluidity; but we beg to remind our readers that there are cases of fluids being generated by the trituration of solids together, and surely they will acknowledge, that what is true in the one case, is at least possible in the other; but we will even admit, that caloric is the principal cause of fluidity (though we are aware that in admitting it, we depart from true philosophy), and yet we do not perceive, that the least objection to our supposition will hence arise. May not caloric be composed of the very smallest, or the primary atoms of matter, and consequently be more easily insinuated between the atoms of other bodies which are composed of the aggregates of these primary atoms? Do we not find that it corresponds pretty accurately with the description of these atoms which Bofcovich has given? Does it not seem in the least distances to repel its own particles, and at greater distances to be attracted by the particles or atoms of other bodies?\n\nThe constant addition of adventitious atoms to the interfaces in a solid body, as we have before mentioned, will cause vibrations, and will at last, by totally separating the atoms from the limits of cohesion and the sphere of the attractive power, render them susceptible of the influence of surrounding bodies, so that they leave each other, and combine with those which surround them. When caloric is the body added, the most general effect which results from its repeated and constant addition is evaporation. Now the particles of an evaporated fluid will recombine if the supersubstantial caloric which holds them together be withdrawn, provided the bodies with which they unite do not attract them more powerfully than they do each other. But it is possible that such an addition will in certain cases strengthen the combination of a solid, i.e., that fluidity will not always be the consequence of insinuating atoms into the vacant spaces, for it is possible to specify circumstances, in which a body already fluid, may be rendered solid by interposing amongst its particles, the particles of another fluid.\n\nWhen the adventitious atoms are removed, one of two consequences will occur, either the atoms of a solid which has been rendered fluid by such insinuation, will be left within their spheres of attraction, and consequently will enter into limits of cohesion, and form a solid again, or they may be left beyond these spheres, so as not to enter into limits of cohesion, but to form a loose uncombined pulverulent substance. It may happen that in the latter case, the particles being separated from each other beyond their spheres of attraction, will enter into combinations with other bodies, of whose influence they are now susceptible. We have instances of both of these in the fusion of metals: sometimes on cooling these form again into solids; others, having their atoms too far separated from each other, cannot unite, but combine with other bodies, (generally oxygen) and form powders which retain no characteristics of metals; and some combine with other metals constituting alloys.\n\nVol. IV. Part I.\nWe recommend the prosecution of this subject to the philosophical chemist; and though we encounter the charge of vanity, we cannot help flattering ourselves with having pointed out a mode by which, though nothing should be discovered, yet to resolve some apparently unconnected phenomena into one general principle, and hence to abridge the labour of acquiring the science of chemistry, and to facilitate the application of it to the practical purposes of life. We are of opinion that the facts in chemistry are now so numerous, as to require a generalizing spirit to reduce them into some kind of order, to shew their connexion in the chain of nature, and to derive from them by induction, certain principles which may be employed in the synthetic process. Indeed without such it will soon be found that no ordinary memory can retain what may be useful, but certainly is elegant in the art, and that a great body of evidence is insufficient to enforce conviction, if it be budded together in chaotic confusion: pillars and porticoes and carved stones may be collected, and may astonish us by their grandeur; but unless they be methodized, connected, and combined, our astonishment will resemble that which we feel, when we contemplate the preposterous structure of some natural monster, whose limbs are individually elegant, but serve by their elegance to magnify the error of their position. We do not wish to depreciate the merits of modern chemists, but we must confess, they appear to us more scrupulous about ascertaining the few grains of earth in some cockle shell, than anxious to erect a temple to their science, and are themselves too much elevated by the discovery of a semi-metal, to be concerned about the deities which preside. What we have said may be thought mere declamation, if we do not accompany it with some example of the employment of such a generalizing spirit; we know not how far it may become us to do so, but as the consideration of the theory of Boscovich, in which we have been engaged, has naturally led us to those phenomena which seem best qualified to admit of its application, and as therefore, in some sort resulting from, or connected with our subject, we shall attempt to give a final specimen of it. It is well known to chemists, that although certain individual or single bodies of the saline class be very soluble in water, the compounds formed of them are very insoluble in that fluid, i.e., that though alkalies or acids singly very soluble in water, the neutral salts formed by them are very insoluble; and that many varieties in the degrees of solubility are to be met with in the compound bodies or neutral salts, which are contrary to what we should expect from reasoning on the varieties of these degrees, in the simple or elementary bodies which compose them.\n\nFor example, the sulphuric acid is very soluble in water, and so is the vegetable alkali or potash; but the sulphate of potash, which is a compound of these, is so difficult of solution, that 16 times its own weight of water, at the temperature of 60\u00b0, is required to effect it. The acetate of potash affords another example, though not so remarkable, requiring only about 10 times its own weight of water at the same temperature. Indeed, there are many instances of a compound or neutral salt being less soluble than either the alkali or the acid which enter into its composition; but in those we have mentioned, the difference is so great as to have merited much attention, though as far as we know, Boscovich's there has not been assigned a reason for it. Now we apprehend the reason to be, that as both the simple bodies have an attraction for water, or that as there is an attraction between water and these two bodies, the degree of attraction will be equal to the difference only of the separate attractions between water and the bodies individually; or, in other words, the attraction between water and one of the bodies will be lessened by the attraction between water and the other body, so that the difference only of these two will influence. Now, in certain cases, this difference will be equal to nothing, when the attractions are equal; but in every case, it is evident, it will be less than the greater of the attractions, and, of consequence, the solubility of the compound will be less than that of the simple bodies which compose it. Now this consequence is not affected by the absolute solubility of the simple bodies, but by their solubility in respect to each other, i.e., relative alone; therefore, the compound of simple bodies, which themselves are highly soluble, may be no more soluble than the compound of simple bodies, which themselves are very little soluble.\n\nThe principle is universal. Other consequences will result, which are not only curious, but, in our opinion important; and we do not in the least hesitate to assert, that the principle may be applied to determine a priori the degrees of solubility of neutral salts, provided we are sufficiently acquainted with the relative solubility of the simple bodies which compose them. One consequence will be, that a compound formed of a very soluble and a very insoluble simple body will be nearly, or quite, as soluble as the former, feeling that the attraction between it and water will be little or not at all diminished by the attraction between the other very insoluble body and water. As a proof of this, we may take the instance of the sulphate of magnesia, which is soluble in its own weight of water at temperature 60\u00b0: Now in this case, the magnesia is soluble to a very small amount only; but the acid, it is well known, is so to a great degree; even the small solubility of the magnesia, however, does in a certain degree impair the solubility of the compound. The same is true of the nitrat and muriat of magnesia; and, did our limits permit, we might adduce very many examples of the same; we might shew, that the compounds of very soluble acids with the metallic oxys are soluble, if these oxys are not so; but if they are, the solubility of the compound is impaired: and we might also apply the principle to bodies soluble in alcohol and other menstrua, where it will be found to hold. But we leave the prosecution of the subject to our chemical readers, conferring, however, that we have found exceptions to its universality, which as yet we have not been able to reconcile. Perhaps, a principle still more general, and higher in the order of events, may influence or modify this which we have specified; it may be connected with some of those varieties in the composition of forces, which may take place in the insensible distances, changing the limits of cohesion, and modifying the position and the action of the atoms of matter. We have ventured far in the exposition we have given; did we persevere, there might be imputed to us temerity.\n\nWe have attempted to apply Boscovich's theory to several\nBosovich's several other chemical phenomena, particularly those of elective attraction and dissolving affinity; but though our success has been somewhat flattering, we have not been able hitherto to collect and arrange our principles and results, so as to present them properly to the public. At some future stage of this work, however, such may be in our power, when we hope to convince our readers, that the theory is sufficiently accommodated to that object, and that it will assist us in deducing principles more general, than any yet received in chemical science.\n\nIt is now time for us to conclude our account of the theory of Bosovich; and in so doing, it becomes us to recommend to our readers, that they endeavour to form a just and an adequate opinion of its merits, of the objects which it has in view, and of the means which it employs to accomplish them. Considered in respect to itself only, as the production of a great and an enlightened mind, no labour to comprehend it can be in vain or worthless, and no one can comprehend it without receiving the most elevated pleasure; but there is another inducement for us to effect this purpose, different from any we have yet mentioned: we mean the tendency it will have to modify, and to subvert, many of the leading doctrines in the metaphysics of the day. Nor ought this to alarm any of our readers, for if these doctrines be true and legitimate, they will be paramount to all objections, and the improvements made in every other science will serve to confirm them; but if they are not so, surely the sooner they are subverted the better it will be for science and for us all; at all events, an inquiry into them is rational, and it may do good. This, however, we dare not now propose to ourselves, and will therefore recommend our readers to peruse the Essays on Perception, by Professors Reid and Stewart, where they will find sentiments which derive most of their validity from some of the Bosovichian principles. They are sentiments in which we have the honour to agree with these true philosophers; though it is somewhat mortifying to us to confess, that they have convinced us that the phenomenon of which they treat is inexplicable.\n\nIt is indeed very mortifying to humanity to be convinced, that for many, very many centuries, our forefathers have been unceasingly attempting to explain phenomena intellectual and material by a nullity, on principles which do not exist; but it would be still more mortifying to find, that though there is ground for such convictions, men calling themselves philosophers should persevere steadfastly in the same invariable course of error and absurdity. In our own days, a light, clear and authoritative, has arisen to direct and to animate us in the search after truth; it is our own faults if we shut our eyes against its splendour, and suffer the interior man to be dark and unenlightened. Of this light the theory of Bosovich forms a part: it has succeeded and surpassed that of Newton; it will be the parent of a greater than either; it professes to conduct us to the interior veil of the temple of nature; but it has failed in this very sublime attempt, failed, however, only after it has conducted us beyond Descartes, Leibnitz, and Newton.","sp":45,"ep":63},{"h":"BOSEA","t":"GOLDEN-ROD TREE. See Botany Index.**\n\n**BOSHIES-MEN,** a species of Hottentots, so called, according to Dr Sparman, from their dwelling in woody or mountainous places. They are sworn enemies to a pastoral life. Some of their maxims are, to live on hunting and plunder, and never to keep any animal alive for the space of one night. By these means they render themselves odious to the rest of the inhabitants of the Cape; and are pursued and exterminated like the wild beasts, whose manners they have assumed. Others of them again are kept alive, and made slaves of. Their weapons are poisoned arrows, which shot out of a small bow will fly to the distance of 200 paces, and will hit a mark with a tolerable degree of certainty at the distance of 50 or even 100 paces. From this distance they can by stealth, as it were, convey death to the game they hunt for food, as well as to their foes, and even to so large and tremendous a beast as the lion; this noble animal thus falling by a weapon which perhaps it despised, or even did not take notice of. The Hottentot, in the mean time, concealed and safe in his ambush, is absolutely certain of the operation of his poison, which he always culls of the most virulent kind; and it is said he has only to wait a few minutes in order to see the wild beast languish and die. The dwellings of these foes to a pastoral life are generally not more agreeable than their maxims and manners. Like the wild beasts, bushes and cliffs in rocks by turns serve them instead of houses; and some of them are said to be far worse than beasts, that their foil has been found close by their habitations. A great many of them are entirely naked; but such as have been able to procure the skin of any sort of animal, great or small, cover their bodies with it from the shoulders downwards as far as it will reach, wearing it till it falls off their backs in rags. As ignorant of agriculture as apes and monkeys, like them they are obliged to wander about over hills and dales after certain wild roots, berries, and plants (which they eat raw), in order to sustain a life that this miserable food would soon extinguish and destroy were they used to better fare. Their table, however, is sometimes composed of several other dishes, among which may be reckoned the larvae of insects, or that kind of caterpillars from which butterflies are generated; and in like manner a sort of white ants (the termites), grasshoppers, snakes, and some sorts of spiders. With all these changes of diet, the Boshies-man is nevertheless frequently in want, and famished to such a degree as to waste almost to a shadow. \"It was with no small astonishment (says Dr Sparman), that I for the first time saw in Lange Kloof a lad belonging to this race of men with his face, arms, legs, and body, so monstrously small and withered, that I could not have been induced to suppose but that he had been brought to that state by the fever that was epidemic in those parts, had I not seen him at the same time run like a lapwing. It required but a few weeks to bring one of these starvelings to a thriving state, and even to make him fat; their stomachs being strong enough to digest the great quantity of food with which they are crammed, as they may rather be said to bolt than eat. It sometimes happens indeed that they cannot long retain what they have taken in; but this circumstance, it is said, does not hinder them from beginning again upon a new score.\"\n\n\"The capture of slaves from among this race of men...\"\nis by no means difficult; and is effected (Dr Sparman informs us) in the following manner. \"Several farmers that are in want of servants join together and take a journey to that part of the country where the Boshies-men live. They themselves, as well as their Lego-Hottentots, or else such Boshies-men as have been caught some time before, and have been trained up to fidelity in their service, endeavour to spy out where the wild Boshies-men have their haunts. This is best discovered by the smoke of their fires. They are found in societies from 10 to 15 and 100, reckoning great and small together. Notwithstanding this, the farmers will venture in a dark night to set upon them with six or eight people, which they contrive to do by previously stationing themselves at some distance round about the kraal. They then give the alarm by firing a gun or two. By this means there is such a conflagration spread over the whole body of these savages, that it is only the most bold and intelligent among them that have the courage to break through the circle and steal off. These captors are glad enough to get rid of at so easy a rate; being better pleased with those that are stupid, timorous, and struck with amazement, and who consequently allow themselves to be taken and carried into bondage. They are however, at first treated by gentle methods; that is, the victors intermix the fairest promises with their threats, and endeavour, if possible, to throtl some of the larger kinds of game for their prisoners, such as buffaloes, sea-cows, and the like. Such agreeable baits, together with a little tobacco, soon induce them, continually cockered and feasted as they are, to go with a tolerable degree of cheerfulness to the colonist's place of abode. There this luxurious junketing upon meat and fat is exchanged for more moderate portions, consisting for the most part of butter-milk, frumenty, and hasty-pudding. This diet, nevertheless, makes the Boshies-man fat in a few weeks. However, he soon finds his good living embittered by the maudering and grumbling of his master and mistresses. The words t'guazeri and t'gaunath, which perhaps are best translated by those of \"young sorcerer\" and \"imp,\" are expressions which he must frequently put up with, and sometimes a few curses and blows into the bargain; and this for neglect, remissness, or idleness: which last failure, if it cannot be said to be born with him, is however in a manner naturalized in him. So that, both by nature and custom detesting all manner of labour, and now from his greater corpulency becoming still more slothful, and having besides been used to a wandering life subject to no control, he most sensibly feels the want of his liberty. No wonder, then, that he generally endeavours to regain it by making his escape: but what is really a subject for wonder is, that when one of these poor devils runs away from his service, or more properly bondage, he never takes with him anything that does not belong to him. This is an instance of moderation in the savages towards their tyrants which is universally attested, and at the same time praised and admired by the colonists themselves; which, however, I cannot easily reconcile with what I have learned of the human heart.\" Is it in consequence of their fearing to meet with harder usage in case they should be retaken? This far, however, is certain, that none of this species of Hottentots are much given to violence or revenge. Free from many wants and desires that torment the rest of mankind, they are little, if at all, addicted to thieving, if we except brandy, victuals, and tobacco. It is not improbable likewise, that the advantages accruing from a theft may be overlooked by them, when their thoughts are taken up with regaining their liberty, the greatest of all treasures. It is necessary to observe here, that some of the Hottentots or Boshies-men, who are thus forced into the service of the colonists, live in small societies peaceably and quietly in desert tracts, where the colonists cannot easily come at them, and are sometimes in the possession of a few cows. These people probably originate from Boshies-men who have run away from the colonists service.\n\n\"I must confess (continues our author), that the Boshies-men in some hutbandmen's service are treated in the gentlest manner, and perhaps even without ever having a harsh word given them; live very well with regard to provisions; are well clad, relatively to their condition in life; and are very comfortably lodged, in comparison of what others are, in their own straw cottages. The chief of their benefits perhaps consists in tending a herd of cattle or flock of sheep during the heat of the day, when they have an opportunity of getting into a gentle state of intoxication by smoking tobacco; a state which excites in them sensations of as agreeable a nature as the frenzy produced by spirituous liquors and opium seems to afford to many others, who are never at ease but when they can procure to themselves this delicious pleasure. And yet, though they may thus agreeably pass away the otherwise tedious hours of their lives in smoking and sleep, they nevertheless generally run away. The colonists wonder at this, as a procedure entirely devoid of reason; without perceiving, that in so doing they suppose the Hottentots not endowed with a desire, which has its immediate foundation in nature, and which is common to the human race, and even to most brute animals, viz. an earnest longing after their birthplace and families, and especially after their liberty.\n\n\"The slave benefits, that violent outrage to the natural rights of mankind, always in itself a crime, and which leads to all manner of misdemeanors and wickedness, is exercised by the colonists in general with a cruelty towards the nation of Boshies-men which merits the abhorrence of every one; though I have been told that they pique themselves upon it; and not only is the capture of those Hottentots considered by them merely as a party of pleasure, but in cold blood they destroy the bands which nature has knit between husbands and their wives and children. Not content, for instance, with having torn an unhappy woman from the embraces of her husband, her only protection and comfort, they endeavour all they can, and that chiefly at night, to deprive her likewise of her infants; for it has been observed, that the mothers can seldom persuade themselves to flee from their tender offspring. The amiable tenderness of the mother, which perhaps glows with a more lively flame in the breast of this poor heathen than in those of her Christian tyrants, is the very circumstance laid hold on by their persecutors in order to rivet the chains of this wretched female so much the faster. There are some mothers, however, that let themselves free, when they have lost\nall hopes of saving their children. After having made their escape, they sometimes keep secretly about the neighbourhood, in hopes of finding some opportunity of recovering their infants again.\"","sp":63,"ep":65},{"h":"BOSNIA","t":"a province of Turkey in Europe, seated between Slavonia and Dalmatia.

Arrian tells us, that the Phrygians were enjoined by the oracle, to follow the rout which a bullock should mark out to them; and that, upon stirring one up, it jumped into the sea to avoid their pursuit, and swam over this strait.

The following is a description of this capital before the commencement of the late American war. \"The town stands in W. Long. 71. 5. N. Lat. 42. 24. about nine miles from the mouth of the bay. At the entrance of this bay are several small rocks which appear above water, and upwards of a dozen of small islands, some of which are inhabited. There is but one safe channel to approach the harbour; and that so narrow, that two ships can hardly sail through abreast; but within the harbour there is room for 500 sail to lie at anchor in a good depth of water. On one of the islands of the bay stands Fort William, the most regular fortress in British America. This castle is defended by 100 guns, 20 of which lie on a platform level with the water, so that it is scarce possible for an enemy to pass the castle. To prevent surprise, they have a guard placed on one of the rocks, at two leagues distance, from whence they make signals to the castle when any ships come near it. Boftonworth. There is also a battery of guns at each end of the town. At the bottom of the bay is a noble pier near 2000 feet in length; along which on the north side extends a row of warehouses for the merchants; and to this pier ships of the greatest burden may come and unload without the help of boats. The greatest part of the town lies round the harbour in the form of a half moon, the country beyond it rising gradually and affording a delightful prospect. The neck of land which joins the peninsula to the continent is but 40 yards over; which situation, if properly improved, might render the town impregnable on the land side. Bofton contains only about 18,000 inhabitants. They were more numerous 50 years ago; but the surprising increase of Newburyport, Salem, Marblehead, Cape Ann, Plymouth, Dartmouth, and the island of Nantucket, checked the growth and trade of the capital. The trade of Bofton, however, was so considerable, that, in 1768, 1300 sail entered and cleared at the custom-house there. The predominant religion is the Independent; though there are other persuasions, and ten churches serve for them all, but the Independents have six.\" Bofton has frequently suffered by fire, but the houses that were thus destroyed have always been rebuilt to advantage.

He introduced at Paris the practice of frequent letting of blood; which was condemned by the faculty; but soon after his death it came into practice with all the physicians. He published several books in physic and surgery; and the best edition of his works is that of Leyden in 1660, octavo.\n\nBOTANY\n\nIs that science which arranges, distinguishes, and names all plants or vegetables, to enable us to study their properties and uses.\n\nVegetables consist of an innumerable succession of individuals which it is impossible to examine, and would be useless if it were possible. It is therefore necessary to diminish the labour by forming them into groups or classes, that the same name may apply to a great number of individuals. Now certain individual plants have so close a resemblance to others in their flower, fruit, leaves, and general appearance, that almost every man at first sight would give them the same name. Thus every man who has seen the common daisy once, and knows its name, will probably apply the same name without mistake to every other individual of the same species. This forms the first step in botany, or what is called arranging and naming plants according to their species. Nor is it only the first, but the easiest step in botany. It is also the most important; for all the individuals of the same species must in similar circumstances possess the same qualities. For example, we have no reason to doubt that each individual plant of common hemlock, or of foxglove, possesses the same medical qualities, though from their place of growth these qualities may differ in degree. It is therefore the individuals of the species alone that are useful; and the whole value of any arrangement consists in enabling the botanist to distinguish and name the individuals, with the greatest ease and accuracy. If the number of species were small, definitions, or descriptions\nElements. scriptions of them would alone be sufficient; but as they amount perhaps to 40,000 or 50,000 or more, to search for every single species amid such a multitude would be a task for which neither human patience nor human life would be sufficient.\n\nTo shorten the labour, it has been found very expedient to arrange plants into various divisions; first into some very general divisions which may reduce them into a small compass, then to subdivide these general divisions into others less comprehensive, and these into others, till we arrive at the particular species which we are in search of. Thus the arrangement descends from a general division of all plants to every particular species.\n\nMany plans of this kind have been attempted by various botanists, but the arrangement of the celebrated Linn\u00e6us is incomparably the most ingenious, most accurate, as well as the simplest and easiest. That illustrious botanist divided all plants into classes, the classes into orders, the orders into genera, and the genera into species. The orders too, and the species, when numerous, he frequently subdivided into sections.\n\nObjections have been made to the arrangement of Linn\u00e6us, because it admits divisions which do not appear natural. But such persons, though distinguished botanists, seem to us to have misunderstood the use and intention of that arrangement. It is not, and ought not to be, its object to give what has been called a natural arrangement; for nature does not classify her productions. She places before us innumerable individuals, and leaves us to classify them according to the purpose which we have in view. If nature had formed plants into classes, orders, and genera, the botanist would have nothing to do but to study these. But in none of her works has nature done this. Classification is the work of man; and it is necessary for man merely on account of the limited nature of the faculties of his mind. Classification enables us to accomplish by several steps or operations what we cannot accomplish by one. But were our faculties much more exalted, were our penetration much more acute, and our memories perfectly retentive; could we at once survey all the qualities of objects, discern their relations to one another, and retain the remembrance of these accurately, we should have no occasion to generalize at all. As generalization or classification is necessary to aid our limited faculties, the best classification is that which leads us without error, and by the easiest process, to the particular object which we have occasion to investigate.\n\nThe arrangement of Linn\u00e6us is therefore the best: It is, however, not so perfect in some of its parts as it may yet be rendered. This is the case in some of the genera which are distinguished by marks that are too minute. But when we consider the indefatigable mind of that illustrious man, the chaos in which he found botany, and the beautiful arrangement which he gave to it, we may justly enroll the name of Linn\u00e6us in the same list with Bacon, and Newton, and Locke.\n\nA botanical system is a dictionary by which a person who has studied the rudiments of the science may find out the name of every plant which he meets with. This dictionary has been much enlarged by the labours of the great many eminent botanists of the present time. We shall therefore point out the method of consulting it, after giving a very concise view of the principles upon which it is founded. We will give a concise view, because we think most or perhaps all the elementary books of this science tend to confound and disgust beginners by physiological definitions, and by the multiplicity of terms which they require to be studied at the very first outset. Their plan is just as if a teacher of Latin was to require his pupils first to make themselves masters of a Latin dictionary before he allowed them to translate. Our plan is to require of a beginner no more elementary knowledge than what is sufficient to enable him to consult the system as he would do a dictionary. The meaning of the rest of the botanical terms we think can best be learned by having recourse to an explanation in an alphabetical form, as they occur in the investigation. This we intend to add to the present article. And we wish sincerely that every man who publishes a system of botany would do the same; for we have strong reasons to believe that different writers use the same words in different senses from one another. Linn\u00e6us, indeed, has defined his botanical terms; but in his two works, *Delici\u00e6 Plantarum* and *Philosophia Botanica*, he sometimes defines the same word differently. Now we ought to know which of his definitions succeeding botanists have adopted. Besides almost every botanist introduces terms of his own which we shall look for in vain in the definitions of Linn\u00e6us.\n\n**ELEMENTS OF BOTANY.**\n\nThe parts of a plant which it is necessary for the young botanist first to know, are the flower, and fruit. These include seven; the calyx, corolla, stamen, pistil, pericarp or seed-vessel, seed and receptacle. We will describe these in the order which will make them most easily distinguished.\n\n1. The corolla, which in common language is called the flower, and in fruit-trees the blossom, is the part which is most beautifully coloured, which is of the finest texture, and is often odorous. It is to be found of every colour, except green, a hue which it very seldom attains. It is white, as in the blossoms of the cherry, yellow as in the primrose and ranunculus or buttercup, red as in the rose, blue as in the violet. It is sometimes of one piece, and sometimes divided into distinct pieces, called petals. When the corolla consists of one petal, the outer or upper part which is broad is named the limb or border; and the lower part which is narrow and hollow, by which it is fixed, is called the tube. When the corolla consists of more than one petal, the lower part is called a claw, and the upper lamina.\n\nIn the corolla it is necessary to attend to its form, its divisions, the number of its petals, its colour and the part to which it is attached. See Plate XCV. Fig. 11. a corolla of one petal: a, the tube; b, the laminae. Fig. 13. a corolla of more than one petal: a, the claw; b, the laminae.\n\n2. The calyx is situated on the outside of the corolla, and enclosing it commonly at the base. It is generally\nGenerally of a greenish colour and of a coarser texture than the corolla. It consists of one part, or of two, three, &c., and is then said to be one-leaved, two-leaved, three-leaved, many-leaved. The calyx is of various shapes, tubular, globular, inflated, &c.\n\nThere are seven species of calyx, perianth, involucre, glume, anther, (pathe, calyptra, and volva. For explanation of these consult the vocabulary and Plate XCV. Fig. 18, a, the calyx.\n\n3. The pistil, or pistils, commonly appear in the centre of the corolla, from which they rise like so many columns. There are from one to twelve in the same flower, and sometimes more.\n\nA pistil consists of three parts, the stigma, the style, and the germen. 1. The stigma is the highest part of the pistil; which is sometimes globular, sometimes cleft, sometimes cross-shaped, &c. 2. The style is the pillar or thread which supports the stigma. 3. The germen is the pedicel or base of the pistil, most commonly of a roundish or globular shape; but sometimes long and slender. Sometimes there are several germens together. See Plate XCV. fig. 12, c, the stigma; b, the style; a, the germen.\n\n4. The filaments, which resemble threads or pillars, usually stand between the corolla and the pistil, are placed in regular order round the pistils, or alternate with the petals. They are in number on one flower from one to several hundreds. But it is not necessary to count them when they are more than twenty.\n\nA filament consists of two parts, the anther and the filament. 1. The anther is the summit of the filament, containing a mealy or powdery substance called pollen, and is generally of a different colour from the filament. They are of different forms, globular, horned, &c. 2. The filaments are the threads or pillars which support the anthers. The filaments are attached to the corolla, to the calyx, to the receptacle, or to the style. See Plate XCV. fig. 18. Filaments marked by e, e, e, e, e, e.\n\n5. The pericarp, or seed-vessel, is the case or covering of the seed, and is the external part of the germen come to maturity. It is of various shapes; globular, as in the poppy; long, as in the pod of the common garden or field pea: it is pulpy with a stone in the middle, as in the plum; pulpy, containing seeds enclosed in a case, as in the pear; juicy, and containing seeds which have only an external case, as the currant and gooseberry.\n\nThere are eight species of pericarp; capsule, silique, legume, follicle, drupe, pome, berry, and strobile. A description of these will be given in the vocabulary. Consult also Plate XCV. fig. 23. to 30.\n\n6. The seeds are so well known, that they require no description in the elements of the science.\n\n7. The receptacle is a point, line, or broad base, to which some or all of the six parts now described are attached. When it is the base of all these parts, it is called the receptacle of the fructification. When the calyx, corolla, and stamens only are attached to it, it is called the receptacle of the flower. When the germens together with the pistil only is fixed to it, it is called the receptacle of the fruit. It is called proper when only one flower with its fruit is inserted into it. It is called common when many flowers are attached to it, as in the common daisies, dandelion. See Plate XCV. Elements: Fig. 13, c, a proper receptacle. Fig. 9, 10, a common receptacle.\n\nAttention to the receptacle is most necessary chiefly in classes 11th, 13th, and 19th.\n\nBesides these seven, which are called the parts of fructification, because when they exist together, they are supposed necessary for producing proper fruit, there is another part which Linnaeus calls the nectary, that requires attention, as it is the foundation of some genera. It is difficult for beginners to distinguish it, as it varies much in its appearance, and is not very discernible in a great many species. It is sometimes the name of a small gland; sometimes of a scale or a number of scales; sometimes of a cup; sometimes of a horn or spur on the corolla, as in larkspur and violet; sometimes of a groove or excavation. In short, it appears to be a name for any singular or irregular appearance of any of the parts of the flower. In all accurate and perspicuous systems, it is so well described that it can be easily found out. If this be done the name may be admitted, but if not it must lead to ambiguity and want of precision.","sp":66,"ep":68},{"h":"BOTANY","t":"1. Lin. Thouinia ligustrina of Swartz.

Europe.\n\n*, A. leaves 3-cleft, trap-shaped, very entire; flowers sitting, lateral, solitary; stem spreading.\u2014This plant has a degree of bitternefs and acrimony; but its real use is far from being ascertained. It stands recommended in the gout, jaundice, and intermitting fevers.\n\n1093. **Teucrium, or Germaner.**\n\n64 species; viz. campanulatum, laevigatum, orientale, parvilorum, botrys, nilfolianum, trifidum, pleurodo-cham\u00e6pithys, fruticans, brevifolium, creticum, marum, quadratulum, multilorum, regium, laxmanni, fibricum, asiaticum, cubenfe, arduini, canadenfe, virginicum.\nginicum, japonicum, inflatum, villosum, hyrcanicum, abutiloides, * scorodonia, pseudo-scorodonia, betonicum, refupinatum, salviiflere, salviae-trum, * scordium, scordioides, * cham\u00e6drys, heterophyllum, braeateum, lucidum, nitidum, flavum, montanum, supinum, thymifolium, pyrenicum, rotundifolium, buxifolium, aureum, flavescens, graphalodes, ach\u00e6menis, polium, trifoliatum, pseudhyssopus, valentinum, capitatum, lusitanicum, pycnophyllum, verticillatum, libanitis, pulmum, angustiflimum, celeste, spinosum. Europe, Peria, N. America, W. Indies.\n\nscorodonia. * T. leaves heart-shaped, ferrated, on leaf-stalks; flowers in lateral bunches, pointing one way; stem upright.\u2014The people of Jersey are said to make use of this plant in brewing. It possesses the bitterness and a good deal of the flavour of hops; but, upon trial, it gave too much colour to the liquor.\n\nscordium. * T. leaves oblong, fitting, toothed, nakedish; flowers in pairs, on fruit-stalks, axillary; stem pubescent, spreading.\u2014The fresh leaves of this plant are bitter, and somewhat pungent. Powdered, they destroy worms. A decoction of this plant is a good fomentation in gangrenous cases. If cows eat it, when compelled by hunger, their milk gets a garlick flavour. Sheep and goats eat it. Horses, cows, and swine, refuse it.\n\ncham\u00e6drys. * T. leaves wedge-egg-shaped, cut, scolloped, on leaf-stalks; flowers 3 together; stems somewhat hairy.\u2014This plant is bitter, with a degree of aroma, and may be used with advantage in weak and relaxed constitutions. It is an ingredient in the celebrated gout powders.\n\nThe teucrium cham\u00e6pithys is a low hairy plant, clammy to the touch, of a strong aromatic resinous smell, and a little roughish taste. It is an aperient and vulnerary, and is used also in gouty and rheumatic pains.\n\nThe teucrium marum is a small shrubby plant, growing spontaneously in Syria, Candy, and other warm climates, and cultivated with us in gardens. The leaves have an aromatic bitterish taste, and, when rubbed between the fingers, a quick pungent smell, which soon affects the head and occasions sneezing. Distilled with water, they yield a very acid, penetrating, essential oil, resembling one obtained by the same means from feverish grass. These qualities sufficiently point out the uses to which this plant might be applied: at present, it is little otherwise employed than in cephalic snuffs.\n\n1094. Satureja, or Savory.\n\n11 species; viz. juliana, nervosa, thymbra, graca, filiformis, montana, rupestris, hortensis, capitata, pinifera, viminea. S. Europe, Jamaica.\u2014The herb of the satureja hortensis is raised annually in gardens for culinary purposes. It is a very warm aromatic, and affords in distillation with water, a subtile essential oil, of a penetrating smell, and very hot acid taste. It yields little of its virtues by infusion to aqueous liquors; rectified spirit extracts the whole of its taste and smell, but elevates nothing in distillation.\n\n1095. Thymbra, or Mountain-hyssop.\n\nThree species; viz. spicata, verticillata, ciliata. Spain, Italy, Levant.\n\n1096. Hyssopus, or Hyssop.\n\nFour species; viz. officinalis, lophanthus, nepetoides, ficiflora, foliatus. Siberia, S. Europe, N. America.\u2014The leaves of hyssop have an aromatic smell, and a warm pungent taste. Besides the general virtues of aromatics, they are particularly recommended in humoral affections, coughs, and other disorders of the breast and lungs; and said to promote expectoration; but so little dependence is put upon any property of this kind, that hyssop has now no place in the Pharmacopoeia of the London college.\n\n1097. Nepeta, or Nep, or Cat-mint.\n\n27 species; viz. * cataria, angustifolia, crispa, heliotropifolia, pannonica, cerulea, violacea, incana, japonica, ucrainica, nepetella, nuda, melissiflora, hirtuta, italica, multibracteata, reticulata, tuberosa, lanata, scordotis, virginica, malabarica, indica, ambinica, madagascariensis, multifida, botryoides. Europe, India, N. America.\n\n* N. flowers in spikes: whorls on short fruit-stalks: cataria, leaves on leaf-stalks, heart-shaped, tooth-ferrated.\u2014An infusion of this plant is deemed a specific in chlorotic cases. Two ounces of the expressed juice may be given for a dose. Cats are so delighted with this plant that they can hardly be kept out of the garden wherein it grows. Mr Miller says, that cats will not meddle with it if it is raised from seeds; and in support of this opinion quotes an old saying, \"If you let it, the cats will eat it; if you sow it, the cats will not know it.\" It cannot well be planted without being more or less bruised. Sheep eat it; cows, horses, goats, and swine, refuse it.\n\n1098. Elsholtzia.\n\nTwo species; viz. crillata, paniculata.\n\n1099. Lavandula, or Lavender.\n\nEight species; viz. spica, floecas, viridis, dentata, pinnata, multifida, abrotanoides, carnosa. S. Europe, Madeira, E. Indies.\n\nThere are different varieties of the lavandula spica, particularly the narrow and broad leaved. The flowers of both have a fragrant smell, to most people agreeable, and a warm pungent bitterish taste; the broad-leaved sort is the strongest in both respects, and yields in distillation thrice as much essential oil as the other; its oil is also hotter and specifically heavier: hence in the southern parts of France, where both kinds grow wild, this only is made use of for the distillation of what is called oil of spike. The narrow-leaved is the sort commonly met with in our gardens.\n\nLavender is a warm stimulating aromatic. It is principally recommended in vertigo, palpitations, tremours, suppression of the menstrual evacuations; and in general in all disorders of the head, nerves, and uterus. It is sometimes also used externally in fomentations for paralytic limbs. The distilled oil is particularly celebrated for destroying various cutaneous insects. If soft spongy paper, dipped in this oil, either alone or mixed with that of almonds, be applied at night to the parts infested by the insects, they will certainly be all found dead in the morning. The official preparations of lavender are, the essential oil, a simple spirit, and a compound tincture.\n\nThe Lavandula floribar is a shrubby plant, considerably smaller than the common lavender. The flowery heads are brought from Italy and the southern parts of France;\nFrance; they are very apt to grow mouldy in the palfage; and even when they escape this inconvenience, are generally much inferior to those raised in our gardens. The best stocks which we receive from abroad has no great smell or taste; Pomet affirms, that such as the shops of Paris are supplied with is entirely deliquescence of both; whilst that of our own growth, either when fresh, or when carefully dried, has a very fragrant smell, and a warm, aromatic, bitterish, subacrid taste: distilled with water, it yields a considerable quantity of a fragrant essential oil; to rectified spirit it imparts a strong tincture, which insipidated proves an elegant aromatic extract. This aromatic plant is rarely met with in prescription; the only officinal compositions into which it was admitted were the mithridate and theriac.\n\nThere is another plant called *Achillea*, which from the beauty and durability of its flowers has of late years had a place in our gardens, and whose aromatic qualities render it worthy of attention; this is the *Gnaphalium arenarium*, the golden stocks, goldlocks, or yellow cassinody: its flowers stand in umbels on the tops of the branches; they are of a deep shining yellow colour, which they retain in perfection for many years; their smell is fragrant and agreeable, somewhat of the musky kind; their taste warm, pungent and subastringent; they impart their flavour to water in distillation and by infusion to rectified spirit.\n\n**1100. Sideritis**, or Ironwort.\n\n20 species; viz. canariensis, candicans, cretica, montana, elegans, romana, syriaca, taurica, distans, perfoliata, ciliata, incana, virgata, glauca, hyssopifolia, scordoides, spinosa, hirtula, ovata, lanata. S. Europe, Canary, Madeira.\n\n**1101. Bystropogon.**\n\nSeven species; viz. pectinatum, fidaefolium, suaveolens, plumosum, origanifolium, canariense, punctatum. Madeira, Canary, Japan.\n\n**1102. Mentha**, or Mint.\n\n22 species; viz. auricularia, *sylvestris*, nemorosa, gratissima, niliaca, glabrata, *viridis*, *rotundifolia*, crispa, *hirsuta*, *aquatica*, citrata, *piperita*, sativa, dentata, *gentilis*, *arvensis*, austriaca, canadensis, *pulegium*, cervina, perilloides. Europe, Egypt, Canada.\n\n* M. spikes oblong; leaves spear-shaped, naked, serrated, fitting; stamens longer than the blossom.\u2014The flavour of this species being more agreeable than that of the others, it is generally preferred for culinary and medicinal purposes. A conserve of the leaves is very grateful, and the distilled waters, both simple and spirituous, are universally thought pleasant. The leaves are used in spring fallas; and the juice of them, boiled up with sugar, is formed into tablets. The distilled waters, and the essential oil, are often given to stop retching, and frequently with succers. Dr Lewis says, that dry mint digested in rectified spirit of wine, gives out a tincture which appears by daylight of a fine dark-green, but in candlelight of a bright red colour. The fact is, that a small quantity of this tincture is green either by daylight, or by candlelight; but a large quantity of it seems impervious to common daylight: however, when held between the eye and a candle, or between the eye and the sun, it appears red; so that if put into a flat bottle, it appears either green or red, as it is viewed through the flat side or through the edge of the bottle.\n\n* M. leaves egg-shaped, on leaf-stalks; stamens shorter *piperita*, than the blossom.\u2014The stem and leaves of it are beget with numbers of very minute glands, containing the essential oil, which rises plentifully in distillation. Peppermint-water is well known as a carminative and antispasmodic. The essence of peppermint is an elegant medicine, and possesses the most active properties of the plant.\n\n* M. leaves egg-shaped, acute, serrated; stamens as *arvensis*, long as blossoms.\u2014This species prevents the coagulation of milk; and when cows have eaten it, as they will do largely at the end of summer when the pastures are bare, and hunger distresses them, their milk can hardly be made to yield cheese; a circumstance which sometimes puzzles the dairy-maids. Horses and goats eat it; sheep are not fond of it; cows and swine refuse it.\n\n* M. leaves egg-shaped, blunt, somewhat scolloped; *pulegium*. stems roundish, creeping; stamens longer than the blossom.\u2014The expressed juice of this plant, with a little sugar, is not a bad medicine in the hooping cough. A simple and a spirituous water, distilled from the dried leaves, are kept in the shops. They are prescribed in hysterical affections, and are not without considerable antispasmodic properties. An infusion of the plant may be used with the same intention.\n\n**1103. Perilla.**\n\nOne species; viz. ocyroides. India.\n\n**1104. Hyptis.**\n\nFour species; viz. verticillata, capitata, radiata, cham\u00e6drys.\n\n**1105. Glechoma**, or Gill, or Ground ivy.\n\nOne species; viz. hederacea. N. of Europe.\n\nG. leaves kidney-shaped, scolloped.\u2014The leaves of this plant, thrown into the vat with ale, clarify it and give it a flavour. Ale thus prepared is often drank as an antiscorbutic. The expressed juice, mixed with a little wine, and applied morning and evening, destroys the white specks upon horses eyes. The plants that grow near it do not flourish. It is said to be hurtful to horses if they eat much of it. Sheep eat it; horses are not fond of it; cows, goats, and swine, refuse it. Little protuberances, composed of many cells, are sometimes found upon the leaves, and are occasioned by insects.\n\n**1106. Lamium**, or Dead-nettle.\n\n13 species; viz. ovata, levigatum, rugosum, garanicum, maculatum, *album*, molle, *purpureum*, incisum, bifidum, tomentosum, *amplexicaule*, multifidum. Europe.\n\n* L. leaves heart-shaped, tapering to a point, serrated, *album*, on leaf-stalks; flowers about 20 in a whorl.\u2014This plant grows wild in hedges; and flowers in April and May. The flowers have been particularly celebrated in uterine flours and other female weaknesses, and also in disorders of the lungs; but they appear to be of very weak virtue, and are at present little used in Britain.\n1107. *Galeopsis*, or Hedge-nettle.\n\nFour species; viz. *ladanum*, *grandiflora*, *tetrahit*, *cannabina*. Europe.\n\n1108. *Betonica*, or Betony.\n\nEight species; viz. *officinalis*, *stricta*, *incana*, *orientalis*, *alopecuros*, *hiruta*, *grandiflora*, *heraclea*.\n\n* B. spike interrupted: blossoms, upper lip entire; lower lip, the upper segment notched: calyxes smoothish.\u2014This is a low plant, growing in woods and shady places, in several parts of England; the flowers come forth in June and July; they are of a purplish colour, and stand in spikes on the tops of the stalks. The leaves and flowers have an herbaceous, roughish, somewhat bitterish taste, accompanied with a very weak aromatic flavour. This herb has long been a favourite among writers on the materia medica, who have not been wanting to attribute to it abundance of good qualities. Experience does not discover any other virtue in betony than that of a mild corroborant; as such, an infusion or light decoction of it may be drank as tea, or a saturated tincture in rectified spirit given in suitable doses, in laxity and debility of the viscer\u00e6, and disorders proceeding from thence. The powder of the leaves, snuffed up the nose, provokes sneezing; and hence betony is sometimes made an ingredient in sterutatory powders: this effect does not seem to be owing, as is generally supposed, to any peculiar stimulating quality in the herb, but to the rough hairs which the leaves are covered with. The roots of this plant differ greatly in quality from the other parts; their taste is bitter, and very nauseous; taken in a small dose, they vomit and purge violently, and are supposed to have somewhat in common with the roots of hellebore. It is pretty singular, if true, that betony affects those who gather any considerable quantity of it, with a disorder resembling drunkenness, as affirmed by Simon Pauli and Bartholinus. From these fickle qualities and operative effects, although it has now no place in our pharmacopoeias, yet it is perhaps to be considered as a vegetable deserving farther attention.\n\n1109. *Stachys*, or Bafe Horehound.\n\n26 species, viz. *sylvatica*, *circinata*, *coccinea*, *palustris*, *alpina*, *germanica*, *intermedia*, *lanata*, *cretica*, *heraclea*, *tenufiflora*, *glutinosa*, *spinoso*, *orientalis*, *paletina*, *maritima*, *aethiopica*, *hirta*, *lavanduliflora*, *rugosa*, *recta*, *arenaria*, *annua*, *arvensis*, *latiflora*, *artemisia*. Europe, Barbary, Cape, Carolina.\n\n* S. six flowers in a whirl; leaves heart-shaped, on leaf-stalks.\u2014It will dye yellow. The whole plant has a foetid smell, and toads are thought to be fond of living under its shade. Sheep and goats eat it. Horses, cows, and swine refuse it.\n\n1110. *Ballota*, or Black Horehound.\n\nFour species, viz. *nigra*, *alba*, *lanata*, *disticha*. Europe, East Indies.\n\nB. leaves heart-shaped, undivided, serrated; calyx, teeth tapering to a point.\u2014It stands recommended in hysterical cases. The Swedes reckon it almost a universal remedy in the diseases of their cattle. Horses, cows, sheep, and goats refuse it.\n\n1111. *Marjoram*, or Horehound.\n\n14 species, viz. *alyssum*, *africanum*, *peregrinum*, *creticum*, *candidissimum*, *superium*, *cataractifolium*, *vulgare*, *africanum*, *crispum*, *hiratum*, *hispanicum*, *pseudo-dictamnus*, *acetabulum*.\n\n* M. teeth of the calyx, brittle shaped, hooked.\u2014It *vulgare* is very bitter to the taste, and not altogether unpleasing to the smell. It was a favourite medicine with the ancients in obstructions of the viscer\u00e6. In large doses it loosens the belly. It is a principal ingredient in the negro Caesar's remedy for vegetable poisons. A young man who had occasion to take mercurial medicines, was thrown into a salivation which continued for more than a year. Every method that was tried to remove it rather increased the complaint. At length Linnaeus prescribed an infusion of this plant, and the patient got well in a short time. Horses, cows, sheep and goats refuse it.\n\n1112. *Leonurus*, or Lion's-tail.\n\nSeven species, viz. *crispus*, *cardiac*, *marrubiatrum*, *galeobdolon*, *fupinus*, *tataricus*, *fibricus*. Russia, Siberia, Austria.\n\n* L. stem-leaves spear-shaped, 3-lobed.\u2014The leaves *cardiac* have a strong but not agreeable smell, and a bitter taste. Goats, sheep, and horses eat it. Cows are not fond of it. Swine refuse it.\n\n1113. *Phlomis*, or Jerusalem Sage.\n\n27 species, viz. *fruticosa*, *purpurea*, *italica*, *nissolii*, *armenica*, *lychnites*, *laciniata*, *famia*, *crinita*, *biloba*, *pungens*, *herba venti*, *alpina*, *tuberosa*, *zeylanica*, *martinicensis*, *urticfolia*, *decendentata*, *bifora*, *chinenis*, *indica*, *moluccoides*, *glabrata*, *alba*, *neptifolia*, *leonurus*, *leonites*. South Europe, Cape, East and West Indies.\n\n1114. *Mollucella*, or Molucco Balm.\n\nSix species, viz. *spinoso*, *laevis*, *tuberosa*, *perfica*, *fruticens*, *grandiflora*. Siberia, Levant, India.\n\n1115. *Clinopodium*, or Field Basil.\n\nThree species, viz. *vulgare*, *egyptiacum*, *incanum*. Europe, Egypt, North America.\n\n1116. *Origanum*, or Wild Marjoram.\n\n16 species, viz. *egyptiacum*, *dictamnus*, *sipyleum*, *tournefortii*, *cilatum*, *benghalense*, *creticum*, *synymaum*, *haeraceicum*, *vulgare*, *glandulosum*, *onites*, *fyriacum*, *maru*, *majorana*, *majoranoides*. S. Europe, Egypt, Carolina.\n\n* O. spikes roundish, panicle, clustered; floral leaves egg-shaped, longer than the calyx.\u2014The whole plant is a warm aromatic. The dried leaves, used instead of tea, are exceedingly grateful. The essential oil of this plant is so acid, that it may be considered as a caustic, and is much used with that intention by farriers. A little cotton wool moistened with it, and put into the hollow of an aching tooth, frequently relieves the pain. The country people use the tops to dye purple. Goats and sheep eat it. Horses are not fond of it. Cows refuse it.\n\nThe *origanum dictamnus* is a kind of *origanum* said to grow plentifully in the island of Candy, in Dalmatia, and in the Morea; it has been found hardy enough to bear the ordinary winters of our climate. The leaves, which are the only part in use with us, come from Italy. The best sort are well covered over with a thick white down, and now and then intermixed with purplish flowers. In smell and taste they somewhat resemble lemon thyme; but have more of an aromatic flavour,\nflavour, as well as a greater degree of pungency. When fresh they yield a considerable quantity of an excellent essential oil; but they have now no place either in the London or Edinburgh Pharmacopoeias.\n\nThe origanum majorana is raised annually in our gardens for culinary as well as medicinal uses; the seeds are commonly procured from the southern parts of France, where the plant grows wild. It is a moderately warm aromatic, yielding its virtues both to aqueous and spirituous liquors by infusion, and to water in distillation. It is principally used in disorders of the head and nerves, and in the humoral asthmas and catarrhs of old people. An essential oil of the herb is kept in the shops. The powder of the leaves proves an agreeable errhine, and enters the officinal sternutatory powder.\n\n1117. Thymus, or Thyme.\n\n22 species; viz. * serpyllum, lanuginosus, leavigatus, vulgaris, lanceolatus, numidicus, zygis, marshalleanus, inodorus, * acinos, patavinus, alpinus, montanus, piperella, brownii, filiformis, cephalotes, striatus, villosus, matichina, tragoriganum, virginicus. Europe, North America, Jamaica.\n\n* T. flowers in heads; stems creeping; leaves flat, blunt, fringed at the base.\u2014The whole plant is fragrant, and yields an essential oil that is very heating. An infusion of the leaves removes the headache occasioned by the debauch of the preceding evening. A general opinion prevails, that the fleah of sheep that feed upon aromatic plants, particularly upon thyme, is much superior in flavour to common mutton; but some say this is a vulgar error, that fleah are not fond of aromatic plants; that they will carefully push aside the thyme to get at the grass growing beneath it; and that they never touch it unless when walking space, and then they will catch at anything. The attachment of bees to this and other aromatic plants is well known. Sheep and goats eat it. Swine refuse it.\n\n1118. Melissa, or Balm.\n\nSeven species; viz. officinalis, grandiflora, * calamintha, * nepeta, pyrenaica, cretica, fruticosa. South of Europe.\n\nThe melissa officinalis, when in perfection, has a pleasant smell, somewhat of the lemon kind, and a weak roughish aromatic taste. The young shoots have the strongest flavour; the flowers, and the herb itself when old, or produced in very moist rich soils, or rainy seasons, are much weaker both in smell and taste. Balm, the herb of this plant, is appropriated by the writers on the materia medica, to the head, stomach, and uterus; and in all disorders of these parts is supposed to do extraordinary service. So high an opinion have some of the chemists entertained of balm, that they have expected to find in it a medicine which should prolong life beyond the usual period. The present practice, however, holds it in no great esteem, and ranks it, where it certainly deserves to be, among the weaker corroborants. In distillation it yields an elegant essential oil, but in very small quantity; the remaining decoction tastes roughish. Strong infusions of the herb, drank as tea, and continued for some time, have done service in a weak lax state of the viscera; these liquors, lightly acidulated with juice of lemons, turn of a fine reddish colour, and prove an useful, and to many a very grateful, drink in dry parching fevers.\n\n1119. Dracocephalum, or Dragon's-head.\n\n18 species; viz. virginianum, denticulatum, canariense, pinnatum, origanoides, palmatum, peregrinum, fruticolofum, austricum, ruyschiana, grandiflorum, altaiense, fibricum, moldavica, canefens, peltatum, nutans, thymiflorum.

Europe, China, N. America.\n\n* S. leaves heart-fear-shaped; scolloped flowers axillary.\u2014When the blossoms falls off, the cup cloves upon the seeds, which when ripe, being still smaller than the cup, could not possibly open its mouth, or overcome its elastic force, as the down of the seeds do in the compound flowers, and must consequently remain useless, without a possibility of escaping. But nature, ever full of resources, finds a method to discharge them. The cup grows dry, and then divides into two parts; so that the seeds, already detached from the receptacle, fall to the ground. Cows, goats, and sheep eat it; horses and swine refuse it.\n\n1125. Prunella, or Self-heal.\n\nThree species; viz. * vulgaris, grandiflora, hyssopifolia. Europe, Barbary.\n\n1126.

EUPHRASIA, or Eye-bright.\n12 species; viz. latifolia, * officinalis, faliburgensis, tricuspidata, cuneata, * odorantes, lutea, linifolia, viscosa, purpurea, longiflora, afera. Europe.\n* E. leaves egg-shaped, serrated, sharply toothed.\u2014It is a weak astringent, and was formerly in repute as a remedy for impaired vision. It will not grow but when surrounded by plants taller than itself. Cows, horses, goats, and sheep eat it. Swine refuse it.\n\n1133. MELAMPYRUM, or Cow-wheat.\nSeven species; viz., * cratilatum, * arvense, barbatum, nemorosum, * pratense, * sylvaticum, lineare. Eur.\narvense.\nM. spikes conical, loofe; floral leaves, with brittle-shaped teeth, coloured.\u2014The seeds when ground with corn give a bitterish and greyish tinge to the bread, but do not make it unwholesome. Cows and goats eat it. Sheep refuse it.\npratense.\n* M. flowers lateral, pointing one way; leaves in distant pairs; blossoms closed.\u2014Where this plant abounds, the butter is yellow and uncommonly good. Swine are very fond of the seeds. Sheep and goats eat it. Cows are very fond of it. Horses and swine refuse it.\n\n1134. LATHRAEA.\nThree species; viz. clandestina, aublatum, * squamaria.

Europe, N. America.\npalustris.\n* P. stem branched; calyx crested with callous dots; lip of the blossom flatting.\u2014This plant is an unwholesome growth in meadows, being very disagreeable to cattle. Goats eat it. Horses, sheep, and cows refuse it. Swine are not fond of it.\nsylvatica.\n* P. stem branched; calyx oblong, angular, smooth; lip of the blossom heart-shaped.\u2014The expressed juice, or a decoction of this plant, has been used with advantage as an injection for sinusous ulcers. It is said, that if the healthiest flock of sheep be fed with it, they become scabby and feisty in a short time; the wool will get loose, and they will be overrun with vermin. Cows and swine refuse it.\n\n1138. GERARDIA.\n12 species; viz. tuberosa, delphiniflora, purpurea, tenuiflora, tubulosa, nigra, flavia, scabra, pedicularia, japonica, glutinosa, sessiliflora. E.

ANTIRRHINUM, or Snap-dragon, Calceolaria.\n70 species; viz. * cymbalaria, piloflum, lanigerum, dentatum, heterophyllum, * elatine, elatinoides, * spurium, cirrhosum, aegyptiacum, fruticosum, hexandrum, triphyllum, latifolium, virgatum, triornithophorum, purpureum, vericolor, linarioides, * repens, monspelanum, bipunctatum, amethystinum, laxiflorum, triflere, helava, thymifolium, supinum, simplex, * arvense, peliferianum, parviflorum, flavum, saxatile, micranthum, viscosum, aparinoides, multicaule, reticulatum, marginatum, glaucum, alpinum, aphyllum, bicornis, macrocarpum, villosum, origanifolium, flexuosum, * minus, dalmaticum, hirtum, genitifolium, junceum, * linaria, linifolium, lagopodoides, canadenfis, chalepenle, reflexum, pedunculatum, * majus, ficulum, sempervirens, * orontium, papilionaceum, afera, molle, pinnatum, unilabiatum. Europe, Egypt, Barbary, Cape.\n* A. leaves heart-shaped, 5-lobed, alternate; stems cymbala-trailing.\u2014Its trailing branches, variously interwoven, ria, often cover old moist walls with a thick tapestry, and when in blossom, make a beautiful appearance.\n* A. leaves halberd-shaped, alternate; stems trailing, elatine.\u2014This is considerably more bitter than the other species, and is said to have been used successfully in cases of foul ulcers, and in cutaneous eruptions.\n* A. leaves pear-shape-shaped, crowded; stem upright; linaria. spikes terminating, fitting.\u2014An infusion of the leaves is diuretic and purgative. An ointment, prepared from them, gives relief in the piles. The expressed juice, mixed with milk, is a poison to flies, as is likewise the smell of the flowers. Cows, horses, and swine, refuse it. Sheep and goats are fond of it.\n* A. blossoms without a spur; flowers in spikes; cups majus, rounded.\u2014Though the seeds of this plant vegetate on the ground, it is only in dry soils and situations that the plant continues to live long enough to produce flowers.\n\n1145. ANARRHINUM.\nFive species; viz. bellidifolium, pedatum, fruticosum, crassifolium, tenellum.\n\n1146. CYMBARIA.\nOne species; viz. daurica. Dauria.\n1147. Tourettia.\n\nOne species; viz. lappacea.

Europe, Barbary, Madeira, America.\n\n* S. leaves oblong-heart-shaped, 3-fibred at the base, corners of the item acute.\u2014This plant is hardly known in modern practice; but the rank smell and bitter taste of the leaves seem to indicate some active properties. Swine that have the scab are cured by washing them with a decoction of the leaves. Goats eat it. Cows, horses, sheep, and swine refuse it.\n\n1153. Celsia.\n\nFive species; viz. orientalis, arcturus, coromandellina, cretica. Crete, Levant, E. Indies.\n\n1154. Hemimeris.\n\nFive species; viz. montana, fabulosa, diffusa, urticifolia, coccinea.

Europe, Canary, Madeira.\n\n* D. segments of the calyx egg-shaped, acute; blossom blunt, upper lip nearly entire.\u2014This species is certainly a very active medicine, and merits more attention than modern practice till very lately bestowed upon it. It grows wild in woods and on uncultivated heaths: the elegant appearance of its purple flowers (which hang in spikes along one side of the stalk), has gained it a place in some of our gardens. The leaves have been strongly recommended, externally, against scrophulous tumours, and likewise internally in epileptic disorders: what service they may be capable of doing in these cases, is not ascertained by accurate experiment. Several examples are mentioned by medical writers of their occasioning violent vomiting, hypercatarhis, and disordering the whole constitution; infomuch that Boerhaave accounts them poisonous. Their taste is bitter, and very nauseous. Digitalis, however, has lately been employed with great success in other diseases. A treatise has lately been published by Dr. Withering, professedly on the subject of its use in medicine, and containing many important and useful observations.\n\nAn infusion of two drams of the leaf, in a pint of water, given in half-ounce doses every two hours or fo, till it begin to puke or purge, is recommended in dropsy, particularly that of the breast. It is said to have produced an evacuation of water so copious and sudden, in affections, by stool and urine, that the compression of bandages was found necessary. The plentiful use of diluents is ordered during its operation. The remedy, however, is inadmissible in very weakly patients. But besides being given in infusion, it has also been employed in sublance; and when taken at bed-time, to the extent of one, two, or three grains of the dried powder, it often in a short time operates as a very powerful diuretic, without producing any other evacuation. Even this quantity, however, will sometimes excite very severe vomiting; and that too, occurring unexpectedly. During its operation, it has often very remarkable influence in rendering the pulse slower; and it frequently excites very considerable vertigo, and an affection of vision.\n\nBesides dropsy, digitalis has of late been employed in some instances of haemoptysis, of phthisis, and of mania, with apparent good effects. But its use in these diseases is much less common than in dropsy.\n\n1156. Incarvillea.\n\nOne species; viz. finenisis.\n\n1157.

It is there alone they can enjoy the proper temperature of heat, and receive the nourishment necessary for them. See *Oestrus, Entomology Index*.\n\nBesides the long worms which have been observed in the bodies of horses, there are also short ones.\u2014By these are to be understood what we call *botts*.\n\nAll authors, both ancient and modern, who have treated of the diseases of horses, have taken notice of these worms; but M. Vallifnieri is the first who has traced them to the last stage of their transformation, and has seen them change into a hairy kind of fly like the drone.\n\nThe flies from which these botts are produced inhabit the country, and do not come near houses, at least not near those of great towns; and therefore horses are never liable to have the worms (*i.e.*, botts) in their bodies, if they have been kept in the house, especially in a town, during the summer and autumn.\n\nIt is in the former of these seasons, and perhaps too in the beginning of the latter, that the females of these flies apply themselves to the anus of horses, and endeavour to gain admittance, in order there to deposit their eggs, or perhaps their worms.\n\nThe precise instant of their entrance will scarce admit of an eye-witness, but by the merest chance; yet M. Vallifnieri says, that Dr Gaspari had attained this very uncommon sight. The Doctor (he tells us) was one day looking at his mares in the field; and from being very quiet, he observed, that on a sudden they became very restless, and ran about in great agitation, prancing, plunging, and kicking, with violent motions of their tails. He concluded, that these extraordinary effects were produced by some fly buzzing about them, and endeavouring to settle upon the anus of one of them; but the fly not being able to succeed, he observed it to go off with less noise than before, towards a mare that was feeding at a distance from the rest; and now the fly taking a more effectual method to obtain its design, passed under the tail of the mare, and so made its way to the anus. Here at first it occasioned only an itching, by which the intestine was protruded with an increasing aperture of the anus; the fly taking the advantage of this, penetrated further, and secured itself in the fold of the intestine:\u2014this effected, it was in a situation proper for laying its eggs. Soon after this, the mare became very violent, running about, prancing, and kicking, and throwing herself on the ground; in short, was not quiet, nor returned to feeding, till after a quarter of an hour.\n\nThe fly then, we see, can find means of depositing its eggs, or perhaps its worm (*i.e.*, botts), in the fundament of the horse; which once effected, it has done all that is necessary for them. If these bott-worms are not hatched when first deposited in the horse, but are then only eggs, it will not be long before it happens, from the nutritive heat they there receive.\n\nThese bott-worms soon make their way into the intestines of the horse: they occupy such parts of this region as are to them most convenient; and sometimes (as we shall see presently) they penetrate even to the stomach. All the hazard they appear to be exposed to, is that of being carried away from the places they have fixed on by the excrement, which may seem likely to drive all before it. But nature has provided for all things; and when we shall have further described these bott-worms, it will seem that they are able to maintain their situation, and to remain in the body of the horse, as long as they please.\n\nThere is a time when these bott-worms are of themselves disinclined to leave this their habitation, it being no longer convenient for them after the purposes of their growth are answered. Their transformation to a fly must be performed out of the horse's body: and accordingly, when the time of their transformation draws near, they approach towards the anus of the horse; and then leave him of their own accord, or with the excrement, with which they then suffer themselves to be carried along.\n\nAccording to M. de Reaumur's observations, the bott-worms have two unequal claws, by which they are enabled to remain in the intestines of the horse in opposition to all efforts of the excrement to force them out.\u2014These claws are a sort of anchor, differently disposed from those of common anchors, but contrived to produce the same effect. Besides these two claws, nature has given them a very great number of triangular spines or bristles, very sufficient to arm them against the coats of the intestines, and to resist the force employed to drive them towards the anus, provided the head be directed towards the stomach of the horse.\n\nIt will be asked, no doubt, if these bott-worms are not\nnot dangerous to horses?\u2014The mares which afforded M. de Reaumur, for several years, those on which he made his observations, did not appear to be less in health than those which had none; but it may sometimes happen, that they are in so great a quantity in the body of the horse as to prove fatal to him. M. Vallifshieri supposes these bot-worms to have been the cause of an epidemical disease that destroyed a great many horses about Verona and Mantua in the year 1713.\n\nThe observations communicated to him by Dr Gaffari sufficiently confirm his supposition. This gentleman, upon dissecting some horses that died of this distemper, found in their stomachs a surprising quantity of short worms; of which to give us some idea, he compares them to the kernels of a pomegranate opened: each of these, by gnawing on the coat of the stomach, had made itself a kind of cellule therein, each of which would easily contain a grain of Indian wheat. It is easy to imagine by this means the stomach must be reduced to a wretched condition; the outer membranes were inflamed, and the inner ones ulcerated and corrupted; a very small quantity of these worms were found in the small intestines, and only a few in the larger, to which last they were found affixed, but had not corroded them. It is only perhaps when these bot-worms are in great numbers, and thereby incommoding each other in the intestines of the horse, that they make their way towards the stomach; and indeed a very few flies must be enough to overflow the inside of a horse, provided they should deposit all their eggs, and such should all be animated, M. Vallifshieri having counted 700 and odd in the body of one single fly.\n\nWhen one of these bots has left the anus of the horse, it falls on the ground; and immediately seeks out for some place of safety, where it may retire, to prepare for the last stage of its transformation, by which it is to become a fly. And now by degrees the skin hardens and thickens; and at length forms a solid shell or cocoon, the form of which scarcely differs from that of the worm. It is first of a pale red colour, which changes into chestnut; and at length, by the addition of gradual and successive shades of brown, the shell is rendered black. The worm or bot, before it passes into a nymph, is of the form of an oblong ball; it remains in this form much longer than worms of the flesh-fly kind. M. de Reaumur met with worms that retained this figure five or six days: as yet, one can perceive no traces of the legs, wings, and head of the nymph. Hence he first learned, that those bot-worms do not become nymphs immediately upon their first change; but that, in order to become flies, they must undergo one change more than caterpillars ordinarily do to become butterflies.\u2014For the cure of horses troubled with bots, see Farriery Index.","sp":408,"ep":409},{"h":"BOTTLE","t":"a small vessel proper to contain liquors, made of leather, glass, or stone. The word is formed from butellus, or botellus, used in barbarous Latin writers, for a lesser vessel of wine; being a diminutive of bota, which denoted a butt or cask of that liquor.\n\nThe ancient Jewish bottles were casks made of goats or other wild beasts' skins, with the hair on the inside, well sewed and pitched together; an aperture in one of the animal's paws serving for the mouth of the vessel.\n\nGlass-bottles are better for cider than those of stone. Foul glass-bottles are cured by rolling sand or small shot in them; muffle bottles, by boiling them. See Glass.\n\nBottles are chiefly made of thick coarse glass; though there are likewise bottles of boiled leather made and sold by the cask-makers. Fine glass-bottles covered with straw or wicker, are called flasks, or betters. The quality of the glass has been sometimes found to affect the liquor in the bottle.\n\nDr Percival cautions against the practice of cleaning of wine bottles with leaden shot. It frequently happens (he thinks), through inattention, that some of the little pellets are left behind; and when wine or beer is again poured into the bottles, this mineral poison will slowly dissolve, and impregnate those vinous liquors with its deleterious qualities. The sweetness which is sometimes perceived in red port wine may arise from this cause, when such an adulteration is neither designed nor suspected.\u2014Potash is recommended for cleansing bottles: a small quantity in the water will clean two groats.","sp":407,"ep":407},{"h":"BOTTLING","t":"the operation of putting up liquors in bottles corked, to keep, ripen, and improve. The writers on good husbandry give divers rules concerning the bottling of beer, cider, and the like. The virtues of Spaw, Pyrmount, Scarborough, and other waters, depend on their being well bottled and corked, otherwise they lose both their taste and smell. To preserve them, it is necessary the bottles be filled up to the mouth, that all the air may be excluded, which is the great enemy of bottled liquors. The cork is also further secured by a cement. Some improve their bottled beer, by putting crystals of tartar, and wine or malt spirits, and others, by putting sugar boiled up with the essence of some herb, and cloves, into each bottle.\n\nCyder requires special precautions in the bottling; being more apt to fly, and burst the bottle, than other liquors. The best way to secure them, is to have the liquor thoroughly fine before it be bottled. For want of this, some leave the bottles open a while, or open them after two or three days bottling to give them vent. If one bottle break, through fermentation, it is best to give them all vent, and cork them up again. Mean cyder is apter to break the bottles than rich. Some soak the corks in scalding water, to render them more pliant and serviceable. Another particular to be observed is, to lay the bottles so as that the liquor may always keep the cork wet and swelled. Something also depends on the place where the bottles are set, which ought to be such as exposes them as little as possible to the alterations and impressions of the air: the ground is better for this purpose than a frame; sand better than the bare ground; and a running water, or a spring often changed, best of all.\n\nTo hasten the ripening of bottled liquors, they are sometimes set in a warm place, or even exposed to the sun, when a few days will bring them to maturity.","sp":407,"ep":407},{"h":"BOTTOM","t":"in a general sense, denotes the lowest part of a thing, in contradistinction to the top or uppermost part.","sp":407,"ep":407},{"h":"BOTTOM","t":"in Navigation, is used to denote as well the channel of rivers and harbours, as the body or hull of a ship.

In which case it is understood, that if the ship be lost, the lender loses also his whole money; but if it return in safety, then he shall receive back his principal, and also the premium or interest agreed upon, however it may exceed the legal rate of interest. And this is allowed to be a valid contract in all trading nations, for the benefit of commerce, and by reason of the extraordinary hazard run by the lender. And in this case, the ship and tackle, if brought home, are answerable (as well as the person of the borrower) for the money lent. But if the loan is not upon the vessel, but upon the goods and merchandise, which must necessarily be sold or exchanged in the course of the voyage, then only the borrower, personally, is bound to answer the contract; who therefore, in this case, is said to take up the money at respondentia. These terms are also applied to contracts for the repayment of money borrowed, not on the ship and goods only, but on the mere hazard of the voyage itself; when a man lends a merchant 100l. to be employed in a beneficial trade, with condition to be repaid with extraordinary interest, in case such a voyage be safely performed; which kind of agreement, is sometimes called fennius nauticum, and sometimes njura maritima.

He was born in the year 1644, and entering early into the army, was raised in 1669 to the rank of colonel of dragoons, and in the conquest of Lorraine, served under Marshal Crequi. In the war against Holland he served under the celebrated Turenne, and frequently distinguished himself for his skill and bravery; and when that general was killed, in 1675, he commanded the rear-guard during the retreat of the French army. After performing various military services in Germany, in Flanders, and on the frontiers of Spain, he gradually rose in rank as well as in reputation. In 1690, he was created general of the army of the Moselle. In the following year, he acted as lieutenant-general, under the king in person; and while he invested Mons was wounded in an attack on that place. He conducted the bombardment of Li\u00e8ge, although it was defended by a superior enemy, and he forced the allied generals to abandon Luxemburg. He was entrusted with the command of the covering army, against King William, at the siege of Namur; and for this and many other important services, he was raised in 1693 to the high rank of marshal of France. In 1694, he was appointed governor of French Flanders, and of the town of Lille. By a skilful manoeuvre he threw himself into Namur, in 1695, and held out for sixty-three days, against the combined armies of the allies under King William. Having agreed to a capitulation, he was arrested prisoner of war.\nwar, because the French had not performed the stipulated terms on which the garrison had surrendered; and when he remonstrated that the garrison should have been retained rather than himself, he received a fine compliment, by being answered, that he was estimated at 10,000 men. In the conferences which were held with the earl of Portland, and which terminated in the peace of Rylwick, he had a principal share.\n\nDuring the following war, when Lille was again threatened, in 1708, with a siege by the duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene, Boufflers was appointed to the command, and made a very obstinate resistance of four months. His magnanimity was not less remarkable than his military conduct; for when a partisan represented to him that it would not be difficult to kill Prince Eugene, he was told by the marshal, that he might expect a great reward for taking him prisoner, but the severest punishment if anything were attempted against his life. He was rewarded and honoured by the king for his defence of Lille, as if he had been victorious. When the affairs of France were threatened with the most urgent danger, though a senior officer to Villars, he made an offer to serve under that general, and was with him at the battle of Malplaquet. Here he again displayed his military skill, by conducting the retreat, so that he lost neither cannon nor prisoners. He died at Fontainbleau in the year 1711, at the age of 68, and left the character of a true patriot, as well as of a great commander. Madame de Maintenon, said of him, \"that his heart was the last part that died.\" His conduct was uninfluenced by private interest, and superior to court intrigue. When he was ordered to take upon him the defence of Lille, and permitted to have the choice of his lieutenants, he waited not to arrange or regulate his private affairs, or even to take leave of his family, but flew to the place, and carried with him only two officers, one taken from the Bataille, and another who had been in disgrace; preferring merit obscured in the shades of retirement, to the gaudy flutterer in the sunshine of court favour.","sp":409,"ep":410},{"h":"BOUGENT","t":"WILLIAM HYACINTH, a famous Jesuit, first taught humanity at Caen and Nevers, and afterwards settled at the college of Louis the Great, where he employed himself in writing several works; the principal of which were, 1.

Scultetus, about Bouhours, the middle of the 17th century, used bougies in dicales of the urethra, and Monf. Daran, probably took the hint from him.

Having spread any quantity of the linen rag with the composition that is chosen for the purpose, cut it into slips from six to ten inches long, and from half an inch to an inch broad: then dexterously roll them on a glazed tile into the form of a wax candle: and as the end of the bougie that is to be entered first into the urethra should be somewhat smaller than the rest, it would be as well to cut the slips a little tapering. It should also be observed, that when the bougies are rolled up, that side must be outward on which the plaster is spread.\n\nMonf. Daran, and some others, attributed the action of their bougies to the composition they made use of in forming them. Mr Sharp apprehended, that as much of their efficacy was owing to the composition they made on the affected part, as to any other principle; and Mr Aiken very justly says, As it is evident that bougies of very different compositions succeed equally well in curing the same disorders in the urethra, it is plain that they do not act by means of any peculiar qualities in their composition, but by means of some property common to them all. This must be their mechanical form and texture, therefore their mode of action must be simple compression. The efficacy of mere compression in many cases of constriction is well known, from the use of sponge tents for widening parts that are straitened by cicatrices; and admitting obstructions in the urethra to be from a constriction formed by cicatrized ulcers, or a projection of the spongy substance of the urethra into the canal, we may easily conceive, that a gentle continued elastic compression will in time overcome the disease. We may also readily account for the inferior efficacy of metallic and whalebone bougies, from their not having the property of swelling with moisture, and therefore not making to equal a compression. As to bougies procuring a discharge of matter, there is no doubt but the mechanical stimulus of a foreign body in such a tender part, though free from disease, must produce it in some degree; and that this will be varied according to the chemically irritating quality of the composition, and the irritable state of the urethra: but it seems an absurdity to apply a topic, made uniform throughout, to the whole length of a canal, with a view of producing extraordinary effects upon a particular part of it, by means of some powerful quality in the ingredients. As to that part of the bougie which was in contact with the diseased part, being particularly covered with matter; this circumstance is probably owing to the greater irritation of that part of the urethra where the disorder is, than any other.","sp":410,"ep":410},{"h":"BOUHOURS","t":"DOMINIC, a celebrated French critic,\nBouillon, tic, was born at Paris in 1628; and has been by some considered as a proper person to succeed Malherbe, who died about that time.

During his education, he is said to have come out of the college of Beauvais almost as ignorant as he entered into it; but struggling hard against his unaptitudes to learn, he at length overcame it. At seventeen, he began to study mathematics and architecture; and in three or four years made such a progress, as to be useful to the baron of Thiers, whom he accompanied to the army in quality of engineer. Afterwards he had the supervision of the highways and bridges; and he executed several public works in Champagne, Burgundy, and Lorraine. The author of his life, in the Dictionnaire des Hommes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres, writes, that in this province a terrible spirit discovered itself in him, which he himself did not suspect before; and this was, it seems, the spirit of \"thinking philosophically.\" In cutting through mountains, directing and changing the courses of rivers, and in breaking up and turning over the strata of the earth, he saw a multitude of different substances, which (he thought) evinced the great antiquity of it, and a long series of revolutions which it must have undergone. From the revolutions in the globe, he passed to the changes that must have happened in the manners of men, in societies, in governments, in religion; and he formed many conjectures upon all these. To be farther satisfied, he wanted to know what, in the history of ages, had been said upon these particulars; and\nBoulanger that he might be informed from the fountain head, he learned first Latin and then Greek. Not yet content, he plunged into Hebrew, Syriac, Chaldaic, and Arabic; and acquired so immense an erudition, that, if he had lived, he would have been one of the most learned men in Europe; but death, as we have observed, prematurely took him off. His works are, 1. *Trait\u00e9 du D\u00e9sertisme Oriental*, 2 vols 12mo; a very bold work; but not so bold and licentious as, 2. *L'Antiquit\u00e9 desville*, 3 vols 12mo. This was posthumous. 3. He furnished to the *Encyclop\u00e9die* the articles Delage, Corve\u00e9, and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. 4. He left behind him in MS. a Dictionary, which may be regarded as a concordance in ancient and modern language. As a man, he is said to have been of a sweet, calm, and engaging temper; which, however, it is very difficult to reconcile with the dark, impetuous, ardent spirit, that appears to have actuated him as a writer.\n\n**Boulanger**, John, an engraver, who flourished towards the end of the last century, was a native of France. His first manner of engraving appears to have been copied, in some degree, from that of Francis de Poilly; but soon after he adopted one of his own, which, though not original, he however greatly improved: He finished the faces, hands, and all the naked parts of his figures, very neatly with dots instead of strokes, or strokes and dots. The effect is singular enough, and by no means unpleasing: only, in some few instances, he has opposed the coarse graving of his draperies, and back-ground, so violently to the neater work of the flesh, that the outline of the latter is thereby rendered hard, and the general appearance of it flat and chalky. This style of engraving has been carried to its greatest perfection in the present day, particularly in England. He did not draw the naked parts of his figures correctly, or with fine taste. His draperies are apt to be heavy, and the folds not well marked. However, his best prints possess much merit, and are deservedly held in great esteem.\n\n**Boulay**, C\u00e9sar, was born at St Ellier, a village of Maine in France; and became professor of humanity at the college of Navarre, regester, rector, and historiographer of the university of Paris. He died in 1678, after having published several works. The principal of them are, *A History of the University of Paris*, in Latin, 6 vols folio; and the *Treasure of Roman Antiquities*, in 1 vol. folio.\n\n**Boulcolaca**, among the modern Greeks, denotes the spectre of some wicked person who died excommunicated by the patriarch, reanimated by the devil, and causing great disturbance among the people; of which many strange stories are told.

There are three of his pictures in the church of Notre Dame.\u2014He left two sons who were admired for their skill in painting. The elder, who is well known under the name of Bon Boullon, was first instructed by his father; after which we went to perfect himself in Italy, and for that purpose the king allowed him a pension; at his return, he was made professor of the academy of painting. Louis XIV. employed him in adorning several of his palaces; and there are a great number of his pictures at Paris. His talents for copying the pictures of the great Italian masters were so very extraordinary, that he frequently deceived the greatest judges. He died in 1717.\u2014Lewis Boullon, his brother, after being also instructed by his father, gained the prize of painting at 18 years of age; upon which he obtained the king's pension. He set out for Italy at his brother's return, and acquired great skill in designing and colouring. At his return to Paris he was much employed; and at length became director of the academy of painting, knight of the order of St Michael, and first painter to the king. Louis XIV. allowed him several pensions, and raised him and his posterity to the rank of nobility. He embellished the church of the Invalids, the chapel of Versailles, &c.\n\n**Boullon**, Bon de, a painter of some eminence, was born at Paris in 1649. From his father Louis de Boulogne he learned the first principles of the art; but went to Rome in order to perfect himself from the works of the best masters. He abode in Italy five years. He excelled in history and portrait. His talents for copying the pictures of the great Italian painters were so very extraordinary, that he frequently deceived the greatest judges. He died at Paris in 1717, aged 68.\n\n**Boulogne**, Louis de, born at Paris in 1654, was the younger brother of the preceding; and like him learned from his father the first principles of painting, and afterwards went to Rome to complete his studies. His works, on his return, were so much esteemed, that Louis XIV. honoured him with the order of St Michael, and, after the death of Antony Coppell, appointed him his principal painter. He chiefly excelled in historical and allegorical subjects. He died at Paris in 1734, aged 80 years.\n\n**Boulogne**, a large sea-port town of Picardy in France, and capital of the Boulognois, now called the department of the Straits of Calais, with a harbour, and formerly a bishop's see.

The harbour has a mole for the safety of shipping, which at the same time prevents it from being choked up. The lower town is inhabited by merchants, and has three large streets, one of which leads to the high town, and the other two run in a line on the side of the river.

He was educated at Merchant-taylors school; and, before the Revolution, was from thence admitted a commoner of Christ-church in Oxford. Some time after, he was chosen a demy of Magdalen college, at the same election with Mr Addison and Dr Wilcox. From the merit and learning of the persons elected, this was commonly called by Dr Hough, president of the college, the golden election. He afterwards became fellow of the same college; in which station he continued in the university till he was invited to London by Sir Charles Hodges, principal secretary of state, in the year 1709, who made him his chaplain, and recommended him to Dr Tenison archbishop of Canterbury; but his first preferments were owing to the earl of Sunderland, by whose interest and influence he was promoted to the parsonage of St Olave in Southwark, and the archdeaconry of Surry. Here he continued discharging very faithfully and diligently every part of his pastoral office, till he was recommended to attend George I. as his chaplain when he went to Hanover in 1719. He had the honour to teach Prince Frederic the English language; and by his conduct he so won the king's favour, that he promoted him to the deanery of Christ-church, and the bishopric of Bristol, in the same year. As he was visiting his diocese five years afterwards, he received a letter from the secretary of state, acquainting him that his majesty had nominated him to the archbishopric of Armagh and primacy of Ireland. This honour he would gladly have declined; and desired the secretary to use his good offices with his majesty to excuse him from accepting it. Ireland happened to be at this juncture in a great flame, occasioned by Wood's ruinous project; and the ministry thought that the bishop would greatly contribute to quench it by his judgment, moderation, and address. The king therefore laid his absolute commands upon him; to which he submitted, but with some reluctance. As soon as he had taken possession of the primacy, he began to consider that country, in which his lot was cast for life, as his own; and to promote its true interest with the greatest zeal and affluency. Accordingly, in innumerable instances, he exerted himself in the noblest acts of beneficence and public spirit. In seasons of the greatest scarcity, he was more than once instrumental in preventing a famine which threatened that nation. On one of these occasions he distributed vast quantities of corn throughout the kingdom, for which the house of commons passed a vote of public thanks; and at another time 2500 persons were fed at the poor-house in Dublin, every morning, and as many every evening, for a considerable time together, mostly at the primate's expense. When schemes were proposed for the advantage of the country, he encouraged and promoted them not only with his counsel but his purse. He had great compassion for the poor clergy of his diocese, who were disabled from giving their children a proper education; and he maintained several of the children of such in the university. He erected four houses at Drogheda for the reception of clergymen's widows, and purchased an estate for the endowment of them. His charities for augmenting small livings and buying glebes amounted to upwards of 30,000l. besides what he devised by will for the like purposes in England. In short, the instances he gave of his generosity and benevolence of heart, his virtue, his piety, and his wisdom, are almost innumerable, and the history of his life is his noblest panegyric.

The happy influence which bounties have on trade and manufactures is well known; nor can there be a more convincing proof of the good intentions of the government under which we live, than the great care that is taken to give all possible encouragement to those who shall establish or improve any hazardous branch of trade.\n\nAll undertakings, in respect either to mercantile enterprises, or in the establishment of manufactures, are political weak and feeble in their beginnings; and if unsuccessful, Survey of either sink entirely, or at least are seldom revived in the same age. Accidents of this nature are not only destructive to private persons, but exceedingly detrimental to the public interest. On this principle, more especially\nespecially since trade, for which Providence designed us, hath been attended to, such attempts have been thought deserving, and have been favoured with public support. This in former times usually flowed from the crown, in the form of letters-patent, charters, or other grants of privileges, which, however requisite they might be, were notwithstanding very frequently objects of censure. If such as obtained them failed in their endeavours, they were reputed projectors; if, on the other hand, they succeeded, they were considered as monopolizers. Corporations, which imply the uniting certain individuals into a body, that they may thereby become more useful to the community, are created by the crown. Many of these were formed for promoting trade; and, according to the old system of our government, were necessary and useful. On the same principle, privileges were granted to private persons, on a suggestion, that what was immediately of use to them would terminate in public utility. These also did good in bringing in many arts and manufactures; though, in some cases, tending to private interest more than public emolument, they were liable to legal correction. In later times, and in concerns of moment, a much better method has been adopted, as often as it hath been found practicable, by rejecting private or particular interest, and proposing the designed advantages to such as should perform the stipulations on which they are granted. These bounties, as they are paid by the public, so they are solely calculated for the benefit of the public. They are sometimes given to encourage industry and application in raising a necessary commodity; which was intended by the bounty on exporting corn. The intention of this bounty was to encourage agriculture; and the consequence hath been, that we now grow more than twice as much as we did at the establishment of the bounty; we even consume twice as much bread as we then grew; yet in A.D. 1697, we exported a fifteenth part of what we grew, of late years a twenty-ninth part only. The bounty on this twenty-ninth part amounted to somewhat more than 50,000l., and the produce to more than 400,000l. It is evident that all this is so much clear gain to the nation. But this is far from being all that we have annually gained. For if our cultivation is double, as indeed it is, then the rent of lands, the subsistence of working hands, the profits of the tradesmen supplying them with utensils, clothes, the value of horses employed, &c. must all be taken into the account. Besides this, we must add the freight (amounting to half the bounty), to make the idea of the advantages complete.\n\nSometimes bounties are given with a view to promote manufactures, as in the case of those made of silk. Many laws are to be found in our statute books in favour of the silk manufacture, made with great wisdom and propriety, for the encouragement and support of many thousands of industrious persons employed therein. By statute 8 Geo. I. cap. 15, \u00a7 1, a bounty was given on the due exportation of ribbons and stuffs, of silk only, of three shillings upon a pound weight; silk, and ribbons of silk, mixed with gold and silver, four shillings a-pound; on silk gloves, silk stockings, silk fringes, silk laces, and sewing silk, one shilling and threepence a-pound; on stuffs of silk and grommet yarn, eightpence a-pound; on silks mixed with inkle or cotton, one shilling; on stuffs of silk mixed with worsted, sixpence a-pound, for three years; and, from experience of their utility, these were continued by subsequent statutes.\n\nSometimes bounties are given to support a new manufacture against foreigners already in possession of it, as in making linen and fail-cloth. The promoting of the manufacture of British fail-cloth was undoubtedly a very important national object, as the consumption was very large, and of consequence the purchase of it from foreigners a heavy expense on the public. Many methods were therefore devised, and countenanced by law, both here and in Ireland, for introducing and encouraging our own in preference to that of strangers, more especially in the royal navy. By stat. 12 Anne, cap. 16, \u00a7 2, a bounty was given of one penny per ell on all that was exported for a term, and continued by subsequent statutes. By 4 Geo. II. cap. 27, \u00a7 4, an additional bounty of another penny an ell is granted. These bounties were to be paid out of an additional duty on imported fail-cloth. By the same statute every ship built in Britain, or in the plantations, is, under the penalty of 50l., to be furnished with a complete suit of fails of British manufacture. The amount of these bounties mark the progress of the manufacture, which is also affixed by the fund on which the payment is assigned.\n\nThe assistance, however, are never bestowed but on mature deliberation, in virtue of strong proofs, and with a moral certainty of a national benefit. The great intention of bounties is to place the British trader on such ground as to render his commerce beneficial to his country. In order to this, some profit must accrue to himself, otherwise he would not embark therein; but this, whatever it be, must prove inconsiderable in comparison of what results to the public. For if, by the help of such a bounty, one or many traders export to the value of 1000, 10,000, or 100,000 pounds worth of commodities or manufactures, whatever his or their profit or loss (for the latter, through avidity and overloading the market, sometimes happens) may be, the nation gains the 1000l., 10,000l., or 100,000l.; which was the object of the legislature in granting the bounty. Upon this consideration, that the entire produce of what is exported accrues to the nation, the legislature, when an alteration of circumstances required it, have made no scruple of augmenting a bounty; as in the case of refined sugar exported, from three to nine shillings per hundred weight. In like manner, the original bounty of one pound per ton in favour of vessels employed in the whale-fishing hath been doubled, and many new regulations made, in order to render this fishery more advantageous to the public. As a bounty is given on malt when allowed to be exported, so an equivalent of 30 shillings per ton hath been granted on all British made malt-spirits when exported, which is a common benefit to land, manufactures, and commerce.\n\nIt is indeed true, that on whatever account, or to whatever amount, this reward is given, the public seem to pay, and private persons seem to receive. But these private persons receive it as the hire from the public for performing a service which otherwise they would not perform, the benefit of which accrues to the public, and who can therefore very well afford to pay that reward in reality, which, as we have stated it, the on-\nly seems to do. For, looking a little closer, we cannot help observing, that the bounty is paid to individuals, who, as such, make a part of the public. But the commodities or manufactures exported are sold to foreigners, and the whole produce of them, be it what it will, comes into the purview of the public. By attending to this self-evident doctrine, every reasonable and public-spirited man will be easily reconciled to bounties; and the three following considerations will be sufficient to obviate the most common objections that have been made to the practice of giving them. 1. That no bounty can be desired but on the plea of national utility, which always deserves notice, and cannot be mistaken. It must likewise be alleged and proved, that this is the only means whereby the national benefit can be attained. 2. The sums issued on this account not only show the clear expense of the bounty, but also indicate the profit gained by the public; for as the one cannot exist without the other, that amount must be the incontestable index of both. 3. It must be remembered (and of this too some instances might be given), that if bounties should be improperly bestowed, they will of course prove ineffectual, and after a few fruitless trials will remain unclaimed, and consequently produce no expense. There is indeed another objection which hath been made against the giving of bounties. This is grounded on the frauds to which they are supposed to be liable; and particularly the relanding of the goods on which the bounty hath been paid, and thereby deceiving and cheating the public. But whoever peruses the laws made on this head, and attentively considers the numerous precautions taken to fix every circumstance relative to the obtaining the bounty, the checks on the shipping of goods, the securities taken for their due exportation, the certificates required to ascertain their being actually delivered and sold in a foreign market, must be convinced, that to discharge all those securities, in case of an intended fraud, is a thing very difficult, if not impossible.\n\nTo these remarks we may add, that bounties are usually granted only for a limited time, and then expire; are always liable to be suspended; and of course can never be the cause of any great national loss. There is no doubt that, exclusive of frauds, the immoderate thirst of gain may tempt interested men to aim at converting what was calculated for public benefit to its detriment, for their own private advantage. Thus, on a prospect of short crops in other countries, men may take measures within the letter, but directly against the spirit, of the law, to send so much of our corn abroad as to endanger a famine at home. For this the wisdom of parliament provides, not barely by suspending the bounty, but by prohibiting exportation and opening the ports for foreign supplies. We cannot with any shadow of justice ascribe scarcity to the bounty on the exportation. If this was the case, suspensions would be frequent, whereas there have been but five in a course of 70 years. If the bounty had any share, the larger the exportation, the greater would be the scarcity. In A.D. 1750 we exported more than one fifth of our growth of wheat, which was notwithstanding but at four shillings per bushel; whereas a century before, A.D. 1650, when we had neither bounty nor exportation, wheat was at nine shillings and sixpence per bushel. The causes of scarcity are unkindly fea-\n\nfons; which though human policy cannot prevent, yet their sad effects have been evidently lessened by our increased growth, since the taking place of bounty and exportation.\n\nQueen Anne's Bounty, for augmenting poor livings under 50l. per annum, confits of the produce of the first fruits and tenths, after the charges and pensions payable out of the same are defrayed.

See Augmentation.","sp":413,"ep":415},{"h":"BOURBON","t":"or Mascarenhas, Isle of, an island in the Indian ocean, lying on the east of Madagascar, in E. Long. 58\u00b0 30'. S. Lat. 21\u00b0 23'. This island has no port, and is in some places inaccessible. Its length and breadth have not been well determined; but the circumference, according to the account of a person who resided there some time, is about 57 leagues. It is for the most part mountainous, but in some places there are very beautiful and fertile plains. In the south part of the island there is a burning mountain, which has thrown out vast quantities of bitumen, sulphur, and other combustible materials; neither does it cease throwing them out still, so that the country about it is useless, and is called by the inhabitants pays br\u00fbl\u00e9, that is, burnt land. The shore is high and rocky all round; but though on this account it hath no ports, there are several good roads, particularly one on the west, and another on the north-east. As to its form, this island is irregular, so that it is difficult to judge from the maps whether it is round or long. The air is equally pleasant and wholesome, inasmuch that the people live to a great age without feeling either infirmities or diseases. This is occasioned by the hurricanes, of which they have one or two every year. These purge and cleanse the air so as to render it highly salubrious; the certainty of which is thus distinguished, that when they fail of making their annual visits, as sometimes they do, diseases and death find an entrance into the island, which otherwise would soon be overstocked with inhabitants. The climate is hot, but not to such a degree as might be expected from its situation, the breezes from the mountains being constant and very refreshing. The tops of these mountains are in winter covered with snow; which, melting in the summer, furnishes abundance of rivers and rivulets, with which the country is plentifully watered: so that the soil, though not very deep, is wonderfully fruitful, producing Turkey corn and rice twice a-year, and the latter in great abundance. Most sorts of cattle are found here, good in their kind, and are very cheap; wild goats and wild hogs are found in the woods and on the tops of the mountains; here also are vast quantities of wild fowl of different kinds, fish, and land tortoises, affording at once the most delicate and wholesome food. As to fruits, they have bananas, oranges, citrons, tamarinds, and other kinds; neither does it want valuable commodities, particularly ebony, cotton, white pepper, gum benzoin, aloes, and tobacco; all excellent in their kind, when compared with those of other countries. This island is also happy in its deficiencies; for no animals that are venomous are to be found therein, and only two sorts that are disagreeable to the sight, viz. spiders of the size of a pigeon's egg, which weave nets of a surprising strength, reckoned by some capable of being treated to as to become as valuable-\nluable as silk; and bats of a most enormous size, which are not only skinned and eaten, but esteemed also the greatest delicacy that they have.\n\nThe island of Bourbon was discovered by the Portuguese in 1545, as appears by a date inscribed by them upon a pillar when they first landed; but when the French settled in Madagascar, this island was totally desolate. Three Frenchmen being banished thither, and left there for three years, made such a report of it at their return as surprized their countrymen. They lived most of that time upon pork; and though they were in a manner naked, yet they affirmed that they never had the least pain or sickness whatever. This tempted one Anthony Taureau to go over thither in 1654, accompanied by seven French and six negroes, who carried with them the cattle from which the island has been stocked ever since. The first thing they did was to erect the arms of France, by order of M. Falcourt who was governor of Madagascar, and to bestow upon the island a new name. Then they set up huts, and laid out gardens, in which they cultivated melons, different sorts of roots, and tobacco; but just as the last became ripe, the whole plantation was destroyed by a hurricane. The French, however, went to work again; and having some acquaintance with the climate, succeeded better, and added aloes to the rest of their plantations; but receiving no succour from Madagascar, and being tired of living by themselves in the ille de Bourbon, they very readily embraced the offer of an English captain, and in the year 1658 embarked for Madras. When the last great blow was given to the French at Madagascar by the natives, who surprized and cut them off in one night, there escaped as many men as, with their wives, who were natives, filled two canoes; and these being driven by the wind on the ille de Bourbon, were the next set of people who inhabited it. This last colony, for want of an opportunity to remove, were constrained to cultivate this new country of theirs, and to remain in it. It was not long before a further stock of inhabitants arrived. A pirate that had been committing depredations in the Indies, returning to Europe, ran ashore and was split to pieces upon the rocks, so that the crew were forced to join themselves to the former inhabitants; and as they had on board their vessel a great many Indian women whom they had made prisoners, they lived with them, and in process of time had a numerous posterity. As East India ships touched frequently here, when too late to double the Cape, many of the sailors, for the sake of the women, deferred at the time of their departure, and staying behind became planters in the ille de Bourbon. As the place grew more populous, the people naturally became more civilized, and desirous of living in a more commodious manner; which induced them to build small vessels, that in these they might sometimes make a trip to Madagascar, in order to purchase slaves, whom they employed in their plantations to cultivate aloes, tobacco, and other things, with which they drove a small trade, when ships of any nation anchored in their roads for the sake of refreshments. In this situation they were, when the French East India company put in their claim; and assuming the property of the island, lent thither five or six families and a governor. At first the inhabitants expected to reap some benefit from their new masters; but finding very little, and thinking the governor took too much upon him, they revolted at the instigation of a priest, seized their governor and put him into a dungeon, where he died of hunger and grief. For this some of the ring-leaders were punished, a kind of fort was erected, some guns placed on it, and the French flag kept flying; but in other respects, so little care was taken, that till within these 40 years, the island was in no state of defense.\n\nThe number of inhabitants in the year 1717 was computed at 2000; viz. 900 free, and 1100 slaves. Amongst these people the usual distinction of whites and blacks entirely fails: for even the free are of different colours; and a French writer affirms us, that he saw in a church one family, consisting of five generations, of all complexions. The eldest was a female, 108 years of age, of a brown black, like the Indians of Madagascar; her daughter, a mulatto; her grand-daughter, a mestizo; her great-grand-daughter, of a dusky yellow; her daughter again, of an olive colour; and the daughter of this last, as fair as any English girl of the same age. These people are, generally speaking, of a gentle quiet disposition, very industrious, and submissive enough to authority, provided it is exercised with a tolerable degree of equity and decency; for otherwise the whole of them are apt to rise in rebellion at once; and the slaves have so little reason to complain of their masters, that they are always on the same side. The island is divided into four quarters. The first is that of St Paul, which is the largest and best peopled: their houses are built at the foot of a steep mountain, on both sides of a fresh water lake. As for the plantations, they are on the top of a mountain, which they ascend by a very rough and troublesome passage. On the summit there is a spacious plain, a great part of which is divided into plantations of rice, tobacco, corn, sugar, and fruits. The quarter of St Dennis lies seven leagues from that of St Paul, towards the east, and there the governor resides. It is not so well peopled as the former; but the country is more pleasant, and the situation better. At two leagues distance, proceeding along the sea-coast, is the quarter of St Mary's, which is but thinly peopled. The last and most fertile quarter is that of St Sannah, which is at the distance of four leagues from St Dennis. The road between these two quarters is tolerable, though part of it has been cut with much difficulty through a wood; but the passage from St Dennis to St Paul is only by sea.\n\nWhen the present company of India became, by their perpetual establishment, possessed of the island of Bourbon, they began to improve it exceedingly; raising new forts and batteries, so as to render it in a manner inaccessible; and importing coffee-trees from Arabia; which have succeeded so well, that it is believed they produce an eighth, according to some a fifth, part as much coffee as is raised in the kingdom of Yemen in Arabia, and it is likewise held next in goodness to that.\n\nIn 1763, the population amounted to 4627 white people, and 15,149 blacks; the cattle consisted of 8702 beefeves, 4084 sheep, 7405 goats, and 7619 hogs. Upon an extent of 125,909 acres of cultivated land, they gathered as much coffee as would feed their slaves, 1,135,000 pounds weight of corn, 844,100 pounds of rice,\nBourbon rice, 2,879,100 pounds of maize, and 2,535,100 pounds of coffee; which last the company bought up at about 3d. per pound.\n\nIn 1743, Admiral Bocawen appeared before this island with a British fleet; but found it well fortified both by nature and art, that he was obliged, after some cannonading to very little purpose, to pursue his voyage.\n\nBourbon, Nicholas, a famous Latin poet in the 16th century, was a native of Vendeuvre near Langres, and the son of a wealthy man who was master of several forges. Margaret de Valois appointed him preceptor to her daughter Jane d'Albert of Navarre, the mother of King Henry IV. At length he retired to Conde, where he had a benefice, and died about the year 1550. He wrote eight books of Epigrams; and a poem on the forge, which he has entitled Ferraria. He had great knowledge of antiquity and of the Greek language. Erasmus praises his Epigrams.\n\nBourbon, Nicholas, a celebrated Greek and Latin poet, was nephew of the preceding. He taught rhetoric in several colleges of Paris; and the cardinal de Perron caused him to be nominated professor of eloquence in the Royal College: he was also canon of Langres, and one of the 40 of the French academy. At length he retired to the fathers of the oratory, where he died in 1644, aged 70. He is esteemed one of the greatest Latin poets France has produced. His poems were printed at Paris in 1630.\n\nBourbon-Lancy, a town of France, in the department of Saone and Loire. It is remarkable for its castle and baths; and there is a large marble pavement, called the great bath, which is a work of the Romans. It is seated near the river Loire, in E. Long. 3\u00b0 46'. N.

(the last of the Valois race), whose brother Francis II. married Mary queen of Scots, and both died without issue. Louis XVI. was the 5th king of this family in succession. This family also mounted the throne of Spain in 1700, by Philip V., grandson to Louis XIV., which was the occasion of the long and bloody war that ended in the peace of Utrecht. A branch of the Spanish family likewise mounted the throne of the two Sicilies in 1734. These three branches, entered into a treaty offensive and defensive in 1761, which goes by the name of the family-complot.\n\nBourbonne-le-Bains, a town of France, in Champagne, and in the Bailligny, famous for its hot baths.

It abounds in corn, fruits, pastures, wood, game, and wine. Its principal town is Moulins; and the rivers are the Loire, the Allier, and the Cher.\n\nBourbourg, a town in French Flanders, whose fortifications are demolished.

Under Edward IV., our lord John was created a knight of the Bath, at the marriage of the duke of York second son of Edward IV., and was first known by quelling an insurrection in Cornwall and Devonshire, raised by Michael Joseph a blacksmith, in 1495, which recommended him to the favour of Henry VII. He was a captain of the pioneers at the siege of Therouanne, under Henry VIII., by whom he was made chancellor of the exchequer for life, lieutenant of Calais and the Marches, appointed to conduct the lady Mary the king's sister into France on her marriage with Louis XII., and had the extraordinary happiness of continuing in favour with Henry VIII. for the space of 18 years. He died at Calais in 1532, aged 63. He translated, by King Henry's command, Froissart's Chronicle; which was printed in 1523, by Richard Pynson, the scholar of Caxton, and the fifth on the list of English printers. His other works were a whimsical medley of translations from French, Spanish, and Italian novels, which seem to have been the mode then, as they were afterwards in the reign of Charles II. These were: The Life of Sir Arthur, an Armorican knight; The famous exploits of Sir Hugh Bourdeaux; Marcus Aurelius; and, The cattle of love. He composed also a book of the duties of the inhabitants of Calais; and a comedy entitled Ite in Vineam, which is mentioned in none of our catalogues of English plays. Anthony Wood says it was usually acted at Calais after vespers.\n\nBourdaloue, Lewis, a celebrated preacher among the Jesuits, and one of the greatest orators France has produced, was born at Bourges on the 20th of August 1632. After having preached at Provence, he in 1669 went to Paris; and there met with such applause, that the king resolved to hear him; on which he was sent for to court, and frequently preached before Louis XIV. He afflicted the sick, visited the prisoners and hospitals, and was very liberal in giving alms. He died at Paris on the 13th of May 1704. The best edition of his sermons is in octavo.\n\nBordeaux, an ancient, large, handsome, and rich town of France, in the department of Gironde, is the capital of Guienne, and an archbishop's see; has an university and an academy of arts and sciences. It is built in the form of a bow, of which the river Garonne is the string. This river is bordered by a large quay, and the water rises four yards at full tide, for which reason the largest vessels can come up to it very readily. The castle called the Trompe is seated at the entrance of the quay, and the river runs round its walls. Most of the great streets lead to the quay. The town has 12 gates; and near another castle are fine walks under several rows of trees. The ancient city of Bordeaux, though considerable in point of size, was ill built, badly paved, dangerous, without policy or any of those municipal regulations indispensably requisite to render a city splendid or elegant. It has entirely changed its appearance within these last thirty years. The public edifices are very noble, and all the streets newly built are regular and handsome. The quays are...\nfour miles in length, and the river itself is considerably broader than the Thames at London bridge. On the opposite side, a range of hills covered with woods, vineyards, churches, and villas, extends beyond the view. Almost in the centre of the town is a fine equestrian statue in bronze erected to Louis XV. in 1743, with the following inscription:\n\nLudovicus quindecimus\nSepe victori, semper pacificatoris;\nSuos omnes, quam lat\u00e8 regnum patet,\nPaterno pectori gerentis;\nSuorum in animis penitus habitanit.\n\nThe beauty of the river Garonne, and the fertility of the adjoining country, were probably the causes which induced the Romans to lay the foundations of this city. The ruins of a very large amphitheatre yet remain, constructed under the emperor Gallienus; it is of brick, as are most of the edifices of that period, when the empire was verging to its fall, and the arts began rapidly to decline. During the irruptions of the barbarous nations, and particularly in those which the Normans repeatedly made, Bordeaux was ravaged, burnt, and almost entirely destroyed. It only began to recover again under Henry II. of England, who having united it to the crown by his marriage with Eleanor of Aquitaine, rebuilt it, and made it a principal object of his policy to restore the city again to the lustre from which it had fallen. The Black Prince received all Guienne, Gascony, and many inferior provinces, in full sovereignty from his father Edward III. He brought his royal captive, John king of France, to this city, after the battle of Poictiers in 1356; and held his court and residence here during eleven years. His exalted character, his uninterrupted feats of good fortune, his victories, his modesty, his affability, and his munificence, drew strangers to Bordeaux from every part of Europe; but all this splendour soon disappeared. He lived to experience the ingratitude of Peter the Cruel, to whom he had restored the kingdom of Castile; he became a prey to distempers in the vigour of life; he saw his dominions reunited again in many of their branches to the crown of France, by Charles V.; he lost his eldest son Edward, a prince of the highest expectations; and at length, overcome with sorrow at this last affliction, he quitted Bordeaux, and re-embarked for England, there to expire a memorable example of the hasty revolution of human greatness! In 1453, Charles VII. king of France, re-entered the city, and subjected the whole province of Guienne, which had been near three centuries under the English government. Conscious of the importance of such a conquest, he ordered the Chateau Trompette to be built to defend the passage of the river; and Louis the XIV. afterwards employed the celebrated Vauban to erect a new fortress in the modern style of military architecture, on the same spot.\u2014Madame de Maintenon, whom fortune seemed to have chosen as the object of her extreme rigour and extreme bounty, was removed from the prisons of Niort in Poitou, where she was born, with her father the Baron d'Aubigne, to this castle, where she used to play with the daughter of the turnkey, in the greatest indigence. Bourdeaux prefers few remains of antiquity. The cathedral appears to be very old, and has suffered considerably from the effects of time. The unfortunate duke of Guienne, brother to Bourdelet Louis the XI. who was poisoned in 1473, lies buried before the high altar. The adjacent country, more particularly the Pays de Medoc, which produces the finest claret, is exceedingly pleasant, and at the season of the vintage forms one of the most delicious landscapes in the world.

He once laid a wager with a friend, that he should paint 12 heads after the life, and as big as the life, in one day. He won it; and these are said not to be the worst things he ever did. His most considerable pieces are, The gallery of M. de Bretonvilliers, in the aisle of Notre Dame; and, The seven works of mercy, which he etched by himself. But the most esteemed of all his performances is, The martyrdom of St Peter, drawn for the church of Notre Dame; It is kept as one of the choicest rarities of that cathedral. Bourdon was a Calvinist; much valued and respected, however, in a Popish country, because his life and manners were good. We have also by this master a great number of etchings; which are executed in a bold masterly style, and much more finished than those we generally meet with from the point of the painter.

It stands upon a great deal of ground; but one part of it is without houses; and the rest is but thinly peopled with gentlemen, students, and ecclesiastics, the whole number of souls amounting only to about 1800. They have no manner of trade but for their own necessaries. It is divided into the old and new town. The walls of the old are almost entire, and the new town is almost as large as the old. There are several churches, convents, and nunneries. The parish-church, dedicated to St Stephen, is a fine old Gothic structure: it is seated in the highest part of the city, and on each side of the front are two handsome high towers.

There are four mineral springs at Apoigny, Primeau, Bourbon-Lancy, and St Reine. The first are obscure, and the two last in high reputation. In the canton of Brefle, there are two subterranean lakes which often overflow in times of the greatest drought, and lay a large tract of ground under water: one of them has no apparent spring or opening; and yet in a dry season, it throws out water enough to overflow the meadow-land near it. The grottoes or caves of Arcy are seated about 18 miles from Auxerre, and over them is foil about 10 feet deep. The entrance into these cavities is 200 paces long, but narrow.

These conjunctions of tents, they called burgi; and they were to them what towns are to us. Sidonius Apollinaris tells us, that they wore long hair, took great pleasure in singing, and were fond of praise for their vocal talents. He adds, that they ate great quantities; and anointed their hair with butter, deeming that unction very ornamental. Their crown was at first elective, and the authority of their kings expired with their successors. They were not only accountable for their own misconduct, but likewise for the calamities of nature, and the caprice of fortune.

They were not more favourably treated in case of a bad harvest or vintage, or if any epidemical distemper had ravaged the state. At first they were governed by many kings, and benden was the title of the royal dignity. But in latter times they were subject to one sovereign; and they grew humane and civilized, especially when Christianity was propagated in their country.

From her childhood to her old age she had an extraordinary turn of mind. She set up for a reformer, and published a great number of books filled with very singular notions; the most remarkable of which are entitled The light of the World, and the testimony of Truth. She was an enemy to reason and common sense, which she maintained ought to give place to the illumination of divine faith; and affected, that whenever any one was born again by embracing her doctrine, he felt the pains and throws of a woman in labour. Of her pretended visions and revelations we shall give one instance as a sample. In one of her ecstasies she saw Adam in the same form in which he appeared before his fall, and the manner in which he was capable of procreating other men, since he himself possessed in himself the principles of both sexes*. Nay the pretended it was told her that he had carried this procreating faculty so far as to produce the human nature of Jesus Christ. \"The first man (says she), whom Adam brought forth without any concurrent assistance in his glorified state, was chosen by God to be the throne of the Divinity; the organ and instrument by which God would communicate himself externally to men: This is Chiff the first born united to human nature, both God and man.\" Besides these and such like extravagancies, she had other forbidding qualities: her temper was morose and peevish, and was the extremely avaricious and greedy of amassing riches.

It is also called the long-bow, by way of distinction from the cross-bow or arbalist.\n\nThe bow is the most ancient, and the most universal of\nof all weapons. It has been found to obtain among the most barbarous and remote people, and who had the least communication with the rest of mankind.\n\nThe use of the bow and arrow was first abolished in France under Louis XII. in 1481, and in their place were introduced the Swiss arms, that is, the halberd, pike, and broadsword. The long-bow was formerly in great vogue in England; most of our victories in France were acquired by it; and many laws were made to regulate and encourage its use. The parliament under Henry VIII. complain \"of the disuse of the long-bow, heretofore the safeguard and defence of this kingdom, and the dread and terror of its enemies.\" 33 Hen. VIII. cap. 6.\n\nThe art of using bows is called archery, and those practised therein, archers, or bowmen. See Archery.\n\nThe strength of a bow may be calculated on this principle, that its spring, i.e., the power whereby it restores itself on its natural position, is always proportionate to the distance or space it is removed therefrom.\n\nThe most barbarous nations often excel in the fabric of the particular things which they have the greatest necessity for in the common offices of life. The Laplanders, who support themselves almost entirely by hunting, have an art of making bows, which we, in these improved parts of the world, have never arrived at. Their bow is made of two pieces of tough and strong wood, shaved down to the same size, and flattened on each side; the two flat sides of the pieces are brought closely and evenly together, and then joined by means of a glue made of the skins of perch, which they have in great plenty, and of which they make a glue superior in strength to any which we have. The two pieces, when once united in this manner, will never separate, and the bow is of much more force to expel the arrow, than it could possibly have been under the same dimensions if made of only one piece.\n\nAmong the ancients, the bow-string, called \u03c4\u03b5\u03be\u03af\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, was made of horse's hair, and hence also called \u03b9\u03c7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1; though Homer's bow-strings are frequently made of hides cut into small thongs; whence \u03c4\u03b5\u03be\u03af\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2. The uppermost part of the bow, to which the string was fastened, was called \u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7, being commonly made of gold, and the last thing towards finishing the bow. The Grecian bows were frequently beautified with gold or silver; whence we have mention of aurei arcus; and Apollo is called \u1f08\u03c1\u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2. But the matter of which they were ordinarily composed, seems to have been wood; though they were anciently, Scythian-like, made of horn, as appears from that of Pandarus in Homer, Iliad. 2. v. 105.\n\nThe invention of the bow is usually ascribed to Apollo, and was communicated to the primitive inhabitants of Crete, who are said to have been the first of mortals who undertook the use of bows and arrows. And hence, even in later ages, the Cretan bows were famous, and preferred by the Greeks to all others. Some, however, rather choose to honour Perseus, the son of Perleus, with the invention of the bow; while others ascribe it to Scythes, son of Jupiter, and progenitor to the Scythians, who were excellent at this art, and by many reputed the first masters of it. From them it was derived to the Grecians, some of whose ancient nobility were instructed by the Scythians in the use of the bow, which in those days passed for a most princely education. It was first introduced into the Roman army in the second Punic war.\n\nThe Indians still retain the bow. In the repository of the Royal Society we see a West Indian bow two yards long.\n\nThe Scythian bow was famous for its incurvation, which distinguished it from the bows of Greece and other nations; being so great as to form an half moon or semicircle; whence the shepherd in Athenaeus, being to describe the letters in Theseus's name, and expressing each of them by some apposite resemblance, compares the third to the Scythian bow; meaning not the more modern character \u03a3, but the ancient \u039a, which is semicircular, and bears the third place in \u0398\u0397\u03a3\u0395\u03a5\u03a3.\n\nGros-Bow, is also called arbalest or arbaltes; which word is derived from arbaliata, e.i. arcubalista, \"a bow with a fling.\" The arbalest consists of a steel bow, let in a shaft of wood, furnished with a string and a trigger; and is bent with a piece of iron fitted for that purpose. It serves to throw bullets, large arrows, darts, &c. The ancients had large machines for throwing many arrows at once, called arbalests or barbette.\n\nBow, is also an instrument used at sea, for taking the gun's altitude; consisting of a large arch of 90\u00b0 graduated, a thank or staff, a side vane, a sight vane, and an horizon vane. It is now out of use.\n\nBow, among builders, a beam of wood or brass, with three long screws that direct a lathe of wood or steel to any arch; chiefly used in drawing draughts of ships and projections of the sphere, or wherever it is requisite to draw large arches.\n\nBow, in Music, a small machine, which, being drawn over the strings of a musical instrument, makes it resound. It is composed of a small stick, to which are fastened 80 or 100 horse hairs, and a screw which serves to give these hairs a proper tension. In order that the bow may touch the strings briskly, it is usual to rub the hairs with rosin. The ancients do not appear to have been acquainted with bows of hair: in lieu thereof they touched their instruments with a plectrum; over which our bows have great advantage, for giving long and short sounds, and other modifications which a plectrum cannot produce.\n\nBow, among artificers, an instrument so called from its figure; in use among gunsmiths, locksmiths, watchmakers, &c., for making a drill go. Among turners it is the name of that pole fixed to the ceiling, to which they fasten the cord that whirls round the piece to be turned.\n\nBow, a town of Devonshire in England, 188 miles west from London, and a little to the west of Crediton, has a weekly market, and two fairs in the year. The court of the duchy of Lancaster is commonly kept here.\n\nBows of a Saddle, are two pieces of wood laid archwise to receive the upper part of a horse's back, to give the saddle its due form, and to keep it tight.\n\nThe fore-bow which sustains the pommel, is composed of the withers, the breasts, the points or toes, and the coking.\n\nThe hind-bow bears the torsequin or quilted roll. The bows are covered with finewax, that is, with bulls pizzles beaten, and so run all over the bows to make them stronger. Then they are strengthened with bands\nBow\n\nof iron to keep them tight: and on the lower side are nailed on the saddle-straps, with which they make fast the girths.\n\nBow, Epaule, in Ship building, the rounding part of a ship's side forward, beginning at the place where the planks arch inwards; and terminated where they close, at the stem or prow. It is proved by a variety of experiments, that a ship with a narrow bow is much better calculated for sailing swiftly, than one with a broad bow; but is not so well fitted for a high sea, into which she always pitches or plunges her fore-part very deep, for want of sufficient breadth to repel the volume of water which she so easily divides in her fall. The former of these is called by seamen a lean, and the other a bluff bow. \"The bow which meets with the least resistance in a direct course, not only meets with the least resistance in oblique courses, but also has the additional property of driving the least to leeward; which is a double advantage gained by forming the bow so as to give it that figure which will be least resisted in moving through any medium.\"\n\nOn the Bow, in Navigation, an arch of the horizon comprehended between some distant object and that point of the compass which is right a-head, or to which the ship's stern is directed. This phrase is equally applicable when the object is beheld from the ship, or discovered by trigonometrical calculation: As, We saw a fleet at day-break bearing three points on the starboard-bow: that is, three points from that part of the horizon which is right a-head, towards the right-hand. See the article Bearing.\n\nBow-dye, a kind of scarlet red, superior to madder; but inferior to the true scarlet grain for fixedness and duration. It was brought into England, and first practised at the village of Bow, near London, by Kephler, a Dutchman, in the year 1643.\n\nBow grace, in the sea language, a frame or composition of old ropes or junks of cables, used to be laid out at the bows, stems, and sides of ships, to preserve them from great flukes of ice, chiefly when they fail in high north or south latitudes.\n\nBow-net, or Bow-wheel, an engine for catching fish, chiefly lobsters and craw-fish, made of two round wicker baskets, pointed at the end, one of which is thrust into the other; at the mouth is a little rim, four or five inches broad, somewhat bent inwards. It is also used for catching sparrows.\n\nBow-legged, or Bandy-legged. Some children are bow-legged from their birth; others become so from setting them on their feet too early. The tibia of some is crooked; the knees of others are distorted; from a fault in the ankle, the feet of some are turned inwards. These are called varus; and in others, who are called valgus, they are turned outwards. The best method of preventing these disorders in weakly children is to exercise them duly, but not violently, by dancing or toying them about in one's arms; and not setting them much upon their feet, at least not without properly supporting them: if the disorder attends at the birth, or increases after it is begun, apply emollients, then apply boots of strong leather, wood, &c. so as gradually to dispose the crooked legs to a proper form; or other instruments may be used instead of boots, which, when not too costly, are usually to be preferred.\n\nSlighter instances of these disorders yield to careful nursing, without instruments.\n\nBow Line, or Bowling, a rope fastened near the middle of the leech, or perpendicular edge of the square sails, by three or four subordinate parts called bridles. It is only used when the wind is so unfavourable that the sails must be all braced sideways, or close hauled to the wind: in this situation the bow-lines are employed to keep the weather or windward edges of the principal sails tight, forward, and steady, without which they would always be shivering, and rendered incapable of service. To check the bow-line is to slacken it, when the wind becomes large.\n\nBow Pieces, are the pieces of ordnance at the bow of a ship.\n\nRain-Bow.

His father, whose name also was William, had been eminent in the same profession; and his maternal grandfather (Isaac Dawes) was employed in printing the celebrated Polyglott bible of Bishop Walton. At a proper age, he was placed for grammatical education under the care of Mr Ambrose Bonwicke, a nonjuring clergyman of known piety and learning, who then lived at Headly, near Leatherhead in Surrey. Here Mr Bowyer made great advances in literature, and a firm attachment commenced between him and his master. On the 30th of January 1713, the whole property of the elder Mr Bowyer was destroyed by fire; on which occasion Mr Bonwicke generously undertook the education of his pupil for one year. In 1716, young Mr Bowyer was admitted a fellow at St John's college, Cambridge, where Dr Robert Jenkin was at that time master. He continued at the college of Cambridge under the tuition of the reverend Dr John Newcomb till June 1722, during which period he probably took his degree of bachelor of arts; and it appears that he was desirous of obtaining a fellowship, though it is not certain that he ever stood a candidate for that honour. Soon after this he had an opportunity of repaying the kindness which Mr Bonwicke had shown him, by officiating some time after his death in the capacity of a schoolmaster for the benefit of his family.\n\nMr Bowyer now entered into the printing business along with his father. One of the first books which received the benefit of his correction was the complete edition of Selden in three volumes folio by Dr David Wilkins. This edition was begun in 1722, and finished in 1726; and Mr Bowyer's great attention to it appeared in his drawing up an epitome of Selden de Synedris, as he read the proof-sheets. In 1727, he drew up an excellent sketch of William Baxter's Glossary of the Roman Antiquities. This was called \"A view of a book entitled Reliquia Baxteriana.\" In a letter to a friend. A single sheet 8vo. By this first public proof of Mr Bowyer's abilities, Dr Wotton and Mr Clarke were highly pleased; but as it was never published, and very few copies printed, it is very seldom found with the glossary. In 1727 Mr Bowyer lost his mother; on which occasion he received a letter of consolation from Mr Chishull the learned editor of the Antiquitates Anglicanae. In October 1728 he married Miss Ann Prudom, his mother's niece, a very accomplished lady, by whom he had two sons, William and Thomas; the former of whom died an infant, and the latter survived his father. In 1729 Mr Bowyer published a curious treatise, entitled, \"A Pattern for young Students in the University; set forth in the Life of Ambrose Bonwicke, sometime scholar of St John's College, Cambridge:\" but though this treatise was generally ascribed to Mr Bowyer, it was in reality the production of Mr Ambrose Bonwicke the elder. About this time it appears, that Mr Bowyer had written a pamphlet against the Separatists, though neither the title nor the occasion of it are now remembered. The same year, through the friendship of the Right Hon. Arthur Onslow, he was appointed printer of the votes of the house of commons; which office he held, under three successive speakers, for near fifty years. In 1731 Mr Bowyer published, and, it is believed, translated Voltaire's Life of Charles XII. This year also his wife died; on which occasion his friends Mr Clarke and Mr Chishull wrote him very affectionate and Christian letters. He remained a widower till 1747, when he married a very benevolent and worthy woman, Mrs Elizabeth Bill, by whom he had no children. In 1733 he published a piece in two sheets 4to, entitled, \"The Beau and the Academic;\" being a translation from a Latin poem recited that year at the Sheldonian theatre; and in 1736 he was admitted into the Society of Antiquarians, where he became an active and useful member. In 1737 Mr Bowyer lost his father; and on this occasion Mr Clarke again addressed to him a letter of consolation. In 1742 our author published a translation of Trapp's Latin Lectures on Poetry, in which he was assisted by Mr Clarke, though the latter had a contemptible opinion of the performance.\n\nIn 1749, Mr Bowyer, along with Dr Burton, was virulently attacked by Dr King in a piece entitled Elogium famae inferiens Jacobi Ettenensis five Gigantis: or, \"The praises of Jack Eaton, commonly called Jack the Giant.\"\u2014This abuse was probably occasioned by Mr Bowyer's having hinted in conversation some doubts concerning the Doctor's skill in Latin. Our author drew up some strictures in his own defence, which he intended to insert at the conclusion of a preface to Montesquieu's Reflections; but by Dr Clarke's advice, they\nthey were omitted. In 1750, a prefatory critical dil-\nferation and some notes were annexed by our author\nto Kutter's Treatise De usu verborum mediorum; a\nnew edition of which, with farther improvements, ap-\npeared in 1773. He wrote likewise about the same\ntime a Latin preface to Leedes's Veteres poetarum,\n&c.\u2014Being soon after employed to print an edition\nof Col. Bladen's translation of Caesar's Commentaries,\nthat work received considerable improvements from Mr\nBowyer's hands, with the addition of such notes in it\nas are signed Tyrocr. In the subsequent editions of\nthis work, though printed by another person during our\nauthor's lifetime, the same signature, though contrary\nto decorum, and even to justice, was still retained. In\n1751, he wrote a long preface to Montefiore's \"Re-\nflections on the rise and fall of the Roman Empire;\"\ntranslated the dialogue between Sylla and Socrates;\nmade several corrections to the work from the Baron's\n\" Spirit of Laws;\" and improved it with his own\nnotes. A new edition, with many new notes, was\nprinted in 1759. In 1751 he also published the first\ntranslation that ever was made of Rousseau's paradoxi-\ncal oration, which gained the prize at the academy of\nDijon in 1750; and which first announced that singular\ngenius to the attention and admiration of Europe.\nOn the publication of the third edition of Lord Orrery's\n\" Remarks on the Life and Writings of Dr Swift,\" in\n1752, Mr Bowyer wrote and printed, but never pub-\nlished, \"Two Letters from Dr Bentley in the Shades\nbelow, to Lord Orrery in a Land of thick darkness.\"\nThe notes signed B, in the ninth quarto volume of\nSwift's works, are extracted from these letters. In\n1753, he endeavoured to allay the ferment occasioned\nby the Jew bill; with which view he published, in\nquarto, \"Remarks on the speech made in common-\ncouncil, on the bill for permitting persons professing\nthe Jewish religion to be naturalized, so far as proph-\necies are supposed to be affected by it.\" This little tract\nwas written with spirit, and well received by those who\nwere superior to narrow prejudices. Its design was to\nshow, that whatever political reasons might be alleged\nagainst the bill, Christianity was in no danger of being\nprejudiced by the intended protection promised to the\nJews. The same year some of Mr Bowyer's notes\nwere annexed to Bishop Clatton's translation of \"A\nJournal from Grand Cairo to Mount Sinai and back\nagain.\"\u2014In 1754, Mr Bowyer, with a view of lessening\nhis fatigue, entered into partnership with a relation;\nbut some disagreement arising, the connection\nwas dissolved in three years. On the death of Mr\nRichardson in 1761, Mr Bowyer succeeded him as\nprinter to the Royal Society, through the favour of\nthe late Earl of Macclesfield; and, under the friend-\nship of five successive presidents, enjoyed that office till\nhis death.\n\nIn 1763, Mr Bowyer published an excellent edition\nof the Greek Testament, in two vols. 12mo. It ap-\npeared under the following title: Novum Testamentum\nGraecum; ad fidem Graecorum folum Codicum MSS.\nnunc primum impressum, adiungantur Joanne Jacobo\nWeiffenius, justa Selectione Jo. Alberti Bengelii divulgata;\net nova interpretatione sapientium illustrata. Accedere in\naltero volumine, Emendationes conjecturales virorum doc-\ntorum undecunque collectae. This fold with great rapid-\nity; the Conjectural Emendations were well received\nby the learned, and are thought to be a valuable work.\nThe president and fellows of Harvard college in Cam-\nbridge expressed their approbation of this edition in\nvery high terms. In a letter to Mr Bowyer, written\nin the year 1767, \"This work (say they), though\nsmall in bulk, we esteem as a rich treasure of sacred\nlearning, and of more value than many large volumes\nof the commentators.\" A second edition of the Con-\njectures on the New Testament, with very considerable\nenlargements, was separately published, in one vol. 8vo,\nin 1772. Bishop Warburton having censured a pas-\nsage in the former edition, Mr Bowyer sent him a copy\nof this book, with a conciliatory letter. Dr War-\nburton's Divine Legation had received very consider-\nable advantage from Mr Bowyer's corrections; and\nthis even in an edition which was necessarily given to\nanother press. In 1761 he was employed to print his\nLordship's Doctrine of Grace. A second edition be-\ning soon wanted, and Mr Bowyer not having been in-\ntrusted with the care of it, he prepared a series of let-\nters to the bishop in his own defence; of which, to-\ngether with a few he had formerly received from that\ngreat writer, he afterwards printed twelve copies, of\nwhich ten have since been destroyed. However, there\nis the best authority for asserting, that notwithstanding\nany little alterations which happened, Dr War-\nburton always retained a sincere regard for our au-\nthor. In 1765, at the request of Thomas Hollis,\nEsq., Mr Bowyer wrote a short Latin preface to Dr\nWallis's Grammatica Linguae Anglicane. He wrote\nalso a large English preface for the same work, which,\nhowever, still remains unprinted. In 1766 he entered\ninto partnership with Mr Nichols, who had been train-\ned by him to the profession, and had for several years\nassisted him in the management of his business. The\nsame year, Mr Bowyer wrote an excellent Latin pre-\nface to Joannis Harduii, Jesuitae, ad Centuram Scrip-\nturae veterum Prologomena. Juxta Autographum. In\n1767 he was appointed to print the journals of the\nhouse of lords and the rolls of parliament. This\nyear he printed Mr Clarke's excellent and learned\nwork on \"The Connection of the Roman, Saxon, and\nEnglish Coins;\" and wrote some notes upon it, which\nare interspersed throughout the volume with those of\nthe author. Part of the Dissertation on the Roman\nleprechaun was likewise Mr Bowyer's production; and\nthe index, which is an uncommonly good one, was\ndrawn up by him entirely.\n\nIn January 1771 Mr Bowyer lost his second wife,\nand again received a letter of consolation from his old\nfriend Mr Clarke, who had sent him one almost forty\nyears before on a similar occasion. In the Philoso-\nphical Transactions for this year was printed a very inge-\nnious \"Inquiry into the Value of the ancient Greek\nand Roman Money,\" by the late Matthew Raper,\nEsq. But his opinions not coinciding with those of\nMr Bowyer, he printed a small pamphlet, entitled,\n\"Remarks, occasioned by a late Dissertation on the\nGreek and Roman money.\" In 1773 three little tracts\nwere published by him, under the title of \"Se-\nlect Discourses. 1. Of the correspondence of the He-\nbrew months with the Julian, from the Latin of Pro-\nfessor Michaelis. 2. Of the Sabbatical years, from the\nsame. 3. Of the years of jubilee, from an anonymous\nwriter in Mason's Histoire Critique de la Republique\nBowyers, des Lettres.\" In 1774 he corrected a new edition of Schrevelius's Greek Lexicon; to which he has added a number of words, distinguished by an asterisk, which he himself had collected in the course of his studies. Considerable additions, still in manuscript, were made by him to the lexicons of Hederic and Buxtorf, the Latin ones of Faber and Littleton, and the English Dictionary of Bailey; and he left behind him many other proofs of his critical skill in the learned languages. In 1774 was published, \"The Origin of Printing,\" in two essays. 1. The substance of Dr Middleton's Dissertation on the Origin of Printing in England. 2. Mr Meereman's Account of the Invention of the Art at Haarlem, and its progress to Mentz, with occasional Remarks, and an Appendix.\" The original idea of this valuable tract was Mr Bowyer's, but it was completed by Mr Nichols.\n\nAlthough our author, during the last ten years of his life, had been afflicted with the palsy and stone, he not only preserved a remarkable cheerfulness of temper, but was enabled to support the labour of almost incessant reading; and he regularly corrected the learned works, especially the Greek books, which came from his press. This he continued to do till within a few weeks of his death, which happened in November 1777, when he had nearly completed his 78th year. For more than half a century Mr Bowyer was unrivalled as a learned printer; and many of the most masterly productions of this kingdom have come from his press. To his literary and professional abilities he added an excellent moral character; and he was particularly distinguished by his inflexible probity, and an uncommon alacrity in relieving the necessitous.","sp":423,"ep":425},{"h":"BOWYERS","t":"artificers whose business is to make bows: in which sense, bowyers stand distinguished from fletchers, who make arrows.\n\nThe bowyers company in London was incorporated in 1622: and consists of a master, two wardens, twelve assistants, and 30 on the livery.

It was placed immovable in the middle of the table, being perforated or open at both ends, and likewise channelled within; over the top was placed a kind of funnel, into which the dice were cast out upon the fritillus; whence descending, they fell through the bottom on the table; by which all practising on them with the fingers was effectually prevented. For want of some contrivance of this kind, our sharpers have opportunities of playing divers tricks with the box, as palming, topping, flabbing, &c.\n\nBox, is also used for an uncertain quantity or measure: thus a box of quicksilver contains from one to two hundred weight; a box of prunellas only 14 pounds; a box of rings for keys, two groats, &c.\n\nBox-Tree.

The strange disfigurements these boxers underwent were such that they frequently could not be known, and rendered them the subject of many railleries.

When the champions had \u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9, or balls, whether of lead or stone, it was properly denominated \u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2. The ancient boxing differed from the pugna caelum, in which the combatants had leathern thongs on their hands, and balls to offend their antagonists; though this distinction is frequently overlooked, and fighting with the caelus ranked as a part of the bufines of pugiles. We may distinguish three species of boxing; viz. where both the head and hands were naked; where the hands were armed and the head naked; and where the head was covered with a kind of cap, called amphiodes, and the hands also furnished with the caelus.\n\nBoxing is an ancient exercise, having been in use in the heroic ages. Those who prepared themselves for it, used all the means that could be contrived to render themselves fat and fleshy, that they might be better able to endure blows: whence corpulent men or women were usually called pugiles, according to Terence: Siqua efl habitoor paulo, pugilem efse aiunt.\n\nIn modern times this art has been in a manner appropriated by the English. About half a century ago it formed as regular an exhibition as we now see at any of the places of public amusement, the theatres alone excepted. It was encouraged by the first ranks of the nobility, patronized by the first subjects in the realm, and tolerated by the magistrates. Before the establishment of Broughton's amphitheatre, a booth was erected at Tottenham Court, in which the proprietor, Mr George Taylor, invited the professors of the art to display their skill, and the public to be present at its exhibition. The bruisers then had the reward due to their prowess, in a division of the entrance-money, which sometimes was 100l. or 150l. The general mode of sharing was for two thirds to go to the winning champion, while the remaining third was the right of the loser; though sometimes by an express agreement of the parties, the conqueror and the vanquished shared alike. The nobility and gentry having complained of the inconveniences sustained at Taylor's Booth, prevailed on Mr Broughton, who was then...\nthen rising into note as the first builder in London, to build a place better adapted for such exhibitions. This was accordingly done in 1742, principally by subscription, behind Oxford-road. The building was called Broughton's New Amphitheatre; and, besides the stage for the combatants, had seats corresponding to the boxes, pit, and galleries, much in the same manner with those at Astley's. After a course of years, however, these exhibitions became gradually less patronized and frequented, owing probably to the refinement of our manners.

He was born in Galloway on the 13th of January 1562, and came into the world with teeth. He learned the rudiments of the Latin and Greek languages at Glasgow under two grammarians; but was of so high and untractable a spirit, that they despaired of ever making him a scholar. Having quarrelled with his masters, he beat them both, burnt his books, and forswore learning. While he was yet a youth, he followed the court, and did his utmost to push his interest there; but the fervour of his temper soon precipitated him into quarrels, from which he came off with honour and safety, though frequently at the hazard of his life. He, with the approbation of his friends, went to serve in the French army, and carried his little patrimony with him, which he soon dissipated at play. He was shortly after routed by that emulation which is natural to great minds, and applied himself to letters with unremitting ardour, till he became one of the most consummate scholars of his age. He is said to have translated Caesar's Commentaries into Greek in the style of Herodotus, and to have written many Latin poems which were little inferior to the first productions of the Augustan age. He also left several manuscripts on philological, political, and historical subjects, in Latin and French, which languages were as familiar to him as his native tongue. He could with facility dictate to three amanuenses at the same time, in different languages, and on different subjects. He was also one of the best Scottish poets of the age. To all this we must add, that his personal beauty and accomplishments were equal to his mental superiority. He died at Pinkhill in Scotland, in 1601.

He was for many years concerned in a newspaper called the Post-boy, of which he had the principal management. He likewise published a monthly work entitled the Political State of Great Britain. He wrote a life of Queen Anne in folio, which is esteemed a very good chronicle of that period of the English history. But what has rendered him the most known, and has most firmly established his reputation, are the excellent Dictionary and Grammar of the French language, which he compiled, and which are still reckoned the best in their kind. He also wrote, or rather translated from the French of M. de Racine, the tragedy of Iphigenia, which he published under the title of The Victim. It was performed with success at the theatre of Drury-lane, and is far from being a bad play. Nor can there perhaps be a stronger instance of the abilities of its author, than success in such an attempt; since writing with any degree of correctness or elegance, even in prose, in a foreign language, is an excellence not very frequently attained; but to proceed so far in the perfection of it as to be even tolerable in poetry, and more especially in that of the drama, in which the diction and manner of expression require a peculiar dignity and force, and in a language so difficult to attain the perfect command of as the English, is what has been very seldom accomplished.

He studied at Bennet college, Cambridge, and afterwards became a student in the Middle Temple. Having lost his father and mother, and being unable to support himself in the prosecution of his studies, he became clerk to Sir Richard Manhood, one of the chief barons of the exchequer; but finding that by his employment he could not improve his fortune, he went to Ireland in 1588, with fewer pounds in his pocket than he afterwards acquired thousands a-year. He was then about 22, had a graceful person, and many accomplishments, which enabled him to render himself useful to several of the principal persons employed in the government, by drawing up for them memorials, cases, and answers. In 1595, he married Joan the daughter and coheiress of William Anley, who had fallen in love with him; and the dying in 1599 in labour of her first child, which was stillborn, left him an estate of 500l. a year in land. In consequence of various services, and the great abilities he displayed, he gradually rose to the highest offices, and even to the dignity of the peerage of Ireland; to which he was raised by King James I. on the 29th of September 1616, by the style and title of baron of Toughton, in the county of Cork: four years after, he was created Viscount Dungarvan and earl of Cork; and in 1631 was made lord treasurer of Ireland, an honour that was made hereditary to his family. He particularly distinguished himself by the noble stand he made, when the fatal rebellion broke out in that kingdom, in the reign of Charles I.; and in his old age acted with as much bravery and military skill, as if he had been trained from his infancy to the profession of arms. He turned the cattle of Lismore, his capital seat, into a fortress capable of demanding respect from the Irish. He immediately armed and disciplined his servants and Protestant tenants; and by their assistance, and a small army raised and maintained at his own expense, which he put under the command of his four sons, defended the province of Munster, and in the space of a year took several strong castles, and killed upwards of 3000 of the enemy: during which time he paid his forces regularly; and when all his money was gone, like a true patriot converted his plate into coin.

He was educated at the college of Dublin, where he soon distinguished himself as an early and promising genius. He afterwards made the tour of France and Italy; and at his return afflitted his father in opposing the rebellious Irish, in which he behaved with all the spirit of a young, and all the deference of an old, officer. Upon the murder of the king, he retired to Marston in Somersetshire, and hid himself in the privacy of a cloister retirement; but being at length ashamed to fit the tame spectator of all the mischief that appeared round him, he resolved to attempt something in favour of the king; and under the pretence of going to the Spa for the recovery of his health, he determined to cross the seas, and apply himself to King Charles II. for a commission to raise what forces he could in Ireland, in order to restore his majesty, and recover his own estate. To this purpose, he prevailed on the earl of Warwick to procure a licence for his going to the Spa; and having raised a considerable sum of money, came up to London to prosecute his voyage; but he had not been long in town when he received a message from Cromwell, who was then general of the parliament's forces, that he intended to wait upon him. The lord Broghill was surprized at this message, having never had the least acquaintance with Cromwell; and desired the gentleman to let the general know, that he would wait upon his excellency. But while he was waiting the return of the messenger, Cromwell entered the room; and after mutual civilities had passed between them, told him in few words, that the committee of state were apprised of his design of going over and applying to Charles Stuart for a commission to raise forces in Ireland; and that they were determined to make an example of him, if he himself had not diverted them from that resolution. The lord Broghill interrupted him, by affirming him that the intelligence which the committee had received was false; and that he neither was in a capacity nor had any inclination to raise disturbances in Ireland: but Cromwell, instead of making any reply, drew some papers out of his pocket, which were the copies of several letters which the lord Broghill had sent to those persons in whom he most confided, and put them into his hands. The lord Broghill, upon the perusal of these papers, finding it to no purpose to dissemble any longer, asked his excellency's pardon for what he had said, returned him his humble thanks for his protection against the committee, and intreated his direction how to behave in such a delicate conjuncture. Cromwell told him, that though till this time he had been a stranger to his person, he was not so to his merit and character; he had heard how gallantly his lordship had behaved in the Irish wars; and therefore, since he was named lord lieutenant of Ireland, and the reducing that kingdom was now become his province, he had obtained\nobtained leave of the committee to offer his lordship the command of a general officer, if he would serve in that war; and he should have no oaths or engagements imposed upon him, nor be obliged to draw his sword against any but the Irish rebels.\n\nThe lord Broghill was infinitely surprised at so generous and unexpected an offer. He saw himself at liberty, by all the rules of honour, to serve against the Irish, whose rebellion and barbarities were equally detested by the royal party and the parliament. He desired, however, some time to consider of what had been proposed to him. But Cromwell briskly told him, that he must come to some resolution that very instant: that he himself was returning to the committee, who were still sitting; and if his lordship rejected their offer, they had determined to send him to the tower. Upon this, the lord Broghill, finding that his liberty and life were in the utmost danger, gave his word and honour that he would faithfully serve him against the Irish rebels: on which Cromwell once more assured him, that the conditions which he had made with him should be punctually observed; and then ordered him to repair to Bristol, adding, that he himself would soon follow him into Ireland. Lord Broghill, therefore, having settled the business of his command, went over into that country; where, by his conduct and intrepidity, he performed many important services, and fully justified the opinion Cromwell had conceived of him. By his own interest he now raised a gallant troop of horse, consisting chiefly of gentlemen attached to him by personal friendship; which corps was soon increased to a complete regiment of 1500 men. These he led into the field against the Irish rebels; and was speedily joined by Cromwell, who placed the highest confidence in his new ally, and found him of the greatest consequence to the interest of the commonwealth.\n\nAmong other considerable exploits performed by Lord Broghill, the following deserves to be particularly mentioned. Whilst Cromwell laid siege to Clonmel, Broghill being detached to disperse a body of 5000 men who had assembled to relieve the place, he, with 2000 horse and dragoons, came up with the enemy at Macrooms on the 10th of May 1650; and, without waiting for the arrival of his foot, immediately attacked and routed them, making their general prisoner. Then proceeding to the castle of Carrigdohid, he sent a summons to the garrison to surrender before the arrival of his battering cannon, otherwise they were to expect no quarter. His own army was surprised at this summons, as knowing he had not one piece of heavy cannon: but Broghill had ordered the trunks of several large trees to be drawn at a distance by his baggage horses; which the besieged perceiving, and judging from the slowness of the motion that the guns must be of a vast bore, immediately capitulated. He afterwards relieved Cromwell himself at Clonmel, where that great commander happened to be so dangerously situated, that he confessed, nothing but the reasonable relief afforded him by Lord Broghill could have saved him from destruction. When Ireton sat down before Limerick, he gave Broghill 600 foot and 400 horse, with orders to prevent Lord Muskerry's joining the pope's nuncio, who had got together a body of 8000 men, and was determined to attempt the relief of Limerick. Muskerry was at the head of 1000 horse and dragoons, and about 2000 foot: notwithstanding which, Lord Broghill fell resolutely upon him. The Irish, having the advantage of the ground and numbers, would have conquered, but for a stratagem of Lord Broghill. In the heat of the action he desired those about him to repeat what he said; and then cried out as loud as he could, \"They run, they run.\" The first line of the Irish looked round to see if their rear broke; and the rear seeing the faces of their friends, and hearing the shouts of the enemy, imagined that the first line was routed, and fled. The taking of Limerick, which put an end to the war in Ireland, was the consequence of this defeat.\n\nWhen Cromwell became protector, he sent for Lord Broghill, merely to take his advice occasionally. And we are told, that, not long after his coming to England, he formed a project for engaging Cromwell to restore the old constitution. The basis of the scheme was to be a match between the king (Charles II.) and the protector's daughter. As his lordship maintained a secret correspondence with the exiled monarch and his friends, it was imagined that he was beforehand pretty sure that Charles was not adverse to the scheme, or he would not have ventured to have proposed it seriously to Cromwell; who at first seemed to think it not unfeasible. He soon changed his mind, however, and told Broghill that he thought his project impracticable: \"For (said he) Charles can never forgive me the death of his father.\" In fine, the business came to nothing, although his lordship had engaged Cromwell's wife and daughter in the scheme; but he never durst let the protector know that he had previously treated with Charles about it.\n\nOn the death of the protector, Lord Broghill continued attached to his son Richard, till, when he saw that the honesty and good-nature of that worthy man would infallibly render him a prey to his many enemies, he did not think it advisable to sink with a man that he could not save. The dark clouds of anarchy seemed now to be hovering over the British island. Lord Broghill saw the storm gathering, and he deemed it prudent to retire to his command in Ireland, where he shortly after had the satisfaction of seeing things take a turn extremely favourable to the design he had long been a well-wisher to, viz. that of the king's restoration. In this great event Lord Broghill was not a little instrumental; and, in consideration of his eminent services in this respect, Charles created him earl of Orrery by letters-patent bearing date September 5, 1660. He was soon after made one of the lords justices of Ireland; and his conduct, while at the head of affairs in that kingdom, was such as greatly added to the general esteem in which his character was held before.\n\nHis lordship's active and toilsome course of life at length brought upon him some diseases and infirmities which gave him much pain and uneasiness; and a fever which fell into his feet, joined to the gout with which he was often afflicted, abated much of that vigour which he had shown in the early part of his life: but his industry and application were still the same, and bent to the same purposes; as appears from his letters, which show at once a capacity, and an attention to business, which do honour to that age, and may serve as an example to this.\n\nNotwithstanding\nNotwithstanding his infirmities, on the king's desiring to see his lordship in England, he went over in 1665. He found the court in some disorder; where his majesty was on the point of removing the great earl of Clarendon, lord high chancellor; and there was also a great misunderstanding between the two royal brothers. Lord Orrery undertook to reconcile the king with the duke of York; which he effected by prevailing on the latter to ask his majesty's pardon for some steps he had taken in support of the lord chancellor.\n\nOn his return to Ireland, he found himself called to a new scene of action. The Dutch war was then at its height; and the French, in confederacy with the Hollanders, were endeavouring to stir up the allies of rebellion in Ireland. The duke de Beauport, admiral of France, had formed a scheme for a descent upon Ireland; but this was rendered abortive by the extraordinary diligence, military skill, and prudent measures, of Lord Orrery.\n\nBut in midst of all his labours, a dispute arose, founded on a mutual jealousy of each other's greatness, betwixt him and his old friend the duke of Ormond, then lord lieutenant; the bad effects of which were soon felt by both disputants, who resorted to England to defend their respective interests and pretensions, both having been attacked by secret enemies who sagaciously many things to their prejudice. This quarrel, though of a private beginning, became at last of a public nature; and producing first an attempt to frame an impeachment against the duke of Ormond, occasioned in the end, by the way of revenge, an actual impeachment against the earl of Orrery. He defended himself, however, so well against a charge of high crimes, and even of treason itself, that the prosecution came to nothing. He nevertheless lost his public employments; but not the king's favour; he still came frequently to court, and sometimes to council. After this revolution in his affairs, he made several voyages to and from Ireland; was often consulted by his majesty on affairs of the utmost consequence; and on all occasions gave his opinion and advice with the freedom of an honest plain-dealing man and a sincere friend; which the king always found him, and respected him accordingly.\n\nIn 1678, being attacked more cruelly than ever by his old enemy the gout, he made his last voyage to England for advice in the medical way. But his disorder was beyond the power of medicine; and having in his last illness given the strongest proofs of Christian patience, manly courage, and rational fortitude, he breathed his last on the 16th of October 1679, in the 59th year of his age. His lordship wrote, 1. A work entitled \"The Art of War.\" 2. Parthenilla, a romance, in one volume folio. 3. Several poems. 4. Dramatic pieces, two volumes. 5. State-tracts, in one volume folio, &c. Mr Walpole, speaking of this nobleman, says, he never made a bad figure but as a poet. As a soldier, his bravery was distinguished, his stratagems remarkable. As a statesman, it is sufficient to say, that he had the confidence of Cromwell. As a man, he was grateful, and would have supported the son of his friend; but, like Cicero and Richelieu, he could not be content without being a poet; though he was ill qualified, his writings of that kind being flat and trivial.\n\nBoyle, Robert, one of the greatest philosophers as well as best men that our own or indeed any other nation has produced, was the seventh son and the 14th child of Richard earl of Cork, and born at Lismore in the province of Munster in Ireland, January 25, 1626-7. Before he went to school, he was taught to write a very fair hand, and to speak French and Latin, by one of the earl's chaplains, and a Frenchman that he kept in the house. In the year 1635, his father sent him over to England, in order to be educated at Eton school, under Sir Henry Wotton, who was the earl of Cork's old friend and acquaintance. Here he soon discovered a force of understanding which promised great things, and a disposition to cultivate and improve it to the utmost. While he remained at Eton, there were several very extraordinary accidents that befell him, of which he has given us an account; and three of which were very near proving fatal to him. The first was, the sudden fall of the chamber where he was lodged, when himself was in bed; when, besides the danger he run of being crushed to pieces, he had certainly been choked with the dust during the time he lay under the rubbish, if he had not had presence of mind enough to have wrapped his head up in the sheet, which gave him an opportunity of breathing without hazard. A little after this, he had been crushed to pieces by a starting horse that rose up suddenly, and threw himself backwards, if he had not happily disengaged his feet from the stirrups, and cast himself from his back before he fell. A third accident proceeded from the carelessness of an apothecary's servant, who, by mistaking the phials, brought him a strong vomit instead of a cooling julep.\n\nHe remained at Eton, upon the whole, between three and four years; and then his father carried him to his own seat at Stalbridge in Dorsetshire, where he remained for some time under the care of one of his chaplains who was the parson of the place. In 1638, he attended his father to London; and remained with him at the Savoy, till his brother Mr Francis Boyle espoused Mrs Elizabeth Killigrew; and then, towards the end of October, within four days after the marriage, the two brothers, Francis and Robert, were sent abroad upon their travels, under the care of Mr Marcomb. They embarked at Rye in Sussex, and from thence proceeded to Dieppe in Normandy; then they travelled by land to Rouen, so to Paris, and from thence to Lyons; from which city they continued their journey to Geneva, where his governor had a family; and there the two gentlemen pursued their studies without interruption. Mr Boyle, during his stay here, resumed his acquaintance with the mathematics, or at least with the elements of that science, of which he had before gained some knowledge. For he tells us in his own memoirs, that while he was at Eton, and afflicted with an ague, before he was ten years old, by way of diverting his melancholy, they made him read Amadis de Gaul, and other romantic books, which produced such a restlessness in him, that he was obliged to apply himself to the extraction of the square and cube roots, and to the more laborious operations of algebra, in order to fix and settle the volatile operations of his fancy.\n\nIn September 1641, he quitted Geneva, after having spent 21 months in that city; and passing through Switzerland\nSwitzerland and the country of the Grifons, entered Lombardy. Then, taking his route through Bergamo, Brescia, and Verona, he arrived at Venice; where having made a short stay, he returned to the continent, and spent the winter at Florence. Here he employed his spare hours in reading the modern history in Italian, and the works of the celebrated astronomer Galileo, who died in a village near this city during Mr Boyle's residence in it. It was at Florence that he acquired the Italian language; which he understood perfectly, though he never spoke it so fluently as the French. Of this indeed he was such a master, that as occasion required he passed for a native of that country in more places than one during his travels.\n\nAbout the end of March 1642, he began his journey from Florence to Rome, which took up but five days. He surveyed the numerous curiosities of that city; among which, he tells us, \"he had the fortune to see Pope Urban VIII. at chapel, with the cardinals, who, feverishly appearing mighty princes, in that assembly looked like a company of common friars.\" He visited the adjacent villages which had anything curious or antique belonging to them; and had probably made a longer stay, had not the heats disagreed with his brother. He returned to Florence; from thence to Leghorn; and so by sea to Genoa: then passing through the county of Nice, he crossed the sea to Antibes, where he fell into danger from refusing to honour the crucifix: from thence he went to Marigues by land. He was in that city, in May 1642, when he received his father's letters, which informed him that the rebellion had broken out in Ireland, and how difficultly he had procured the 250l. then remitted to them in order to help them home. They never received this money; and were obliged to go to Geneva with their governor Marcombes, who supplied them with as much at least as carried them thither. They continued there a considerable time, without either advice or supplies from England; upon which Marcombes was obliged to take up some jewels upon his own credit, which were afterwards disposed of with as little loss as might be; and with the money thus raised, they continued their journey for England, where they arrived in the year 1644. On their arrival, Mr Boyle found his father dead; and though the earl had made an ample provision for him, by leaving him his manor of Stalbridge in England, as well as other considerable estates in Ireland, yet it was some time before he could receive any money. However, he procured protections for his estates in both kingdoms from the powers then in being; from which he also obtained leave to go over to France for a short space, probably to settle accounts with his governor Mr Marcombes.\n\nIn March 1646, he retired to his manor at Stalbridge, where he resided for the most part till May 1650. He made excursions sometimes to London, sometimes to Oxford; and in February 1647, he went over to Holland: but he made no considerable stay anywhere. During his retirement at Stalbridge, he applied himself with incredible industry to studies of various kinds, to those of natural philosophy and chemistry in particular. He omitted no opportunity of obtaining the acquaintance of persons distinguished for parts and learning; to whom he was in every respect a ready, useful, generous assistant, and with whom he held a constant correspondence. He was also one of the first members of that small but learned body of men which, when all academical studies were interrupted by the civil wars, seceded themselves about the year 1645; and held private meetings, first in London, afterwards at Oxford, for the sake of canvassing subjects of natural knowledge upon that plan of experiment which Lord Bacon had delineated. They styled themselves then The philosophic college; and, after the Restoration, when they were incorporated, and distinguished openly, they took the name of the Royal Society.\n\nIn the summer of 1654, he put in execution a design he had formed for some time of residing at Oxford, where he chose to live in the house of one Mr Croft, an apothecary, rather than in a college, for the sake of his health, and because he had more room to make experiments. Oxford was indeed the only place at that time in England where Mr Boyle could have lived with much satisfaction; for here he found himself surrounded with a number of learned friends, such as Wilkins, Wallis, Ward, Willis, Wren, &c., suited exactly to his taste, and who had resorted thither for the same reasons that he had done, the philosophical society being now removed from London to Oxford. It was during his residence here that he improved that admirable engine the air-pump; and by numerous experiments was enabled to discover several qualities of the air, so as to lay a foundation for a complete theory. He was not, however, satisfied with this; but laboured incessantly in collecting and digesting, chiefly from his own experiments, the materials requisite for this purpose. He declared against the philosophy of Aristotle, as having in it more words than things; promising much, and performing little; and giving the inventions of men for indubitable proofs, instead of building upon observation and experiment. He was so zealous for, and so careful about, this true method of learning by experiment, that though the Cartesian philosophy then made a great noise in the world, yet he would never be persuaded to read the works of Des Cartes, for fear he should be amused and led away by plausible accounts of things founded on conjecture, and merely hypothetical. But philosophy, and inquiries into nature, though they engaged his attention deeply, did not occupy it entirely; since we find that he still continued to pursue critical and theological studies. In these he had the affluence of some great men, particularly Dr Edward Pocock, Mr Thomas Hyde, and Mr Samuel Clarke, all of great eminence for their skill in the oriental languages. He had also a strict intimacy with Dr Thomas Barlow, at that time head keeper of the Bodleian library, and afterwards bishop of Lincoln, a man of various and extensive learning. In the year 1659, Mr Boyle, being acquainted with the unhappy circumstances of the learned Sanderston, afterwards bishop of Lincoln, who had lost all his preferments on account of his attachment to the royal party, conferred upon him an honorary stipend of 50l. a-year. This stipend was given as an encouragement to that excellent matter of reasoning to apply himself to the writing of \"Cates of Conscience;\" and accordingly\nBoyle. ingly he printed his lectures *De obligatione conscientiae*, which he read at Oxford in 1647, and dedicated them to his friend and patron.\n\nUpon the restoration of Charles II. Mr Boyle was treated with great civility and respect by the king, as well as by the two great ministers the lord treasurer Southampton and the lord chancellor Clarendon. He was solicited by the latter to enter into holy orders, not only out of regard to him and his family, but chiefly with a view to serve the church itself; for Mr Boyle's noble family, his distinguished learning, and, above all, his unblemished reputation, induced Lord Clarendon to think that any ecclesiastical preferments he might attain would be worthily discharged, so as to do honour to the clergy, and service to the established communion. Mr Boyle considered all this with due attention: but, to balance these, he reflected, that, in the situation of life in which he was, whatever he wrote with respect to religion would have to much the greater weight as coming from a layman: since he well knew that the irreligious fortified themselves against all that the clergy could offer, by supposing, and saying, that it was their trade, and that they were paid for it. He considered likewise, that, in point of fortune and character, he needed no accretions; and indeed he never had any appetite for either. He chose, therefore, to pursue his philosophical studies in such a manner as might be most effectual for the support of religion; and began to communicate to the world the fruits of these studies.\n\nThe first of these was printed at Oxford in 1662, in 8vo, under the title of, 1. New experiments, phylico-mechanical, touching the spring of the air and its effects. 2. Seraphic love; or some motives and incentives to the love of God, pathetically discoursed of in a letter to a friend. 3. Certain physiological essays and other tracts, 1661, 4to. 4. Sceptical chemist, 1662, 8vo; a very curious and excellent work, reprinted about the year 1679, 8vo, with the addition of divers experiments and notes about the producibleness of chemical principles.\n\nIn the year 1663, the Royal Society being incorporated by King Charles II. Mr Boyle was appointed one of the council; and as he might be justly reckoned among the founders of that learned body, so he continued one of the most useful and industrious of its members during the whole course of his life. In June 1663, he published, 5. Considerations touching the usefulness of experimental natural philosophy, 4to. 6. Experiments and considerations upon colours; to which was added a letter, containing Observations on a diamond that shines in the dark, 1663, 8vo. This treatise is full of curious and useful remarks on the hitherto unexplained doctrine of light and colours; in which he shows great judgment, accuracy, and penetration; and may be said to have led the way to that mighty genius the great Sir Isaac Newton, who has since let that point in the clearest and most convincing light. 7. Considerations on the style of the Holy Scriptures, 1663, 8vo. It was an extract from a larger work, entitled, \"An Essay on Scripture;\" which was afterwards published by Sir Peter Pett, a friend of Mr Boyle's.\n\nIn 1664, he was elected into the company of the royal mines; and was all this year taken up in the prosecution of various good designs, which probably was the reason why he did not send abroad any treaties either of religion or philosophy. The year following, came forth, 8. Occasional reflections upon several subjects; whereto is prefixed a discourse about such kind of thoughts, 1665, 8vo. This piece is addressed to Sophronia, under whose name he concealed that of his beloved sister the viscountess of Ranelagh. The thoughts themselves are on a vast variety of subjects, written many years before; some indeed upon trivial occasions, but all with great accuracy of language, much wit, more learning, and in a wonderful strain of moral and pious reflection. Yet this exposed him to the only severe censure that ever was passed upon him; and that too from no less a man than the celebrated Dean Swift, who, to ridicule these discourses, wrote A pious meditation upon a broomstick, in the style of the honourable Mr Boyle. But as his noble relation the late Lord Orrery has said, \"To what a height must the spirit of sarcasm arise in an author, who could prevail on himself to ridicule so good a man as Mr Boyle? The sword of wit, like the scythe of time, cuts down friend and foe, and attacks every object that lies in its way. But, sharp and irresistible as the edge of it may be, Mr Boyle will always remain invulnerable.\"\n\nThe same year, he published an important work, entitled, 9. New experiments and observations upon cold, 1665, 8vo. In the year 1666, he published, 10. Hydrological paradoxes made out by new experiments, for the most part physical and easy, in 8vo. 11. The origin of forms and qualities, according to the corpuscular philosophy, illustrated by considerations and experiments. This treatise did great honour to Mr Boyle, whether we consider the quickness of his wit, the depth of his judgment, or his indefatigable pains in searching after truth. We must not forget to observe, that, both in this and the former year, he communicated to his friend Mr Oldenburgh, who was secretary to the Royal Society, several curious and excellent short treatises of his own, upon a great variety of subjects, and others transmitted to him by his learned friends both at home and abroad, which are printed and preserved in the Philosophical Transactions.\n\nIn the year 1668, Mr Boyle resolved to settle in London for life: and removed for that purpose to the house of his sister, the lady Ranelagh, in Pall-Mall. This was to the infinite benefit of the learned in general, and particularly to the advantage of the Royal Society, to whom he gave great and continual assistance, as the several pieces communicated to them from time to time, and printed in their Transactions, do abundantly testify. Those who applied to him, either to desire his help, or to communicate to him any new discoveries in science, he had his set hours for receiving; otherwise it is easy to conceive that he would have had very little of his time for himself. But, besides these, he kept a very extensive correspondence with persons of the greatest figure, and most famous for learning, in all parts of Europe. In the year 1669, he published, 12. A continuation of new experiments touching the weight and spring of the air; to which is added, A discourse of the atmospheres of different bodies: and the same year he revised and made many additions to several of his former tracts, some of which...\nwhich were now translated into Latin, in order to gratify the curious abroad. 13. Tracts about the comical qualities of things; comical suspicions; the temperature of the subterranean regions; the bottom of the sea: to which is prefixed an introduction to the history of particular qualities. This book occasioned much speculation, as it seemed to contain a vast treasure of knowledge which had never been communicated to the world before; and this too grounded upon actual experiments, and arguments justly drawn from them, instead of that notional and conjectural philosophy which in the beginning of the 17th century had been so much in fashion.\n\nIn the year 1671, he published, 14. Considerations on the usefulness of experimental and natural philosophy; the second part, 4to. And, 15. A collection of tracts upon several useful and important points of practical philosophy, 4to. Both of which works were received as new and valuable gifts to the learned world. 16. An essay about the origin and virtues of gems, 1672, 8vo. 17. A collection of tracts upon the relation between flame and air; and several other useful and curious subjects: besides furnishing, in this and the former year, a great number of short dissertations upon a vast variety of topics, addressed to the Royal Society, and inserted in their Transactions. 18. Essays on the strange subtilty, great efficacy, and determinate nature, of effluvia; to which were added a variety of experiments on other subjects; 1673, 8vo.\n\n19. A collection of tracts upon the saltness of the sea, the moisture of the air, the natural and preternatural state of bodies; to which is prefixed a dialogue concerning cold; 1674, 8vo. 20. The excellency of theology compared with philosophy, 1673, 8vo. This discourse was written in the year 1665, while Mr Boyle, to avoid the great plague which then raged in London, was forced to go from place to place in the country, and had little or no opportunity of consulting his books. It contains a great number of curious and useful, as well as just and natural, observations. 21. A collection of tracts containing suspicions about hidden qualities of the air; with an appendix touching celestial magnets; animadversions upon Mr Hobbes's problem about a vacuum; a discourse of the cause of attraction and suction; 1674, 8vo. 22. Some considerations about the reconcileable benefits of reason and religion. By T. E. a layman. To which is annexed a discourse about the possibility of the resurrection. By Mr Boyle, 1675, 8vo. The reader must be informed, that both these pieces were of his writing; only he thought fit to mark the former with the final letters of his name. Among other papers that he communicated this year to the Royal Society, there were two connected into one discourse: the first was entitled, An experimental discourse of quicksilver growing hot with gold: the other related to the same subject; and both of them contained discoveries of the utmost importance.\n\nIn the year 1676, he published, 23. Experiments and notes about the mechanical origin or production of particular qualities, in several discourses on a great variety of subjects, and among the rest on electricity. In 1678, he communicated to Mr Hooke a short memorial of some observations made upon an artificial substance that shines without any preceding illumination; which that gentleman thought fit to publish in his Lettiones Cutlerianae. 24. Historical account of a degradation of gold made by an anti-elixir. This made a great noise both at home and abroad, and is looked upon as one of the most remarkable pieces that ever fell from his pen; since the facts contained in it would have been esteemed incredible, if they had been related by a man of less integrity and piety than Mr Boyle. The regard which the great Newton had for Mr Boyle, appears from a very curious letter, which the former wrote to him, at the latter end of this year, for the sake of laying before him his sentiments of that etherial medium, which he afterwards considered in his Optics as the cause of gravitation. This letter is to be found in the life of our author by the reverend Dr Birch.\n\nIn the year 1680, Mr Boyle published, 25. The aerial noctiluca; or some new phenomena, and a process of a factitious self-luminous substance, 8vo. This year the Royal Society, as a proof of the just sense of his great worth, and of the constant and particular services which through a course of many years he had done them, made choice of him for their president; but he being extremely, and, as he says, peculiarly tender in point of oaths, declined the honour done him, by a letter addressed to \"his much respected friend Mr Robert Hooke, professor of mathematics at Gresham college.\" 26. Discourse of things above reason; inquiring, whether a philosopher should admit any such; 1681, 8vo. 27. New experiments and observations upon the icy noctiluca: to which is added a chemical paradox, grounded upon new experiments, making it probable that chemical principles are transmutable, so that out of one of them others may be produced: 1682, 8vo. 28. A continuation of new experiments, physic-mechanical, touching the spring and weight of the air, and their effects; 1682, 8vo. In 1683, he published nothing but a short letter to Dr Beale, in relation to the making of fresh water out of salt. In 1684, he published two very confidential works, viz. 29. Memoirs for the natural history of human blood, especially the spirit of that liquor, 8vo; and, 30. Experiments and considerations about the porosity of bodies, &c.\n\nIn 1685, Mr Boyle obliged the world with, 31. Short memoirs for the natural experimental history of mineral waters, with directions as to the several methods of trying them; including abundance of new and useful remarks, as well as several curious experiments. 32. An essay on the great effects of even languid and unheeded motion; whereunto is annexed an experimental discourse of some hitherto little regarded causes of the salubrity and infalibility of the air and its effects. None of his treaties, it is said, were ever received with greater or more general applause than this. 33. Of the reconcileable benefits of specific medicines to the corporeal philosophy; to which is annexed a discourse about the advantages of the use of simple medicines; 8vo. Besides these philosophical tracts, he gave the world the same year, an excellent theological one, 34. Of the high veneration man's intellect owes to God, peculiarly for his wisdom and power, 8vo.\n\nAt the entrance of the succeeding year, came abroad his, 35. Free inquiry into the vulgarly received notion\nof nature; a piece which was then, and will always be, greatly admired by those who have a true zeal and relish for pure religion and philosophy. In 1687, he published, 36. The martyrdom of Theodora and Diodymus; a work he had drawn up in his youth. 37. A disquisition about the final causes of natural things; wherein it is inquired, whether, and (if at all) with what caution, a naturalist should admit them; with an appendix about vitiated light; 1688, 8vo. In the month of May this year, our author, though very unwilling, was constrained to make his complaint to the public, of some inconveniences under which he had long laboured; and this he did by an advertisement, about \"the loss of many of his writings addressed to J. W., to be communicated to those of his friends that are virtuosi; which may serve as a kind of preface to most of his mutilated and unfinished writings.\" He complains in this advertisement of the treatment he had met with from plagiarists both at home and abroad; and though it might have been difficult in any other man to have done so without incurring the imputation of self-conceit and vanity, yet Mr. Boyle's manner is such as only to raise in us a higher esteem and admiration of him. This advertisement is inserted at length in his life by Birch.\n\nHe began now to find that his health and strength, notwithstanding all his care and caution, gradually declined, as he observes in a letter to M. le Clerc, dated May 30, 1689; which put him upon using every possible method of husbanding his remaining time for the benefit of the learned. It was with this view that he no longer communicated particular discourses, or new discoveries, to the Royal Society; because this could not be done without withdrawing his thoughts from talks which he thought of still greater importance. It was the more steadily to attend to these, that he resigned his post of governor of the corporation for propagating the gospel in New England; nay, he went so far as to signify to the world that he could no longer receive visits as usual, in an advertisement which begins in the following manner: \"Mr. Boyle finds himself obliged to intimate to those of his friends and acquaintance, that are wont to do him the honour and favour of visiting him, 1. That he has by some unlucky accidents, namely, by his servant's breaking a bottle of oil of vitriol over a chest which contained his papers, had many of his writings corroded here and there, or otherwise impaired, that, without help himself fill up the lacunae out of his memory or invention, they will not be intelligible. 2. That his age and sicknesses have for a good while admonished him to put his scattered and partly defaced writings into some kind of order, that they may not remain quite useless. And, 3. That his skilful and friendly physician, Sir Edmund King, seconded by Mr. Boyle's best friends, has pressingly advised him against speaking daily with so many persons as are wont to visit him, representing it as what cannot but waste his spirits, &c. He ordered likewise a board to be placed over his door, with an inscription signifying when he did, and when he did not, receive visits.\"\n\nAmong the other great works, which by this means he gained time to finish, there is great reason to believe, that one was a collection of elaborate processes in chemistry; concerning which he wrote a letter to a friend, which is still extant; wherein we read, that Boyle \"he left it as a kind of hermetic legacy to the studious disciples of that art.\" Besides these papers committed to the care of one whom he esteemed his friend, he left very many behind him at his death, relating to chemistry; which, as appears by a letter directed to one of his executors, he desired might be inspected by three physicians whom he named, and that some of the most valuable might be preserved.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Boyle published some other works before his death; as, 38. Medicina Hydrostatica; or, Hydrostatics applied to the materia medica, showing how, by the weight that divers bodies used in physics have in water, one may discover whether they be genuine or adulterated. To which is subjoined a previous hydrostatical way of estimating ores, 1690, 8vo. 39. The Christian virtuoso; showing, that, by being addicted to experimental philosophy, a man is rather assisted than indisposed to be a good Christian. To which are subjoined, 1. A discourse about the distinction that represents some things as above reason, but not contrary to reason. 2. The first chapters of a discourse entitled Greatness of mind promoted by Christianity. The last work which he published himself, was in the spring of 1691; and is entitled, 40. Experimenta et Observations Physice: wherein are briefly treated of several subjects relating to natural philosophy in an experimental way. To which is added a small collection of strange reports, 8vo.\n\nAbout the entrance of the summer, he began to feel such an alteration in his health as induced him to think of settling his affairs; and accordingly, on the 18th of July, he signed and sealed his last will, to which he afterwards added several codicils. In October, his distemper increased; and on the last day of December 1691, he departed this life, in the 65th year of his age. He was buried in St. Martin's church in the Fields, Westminster, on the 7th of January following; and his funeral sermon was preached by Dr. Gilbert Burnet, bishop of Salisbury. The bishop made choice upon this occasion of a text very apposite to the subject; namely, \"For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom, knowledge, and joy.\" After explaining the meaning of the words, he applied the doctrine to the honourable person deceased; of whom, he tells us, he was the better able to give a character from the many happy hours he had spent in conversation with him, in the course of 29 years. He gives a large account of Mr. Boyle's sincere and unaffected piety; and more especially of his zeal for the Christian religion, without having any narrow notions concerning it, or mistaking, as so many do, a bigotted heat in favour of a particular sect, for that zeal which is an ornament of a true Christian. He mentions as a proof of this, his noble foundation for lectures in defence of the gospel against infidels of all sorts; the effects of which have been conspicuous in the many volumes of excellent discourses which have been published in consequence of that noble and pious foundation. He was at the charge of the translation and impression of the New Testament into the Malayan tongue, which he sent over all the East Indies. He gave a noble reward to him that translated Grotius's incomparable book \"Of the truth of the Christian religion\" into Arabic; and was at the charge of a whole impression, which he took care should...\nshould be dispersed in all the countries where that language was understood. He was resolved to have carried on the impression of the New Testament in the Turkish language; but the company thought it became them to be the doers of it, and so suffered him only to give a large share towards it. He was at 100l. charge in the edition of the Irish bible, which he ordered to be distributed in Ireland; and he contributed liberally to the impression of the Welsh bible. He gave, during his life, 300l to advance the design of propagating the Christian religion in America; and as soon as he heard that the East India Company were entertaining propositions for the like design in the east, he sent 100l. for a beginning, as an example, but intended to carry it much farther when it should be set on foot to purpose.\n\nIn other respects his charities were so bountiful and extensive, that they amounted, as this prelate tells us, from his own knowledge, to upwards of 1000l. a-year. But as our limits will not allow us to follow the bishop in the copious and eloquent account he has given of this great man's abilities, we must therefore content ourselves with adding the short eulogium by the celebrated physician, philosopher, and chemist, Dr Herman Boerhaave; who, after having declared Lord Bacon to be the father of experimental philosophy, affirms, that \"Mr Boyle, the ornament of his age and country, succeeded to the genius and inquiries of the great chancellor Verulam. Which (says he) of all Mr Boyle's writings shall I recommend? All of them. To him we owe the secrets of fire, air, water, animals, vegetables, foils: so that from his works may be deduced the whole system of natural knowledge.\" The reader perhaps may here be pleased to know, that Mr Boyle was born the same year in which Lord Bacon died.\n\nAs to the person of this great man, we are told, that he was tall, but slender; and his countenance pale and emaciated. His constitution was so tender and delicate, that he had divers sorts of cloaks to put on when he went abroad, according to the temperature of the air; and in this he governed himself by his thermometer. He escaped indeed the small-pox; but for almost forty years he laboured under such feeble-ness of body, and such lowness of strength and spirits, that it was astonishing how he could read, meditate, make experiments, and write, as he did. He had likewise a weakness of his eyes; which made him very tender of them, and extremely apprehensive of such distempers as might affect them. He imagined likewise, that if sickness should confine him to his bed, it might raise the pains of the stone to a degree which might be above his strength to support; so that he feared his last minutes should be too hard for him. This was the ground of all the caution and apprehension with which he was observed to live; but as to life itself, he had that just indifference for it which became a philosopher and a Christian. However, his sight began to grow dim not above four hours before he died; and when death came upon him, he had not been above three hours in bed before it made an end of him, with so little pain that the flame appeared to go out merely for want of oil to maintain it.\n\nMr Boyle was never married; but Mr Evelyn was assured, that he courted the beautiful and ingenious daughter of Cary earl of Monmouth, and that to this pallion was owing his \"Seraphic Love.\" In the memorandum of Mr Boyle's life set down by Bishop Burnet, it is remarked that he abstained from marriage, at first out of policy, afterwards more philosophically; and we find by a letter of Dr John Wallis to him, dated at Oxford, July 17th, 1669, that he had an overture made him with respect to the Lady Mary Hastings, sister to the earl of Huntingdon. But it does not appear from any of his papers, that he had ever entertained the least thoughts of that kind; nay, there is a letter of his, wrote when he was young, to the Lady Barrymore his niece, who had informed him of a report that he was actually married, which almost shows that he never did. The letter is written with great politeness, and in the true spirit of gallantry; and is a clear proof, that though Mr Boyle did not choose to marry, yet it was no philanthropic cynical humour which restrained him from it. It is impossible to entertain the reader better than by prefacing him with that part of it which concerns the point in question. \"It is high time for me to hasten the payment of the thanks I owe your ladyship for the joy you are pleased to wish me, and of which that with possibly gives me more than the occasion of it would. You have certainly reason, madam, to suspend your belief of a marriage, celebrated by no priest but Fame, and made unknown to the suppos'd bridegroom. I may possibly ere long give you a fit of the spleen upon this theme; but at present it were incongruous to blend such pure rillery, as I ever rate of matrimony and amours with, among things I am so serious in as those this scribble pretends you. I shall therefore only tell you, that the little gentleman and I are still at the old defiance. You have carried away too many of the perfections of your sex to leave enough in this country for reducing to stubborn a heart as mine; whose conquest were a task of so much difficulty, and so little worth it, that the latter property is always likely to deter any that hath beauty and merit enough to overcome the former. But though this untamed heart be thus insensible to the thing itself called love; it is yet very acceivable to things very near of kin to that pallion; and esteem, friendship, respect, and even admiration, are things that their proper objects fail not proportionably to exact of me, and consequently are qualities which in their highest degrees are really and constantly paid my lady Barrymore by her most obliged humble servant, and affectionate uncle, Robert Boyle.\"\n\nWe shall conclude this account of Mr Boyle with the mention of his posthumous works, which are as follow. 1. \"The general History of the air deigned and begun. 2. \"General heads for the natural history of a country, great or small; drawn out for the use of travellers and navigators.\" 3. \"A paper of the honourable Robert Boyle's, deposited with the secretaries of the Royal Society, October 14th, 1680, and opened since his death; being an account of his making the phosphorus, September 30th, 1680.\" Printed in the Philosophical Transactions. 4. \"An account of a way of examining waters, as to freckles or saltness.\" 5. \"A free discourse against customary swearing, and a dissuasive from cursing,\" 1695, 8vo. 6. \"Medicinal experiments, or a collection of choice remedies, chiefly simple and easily prepared, useful in families, and fit for the service of the country people. The third and last volume,\"\nvolume, published from the author's original manuscript; whereunto is added several useful notes explanatory of the same,\" 1698, 12mo. Beautiful editions of all his works have been printed at London, in 5 volumes folio, and 6 volumes 4to.\n\nBoyle, Charles, earl of Orrery in Ireland, and baron of Mahton in the county of Somerset, was the second son of Roger the second earl of Orrery, and was born in August 1679. He was educated at Christ-church in Oxford, and soon distinguished himself by his learning and abilities. Like the first earl of Orrery, he was an author, a soldier, and a statesman. He translated the life of Lyander from the Greek of Plutarch; and published a new edition of the epistles of Phalaris, which engaged him in a literary dispute, in which he defended the genuineness of these epistles against Dr Bentley. He was three times member for the town of Huntingdon; but his elder brother, Lionel earl of Orrery dying on the 23rd of August 1703 without issue, he succeeded to that title; and, entering into the queen's service, had a regiment given him, when he behaved with such bravery, that in 1709 he was raised to the rank of major-general, and sworn one of her majesty's privy council. At the famous battle of the wood, he gave the strongest proofs of his intrepid courage, remaining at the head of his regiment in the warmest part of the action, till the victory was complete, which, as it was one of the most glorious, so it was the dearest bought, of any of that war. His lordship had the honour of being appointed the queen's envoy to the states of Brabant and Flanders; and having honourably discharged the trust, was raised to the dignity of a British peer, by the title of Lord Boyle, baron of Mahton in Somersetshire. He enjoyed several other additional honours in the reign of King George I.; but having the misfortune to fall under the suspicion of the government, his lordship was committed to the tower; he was, however, at length, admitted to bail; and nothing being found that could be esteemed a sufficient ground for a prosecution, he was discharged. His lordship died after a flight indisposition, on the 21st of August 1731. To his tutor, Mr Atterbury, he probably owed a good part of that fine relish he had for the writings of the ancients. He made these his constant study, and expressed a high contempt, says Budgell, for the greater part of our modern wits and authors. He was delighted with the company of two sorts of persons; either such as were really geniuses of the first rank, who had fine understandings, strong judgments, and true tastes; or such as had a few foibles, and an eye of ridicule in them, which served to make him laugh. He would rally these in so agreeable, and yet in so tender a manner, that, though it diverted himself and others, it was never offensive to the person rallied. The instrument which was invented by him, and bears his name, representing the solar system according to the sentiments of the new astronomers, is an undeniable proof of his mechanic genius. His lordship had also a turn for medicine; which led him not only to buy and read whatever was published on that subject, but also to employ his friends to send him accounts of herbs and drugs in foreign countries.\n\nBoyle, John, earl of Cork and Orrery, a nobleman distinguished by his learning and genius, was the only son of Charles earl of Orrery, and was born on the 2nd of January 1707. He was educated at Christ church college in Oxford; but, as he himself declares, early disappointments, indifferent health, and many untoward accidents, rendered him fond of retirement, and of improving his talents for polite literature and poetry; of which last art he gave several excellent specimens. He also wrote a translation of Pliny the Younger's letter, with various notes, for the service of his eldest son the Lord Boyle, in two volumes, 4to. This was first published in 1751. The year following, he published the Life of Dean Swift, in several letters, addressed to his second son Hamilton Boyle; and afterwards printed Memoirs of Robert Cary earl of Monmouth, a manuscript presented to him by a relation, with explanatory notes. He died in 1762.\n\nBoyle's Lectures, a course of eight sermons or lectures preached annually, set on foot by the honourable Robert Boyle, Esq.; by a codicil annexed to his will in 1691; whose design, as expressed by the instigator, is, to prove the truth of the Christian religion against infidels, without descending to any controversies among Christians; and to answer new difficulties, scruples, &c. For the support of this lecture he assigned the rent of his house in Crooked-lane to some learned divine within the bills of mortality, to be elected for a term not exceeding three years, by the late Archbishop Tennison and others. But the fund proving precarious, the salary was ill paid; to remedy which inconveniences, the said archbishop procured a yearly stipend of 50l. for ever, to be paid quarterly, charged on a farm in the parish of Brill in the county of Bucks. To this appointment we are indebted for many elaborate defences both of natural and revealed religion.","sp":427,"ep":435},{"h":"BOYNE","t":"a river in Ireland, which rises in Queen's county in the province of Leinster, and runs north-east by Trim and Cavan, falling at last into the Irish channel a little below Drogheda.

He was taught the first rudiments of learning by his father; and his capacity was such, that at the age of five years he read the Bible in Hebrew. He went afterwards to Hadley school; and at 14 was admitted of St John's college, Cambridge, where he distinguished himself by his skill in Greek. Happening to have the small-pox when he was elected fellow, he, to preserve his seniority, caused himself to be carried in blankets to be admitted. He applied himself for some time to the study of medicine; but, fancying himself affected with every disease he read of, he quitted that science. He was ten years chief Greek lecturer in his college, and read every day. He voluntarily read a Greek lecture for some years at four in the morning, in his own chamber, which was frequented by many of the fellows. On the death of his father, he succeeded him in the rectory of Weft Stowe. At the age of 36, he married the daughter of Mr Holt, rector of Boxworth, in Cambridgeshire; whom he succeeded in that living, October 13, 1596. On his quitting the university, the college gave him\nHis young wife, who was bequeathed to him with the living, which was an advowson, proving a bad economit, and he himself being wholly addicted to his studies, he soon became so much involved in debt, that he was obliged to sell his choice collection of books, consisting of almost every Greek author then extant. When a new translation of the Bible was by King James I. directed to be made, Mr Bois was elected one of the Cambridge translators. He performed not only his own, but also the part assigned to another, with great reputation; though with no profit, for he had no allowance but his commons. He was also one of the six who met at Stationers Hall to revile the whole; which talk they went through in nine months, having each from the company of stationers, during that time 30s. a-week. He afterwards assisted Sir Henry Saville in publishing the works of St Chrysostom. In 1615, Dr Lancelot Andrews, bishop of Ely, bestowed on him, unasked, a prebend in his church. He died on the 14th of January 1643, in the 84th year of his age. He left a great many manuscripts behind him, particularly a Commentary on almost all the books of the New Testament.\u2014When he was a young student at Cambridge, he received from the learned Dr Whitaker three rules for avoiding those dilemmas which usually attend a sedentary life, to which he adhered with equal constancy and success. The first was, To study always standing; the second, Never to study in a window; and the third, Never to go to bed with his feet cold.\n\nBoyle, Joseph, a late eminent dissenting minister in Dublin, much respected not only for learning and abilities, but his extensive humanity and undefiled piety. During his ministerial charge at Dublin, he published many sermons which compose several folio volumes, a few poems, and other tracts; but what chiefly distinguished him as a writer, was the controversy he carried on with Dr King, archbishop of Dublin, and author of the Origin of Evil, concerning the office of a scriptural bishop. This controverted point was managed on both sides with great force of argument and calmness of temper. The bishop asserted, that the episcopal right of jurisdiction had its foundation in the New Testament: Mr Boyle, consistent with his principles, denied that any ecclesiastical superiority appeared there, with the greatest candour and good manners. He was father to\n\nBoyle, Samuel, the poet, a man remarkable for the fineness of his genius, the loveliness of his manners, and the wretchedness of his life. He was born in 1708, and received the rudiments of his education in a private school in Dublin. When he was but 18 years old, his father, who probably intended him for the ministry, sent him to the university of Glasgow, that he might finish his education there. He had not been a year at the university, when he fell in love with the daughter of a tradesman in that city, and was imprudent enough to interrupt his education by marrying her before he had entered into his 20th year. The natural extravagance of his temper soon exposed him to want; and as he had now the additional charge of a wife, his reduced circumstances obliged him to quit the university, and go over with his wife (who also carried a sister with her) to Dublin, where they relied on the old gentleman for support. Young Boyle was of all men the furthest removed from a gentleman; he had no graces of person, and fewer still of conversation. Never were three people of more libertine characters than young Boyle, his wife, and sister-in-law; yet the two ladies wore such a mask of decency before the old gentleman, that his fondness was never abated. The estate his father possessed in Yorkshire was sold to discharge his debts; and when the old man lay in his last sickness, he was entirely supported by presents from his congregation, and buried at their expense. We have no further account of Mr Boyle, till we find him soon after his father's death at Edinburgh. At this place his poetical genius raised him many friends, and some patrons of very great eminence. He published a volume of poems in 1731, to which are subjoined The Tablature of Cebes, and A Letter upon Liberty, inserted in the Dublin Journal 1726; and by these he obtained a very great reputation. They are addressed to the countess of Eglinton. This amiable lady was the patroness of all men of wit, and greatly distinguished Mr Boyle while he resided in that country. Upon the death of the viscountess Stormont, Mr Boyle wrote an elegy, which was very much applauded by her ladyship's relations. This elegy he entitled The Tears of the Muses, as the deceased lady was a woman of the most refined taste in the sciences, and a great admirer of poetry. The lord Stormont was so much pleased with this mark of esteem paid to the memory of his lady, that he ordered a very handsome present to be given to Mr Boyle by his attorney at Edinburgh. The notice which lady Eglinton and the lord Stormont took of our poet, recommended him likewise to the patronage to the duchess of Gordon; who was so solicitous to raise him above necessity, that she employed her interest in procuring the promise of a place for him. She gave him a letter, which he was next day to deliver to one of the commissioners of the customs at Edinburgh. It happened that he was then some miles distant from the city; and, the morning on which he was to have rode to town with her grace's letter of recommendation proved to be rainy. This slender circumstance was enough to discourage Boyle, who never looked beyond the present moment; he declined going to town on account of the rainy weather; and while he let slip the opportunity, the place was bestowed upon another, which the commissioner declared he kept for some time vacant in expectation of seeing a person recommended by the duchess of Gordon. Boyle at last having defeated all the kind intentions of his patrons towards him, fell into contempt and poverty, which obliged him to quit Edinburgh. He communicated his design of going to London to the duchess of Gordon; who, having still a very high opinion of his poetical abilities, gave him a letter of recommendation to Mr Pope, and obtained another for him to Sir Peter King the lord chancellor of England. Lord Stormont recommended him to the solicitor-general his brother, and many other persons of the first fashion. Upon receiving these letters, he, with great caution, quitted Edinburgh, regretted by none but his creditors. Upon his arrival in London, he went to Twickenham, in order to deliver the duchess of Gordon's letter to Mr Pope; but that gentleman not being at home, Mr Boyle never gave himself the trouble to repeat his visit. He wrote poems; but those, though excellent in their kind, were lost to the world, by being introduced with no advantage.\nHe had so strong a propensity to grovelling, that his acquaintance were generally of such a cast as could be of no service to him; and those in higher life he addressed by letters, not having sufficient confidence or politeness to converse familiarly with them. Thus unfit to support himself in the world, he was exposed to a variety of distresses, from which he could invent no means of extricating himself but by writing mendicant letters. It will appear amazing, that this man, of so abject a spirit, was voluptuous and luxurious; he had no taste for any thing elegant, and yet was to the last degree expensive. Can it be believed, that often when he had received but a guinea in consequence of a supplicating letter, he would go into a tavern, order a supper to be prepared, drink of the richest wines, and spend all the money that had just been given him in charity, without having any one to participate the regale with him, and while his wife and child were starving at home?\n\nIt was about the year 1740, that Mr Boyle, reduced to the last extremity of human wretchedness, had not a shirt, a coat, or any kind of apparel, to put on; the sheets in which he lay were carried to the pawn-broker's, and he was obliged to be confined to his bed with no other covering than a blanket. He had little support but what he got by writing letters to his friends in the most abject style; but was perhaps ashamed to let this instance of his distress be known, which probably was the occasion of his remaining six weeks in that situation. During this time he had some employment in writing verses for the Magazines; and whoever had seen him in his study, must have thought the object singular enough: he sat up in bed with the blanket wrapped about him, through which he had cut a hole large enough to admit his arm, and, placing the paper upon his knee, scribbled in the best manner he could the verses he was obliged to make: whatever he got by those, or any other of his begging letters, was but just sufficient for the preservation of life. And perhaps he would have remained much longer in this distressful state, had not a compassionate gentleman, upon hearing this circumstance related, ordered his clothes to be taken out of pawn, and enabled him to appear again abroad.\n\nAbout the year 1745, Mr Boyle's wife died. He was then at Reading, and pretended much concern when he heard of her death. His business at Reading was to compile a Review of the most material transactions at home and abroad during the last war: in which he has included a short account of the late rebellion. Upon his return from Reading, his behaviour was more decent than it had ever been before; and there were some hopes that a reformation, though late, would be wrought upon him. He was employed by a bookseller to translate Fenelon on the Existence of God; during which time he married a second wife, a woman in low circumstances, but well enough adapted to his taste. He began now to live with more regard to his character, and supported a better appearance than usual; but while his circumstances were mending, and his irregular appetites losing ground, his health visibly declined. He had the satisfaction, while in this lingering illness, to observe a poem of his, entitled The Deity, recommended by two eminent writers, the ingenious Mr Fielding, and the reverend Mr James Harvey author of The Meditations.\n\nMr Boyle's mind was often religiously disposed; he frequently talked upon that subject, and probably suffered a great deal from the remorse of his conscience. The early impressions of his good education were never entirely obliterated; and his whole life was a continued struggle between his will and reason, as he was always violating his duty to the one, while he fell under the subjection of the other. It was in consequence of this war in his mind, that he wrote a beautiful poem called The Recantation. In May 1749, he died in obscure lodgings near Shoe-lane; but in sentiments, there is the greatest reason to believe, very different from those in which he had spent the greatest part of his life. An old acquaintance of his endeavoured to collect money to defray the expenses of his funeral, so that the scandal of being buried by the parish might be avoided; but in vain: the remains of this son of the muse were, with very little ceremony, hurried away by the parish officers.\n\nNever was a life spent with less grace than that of Mr Boyle, and never were such distinguished abilities given to less purpose. His genius was not confined to poetry only: he had a taste for painting, music, and heraldry; with the latter of which he was very well acquainted. His poetical pieces, if collected, would make five moderate volumes. Many of them are scattered in The Gentleman's Magazine, marked with the letter Y, and Alceus. Two volumes were published in London. An ode of his in the manner of Spenser, entitled The Olive, was addressed to Sir Robert Walpole, which procured him a present of ten guineas. He translated a poem from the High Dutch of Van Haren, in praise of peace, upon the conclusion of that made at Aix-la-Chapelle; but the poem which procured him the greatest reputation was that upon the attributes of the Deity. He was employed by Mr Ogle to translate some of Chaucer's tales into modern English, which he performed with great spirit, and received at the rate of three pence a line for his trouble. Mr Ogle published a complete edition of that old poet's Canterbury Tales modernized; and Mr Boyle's name is put to such tales as were done by him. In 1743, Mr Boyle published, without his name, an ode on the battle of Dettingen, entitled Albion's Triumph.","sp":435,"ep":437},{"h":"BOZOLA","t":"a town of Italy, in the duchy of Mantua, capital of a territory of the same name, and subject to the house of Austria.

Removing to Florence, he was admitted into the academy there, and devoted himself to literature. At Rome he entered into the service of Cardinal Maffeo Barberini, with whom he afterwards went to France. After the death of Clement VIII., he returned to his own country, and for some years prosecuted his studies in retirement. When his patron Barberini was elected pope, under the name of Urban VIII., Bracciolini repaired to Rome, where he was well received, and made secretary to the pope's brother, Cardinal Antonio. He had also the honour conferred on him of taking a surname from the arms of the Barberini family, which were Bees; and thenceforth he was known by the name of Bracciolini dell' Api. He resided in Rome during the whole of that pontificate, frequenting the most illustrious academies, and listened to with general applause, but, at the same time, censured for his fond aversion. He returned at length to his native city, where he died in the year 1645.\n\nBracciolini was a copious writer. There is scarcely any species of poetry, epic, dramatic, pastoral, lyric, and burlesque, which he did not attempt. He is principally noted for his mock-heroic poem, entitled Seberno degli Dei, which is a ridicule of the heathen mythology, and which disputes priority of date with Tasso's Seccia Rapi. In merit, indeed, its inferiority is acknowledged, yet it obtained considerable applause. Of his serious heroic poems, the most celebrated is the Croce Racquifata,\" which by some is placed next to the great works of Ariosto and Tasso, but not without a large interval. He celebrated the elevation of his patron Urban VIII. in a poem of twenty-three books, which shows with what facility he could write verses. His dramatic pastoral entitled L'Amoroso Sdegno, is accounted one of the best productions of the age in which it was written; and some of his tragedies met with much applause, particularly his Evandro.\n\nBRACE is commonly taken for a couple or pair, and applied by huntsmen to several beasts of game, as a brace of bucks, foxes, hares, &c.","sp":438,"ep":438},{"h":"BRACE","t":"or Braffe, is also a foreign measure, answering to our fathom.

Bradford at this time was a gay man, and to support his extravagance made free with the king's money; but being at last unable to support the reflection of his guilt, he determined to make restitution, and actually repaid the money. Quitting his employment of secretary, about the year 1547, he took chambers in the inner temple, and for some time studied the law; but finding himself an inclination to preach the gospel, in the following year he removed to Catharine-hall in Cambridge, where he applied with such uncommon affluence to the study of divinity, that in a much shorter time than usual he was admitted to the degree of master of arts, and soon after made fellow of Pembroke-hall. Bishop Ridley, who, in 1550, was translated to the see of London, charmed with Bradford's application and zeal, now sent for him to the metropolis, ordained and appointed him his chaplain. In 1553, he was also made chaplain to Edward VI., during which time he became one of the most popular preachers in the kingdom. Such a reformer was too dangerous to be suffered in the succeeding reign. Mary was hardly in possession of the crown, before Bradford's persecutions began.

His friends intended him for the church, and his studies were regulated with that view; and as soon as he was of sufficient age to receive holy orders, the bishop of Hereford, who had conceived a great esteem for him, gave him the living of Bridgwater, and soon after he was inducted to that of Welford in Pembrokeshire. But notwithstanding these advantages, from which he might promise himself still further advancement in the church, he at length resigned his livings, that he might be wholly at liberty to pursue his favourite study the mathematics, and particularly astronomy. He was nephew to Mr Pound, a gentleman who is well known in the learned world by many excellent observations, and who would have enriched it with more, if the journals of his voyages had not been burnt at Pulo Condore, when the place was set on fire, and the English who were settled there cruelly massacred, Mr Pound himself very narrowly escaping with his life. With this gentleman, Mr Bradley passed all the time that he could spare from the duties of his function; and perhaps he sometimes trespassed upon them: he was then sufficiently acquainted with the mathematics to improve by Mr Pound's conversation; yet it does not appear that, in this study, he had any preceptor but his genius, or any assistant but his labour.\n\nIt may be easily imagined, that the example and conversation of Mr Pound did not render Bradley more fond of his profession than he was before; he continued, however, as yet to fulfil the duties of it, though at this time he had made such observations as laid the foundation of those discoveries which afterwards distinguished him as one of the greatest astronomers of his age. Though these observations were made as it were by stealth, they gained him at first the notice, and then the friendship, of the lord chancellor Macclesfield, Mr Newton, afterwards Sir Isaac, Mr Halley, and many other members of the Royal Society, into which he was soon elected a member. About the same time, the chair of Savilian professor of astronomy became vacant by the death of the celebrated Dr Keil; and Mr Bradley was elected to succeed him on the 1st of October 1721, being then just 29 years old; and his colleague was Mr Halley, who was professor of geometry on the same foundation. Bradley, upon his being elected into this professorship, gave up both his livings, and with great joy quitted a situation in which his duty was directly opposite to his inclination. From this time, he applied himself wholly to the study of his favourite science; and in the year 1727 he published his theory of the aberration of the fixed stars, which is allowed to be one of the most useful and ingenious discoveries of modern astronomy. Three years after this discovery, by which Mr Bradley acquired very great reputation, he was appointed lecturer in astronomy and physics, at the museum of Oxford.\n\nHe pursued his studies with equal application and delight; and in the course of his observations, which were innumerable, he discovered that the inclination of the earth's axis upon the plane of the ecliptic was not always the same, but that it varied backwards and forwards some seconds, and that the period of these variations was nine years. This period seemed altogether unaccountable, as it could not be supposed to have anything in common with the revolution of the earth, which is performed in one year. Mr Bradley, however, discovered the cause of this phenomenon in the Newtonian system of attraction. He published this discovery in 1737, so that in the space of about ten years he communicated to the world two of the finest discoveries in modern astronomy, which will forever make a memorable epocha in the history of that science.\nMr Bradley always preserved the esteem and friendship of Mr Halley; who, being worn out by age and infirmities, thought he could do nothing farther for the service of astronomy, than procure for Mr Bradley the place of regius professor of astronomy at Greenwich, which he had pollied himself many years with the greatest reputation. With this view, he wrote many letters, which have been since found among Mr Bradley's papers, desiring his permission to apply for a grant of the reverence of it to him, and even offering to resign in his favour, if it should be thought necessary: but before Mr Halley could bring this kind project to bear, he died. Mr Bradley, however, obtained the place afterwards, by the favour and interest of Lord Macclesfield, who was afterwards president of the Royal Society. As soon as the appointment of Mr Bradley to this place was known, the university of Oxford sent him a diploma creating him doctor of divinity. The appointment of astronomer at Greenwich placed Mr Bradley in his proper element, and he pursued his observations with unwearied diligence. However numerous the collection of astronomical instruments at the observatory at Greenwich, it was impossible that such an observer as Dr Bradley should not desire to increase them, as well to answer those particular views, as in general to make observations with greater exactness. In the year 1748, therefore, he took the opportunity of the annual visit made by the Royal Society to the observatory, in order to examine the instruments and receive the professor's observations for the year, to represent so strongly the necessity of repairing the old instruments, and purchasing new, that the society thought proper to represent it to his majesty, and his majesty gave them 100l. for that purpose. This sum was laid out under the direction of Dr Bradley, who, with the assistance of the late celebrated Mr Graham and Mr Bird, furnished the observatory with as complete a collection of astronomical instruments, as the most skilful and diligent observer could desire. Dr Bradley, furnished with such assistance, pursued his observations with new assiduity, an incredible number of which were found after his death, and put into the hands of the Royal Society.\n\nIt has been already observed, that when Dr Bradley was elected to the professor's chair at Oxford, he gave up his two livings, which were at such a distance, that he could not possibly fulfil the duties of them himself; but it happened that after he was settled at Greenwich the living of that parish became vacant, which is very considerable, and which was offered to him, as he was upon the spot to perform the duty, and had the claim of uncommon merit to the reward. This living, however, Dr Bradley, very greatly to his honour, refused, fearing the duties of the astronomer would too much interfere with those of the divine. His majesty, however, hearing of the refusal, was so pleased with it, that he granted him a pension of 250l. a-year in consideration of his great abilities and knowledge in astronomy and other branches of the mathematics, which had procured so much advantage to the commerce and navigation of Great Britain, as is particularly mentioned in the grant which is dated the 15th of February 1752. Dr Bradley, about the same time, was admitted into the council of the Royal Society. In the year 1748, he was admitted a member of the royal academy of sciences and belles lettres of Berlin, upon the death of M. Crevier, first physician to his Catholic majesty; in the year 1752, a member of the imperial academy at Petersburg; and in 1757, of that instituted at Bologna.\n\nDr Bradley was still indefatigable in his observations, and whatever honour he received became an incitement to obtain new distinction; his corporeal abilities, however, at length declined, though his intellectual suffered no abatement. In the year 1760, he became extremely weak and infirm; and towards the end of June 1762, he was attacked with a total suppression of urine, caused by an inflammation of the reins, which on the 12th of July following put an end to his life, in the 70th year of his age. He was buried at Mitchin-Hampton, in Gloucestershire, in the same grave with his mother and his wife. In the year 1744, he married Susannah Peach, the daughter of a gentleman of that name in Gloucestershire, by whom he had only one daughter.\n\nAs to his character, he was remarkable for a placid and gentle modesty, very uncommon in persons of an active temper and robust constitution. It was still more remarkable, that, with this untroubled equanimity of temper, he was compassionate and liberal in the highest degree. Although he was a good speaker, and possessed the rare but happy art of expressing his ideas with the utmost precision and perspicuity, yet no man was a greater lover of silence, for he never spoke but when he thought it absolutely necessary. He did indeed think it necessary to speak when he had a fair opportunity to communicate any useful knowledge in his own way; and he encouraged those that attended his lectures to ask him questions, by the exactness with which he answered, and the care he took to adapt himself to every capacity. He was not more inclined to write than to speak, for he has published very little; he had a natural diffidence, which made him always afraid that his works should injure his character; and therefore suppressed many, which probably were well worthy of the public attention. He was even known, as it were, in spite of himself; and, in spite of himself, he was known much, and consequently much esteemed. He was acquainted with many of the first persons in this kingdom, persons eminent as well for their rank as their abilities; he was honoured by all men of learning in general; and there was not an astronomer of any eminence in the world with whom he had not a literary correspondence. Upon the whole, it may be said of Dr Bradley, that no man cultivated great talents with more success, or had a better claim to be ranked among the greatest astronomers of his age.","sp":440,"ep":441},{"h":"BRADNINCH","t":"a town of Devonshire, once a confident place, but some time ago totally destroyed by fire.

He was taught Latin when seven years old, and studied five years under private tutors. His father dying, his uncle lent him, in April 1559, to study philosophy and rhetoric at Copenhagen. The great eclipse of the sun on the 21st of August 1560, happening at the precise time the astronomers had foretold, he began to look upon astronomy as something divine; and purchasing the tables of Stadius, gained some notion of the theory of the planets. In 1562, he was sent by his uncle to Leipzig to study law; but astronomy wholly engrossed his thoughts, and in purchasing books on that science he employed all his pocket-money. Having procured a small celestial globe, he was wont to wait till his tutor was gone to bed, in order to examine the constellations and learn their names; and when the sky was clear, he spent whole nights in viewing the stars. In 1565, a difference arising between Brahe and a Danish nobleman, they fought, and the former had part of his nose cut off; which defect he so artfully supplied with one made of gold and silver, that it was not perceivable. It was about this time that he began to apply to chemistry, proposing nothing less than to obtain the philosopher's stone. In 1571, he returned to Denmark; and was favoured by his mother's brother, Steno Belle, a lover of learning, with a convenient place at his castle of Herritzvad near Knudstorp, for making his observations, and building a laboratory. His marrying a country girl, beneath his rank, occasioned such a violent quarrel between him and his relations, that the king was obliged to interpose to reconcile them. In 1574, by his majesty's command, he read lectures upon the theory of the comets at Copenhagen. The year following he began his travels through Germany, and proceeded as far as Venice; he then resolved to remove his family, and settle at Basil; but Frederic II. king of Denmark being informed of his design, and unwilling to lose a man that was capable of being such an ornament to his country, promised to enable him to pursue his studies, to bestow upon him for life the island of Huen in the Sound, to erect an observatory and laboratory there, and to defray all the expenses necessary for carrying on his designs. Tycho Brahe readily embraced this proposal; and accordingly the first stone of the observatory was laid August 8, 1576. The king also gave him a pension of 2000 crowns out of his treasury, a fee in Norway, and a canonry of Rofhild, which brought him in 1000 more. James VI. of Scotland, afterwards raised to the crown of England, going to Denmark in order to marry the princess Anne, paid a visit to our author in his retirement at Uraniaburg, made him several presents, and with his own hand wrote a copy of verses in his praise; but, soon after the death of King Frederic, he was deprived of his pension, fee, and canonry; upon which, finding himself incapable of bearing the expenses of his observatory, he went to Copenhagen, whither he brought some of his instruments, and continued his astronomical observations in that city, till Valkendorf, chamberlain to the household of Christian IV. commanded him by the king's order to discontinue them. He then removed his family to Rotstock, and afterwards to Holstein, in order to solicit Henry Ranzou to introduce him to the emperor; and that gentleman complying with his request, he was received by the emperor at Prague with the utmost civility and respect. That prince gave him a magnificent house, till he could procure one for him more fit for astronomical observations; assigned him a pension of 3000 crowns; and promised upon the first opportunity, a fee for him and his descendants; but he did not long enjoy this happy situation; for, upon the 24th of October 1601, he died of a retention of urine, in the 55th year of his age, and was interred in a very magnificent manner in the principal church at Prague, where a noble monument was erected to him.\u2014His skill in astronomy is universally known, and he is famed for being the inventor of a new system, which he endeavoured, though without success, to establish upon the ruins of that of Copernicus. He was very credulous with regard to judicial astrology and presages. If he met an old woman when he went out of doors, or a hare upon the road on a journey, he used to turn back immediately, being persuaded that it was a bad omen. When he lived at Uraniaburg, he had at his house a madman, whom he placed at his feet at table, and fed himself. As he imagined that everything spoken by mad persons prefigured something, he carefully observed all that this man said; and because it sometimes proved true, he imagined it might always be depended on. A mere trifle put him in a passion; and against persons of the first rank, with whom it was his duty to keep on good terms, he openly discovered his resentment. He was very apt to rally others, but highly provoked if the same liberty was taken with himself. His principal works are, 1. Progymnasmata astronomiae. 2.

It is bounded on the west by Lochaber, Lorn, and Knapdale; on the north and east, by part of Lochaber and part of Athol; and on the south by Strathern and Monteith.

Much flax is cultivated here. Some years ago, when premiums were given for the greatest crops, from 70 to 120 hogheads of linseed were annually sown, each peck yielding two stones of dressed flax; and when the yarn fold highest, 2000l. worth has been sold out of the country. Oats and potatoes are the other crops. Oats yield from four to six fold at the most, often less; bear from eight to ten, at an average six. The corn raised seldom suffices the number of inhabitants, so they are often obliged to have recourse to importation. From their potatoes some have distilled a very strong spirit, which has been found cheaper than what is distilled from any grain. Starch is also made from them; and, in some places, bread.

See the title BRACHMANS.\n\nTheir name is formed from Brama, their particular deity. They are found in Siam, Malabar, China, Coromandel, and most other eastern nations anywhere civilized; but their chief seat is in Indofian*, or the Mogul's country. They have a language peculiar to themselves, which they call Shanjchrit; in which they have several ancient books, written, as is alleged, by their great prophet Brahma; as the Shaftram, which is their bible; and Porane, a history which they esteem sacred, and pretend to have been dictated by God himself.\n\nThere are several orders of Bramins. Those who mix in society are for the most part very corrupt in their morals: they believe that the water of the Ganges will wash away all their crimes; and, as they are not subject to any civil jurisdiction, live without either restraint or virtue, excepting that character of compassion and charity which is so commonly found in the mild climate of India. The others, who live abstracted from the world, are either weak-minded men or enthusiasts; and abandon themselves to laziness, superstition, and the dreams of metaphysics. We find in their disputes the very same ideas that occur in the writings of our most celebrated metaphysicians; such as, substance, accident, priority, posteriority, immutability, indivisibility, &c.\n\nTheir religion, which was anciently of the allegorical and moral kind, hath degenerated into a heap of extravagant and obscene superstitions, owing to their having realized those fictions which were intended merely as so many symbols and emblems. Were it possible to obtain a sight of their sacred books, the only remains there are of the Indian antiquities, we might in some measure be enabled to remove the veil that envelopes those numerous mysteries; but the following story will show how little reason there is to hope that we shall ever be intrusted with such a communication.\n\nThe emperor Mahmoud Akbar had an inclination to make himself acquainted with the principles of all the religious sects throughout his extensive provinces. Having discarded the superstitious notions with which he had been prepossessed by his education in the Mahometan faith, he resolved to judge for himself. It was easy for him to be acquainted with the nature of those systems that are formed upon the plan of making profestes; but he found himself disappointed in his design when he came to treat with the Indians, who will not admit any person whatever to the participation of their mysteries. Neither the authority nor promises of Akbar could prevail with the Bramins to disclose the tenets of their religion; he was therefore obliged to have recourse to artifice. The stratagem he made use of was to cause a boy, of the name of Feizi, to be committed to the care of these priests, as a poor orphan of the sacerdotal line, who alone could be initiated into the sacred rites of their theology. Feizi, having received the proper instructions for the part he was to act, was conveyed privately to Benares, the seat of knowledge in Indofian; he was received into the house of a learned Bramin, who educated him with the same care as if he had been his own son. After the youth had spent ten years in study, Akbar was desirous of recalling him: but he was struck with the charms of the daughter of his preceptor. The women of the sacerdotal tribe are looked upon as the greatest beauties in Indofian. The old Bramin laid no restraint upon that growing passion of the two lovers: he was fond of Feizi, who had gained his affection by his address and docility; and offered him his daughter in marriage. The young man, divided between love and gratitude, resolved to conceal the fraud no longer; and falling at the feet of the Bramin, discovered the imposture and asked pardon for his offence. The priest, without reproaching him in the least, seized a poignard, which hung at his girdle, and was going to plunge it in his breast, if Feizi had not prevented him by taking hold of his arm. The young man used every means to pacify him, and declared himself ready to do anything to expiate his treachery. The Bramin, bursting into tears, promised to pardon him on condition that he should swear never to translate the Bedac or sacred volumes, or disclose to any person whatever the symbol of the Bramin creed. Feizi readily promised all that the Bramin required: how far he kept his word is not known; but the sacred books of the Indians have never been translated by him, or any one else, to this day. As the Bramins are the only persons who understand the language of the sacred books, their comments on the text are the same as those that have ever been made on religious books; all the maxims which fancy, interest, passion, or false zeal can suggest, are to be found in these volumes.

The first is a vaulted roof, supported on stone columns: it lies open, and all persons, without distinction, are allowed to enter into it. It is adorned with symbolical figures made of wood, as elephants, oxen, and horses. The second part is open in the daytime, and shut at night. It is filled with grotesque and monstrous figures, as men with many heads and arms. The third, which is a kind of chancel, is kept always shut, with a very strong gate. In this is placed the statue of the deity to whom the pagod is dedicated.

With regard to their form and structure, branches are either straight, in form of a pistil, for young horses to form their mouth; or after the constable of France's fashion, proper for a horse that carries his head well. Some are in form of a gigot or leg, which will prevent horses from carrying too low; some are in form of a bent knee, contrived for horses that arm themselves against the operation of the bit; and others after the French fashion, which is hardly above \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of an inch at the sevile hole, and kneed \\( 1\\frac{1}{2} \\) inch at the jarret or ham.\n\nIt is to be observed, 1. That the farther the branch is from the horse's neck, the more effect it will have. 2. That short branches, ceteris paribus, are ruder, and their effects more sudden, than those of longer. 3.

Its greatest length is near 200 miles, and its greatest breadth near 100. Its northern situation makes it very cold for seven or eight months in winter. The soil in general is far from being fruitful, a great part of it consisting of sand; yet there are several fruitful spots in it; and the whole, under the last and present reign, has been greatly improved, and much better peopled. In some parts there is great plenty of potatoes and turnips; in others of buck-wheat, millet, and flax; in others of tobacco, woad, and other herbs for dyeing. All sorts of colour earth, together with alum, saltpetre, amber, iron, stone, and medicinal springs, are found in it. Abundance of cattle, especially sheep, are bred here; and the woods not only supply the inhabitants with fuel, but with timber, charcoal, tar, and wood-ashes, both for domestic uses and for exportation. The culture of silk also is carried on in this country with great success. The principal rivers by which it is watered are the Elbe, the Oder, the Prignitz, the Havel, the Warte, and the Spree. Some of the rivers and lakes abound in fish, and are united by canals for the benefit of navigation. They reckon in the whole Mark 120 towns, above 2500 villages, and about 800,000 inhabitants. The states here consist of the nobility and towns, whose assembly-house is in the Spandau-street at Berlin, and who still enjoy some small remains of their ancient privileges. The hereditary officers of the marquifate are a marshal, chamberlain, cup-bearer, purveyor, usher, treasurer, and ranger. The king of Prussia, who is also elector of Brandenburg, with his whole court, are Calvinists; but the religion of most of the inhabitants is Lutheranism. The churches of both persuasions are well endowed, and the laity jointly employed by the government. The Roman Catholics are also tolerated here. In short, every inhabitant enjoys full liberty of conscience. A great variety of manufactures, most of which were introduced by the French refugees, are carried on in Brandenburg, especially at Berlin and Potsdam; where are also excellent painters, statuaries, and engravers. By means of these manufactures, fabrics, and arts, not only large sums are kept in the country, but also imported from other parts, to which considerable quantities of the manufactures and natural productions are exported. For the education of youth and the advancement of learning, besides Latin schools in several places, and gymnasia, there is an university at Frankfort on the Oder, and an academy of sciences at Berlin.\n\nThe Brandenburg family is of great antiquity. Some historians say it was founded by the Slavonians, who gave it the name of Branber, which signifies the \"Guards of the Forests;\" and the Germans called it Braunburgh. Henry I. surnamed the Fowler, fortified this place in the year 923, to serve as a rampart against the Huns, a warlike nation, who were extremely troublesome by their frequent incursions. He bestowed the government on Sifro, count of Ringelheim, with the title of Margrave or Marquis, which signifies Protector of the Marches or Frontiers, in 923. It descended to Geron, margrave of Lusatia; and in succession of time passed into the families of Staden, Alcania, Bellenstadt, and that of Bavaria, till the emperor Sigismund, with the consent of the states of the empire, in 1416, gave perpetual investiture to Frederick VI. of Nuremberg; who also the following year received from the emperor, at the diet of Constance, the investiture of the county of Brandenburg as Frederick I.; having had previously conferred upon him the dignity of elector and arch-chamberlain of the Holy Roman empire.\n\nBrandenburg remained long in subjection to Poland; and the investiture of Prussia was granted by the Polish kings to each succeeding margrave. Frederick-William, having concluded a treaty with the king of Poland, was acknowledged to be sovereign of Ducal Prussia by an assembly of the states at Konigberg A.D. 1663. By the treaty of Vienna the emperor confirmed this title; and Frederick, the son of Frederick-William, was proclaimed king of Prussia, January 18, 1701. He was succeeded by his son, who performed the greatest services to his country, and prepared the materials of the future grandeur of the late sovereign, Frederick III. who began his reign on the 31st of May 1740, at the age of 28. See PRUSSIA.\n\nAmong the electors he possesses the seventh place. As arch-chamberlain, he carries the sceptre before the emperor at his coronation, and brings him water in a silver basin to wash with. In the college of princes of the empire he has five voices. His allotment, as elector, is 60 horse and 277 foot, or 1828 florins in lieu of them. To the chamber of Wetzlar, his quota is $11,500,000 florins, each term. As to the orders of the knights of the Black Eagle, and of Merit, it is sufficient here to observe, that the former was instituted by Frederic I. at his coronation, and the other by the present king.

It is about 1560 miles in length, and 1000 in breadth; but, measuring along the coast, it is 2000 miles long, and is bordered with mountains that open from time to time, and form good harbours where vessels may lie in safety. It was accidentally discovered by the Portuguese in 1500. Emmanuel king of Portugal had equipped a squadron of 13 sail, carrying 1200 soldiers and sailors destined for the East Indies, under the conduct of Peter Alvarez Cabral. This admiral, quitting Lisbon on the 9th of March 1500, struck out to sea to avoid the coast of Guinea, and steered his course southward, that he might the more easily turn the Cape of Good Hope, which projects a good way into the ocean. On the 24th of April, he got sight of the continent of South America, which he judged to be a large island at some distance from the coast of Africa. Coasting along for some time, he ventured to send a boat on shore; and was astonished to observe the inhabitants entirely different from the Africans in features, hair, and complexion. It was found, however, impracticable to seize upon any of the Indians, who retired with great celerity to the mountains on the approach of the Portuguese; yet, as the sailors had discovered a good harbour, the admiral thought proper to come to an anchor, and called the bay Puerto Seguro. Next day he sent another boat on shore, and had the good fortune to lay hold on two of the natives, whom he clothed and treated kindly, and then dismissed, to make a proper report to their countrymen. The stratagem had the desired effect. The Indians, having heard the relation of the prisoners, immediately crowded to the shore, singing, dancing, and sounding horns of different kinds; which induced Cabral to land, and take solemn possession in the name of his Portuguese majesty.\n\nAs soon as the court of Lisbon had ordered a survey to be taken of the harbours, bays, rivers, and coasts of Brazil, and was convinced that the country afforded neither gold nor silver, they held it in such contempt, that they sent thither none but condemned criminals and abandoned women. Two ships were sent every year from Portugal, to carry the refuse of the kingdom to this new world, and to bring home parrots and woods for the dyers and cabinet-makers. Ginger was afterwards added; but soon after prohibited, left it should interfere with the sale of the same article from India.\n\nIn 1548, the Jews, many of whom had taken refuge in Portugal, beginning to be persecuted by the inquisition, were stripped of their possessions, and banished to Brazil. Here, however, they were not entirely forsaken. Many of them found kind relations and faithful friends; others, who were known to be men of probity and understanding, obtained money in advance from merchants of different nations with whom they had formerly had transactions. By the affluence of some enterprising men, they were enabled to cultivate sugar canes, which they first procured from the island of Madeira. Sugar, which till then had been used only in medicine, became an article of luxury. Princes and great men were all eager to procure themselves this new species of indulgence. This circumstance proved favourable to Brazil, and enabled it to extend its sugar plantations. The court of Lisbon, notwithstanding its prejudices, began to be sensible, that a colony might be beneficial to the mother country, without producing gold or silver; and this settlement, which had been wholly left to the capricious management of the colonists, was now thought to deserve some kind of attention; and accordingly Thomas de Souza was sent thither, in 1549, to regulate and superintend it.\n\nThis able governor began by reducing these men, who had always lived in a state of anarchy, into proper subordination, and bringing their scattered plantations closer together; after which he applied himself to acquire some information respecting the natives, with whom he knew he must be incessantly engaged either in traffic or war. This it was no easy matter to accomplish. Brazil was full of small nations, some of which inhabited the forests, and others lived in the plains and along the rivers. Some had settled habitations; but the greater number of them led a roving life, and most of them had no intercourse with each other. It is not to be supposed that such a people would be at all disposed to submit to the yoke which the Portuguese wanted to put upon them on their arrival. At first they only declined all intercourse with these strangers; but finding themselves pursued in order to be made slaves, and to be employed in the labours of the field, they took the resolution to murder and devour all the Europeans they could seize upon. The friends and relations of the savages that were taken prisoners also ventured to make frequent attempts to rescue them, and were sometimes successful: so that the Portuguese were forced to attend to the double employments of labour and war.\n\nSouza did not bring a sufficient number of forces to change the situation of affairs. Indeed, by building San Salvador, he gave a centre to the colony; but the honour of settling, extending, and making it really useful to the mother-country, was reserved for the Jesuits who attended him. These men, who for their arts of insinuation and address have been equalled by none, dispersed themselves among the Indians. When any of the missionaries were murdered, they were immediately replaced by others; and seeming to be inspired only with sentiments of peace and charity, the Indians, in process of time, grew not only familiar but passionately fond of them. As the missionaires were too few in number to transact all the business themselves, they frequently deputed some of the most intelligent Indians in their stead. These men having distributed hatchets, knives, and looking-glasses, among the savages they met\nmet with, represented the Portuguese as a harmless, humane, and good sort of people.\n\nThe prosperity of the colony of Brazil, which was visible to all Europe, excited the envy of the French, Spaniards, and Dutch successively. The latter, indeed, bid farewell to the conquest of the whole. Their admiral Henry Lonk arrived, in the beginning of the year 1639, with 46 men of war, on the coast of Fernando de Noronha, one of the largest and best fortified captainships of these parts. He reduced it after several obstinate engagements, in which he was always victorious. The troops he left behind subdued the captainships of Temaraca, Pareiba, and Rio Grande, in the years 1633, 1634, and 1635. These, as well as Fernando de Noronha, furnished annually a large quantity of sugar, a great deal of wood for dyeing, and other commodities. The Hollander was so elated with the acquisition of this wealth, which flowed to Amsterdam instead of Lisbon, that they determined to conquer all the Brazils, and intruded Maurice of Nassau with the conduct of this enterprise. That general reached the place of his destination in the beginning of the year 1637. He found the soldiers so well disciplined, the commanders such experienced men, and so much readiness in all to engage, that he directly took the field. He was successively opposed by Albuquerque, Banjola, Lewis Rocca de Borgia, and the Brazilian Cameron, the idol of his people, passionately fond of the Portuguese, brave, active, cunning, and who wanted no qualification necessary for a general, but to have learned the art of war under able commanders. These several chiefs exerted their utmost efforts to defend the possessions that were under their protection; but their endeavours proved ineffectual. The Dutch seized upon the captainships of Siara, Sereipipe, and the greater part of that of Bahia. Seven of the 15 provinces which composed the colony had already submitted to them, and they flattered themselves that one or two campaigns would make them masters of the rest of their enemies possessions in that part of America; when they were suddenly checked by the revolution happening on the banishment of Philip IV., and placing the duke of Braganza on the throne. After this, the Portuguese recovering their spirits, soon drove the Dutch out of Brazil, and have continued masters of it ever since.\n\nThe country of Brazil is divided into the following provinces, viz. Paria, Maragnano, Siara, Rio Grande, Pareiba, Tamaraca, Fernando de Noronha, Sereipipe, Bahia, Porto Seguro, Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Angra, St Vincent, and Del Rey. See these articles.\n\nThe first aspect of the country from the sea is rather unfavourable, as it appears high, rough, and unequal; but, on a more narrow inspection, nothing can be more delightful, the eminences being covered with woods, and the valleys and savannahs with the most refreshing verdure. In so vast a tract of land, it cannot be imagined that the climate will be found at all equal, or the seasons uniform. The northern provinces are subject to heavy rains and variable winds, like other countries under the same parallels. Tornadoes, storms, and the utmost fury of the elements, wreak their vengeance here; while the southerly regions are blest with all the comforts which a fine fertile soil and temperate climate can afford. In some of the provinces, the heat of the climate is thought to prove favourable to the generation of a great variety of poisonous reptiles: some of which, as the liboy or redback snake, are said to extend to the length of 30 feet, and to be two or three yards in circumference. The rattlesnake and other reptiles of the same kind, grow likewise to an enormous size; and the serpent called ibilaboca is affirmed to be 7 yards long, and half a yard in circumference, possessed too of a poison instantaneously fatal to the human race. Here also are scorpions, ant-bears, tygers or mandillos, porcupines, janoweras, and an animal called tapiraffe, which is the production of a bull and an ass, having a great resemblance to both. No country on earth affords a greater number of beautiful birds, nor variety of the most exquisite fruits; but the chief commodities are Brazil-wood, ebony, dyeing woods, ambergris, rosin, balsams, indigo, sweetmeats, sugar, tobacco, gold, diamonds, beautiful pebbles, crystal, emeralds, jasper, and other precious stones; in all which the Portuguese carry on such an amazing trade, as may justly be reputed the support, and indeed the vital fountain, of the mother country. The gold and diamond mines are but a recent discovery: they are first opened in the year 1681; and have since yielded above five millions sterling annually, of which sum a fifth belongs to the crown. So plentiful are diamonds in this country, that the court of Portugal hath found it necessary to refrain their importation, to prevent too great a diminution of their value. They are neither so hard nor so clear as those of the East Indies, nor do they sparkle so much, but they are whiter. The Brazilian diamonds are sold ten per cent. cheaper than the Oriental ones, supposing the weights to be equal. The largest diamond in the world was sent from Brazil to the king of Portugal. It weighs 1680 carats, or 12 ounces; and has been valued at \u00a36,787,500. Some skilful lapidaries, however, are of opinion that this supposed diamond is only a topaz; in which case a very great abatement must be made in its value. The crown revenue arising from this colony amounts to two millions sterling in gold, if we may credit some late writers, besides the duties and customs on merchandise imported from that quarter. This indeed is more than a fifth of the precious metal produced by the mines; but, every other consequent advantage considered, it probably does not much exceed the truth. The excellent confluence of people to the Brazil colonies, as well from other countries as from Portugal, not only enlarges the imports of gold, but, what is of infinitely more importance to Europe in general, the exportation of the manufactures of this hemisphere; of which the principal are the following. Great Britain sends woollen manufactures; such as fine broad medley cloths, fine Spanish cloths, fcarlet and black cloths; ferges, duroys, druggets, sagathies, falloons, camlets, and Norwich stuffs; black Colchester baize; say's, and perpetuans called long ell's; hats, stockings, and gloves. Holland, Germany, and France, chiefly export fine hollands, bone-lace, and fine thread; silk manufactures, pepper, lead, block tin, and other articles, are also sent from different countries. Besides the particulars already specified, England likewise trades with Portugal, for the use of the Brazils, in copper and bras, wrought and unwrought pewter, and all kinds of hardware; all which articles have so enlarged the Portuguese trade, that, instead of 12 ships usually employed in the Brazil commerce, there are now never fewer.\nBrazil-wood fewer than 100 sail of large vessels constantly going and returning to those colonies. To all this may be added the vast slave-trade carried on with the coast of Africa for the use of the Brazil colonies; which, we may believe, employs a great number of shipping, from the multitude of slaves that are annually transported. Indeed the commerce of Brazil alone is sufficient to raise Portugal to a considerable height of naval power, as it maintains a constant nursery of seamen; yet a certain infatuation in the policy of the country has prevented that effect, even amidst all these extraordinary advantages. All the ships in this trade, being under the direction of the government, have their appointed seasons of going and returning, under convoy of a certain number of men of war; nor can a single ship clear out or go, except with the fleet, but by a special license from the king, which is seldom granted; though it is easily determined, that such restrictions can prove no way beneficial to the general commerce, though possibly the crown revenue may be better guarded thereby. The fleets sail in the following order, and at the following stated periods: That to Rio de Janeiro sets sail in January; the fleet to Bahia, or the Bay of All Saints, in February; and the third fleet, to Fernambucca, in the month of March.\n\nBrazil-Wood, or Brazil-wood, an American wood of a red colour, and very heavy.

But the use of it was not, as is generally believed, and the Arundelian marbles assert, previous to the knowledge of iron. They were both first known in the same generation, and first wrought by the same discoverer. And the knowledge of them must have been equally carried over the world afterwards, with the spreading of the colonies of the Noachidae. An acquaintance with the one or the other was absolutely necessary to the existence of the colonists; the clearing away of the woods about their settlements, and the erection of houses for their habitation.\n\nThe ancient Britons, though acquainted from the remotest periods with the use of both these metals, remained long ignorant that they were to be obtained in the island. Before this discovery they imported all their iron and bras from the continent. And when they had at length detected the former in their own hills, and had ceased to introduce it, they continued to receive the latter. Their want of the metal remained, and no mines of it were opened in the island. In the earliest ages whose manners have been delineated by history, we find the weapons of their warriors invariably framed of this fictitious metal; and the most authentic of all the profane records of antiquity, the A-\n\n* Gen. iv.\n\nrundelian marbles, for that reason, mistakenly date the first discovery of iron a couple of centuries below the Trojan war. Every military nation, as such, is naturally studious of brightness in its arms; and the Britons, particularly, gloried in the neatness of theirs. For this reason the nations of the world still fabricated their arms of bras, even long after the Arundelian era for the discovery of iron; and the Britons continued to import it from the continent, though they had found iron to be a native of the country, and could have supplied themselves with a sufficient quantity of it.\n\nMr Whitaker supposes, that when the Britons deprived their iron and bras from the continent, they purchased the latter at an easier expense than the former. The Gauls had many large bras works carried on in the kingdom, but seem to have had but few iron forges within it. And this would naturally induce the Belgae to be less diligent in their inquiry after the veins of copper and calamine at home, than for the courses of iron ore; though the one was equally discoverable in the island as the other, and lay equally within the Belgic regions of it. Bras being thus cheaper than iron, they necessarily formed with it some domestic as well as military implements. Such were common among the Gauls; and such were familiar to the Britons, either imported into the island, as some actually were, or manufactured within it, as others also assuredly were. The Britons had certainly bras foundries erected among them, and minted money, and fabricated weapons of bras.\n\nIn this condition of the works, the Romans entered the island. And seeing so great a demand among the natives for this article, they would speedily instruct them to discover the materials of it among themselves. This must unavoidably have resulted from the conquest of the Romans. The power of surprising their new subjects with so unexpected a discovery would naturally stimulate the pride of the Roman intellect; and the desire of obliging themselves with so cheap a supply of that useful metal, stationary as they were in that kingdom, would also equally actuate the selfishness of the Roman bras. The veins of copper and calamine would be easily found out by an experienced inquirer after them; and the former metal is therefore distinguished among the Welsh, only by the Roman appellation of cyprium, koppr or copper. And many foundries of bras appear to have been established in the island. Some had been erected before, one perhaps within the confines of every kingdom, and probably in the vicinity of every capital. One at least would be necessary, in order to supply the armory of the principality; and one perhaps was sufficient for most of the British states. But several appear now to have been settled in every kingdom, and one perhaps near every stationary town. Two have been discovered in the fingle county of Essex, and within a narrow portion of it, at Fifield and Danbury. And a third was placed upon Easterly Moor in Yorkshire, 12 miles to the north-west of York, and in the neighbourhood of Harrow or Aldborough.\n\nCorinthian Brass, famous in antiquity, is a mixture of gold, silver, and copper. L. Mummius having sacked and burnt the city of Corinth, 146 years before Christ, it is said this metal was formed from the immense quantities of gold, silver, and copper, wherewith\nthat city abounded, thus melted and run together by the violence of the conflagration.\n\nBrass, in the glass trade.\u2014Thrice calcined brass is a preparation which serves the glaziers to give many very beautiful colours to their metal. The manner of preparing it is this: Place thin plates of brass on tiles on the feet of the furnace near the ocelli; let it stand to be calcined there for four days, and it will become a black powder sticking together in lumps. Powder this, sift it fine, and recalcine it four or five days more; it will not then stick together, but remain a loose powder, of a rufflet colour. This is to be calcined a third time in the same manner; but great care must be taken in the third calcination, that it be not overdone nor underdone: the way to be certain when it is right is, to try it several times in glasses while melting. If it makes it, when well purified, to swell, boil, and rise, it is properly calcined; if not, it requires longer time. This makes, according to the different proportions in which it is used, a sea-green, an emerald-green, or a turcoise colour.\n\nBrass, by long calcination alone, and without any mixture, affords a fine blue or green colour for glasses; but they have a method of calcining it also with powdered brimstone, so as to make it afford a red, a yellow, or a chalcedony colour, according to the quantity and other variations in using it. The method of making the calcination is this: Cut thin plates of brass into small pieces with shears, and lay them stratum super stratum, with alternate beds of powdered sulphur, in a crucible; calcine this for 24 hours in a strong fire; then powder and sift the whole; and finally expose this powder upon tiles for 12 days to a reverberating furnace; at the end of this time powder it fine, and keep it for use. The glass-makers have also a method of procuring a red powder from brass, by a more simple calcination, which serves them for many colours. The method of preparing it is this: They put small and thin plates of brass into the arches of the glass furnaces, and leave them there till they are sufficiently calcined, which the heat in that place, not being enough to melt them, does in great perfection. The calcined matter powdered, is of a dusky red, and requires no farther preparation.\n\nBrass-Colour, one prepared by the braziers and colour-men to imitate brass. There are two sorts of it; the red brass or bronze, and the yellow or gilt brass: the latter is made only of copper-filings, the smallest and brightest that can be found; with the former they mix some red ochre, finely pulverized; they are both used with varnish.\u2014In order to make a fine brass that will not take any rust or verdigris, it must be dried with a chafing-dish of coals as soon as it is applied.\u2014The finest brass-colour is made with powder brass imported from Germany, diluted into a varnish, made and used after the following manner: The varnish is composed of one pound four ounces of spirit of wine, two ounces of gum-lac, and two ounces of sandarac; these two last drugs are pulverized separately, and afterwards put to dissolve in spirit of wine, taking care to fill the bottle but half full. The varnish being made, you mix such quantity as you please of it with the pulverized brass, and apply it with a small brush to what you would brass over. But you must not mix too much at once, because the varnish being very apt to dry, you would not have time to employ it all soon enough; it is therefore better to make the mixture at several times. After this manner they brass over figures of platter, which look as well as if they were of cast brass.\n\nBrass-Leaf is made of copper, beaten out into very thin plates, and afterwards rendered yellow. The German artists, particularly those of Nuremberg and Augsburg, are said to possess the best method of giving to these thin plates of copper a fine yellow colour like gold, by simply exposing them to the fumes of zinc, without any real mixture of it with the metal. These plates are cut into little pieces, and then beaten out fine like leaves of gold; after which they are put into books of coarse paper, and sold at a low price for the vulgar kinds of gilding. The pairings or shreds of these very thin yellow leaves being well ground on a marble plate, are reduced to a powder similar to gold; which serves to cover, by means of gum-water, or some other glutinous fluid, the surface of various mouldings or pieces of curious workmanship, giving them the appearance of real bronze, and even of fine gold, at a very trifling expense, because the gold colour of this metallic powder may be easily raised and improved by flaring it on a wide earthen basin over a slow fire.\n\nBrass-Lumps, a common name given by miners to the globular pyrites.

But as many of the species of this genus are of considerable importance as articles of food, we shall here lay before our readers a more particular account of their uses and mode of culture under the names known to practical gardeners.\n\nThe species called campestris grows naturally on the sea-shore near Dover, has a perennial branching stalk, and in this it differs from all the other species. In very severe winters, when the other sorts are destroyed, this is a necessary plant, for the most severe frosts do not injure it. The flower-talks grow from the end of the branches, and spread out horizontally; but those which arise from the centre of the plants grow erect, and seldom put out branches. The cauliflower has been much more improved in Britain than in any other part of Europe. In France they rarely have cauliflowers till Michaelmas, and Holland has been often supplied with them from Britain. In many parts of Germany there were none of them cultivated till within a few years past, and most parts of Europe are supplied with seeds from Britain. That which is generally known by the title of rape or cole-seed is much cultivated in the Isle of Ely, and some other parts of England, for its seed, from which rape-oil is drawn; and it hath also been cultivated of late years, in other places, for feeding of cattle, to great advantage. The cole-feed, when cultivated for feeding of cattle, should be sown about the middle of June. The ground for this should be prepared for it in the same manner as for turnips. The quantity of seeds for an acre of land is from six to eight pounds; and as the price of the feed is not great, so it is better to allow eight\neight pounds; so if the plants are too close in any part they may be easily thinned when the ground is hoed, which must be performed in the same manner as is practiced for turnips, with this difference only, of leaving them much nearer together; for as they have fibrous roots and slender stalks, so they do not require near so much room. These plants should have a second hoeing about five or six weeks after the first, which, if well performed in dry weather, will entirely destroy the weeds, so they will require no farther culture. Where there is not an immediate want of food, these plants had better be kept as a reserve for hard weather, or spring feed, when there may be a scarcity of other green food. If the heads are cut off, and the stalks left in the ground, they will float again early in the spring, and produce a good second crop in April; which may be either fed off, or permitted to run to seed, as is the practice where this is cultivated for the seeds; but if the first is fed down, there should be care taken that the cattle do not destroy their stems, or pull them out of the ground. As this plant is so hardy as not to be destroyed by frost, so it is of great service in hard winters for feeding of ewes; for when the ground is so hard frozen as that turnips cannot be taken up, these plants may be cut off for a constant supply. This will afford late food after the turnips are run to seed; and if it is afterwards permitted to stand for seed, one acre will produce as much as, at a moderate computation, will fell for five pounds, clear of charges. Partridges, pheasants, turkeys, and most other fowl, are very fond of this plant; so that wherever it is cultivated, if there are any birds in the neighbourhood, they will constantly lie among these plants. The seeds of this plant are sown in gardens for winter and spring salads, this being one of the small salad herbs.\n\nThe common white, red, flat, and long-sided cabbages, are chiefly cultivated for autumn and winter use. The seeds of these sorts must be sown the beginning or middle of April, in beds of good fresh earth; and when the young plants have about eight leaves, they should be pricked out into shady borders, about three or four inches square, that they may acquire strength, and to prevent their growing long stalked. About the middle of June you must transplant them out, where they are to remain. If they are planted for a full crop in a clear spot of ground, the distance from row to row should be three feet and a half, and in the rows two feet and a half aifter: if the season should prove dry when they are transplanted out, you must water them every other evening until they have taken fresh root; and afterwards, as the plants advance in height, you should draw the earth about the stems with a hoe, which will keep the earth moist about their roots, and greatly strengthen the plants. These cabbages will some of them be fit for use soon after Michaelmas, and will continue until the end of February, if they are not destroyed by bad weather; to prevent which, the gardeners near London pull up their cabbages in November, and trench their ground up in ridges, laying their cabbages against their ridges as close as possible on one side, burying their stems in the ground; in this manner they let them remain till after Christmas, when they cut them for the market; and although the outer part of the cabbage be decayed (as is often the case in very wet or hard winters), yet, if the cabbages were large and hard when laid, the inside will remain sound.\n\nThe Russian cabbage was formerly in much greater esteem than at present, it being now only to be found in particular gentlemen's gardens, who cultivate it for their own use. This must be sown late in the spring of the year, and managed as those before directed, with this difference only, that they must be sooner planted out, and must have an open clear spot of ground, and require much less distance every way, for it is but a very small hard cabbage. This sort will not continue long before they will break and run up to seed.\n\nThe early and sugar-loaf cabbages are commonly sown for summer use, and are what the gardeners about London commonly call Michaelmas cabbages. The season for sowing of these is about the end of July, or beginning of August, in an open spot of ground; and when the plants have got eight leaves, you must prick them into beds at about three or four inches distance every way, that the plants may grow strong and short stalked; and toward the end of October you should plant them out: the distance that these require is, three feet row from row, and two feet and a half aifter in the rows. The ground must be kept clean from weeds, and the earth drawn up about your cabbage plants. In May, if your plants were of the early kind, they will turn in their leaves for cabbaging; at which time, the gardeners near London, in order to obtain them a little sooner, tie in their leaves close with a slender offer twig to blanch their middle; by which means, they have them at least a fortnight sooner than they could have if they were left untied.\n\nThe early cabbage being the first, we should choose to plant the fewer of them, and a greater quantity of the sugar-loaf kind, which comes after them; for the early kind will not supply the kitchen long, generally cabbaging apace when they begin, and as soon grow hard and burst open; but the sugar-loaf kind is longer before it comes, and is as slow in its cabbaging; and being of a hollow kind, will continue for a good long time. The sugar-loaf kind may be planted out in February, and will succeed as well as if planted earlier; with this difference only, that they will be later before they cabbage. You should also reserve some plants of the early kind in some well-sheltered spot of ground, to supply your plantation, in case of a defect; for in mild winters many of the plants are apt to run to seed, especially when their seeds are sown too early, and in severe winters they are often destroyed.\n\nThe Savoy cabbages are propagated for winter use, as being generally esteemed the better when pinched by the frosts; these must be sown about the end of April, and treated after the manner as was directed for the common white cabbage; with this difference that these may be planted at a closer distance than those; two feet and a half square will be sufficient. These are always much better when planted in an open situation, which is clear from trees and hedges; for in clove places they are very subject to be eaten almost up by caterpillars and other vermin, especially if the autumn prove dry.\n\nThe broccoli may also be treated in the same manner, but need not be planted above one foot aifter in the rows, and the rows two feet distance; these are ne-\nver eaten till the frost hath rendered them tender; for otherwise they are tough and bitter.\n\nThe seeds of the broccoli (of which there are several kinds, viz. the Roman or purple, the Neapolitan or white, and the black broccoli, with some others, but the Roman is preferred to them all), should be sown about the latter end of May, or beginning of June, and when the plants are grown to have eight leaves, transplant them into beds (as was directed for the common cabbage); and toward the latter end of July they will be fit to plant out, which should be done into some well-sheltered spot of ground, but not under the drip of trees: the distance there require is about a foot and a half in the rows, and two feet row from row. The soil in which they should be planted ought to be rather light than heavy: if your plants succeed well (as there will be little reason to doubt, unless the winter prove extremely hard), they will begin to throw their small heads, which are somewhat like a cauliflower, but of a purple colour, about the end of December, and will continue eatable till the middle of April. The brown or black broccoli is by many persons greatly esteemed, though it doth not deserve a place in the kitchen-garden where the Roman broccoli can be obtained, which is much sweeter, and will continue longer in season: indeed, the brown sort is much harder, so that it will thrive in the coldest situations, where the Roman broccoli is sometimes destroyed in very hard winters. The brown sort should be sown in the middle of May, and managed as hath been directed for the common cabbage, and should be planted at the same distance, which is about two feet and a half a furlong. This will grow very tall, so should have the earth drawn up to their stems as they advance in height. This doth not form heads so perfect as the Roman broccoli; the stems and hearts of the plants are the parts which are eaten. The Roman broccoli (if well managed) will have large heads, which appear in the centre of the plants like clutters of buds. These heads should be cut before they run up to feed, with about four or five inches of the stem; the skin of the stems should be stripped off before they are boiled. After the first heads are cut off, there will be a great number of side-shoots produced from the stems, which will have small heads to them, but are full as well flavoured as the large. The Naples broccoli hath white heads very like those of the cauliflower, and eats so like it as not to be distinguished from it.\u2014Besides this first crop of broccoli (which is usually sown in the end of May), it will be proper to sow another crop the beginning of July, which will come in to supply the table the latter end of March and the beginning of April; and being very young, will be extremely tender and sweet.\n\nIn order to save good seeds of this kind of broccoli, you should reserve a few of the largest heads of the first crop, which should be let remain to run up to seed, and all the under shoots should be constantly stripped off, leaving only the main stem to flower and seed. If this be duly observed, and no other sort of cabbage permitted to seed near them, the seeds will be as good as those procured from abroad, and the sort may be preserved in perfection many years.\n\nThe turnip-rooted cabbage was formerly more cultivated in Britain than at present; for since other sorts have been introduced which are much better flavoured, this sort has been neglected. There are some persons who esteem this kind for soups, but it is too strong for most palates; and is seldom good but in hard winters, which will render it tender and less strong. At the end of June the plants should be transplanted out where they are to remain, allowing them two feet distance every way, observing to water them until they have taken root; and as their stems advance, the earth should be drawn up to them with a hoe, which will preserve a moisture about their roots, and prevent their stems from drying and growing woody, so that the plants will grow more freely; but it should not be drawn very high, for as it is the globular part of the stalk which is eaten, so that should not be covered. In winter they will be fit for use, when they should be cut off, and the stalks pulled out of the ground and thrown away, being good for nothing after the stems are cut off. As food for cattle, however, the cultivation of this species deserves particular attention. See Agriculture Index.\n\nThe curled colewort or Siberian broccoli is now more generally esteemed than the former, being extremely hardy, so is never injured by cold, but is always sweeter in severe winters than in mild seasons. This may be propagated by sowing of the seeds the beginning of July; and when the plants are strong enough for transplanting, they should be planted in rows about a foot and a half a furlong, and ten inches distance in the rows. These will be fit for use after Christmas, and continue good until April, so that they are very useful in a family.\n\nThe mule cabbage. This may be propagated in the same manner as the common cabbage, and should be allowed the same distance: it will be fit for use in October, November, and December; but, if the winter proves hard, these will be destroyed much sooner than the common sort.\n\nThe common colewort or Dorsetshire kale, is now almost lost near London, where their markets are usually supplied with cabbage plants instead of them. The best method to cultivate this plant in the fields is, to sow the seeds about the beginning of July, choosing a moist soil, which will bring up the plants in about ten days or a fortnight; the quantity of seed for an acre of land is nine pounds: when the plants have got five or six leaves they should be hoed, as is practised for turnips, cutting down all the weeds from amongst the plants, and also thinning the plants where they are too thick; but they should be kept thicker than turnips, because they are more in danger of being destroyed by the fly: this work should be performed in dry weather, that the weeds may be killed. About six weeks after, the plants should have a second hoeing, which, if carefully performed in dry weather, will entirely destroy the weeds, and make the ground clean, so that they will require no farther culture: in the spring they may be either drawn up and carried out to feed the cattle, or they may be turned in to feed upon them as they stand; but the former method is to be preferred, because there will be little waste; whereas, when the cattle are turned in amongst the plants, they will tread down and destroy more than they eat, especially if they are not fenced off by hurdles.\n\nThe two last sorts of cabbages are varieties fit for a botanic garden, but are plants of no use. They are annual\nBrassicas, annual plants, and perish when they have perfected their seeds.\n\nThe best method to save the seeds of all the sorts of cabbages is, about the end of November you should make choice of some of your best cabbages, which you should pull up, and carry to some shed or other covered place, where you should hang them up for three or four days by their stalks, that the water may drain from between their leaves; then plant them in some border near a hedge or pile, quite down to the middle of the cabbage, leaving only the upper part of the cabbage above ground, observing to raise the earth above it, so that it may stand a little above the level of the ground; especially if the ground is wet, they will require to be raised pretty much above the surface. If the winter should prove very hard, you must lay a little straw or pease haulm lightly upon them, to secure them from the frost, taking it off as soon as the weather proves mild, least by keeping them too close they should rot.\n\nIn the spring of the year these cabbages will shoot out strongly, and divide into a great number of small branches: you must therefore support their stems, to prevent their being broken off by the wind; and if the weather should be very hot and dry when they are in flower, you should refresh them with water once a week all over the branches, which will greatly promote their feeding, and preserve them from mildew. When the pods begin to change brown, you will do well to cut off the extreme part of every shoot with the pods, which will strengthen your seeds; for it is generally observed, that those seeds which grow near the top of the shoots, are very subject to run to seed before they cabbage; so that by this there will be no loss, but a great advantage. When your seeds begin to ripen, you must be particularly careful that the birds do not destroy it, for they are very fond of these seeds. The best method to prevent this, is to get a quantity of birdlime, and dawb over a parcel of slender twigs, which should be fastened at each end to stronger sticks, and placed near the upper part of the seed in different places, so that the birds may alight upon them, by which means they will be fastened thereto; where you must let them remain, if they cannot get off themselves; and although there should not above two or three birds be caught, yet it will sufficiently terrify the rest, that they will not come to that place again for a considerable time after.\n\nWhen your seed is fully ripe, you must cut it off; and after drying, thrash it out, and preserve it in bags for use.\n\nBut in planting of cabbages for seed, it will be proper never to plant more than one sort in a place, or near one another: for example, never plant red and white cabbages near each other, nor Savoy with white or red cabbages; for they will, by the commixture of their effluvia, produce a mixture of kinds: and it is said to be owing to this neglect, that the gardeners rarely save any good red cabbage seed in Britain, but are obliged to procure fresh seeds from abroad; as supposing the soil or climate of Britain alters them from red to white, and of a mixed kind betwixt both; whereas, if they should plant red cabbages by themselves for seeds, and not suffer any other to be near them, they might continue the kind as good in Britain as in any other part of the world.\n\nCauliflowers have of late years been so far improved in Britain, as to exceed in goodness and magnitude what are produced in most parts of Europe, and by the skill of the gardener are continued for several months together; but the most common season for the great crops is in May, June, and July. Having procured a parcel of good seed, you must sow it about the 21st of August, upon an old cucumber or melon bed, fitting a little earth over the seeds, about a quarter of an inch thick; and if the weather should prove extremely hot and dry, you should shade the beds with mats, to prevent the earth from drying too fast, and give it gentle waterings as you may see occasion. In about a month's time after sowing, your plants will be fit to prick out: you should therefore put some fresh earth upon your cucumber or melon beds; or where these are not to be had, some beds should be made with a little new dung, which should be trodden down close, to prevent the worms from getting through it; but it should not be hot dung, which would be hurtful to the plants at this season, especially if it proves hot; into this bed you should prick your young plants at about two inches square, observing to shade and water them at first planting; but do not water them too much after they are growing, nor suffer them to receive too much rain if the season should prove wet, which would be apt to make them black blanched, as the gardeners term it, which is no less than a rottenness in their stems, and is the destruction of the plants so affected. In this bed they should continue till about the 30th of October, when they must be removed into the place where they are to remain during the winter season; which, for the first sowing, is commonly under bell or hand glasses, to have early cauliflowers, and these should be of an early kind: but in order to have a succession during the season, you should be provided with another more late kind, which should be sown four or five days after the other, and managed as was directed for them. In order to have very early cauliflowers, you should make choice of a good rich spot of ground that is well defended from the north, east, and west winds, with hedges, pales, or walls; but the first are to be preferred, if made with reeds, because the winds will fall dead in these, and not reverberate as by pales or walls. This ground should be well trenched, burying therein a good quantity of rotten dung; then level your ground, and if it be naturally a wet soil, you should raise it up in beds about two feet and a half, or three feet broad, and four inches above the level of the ground; but if your ground is moderately dry, you need not raise it at all: then plant your plants, allowing about two feet six inches distance from glass to glass in the rows, always putting two good plants under each glass, which may be at about four inches from each other; and if you design them for a full crop, they may be three feet and a half row from row: but if you intend to make ridges for cucumbers between the rows of cauliflower plants (as is generally practised by the gardeners near London), you must then make your rows about eight feet asunder; and the ground between the rows of cauliflowers may be planted with cabbage plants, to be drawn off for coleworts in the spring. When you have planted your plants, if the ground is very dry, you should give them a little water, and then let your glasses over them, which may remain quite close down over them, till\ntill they have taken root, which will be in about a week or ten days time, unless there should be a kindly shower of rain; in which case you may set off the glases, that the plants may receive the benefit of it; and in about ten days after planting, you should be provided with a parcel of forked sticks or bricks, with which you should raise your glases about three or four inches on the side toward the south, that your plants may have free air; in this manner your glases should remain over the plants night and day, unless in frothy weather, when you should set them down as close as possible; or if the weather should prove very warm, which many times happens in November, and sometimes in December, in this case you should keep your glases off in the day-time, and put them on only in the night, lest, by keeping the glases over them too much, you should draw them into flower at that season; which is many times the case in mild winters, especially if unskillfully managed. Toward the latter end of February, if the weather proves mild, you should prepare another good spot of ground to remove some of the plants into, from under the glases, which should be well dugged and trenched (as before): then set off your glases; and, after making choice of one of the most promising plants under each glas, which should remain, take away the other plant, by raising it up with a trowel, &c., so as to preserve as much earth to the root as possible; but take care not to disturb or prejudice the roots of the plants which remain. Then plant the plants which you have taken out at the distance before directed, viz. if for a full crop, three feet and a half, row from row; but if for ridges of cucumbers between them, eight feet, and two feet four inches distance in the rows: then, with a small hoe, draw the earth up to the stems of the plants which were left under the glases, taking great care not to let the earth fall into their hearts; and set your glases over them again, raising your props an inch or two higher than before, to give them more air, observing to take them off whenever there may be some gentle showers, which will greatly refresh the plants.\n\nIn a little time after, if you find your plants grow so fast as to fill the glases with their leaves, you should then slightly dig about the plants, and raise the ground about them in a bed broad enough for the glases to stand, about four inches high, which will give your plants a great deal of room, by raising the glases so much higher when they are set over them; and by this means they might be kept covered until April, which otherwise they could not, without prejudice to the leaves of the plants; and this is a great advantage to them, for many times we have returns of severe frosts at the latter end of March, which prove very hurtful to these plants, if exposed thereto, especially after having been nursed up under glases.\n\nAfter you have finished your beds, you may set your glases over your plants again, observing to raise your props pretty high, especially if the weather be mild, that they may have free air to strengthen them; and in mild soft weather set off your glases, as also in gentle showers of rain; and now you must begin to harden them by degrees to endure the open air; however, it is advisable to let your glases remain over them as long as possible, if the nights should be frothy, which will greatly forward your plants; but you must not let your glases remain upon them in very hot sunshine, especially if their leaves press against the sides of the glases; for it hath often been observed in such cases, that the moisture which hath risen from the ground, together with the perspiration of the plants, which by the glases remaining over them hath been detained upon the leaves of the plants, when the sun hath shone hot upon the sides of the glases, have acquired such a powerful heat from the beams thereof, as to scald all their larger leaves, to the no small prejudice of the plants: nay, sometimes large quantities of plants have been so affected therewith, as never to be worth anything after.\n\nIf your plants have succeeded well, toward the end of April some of them will begin to fruit: you must therefore look over them carefully every other day, and when you see the flower plainly appear, you must break down some of the inner leaves over it to guard it from the sun, which would make the flower yellow and unsightly if exposed thereto; and when you find your flower at its full bigness (which you may know by its outside parting as if it would run), you must then draw it out of the ground, and not cut them off, leaving the stalk in the ground, as is by some practised; and if they are designed for present use, you may cut them out of their leaves; but if designed to keep, you should preserve their leaves about them, and put them into a cool place; the best time for pulling them is in a morning, before the sun hath exhaled the moisture; for cauliflowers pulled in the heat of the day, lose that firmness which they naturally have, and become tough.\n\nBut to return to our second crop (the plants being raised and manured as was directed for the early crop, until the end of October), you must then prepare some beds, either to be covered with glass-frames, or arched over with hoops, to be covered with mats, &c. These beds should have some dung laid at the bottom, about six inches or a foot thick, according to the size of your plants; for if they are small, the bed should be thicker of dung to bring them forward, and so vice versa; this dung should be beat down close with a fork, in order to prevent the worms from finding their way through it; then lay some good fresh earth about four or five inches thick thereon, in which you should plant your plants about two inches and a half square, observing to shade and water them until they have taken new root: but you must not keep your coverings close, for the warmth of the dung will occasion a large damp in the bed, which, if pent in, will greatly injure the plants. When your plants have taken root, you must give them as much free open air as possible, by keeping the glases off in the day-time as much as the weather will permit; and in the night, or at such times as the glases require to be kept on, raise them up with props to let in fresh air, unless in frothy weather; at which time the glases should be covered with mats, straw, peat-haulm, &c., but this is not to be done but in very hard frosts; you must also observe to guard them against great rain, which in winter time is very hurtful to them, but in mild weather, if the glases are kept on, they should be propped to admit fresh air; and if the under leaves grow yellow and decay, be sure to pick them off: for if the weather should prove very bad in winter, so that you should be obliged to keep them close covered for two or three days together, as it sometimes happens,\nthese decayed leaves will render the inclosed air very noxious; and the plants perishing pretty much at that time, are often destroyed in vast quantities.\n\nIn the beginning of February, if the weather be mild, you must begin to harden your plants by degrees, that they may be prepared for transplantation: the ground where you intend to plant your cauliflowers out (which should be quite open from trees, &c. and rather moist than dry), having been well dugged and dug, should be fown with radishes a week or fortnight before you intend to plant out your cauliflowers; the sowing of radishes is particularly mentioned, because if there are not some radishes amongst them, and the month of May should prove hot and dry, as it sometimes happens, the fly will seize your cauliflowers, and eat their leaves full of holes, to their prejudice, and sometimes their destruction; whereas, if there are radishes upon the spot, the flies will take to them, and never meddle with the cauliflowers so long as they last: indeed, the gardeners near London mix spinach with their radish-feed, and so have a double crop; which is an advantage where ground is dear, or where persons are straitened for room; otherwise it is very well to have only one crop amongst the cauliflowers, that the ground may be cleared in time.\n\nYour ground being ready and the season good, about the middle of February you may begin to plant out your cauliflowers; the distance which is generally allowed by the gardeners near London (who plant other crops between their cauliflowers to succed them, as cucumbers for pickling, and winter cabbages (is every other row four feet and a half apart, and the intermediate rows two feet and a half, and two feet two inches distance in the rows; so that in the later end of May or beginning of June (when the radishes and spinach are cleared off), they put in seeds of cucumbers for pickling, in the middle of the wide rows, at three feet and a half apart; and in the narrow rows plant cabbages for winter use, at two feet two inches distance, so that these stand each of them exactly in the middle of the square between four cauliflower plants; and these after the cauliflowers are gone off, will have full room to grow, and the crop be hereby continued in a succession through the whole season.\n\nThere are many people who are very fond of watering cauliflower plants in summer; but the gardeners near London have almost wholly laid aside this practice, as finding a deal of trouble and charge to little purpose; for if the ground be very dry as not to produce tolerable good cauliflowers without water, it seldom happens that watering of them makes them much better; and when once they have been watered, if it is not constantly continued, it had been much better for them if they never had any; as also, if it be given them in the middle of the day, it rather helps to leal them: so that, upon the whole, if care be taken to keep the earth drawn up to their stems, and clear them from every thing that grows near them, that they may have free open air, you will find that they will succeed better without than with water, where any of these cautions are not strictly observed.\n\nBut in order to have a third crop of cauliflowers, you should make a slender hot-bed in February, in which you should sow the seeds, covering them a quarter of an inch thick with light mould, and covering the bed with glass-frames. When the plants are come up, and have grown four or five leaves, you should prepare another hot-bed to prick them into, which may be about two inches square; and in the beginning of April harden them by degrees, to fit them for transplanting, which should be done the middle of that month, at the distance directed for the second crop, and must be managed accordingly: these (if the soil is moist where they are planted, or the season cool and moist) will produce good cauliflowers about a month after the second crop is gone, whereby their season will be greatly prolonged.\n\nThere is also a fourth crop of cauliflowers, which is raised by sowing the seed about the 23rd of May; and being transplanted, as hath been before directed, will produce good cauliflowers in a kindly season and good soil after Michaelmas, and continue through October and November, and if the season permit often a great part of December.\n\nAll the species of cabbage are supposed to be hard of digestion, to afford little nourishment, and to produce flatulencies, though probably on no very good foundation. They tend strongly to putrefaction, and run into this state sooner than almost any other vegetable; when putrefied, their smell is likewise the most offensive, greatly resembling that of putrefied animal substances. A decoction of them is said to loosen the belly. Of all these plants cauliflower is reckoned the easiest of digestion. The white is the most fetid, and the red most emollient or laxative; a decoction of this last is recommended for softening acrimonious humours in some disorders of the breath, and in hoarsenesses. The red cabbage is chiefly used for pickling. In some countries they bury the white cabbage when full grown in the autumn, and thus preserve it all winter. The Germans cut them to pieces, and, along with some aromatic herbs and salt, press them close down in a tub where they soon ferment, and are eaten under the name of Sour-croft.

His skill in architecture appears from Henry VII.'s chapel at Westminster, and the chapel of St George at Windsor, as he had a principal concern and direction in the building of the former, and the finishing and bringing to perfection the latter, to which he was also a liberal benefactor. In the middle of the south aisle of the above chapel is a spacious chapel built by him, and still called by his name. He died in 1501; and was interred in the above chapel, probably under the stone where lies Dr Waterland; for, on opening the vault for that gentleman, who died in 1740, a leaden coffin of ancient form was found, which, by other appearances, was judged to be that of Sir Reginald, and was, by order of the dean, immediately arched over.\n\nBray, Dr Thomas, an eminent, learned, and pious divine, was born at Marton, in Shropshire, in the year 1656, and educated at Oxford.

He now engaged in several noble undertakings. He procured sums to be raised for purchasing small libraries for the use of the poor ministers in the several parts of our plantations; and the better to promote this design, he published two books; one entitled Bibliotheca parochialis, or a scheme of such theological and other heads as seem requisite to be perused or occasionally consulted by the clergy, together with a catalogue of books which may be profitably read on each of those points; the other, Apologetical charity, its nature and excellency considered. He endeavoured to get a fund established for the propagation of the gospel, especially among the uncultivated Indians; and by his means a patent was obtained for erecting the corporation called The Society for the propagation of the gospel.

See Baker, Baking, and Barm.\n\nThe grains of all vegetables are almost entirely composed of substances very proper for the nourishment of animals; and amongst grains those which contain a farinaceous matter are the most agreeable and most nutritious.\n\nMan who appears to be designed by nature to eat of all substances which are capable of nourishing him, and still more of vegetables than animals, has, from time immemorial, and in all parts of the earth, used farinaceous grains as the principal basis of his food: but as these grains cannot be without difficulty eaten by men in their natural state, this active and intelligent animal has gradually found means not only to extract the farinaceous part, that is, the only nutritive part of these grains, but also to prepare it so that it becomes a very agreeable and wholesome aliment, such as the bread we now generally eat.\n\nNothing appears so easy at first sight as to grind corn, to make a paste with the flour and water, and to bake this paste in an oven. They who are accustomed to enjoy the advantages of the finest human inventions, without reflecting on the labour it has cost to complete them, think all these operations common and trivial. However, it appears very certain, that for a long time men no otherwise prepared their corn than by boiling and forming compact viscous cakes, not very agreeable to the taste, and of difficult digestion, before they were able to make bread of good taste and quality, as we have now. It was necessary to invent and complete ingenious machines for grinding corn, and separating the pure flour with little trouble and labour; and that inquiries or rather some happy chance, which some observing person availed himself of, should discover, that flour, mixed with a certain quantity of water, is susceptible of a fermentation which almost entirely destroys its acidity, heightens its taste, and renders it proper to make a light bread, very agreeable to the taste, and of easy digestion.\n\nThis essential operation, on which the good quality of bread depends, is entirely of the province of chemistry. It would add to the honour of the ancient cultivators of chemistry, to attribute to them so useful and important a discovery; but, unhappily, it is too probable that they had no share in it. The ancient chemists were engaged in other pursuits than that of bread and other common objects. They hoped to make gold; and what is bread in comparison with gold?\n\nHowever that be, to the fortunate invention of raising the paste before baking we owe the perfection of the art of making bread. This operation consists in keeping some paste or dough, till by a peculiar spirituous fermentation it swells, rarefies, and acquires a smell and taste quick, pungent, spirituous, somewhat sour, and rather disagreeable. This fermented dough is well worked with some fresh dough, which is by that mixture and moderate heat disposed to a similar but less advanced fermentation than that above mentioned. By this fermentation the dough is attenuated, and divided; air is introduced into it, which being incapable of disengaging itself from the tenacious and solid paste, forms in it small cavities, raises and swells it: hence the small quantity of fermented paste which disposes the rent to ferment, is called leaven, from the French word lever, signifying to raise.\n\nWhen the dough is thus raised, it is in a proper state to be put into the oven; where, while it is baked, it dilates\nBread dilates itself still more by the rarefaction of the air, and of the spirituous substance it contains, and it forms a bread full of eyes or cavities; consequently light, and entirely different from the heavy, compact, viscous, and indigested masses, made by baking unfermented dough.\n\nThe invention of beer, or wine of grains, furnishes a new matter useful in the making of bread. This matter is the froth which forms upon the surface of these liquors during fermentation. When it is mixed with dough, it raises it better and more quickly than ordinary leaven. It is called yeast or barm. By means of this, the finest lightest bread is made. It often happens, that bread made with leavened dough has a fourth and not agreeable taste; which may proceed from too great a quantity of leaven, or from leaven in which the fermentation has advanced too far. This inconvenience does not happen to bread made with yeast; because the fermentation of this substance is not too far advanced, or because more attention is given to that finer bread.\n\nIt may be asked, Why, since dough is capable of fermenting spontaneously and singly, as we see from the leaven, a substance is added to dispose it to ferment? The true reason is, That all the parts of a fermenting substance do not ferment at the same time, nor to the same degree; so that some parts of this substance have finished their fermentation, while others have not yet begun. The fermentable liquors which contain much sugar, as hydromel, and must of wines, give proofs of this truth; for, after these liquors have become very vinous, they have still very distinctly a saccharine taste; but all saccharine matter is still susceptible of fermentation; and, in fact, if vinous hydromel, or must, or even new beer, be distilled, so that all their ardent spirit shall be separated, and the residues diluted with water, we shall see a second fermentation take place, and a new quantity of ardent spirit formed.\n\nThe same thing precisely happens to dough, and still more sensibly, from its viscosity and want of fluidity; so that if it be left to ferment alone, and without the help of leaven, as the fermentation proceeds very slowly and insensibly, the parts which ferment first will have become four and vapour before all the rest be sufficiently attenuated and changed, by which the bread will acquire a disagreeable taste.\n\nA mixture of a small quantity of leaven with dough effectually prevents this inconvenience; because the effect of this leaven, and of all fermenting substances, is to dispose to a similar fermentation all matters capable of it, with which it is mixed; or rather, by means of leaven, the fermentation of all the parts of such substances is effected more nearly at the same time.\n\nBread well raised and baked differs from unfermented bread, not only in being less compact, lighter, and of a more agreeable taste, but also in being more easily masticable with water, with which it does not form a viscous mass, which circumstance is of great importance in digestion.\n\nIt is observable, that without bread, or somewhat of this form, no nation seems to live. Thus the Lapps, having no corn of their own, make a sort of bread of their dried fishes, and of the inner rind of the pine, which seems to be used, not so much for their nourishment as for supplying a dry food. For this mankind seem to have an universal appetite, rejecting bland, slippery, and mucilaginous foods. This is not commonly accounted for, but seems to depend on very simple principles. The preparation of our food depends on the mixture of the animal fluids in every stage. Among others the saliva is necessary, which requires dry food as a necessary stimulus to draw it forth, as bland, slippery, fluid aliments are too inert, and make too short flay in the mouth, to produce this effect, or to cause a sufficient degree of manducation to emulsify that liquor. For this reason we commonly use dry bread along with animal food, which otherwise would be too quickly swallowed. For blending the oil and water of our food nothing is so fit as bread, assisted by a previous manducation. For which purpose, bread is of like necessity in the stomach, as it is proper that a substance of solid consistence should be long retained there. Now the animal fluids must be mixed with our aliments, in order to change the acetylicity it undergoes. But liquid foods would not attain this end, whereas the solid stimulates and emulsifies the glands of the stomach. The bread then appears to be exceedingly proper, being bulky without too much solidity, and firm without difficulty of foliation.\n\nAmong the ancients we meet with various denominations of bread; as, 1. Panis filigenesus, called allo Chamber's mundus, athleticus, ifungia, colophius, and robys, answering to our white bread; being made of the purest flour of the best wheat, and only used by the richer sort. 2. Panis secundus or secundarius, called allo similacrus or similagineus, the next in purity; being made of fine flour, only all the bran not sifted out. 3. Autopyrus, called allo syncomitus and confusaneus, made of the whole substance of the wheat, without either retrenching the finer flour or coarser bran; answering to our household bread. 4. Cacabaceus, apparently the same with what was otherwise denominated fordides, as being given to dogs; furfuraceus, furfureus, or furfuratius, because made in great part of bran; and, in the middle age, bilis, on account of its brownness; sometimes allo leibo. There were other sorts of bread, denominated from the manner in which they were made, or the uses they were applied to; as, 1. The militaris, which was prepared by the soldiers and officers in camp with their own hands; for which purpose some had hand-mills, others pounded the corn in a mortar, and baked it on the coals. 2. Clibanites, that baked in an oven, by way of contradiction from that baked on the hearth or under the embers. 3. That called subcinereus, or sub cinere coctus; sometimes allo reveratus, because it was to be turned in the baking. 4. Nauticus, answering to our sea-biscuit, and denominated accordingly bis coctus, because baked several times over to make it keep the longer. Other kinds of bread were denominated from their qualities and accidents; as, 1. The panis ficetus, that which had been long baked; such as were the bis coctus, naval and buccellated bread. 2. Madidus, a sort made of rye or bear, sometimes also made of fine flour, wherewith they smeared their faces, by way of a cosmetic, to render them smooth. 3. Acidus, or sour bread, which was acidulated with vinegar. 4. Azymus, that unleavened or unfermented.\n\nThe French have also a great variety of breads; as queen's\nqueen's bread, alamode bread, bread de Segovie, de Gentilly, quality-bread, &c. all prepared in peculiar manners by the bakers of Paris. The bread de Gonelle excels all others, on account of the waters at Gonelle, a town three leagues from Paris. It is light, and full of eyes, which are the marks of its goodness.\n\nPain de menage, is that which each family bakes for itself. Spice-bread, pain d'epice, denotes bread baked and iced over with the foam taken off sugar in refining houses; it is sometimes also made with honey and other sorts of leavening, and answers to what the ancients call panis mellitus.\n\nAmong us, bread is chiefly divided into white, wheaten, and household; differing only in degrees of purity. In the first, all the bran is separated; in the second, only the coarser; in the third, none at all: so that fine bread is made only of flour; wheaten bread of flour and a mixture of the finer bran; and household, of the whole substance of the grain, without taking out either the coarse bran or fine flour. We also meet with ymnel bread, manchet or roll bread, and French bread: which are only so many denominations of the finest and whitest bread, made of the purest flour; except that in ill-roll bread there is an addition of milk; and in French bread, of eggs and butter also.\n\nIn Lancashire, and several of the northern counties of England, they have several sorts of oaten bread; as,\n\n1. The bannock, which is an oat-cake, kneaded only with water, and baked on the embers.\n2. Clap-bread, which is made into thin hard cakes.\n3. Bitchinets bread, which is made of thin batter, and made into thin soft oat-cakes.\n4. Riddle-cakes, which are thick and four, have but little leaven, and are kneaded stiff. And,\n5. Jannock, which is oaten bread made up into loaves.\n\nAdd to these, peafe-bread, much used in many parts of Scotland; being bread consisting either wholly of the flour of pease, or of this and oat-meal mixed: the dough, sometimes leavened, sometimes made only with water, is formed either into bannocks or cakes, and baked over the embers; or into what they call baps, i.e. a kind of flatfish rolls, and baked in the oven. In the statute of affize of bread and ale, 51 Hen. III. mention is made of wafel-bread, cocket bread, and bread of treet; which answer to the three kinds of bread now in use, called white, wheaten, and household bread. In religious houses, they heretofore distinguished bread by the names esquires bread, panis armigerorum; monks bread, panis conventualis; boys bread, panis puerorum; and servants bread, panis famulorum, called also panis servientalis. A like distribution obtained in the households of nobles and princes; where, however, we find some other denominations; as messengers bread, panis nuncius, that given to messengers as a reward of their labour; court-bread, panis curialis, that allowed by the lord for the maintenance of his household; eleemosynary bread, that distributed to the poor by way of alms.\n\nIt is for the interest of the community that the food of the poor should be as various as possible, that, in time of dearth and scarcity of the ordinary kinds, they may not be without ready and cheap resources. To the discovery of such resources several benevolent philosophers having successfully turned their inquiries, we shall lay before the reader the result of their experiments.\n\n1. Bread of Potatoes. Potatoes, previously deprived of their skin, cut into thin slices, and put between paper, will dry in a heat somewhat less than 300\u00b0 Centigrade. By this process they lose about two-thirds of their weight, and they may then be reduced to a fine powder. A little of this powder thrown upon the fire sends out a smoke, accompanied with a smell resembling burnt bread. As this smell is perceived from all farinaceous vegetables, when treated in the same manner, M. Parmentier thinks it may be considered as the characteristic of the presence of an amylaceous matter. This smell does not, however, he observes, arise from the amylaceous or fibrous part separately, but from both taken together. The powder of potatoes, obtained in the manner described above, has the smell and taste of wheat; and, like it, is devoured by rats and mice; but, even when most finely powdered, it has not the feel or brightness of the flour of wheat; although, on a chemical analysis, it yields the same products. It is also nutritious, and keeps well for a long time.\n\nFinding so great a similarity between the meal of wheat and what may be called the meal of potatoes, M. Parmentier next endeavoured to make bread of them when mixed in different proportions. His trials were made with one-fourth, one-third, one-half, and two-thirds, of the potato-meal, the remainder being flour from wheat. These proportions, with the addition of a little salt and yeast, yielded bread which was well tasted, but which had fermented little, was brown, and covered with hard brown crusts. Bread made from the meal of potatoes alone, with the addition of salt and yeast, was eatable, but very heavy, unfermented, and exceedingly brown. This bread, from the meal of potatoes alone, was apt to crumble into powder. To give it more adhesion, he mixed with the meal a decoction of bran, or a mixture of honey and water; either of which made it lighter and more fermented: it obtained also a crust of a golden colour, became well tasted, and sufficiently adhesive. M. Parmentier obtained bread also, well fermented, and of a good colour and taste, from a mixture of raw potato-pulp with meal of wheat, or potato-meal, with the addition of yeast and salt.\n\nPotatoes, when used for making bread, are not readily disposed to ferment; without which, bread is very insipid, and not easily digested. But M. Parmentier found, from a variety of experiments, that good bread might be made from equal quantities of flour and potato-meal. He concludes, therefore, with recommending the mixture of potatoes, in times of scarcity, with the flour of wheat, instead of employing rye, barley, or oats, as has frequently been done.\n\nWhen grain is altogether wanting, he recommends the use of bread made from a mixture of the amylaceous powder of potatoes and of their pulp, this mixture being fermented with leaven or with honey. The meal of this root, when diluted with hot water, acquires a tenacious and gluey consistence. However fair the meal of potatoes may be, it always gives a gray colour to the bread made by mixing it with the flour of wheat.\nBread: but a mixture of the pulp of potatoes with the flour of wheat does not produce brown-coloured bread.\n\nM. Parmentier made bread, very much like that of wheat, by a mixture of the following four substances, viz., four ounces of amylaceous powder of potatoes, one dram of mucilage extracted from barley, one dram of the bran of rye, and a dram and a half of glutinous matter dried and powdered.\n\n2. Bread from different Vegetables not commonly in Use. Although horse-chestnut has not hitherto been employed, yet it is certain that wholesome bread, without any bitterness, may be obtained from it. M. Parmentier advises, that the fruit, after the skin is taken off, and the juice pressed from it, be made into a paste. This paste must be diluted in water, and then strained through a sieve. A milky-coloured liquor is thus separated, which, on standing, deposits a fine powder. This, being dried, is without either smell or taste, and very fit for aliment; the mass from which it is procured retaining the bitterness of the fruit.\n\nThe roots of the bryonia, when treated in the same manner, yielded a similar white powder. By the same treatment also, fine, white, infusible, inodorous powders may be procured from the roots of the iris, gladiolus, ranunculus, lomatia, arum, dracunculus, mandragora, colchicum, filipendula, and helioborus; plants which grow spontaneously, and in great abundance.\n\nOf acorns bread has frequently been made; and to this day, in some countries, they are in common use. The method of preparation which M. Parmentier recommends is, that they be deprived of their cover by boiling, then dried and powdered, and afterwards baked in the same manner as the flour of wheat. When fully ripe, and made into a paste, they were deprived of their astringency by merely pressing their juice from them. The mass remaining after the pressing, when dried, was easily reduced to a fine powder by no means disagreeable.\n\nThe graminum caninum arvensis, in its appearance, approaches to corn; and some naturalists have considered it as the original species from which all our grain is produced. Its roots are sweet-tasting, and have long been employed in making pitans. In the preparation of them for bread, it is only necessary that the roots should be cleaned, cut small, dried, and pounded. This powder, M. Parmentier observes, does not dissolve in cold water or spirits; but it does in boiling water, which it renders thick and cloudy, and, upon cooling, the whole mass obtains a gelatinous consistence. Upon a chemical analysis, it yields an acid empyreumatic oil, which possesses a singular odour, resembling that which is perceived on burning the plant. The fleshy residuum, calcined in the air, gives a fixed alkali. These properties incontestably prove, that it contains an amylaceous (A) matter similar to that of grain, which appears to be the nutritive part of vegetables. This amylaceous matter, formed into a jelly, and diffused in water, keeps for a long time without suffering any change; it then turns acid, and at length putrefies.\n\nThe amylaceous matter of acrid and poisonous plants, although innocent and nutritive, cannot be converted into bread without the addition of some mucilaginous substance. In times of great scarcity, common bran will answer the purpose; but when potatoes are to be had, the addition of a proper proportion of these is to be preferred.\n\nM. Parmentier gives an account of the bread which he obtained from the amylaceous powders of the different vegetables mentioned above, with the addition of potatoes and a small quantity of common leaven of grain. This bread appeared in general to be well fermented; it was of a good white colour, and free from any disagreeable odour; but to the taste, it was somewhat insipid; which, however, he imagines, might have been corrected by the addition of a proper quantity of salt.\n\nAs the resources against scarcity here pointed out can be procured only at particular seasons, the author proposes a method for preserving the matter thus obtained. For this purpose, he advises, that bread prepared in the manner mentioned above should be carefully\n\n(a) M. Beccari of the Bolognian academy has discovered in the flour of wheat two distinct substances. The one he terms an animal or glutinous matter; the other, an amylaceous matter or vegetable paste.\n\nThe gluten has been supposed to be the nutritive part of corn, from its not dissolving unless in vegetable acids; from its assuming a fleshy form in boiling water; from its supposed analogy to the animal lymph; and, lastly, from the similitude which the products it affords, on a chemical analysis, bear to those obtained from animal substances. M. Parmentier, however, from various experiments, was led to conclude, with the celebrated Model of Petersburg, that the gluten or animal matter of Beccari exists in the bran, and is not the nutritive part of the wheat. Having made experiments with four different kinds of flour, it appeared that the quantity of animal matter was always proportioned to the coarseness of the flour. Hence, were this gluten the nutritive part, the coarsest bread, or that which contained most bran, would afford the greatest quantity of nourishment. The contrary of this, however, is now known to be fact.\n\nThe amylaceous part, or, as some have termed it, the fecula, of wheat and other vegetables, is a peculiar gum, not soluble in spirit of wine, vinegar, or cold water. It contains more acid, and less water, than the ordinary gums. It is found in many of these plants that make the nourishment of men and other animals. Hence M. Parmentier concludes it to be the nutritive matter.\n\nThough we are not to consider the glutinous matter as the nutritious part of vegetables, yet it is a very necessary ingredient. It is that which preserves the cohesion of the paste in fermenting bread; it is that which forms the viscid pellicle, and stops the air in fermentation; gives the favourite taste to bread; occasions it to be light, to ferment, and which forms the small cells seen in it. It is found especially near the cortical part of grain; and this accounts for its being found in the greatest quantity in coarse brown meal. It is this gluten which renders wheat a superior aliment to the other grains and roots.\nBread, fully dried, reduced to powder, and then kept in a clofe cask. By this means, he is of opinion that it may be preserved for a very long time, and will always be ready to make an agreeable and wholesome panada by the addition of a little butter and salt.\n\nM. Parmentier, in order to discover the degree of power wherewith this alimentary powder nourished, made himself the subject of experiment; and found, that three ounces of it for dinner, and as much for supper, made into panada with water, was a sufficient quantity of aliment for a day. From his discharge by stool while he used it, he had reason to believe that it is almost totally alimentary. He concludes with recommending it not only as useful in times of scarcity, but as a proper substitute for farina-biscuit, and as a species of food well adapted for armies and hospitals.\n\n3. Cheap method of making wholesome Bread, when wheat-flour is dear, by mixing turnip with it*. At the time I tried this method, bread was very dear, inasmuch that the poor people, in the country where I live, can hardly afford themselves half a meal a-day. This put me upon considering whether some cheaper method might not be found than making it of wheat-meal. Turnips were at that time very plentiful. I had a number of them pulled, washed clean, pared, and boiled; when they were become soft enough to mash, I had the greatest part of the water pressed out of them, and afterwards had them mixed with an equal quantity in weight of coarse wheat-meal; the dough was then made in the usual manner, with yeast or barm, salt, water, &c. It rose very well in the trough; and after being well kneaded, was formed into loaves, and put into the oven to be baked. I had at the same time some other bread made with common meal in the ordinary way. I baked my turnip bread rather longer than the other. When they were drawn from the oven, I caused a loaf of each sort to be cut; and found, on examination, the turnip-bread was sweeter than the other, to the full as light and as white, but had a little taste (though nowise disagreeable) of the turnip. Twelve hours afterwards I tasted my turnip-bread again, when I found the taste of the turnip in it scarce perceptible, and the smell quite gone off. On examining it when it had been baked 24 hours, had I not known that there were turnips in its composition, I should not have imagined it; it had, it is true, a peculiar sweetness, but by no means disagreeable; on the contrary, I rather preferred it to the bread made of wheat-meal alone. After it had been baked 48 hours, it underwent another examination, when it appeared to me to be rather superior to the other; it ate freer and moister, and had not at all abated in its good qualities: to be short, it was still very good after a week; and, as far as I could see, kept as well as the bread made of common wheat meal.\n\n\"In my trials of this bread by the taste, I was not satisfied with eating it by itself; I had some of it spread with butter; I tasted it with cheese; I ate of it toasted and buttered, and finally in boiled milk and in soup; in all these forms it was very palatable and good.\n\nBread, in Medicine. Besides the alimentary, bread has also medical qualities.\u2014Decoctions, creams, and jellies of bread, are directed in some dispensaries. Bread carefully toasted, and infused or lightly boiled in water, imparts a deep colour, and a sufficiently agreeable refringent taste. This liquor, taken as common drink, has done good service in a weak lax state of the stomach and intestines; and in bilious vomiting and purging, or the cholera morbus; examples are related in the Edinburgh essays of several cases of this kind cured by it, without the use of any other medicine.\u2014In Westphalia there is a very coarse bread eaten, which still retains the opprobrious name given it by a French traveller of Bonjournickel, \"good for his horse Nickel.\" It is the same with what the Romans called panis furfuraceus, or panis impurus, from its not being cleansed from the husks; and panis aer, from the blackness of its colour: though we learn from Pliny, that the Romans for 300 years knew no other bread. The Germans* make Hoffman, two sorts of waters by distillation from this bread; the one with, the other without, the addition of a spirituous liquor: to both which great virtues are ascribed. That without anything spirituous, is made out of the juice of craw-fish, may-dew, rose-water, nutmegs, and saffron, distilled from a large quantity of this bread. This is esteemed a great restorative, and given in hectic habits. The other is distilled from this bread and Rhein wine, with nutmegs and cinnamon. This is given in all the disorders of the stomach, vomiting, loss of appetite, and other complaints of the same kind: and besides these, there is a spirit distilled from it by the retort in the dry way, which, when separated from its fetid oil, is esteemed a powerful sudorific, and very valuable medicine in removing impurities of the blood.\n\nBread is also medicinal, applied externally, as is vulgarly known*. Mr Boyle assures us he drew a menstruum from bread stronger than aquafortis, and which Phil. Works alridged, vol iii. p. 572.\n\nBread Tree. See Artocarpus, Botany Index.\n\nBees-Bread. See Bee.\n\nCassia Bread. See Jatropha, Botany Index.\n\nEarth Bread\u2020. In the lordship of Mofcau in the Upper Lufatia, a sort of white earth is found, of German E-which the poor, urged by the calamities of the wars phemonides, which raged in those parts, make bread. It is taken out of a hill where they formerly worked at saltpetre. When the sun has somewhat warmed this earth, it cracks, and small white globules proceed from it as meal; it does not ferment alone, but only when mixed with meal. Mr Sarlitz, a Saxon gentleman, was pleased to inform us, that he has seen persons who in a great measure lived upon it for some time. He assures us that he procured bread to be made of this earth alone, and of different mixtures of earth and meal; and that he even kept some of this bread by him upwards of six years: he further says, a Spaniard told him, that this earth is also found near Geronne in Catalonia.\"\n\nEucharist or Sacramental Bread, in the Protestant churches, is common leavened bread, in conformity to the ancient practice. In the Roman mass, azymous or unleavened bread is used, particularly in the Gallican church, where a sort is provided for this purpose called pain e chanter, made of the purest wheaten flour pressed between two iron plates graven like wafer-moulds, being first rubbed with white wax to prevent the patte from sticking. The Greeks observe divers ceremonies in their making the eucharist bread. It is necessary\nthe person who bakes it have not lain with his wife the day before; or, if it be a woman, that she have not conversed with her husband. The Abyssinians have an apartment in their churches for this service, being a kind of facility. F. Sirmond, in his disquisition on azymous bread, shows from the council of Toledo, that anciently there were as many ceremonies used in the Latin church in the preparation of their unleavened bread as are still retained in the eastern churches. He cites the example of Queen Radegonda, who distributed with her own hands in the church, the bread which she herself had made. It appears also from the dispute of Cardinal Humbert against the Greeks, that in the Latin church no bread was used for the eucharist, but what was taken out of the facility, and had been made by the deacons, subdeacons, and even priests, who rehearsed several psalms during the process.\n\nEcclesiastical writers enumerate other species of bread allotted for purposes of religion; as, 1. Calendariae, that anciently offered to the priest at the kalends. 2. Prebendariae, the same with capitulariae, that distributed daily to each prebendary or canon. 3. Benedictus, that usually given to catechumens before baptism, in lieu of the eucharistic bread, which they were incapable of partaking of. The panis benedictus, was called also panagium and culogium, being a sort of bread blessed and consecrated by the priest, whereby to prepare the catechumens for the reception of the body of Christ. The same was used afterwards, not only by catechumens, but by believers themselves, as a token of their mutual communion and friendship. Its origin is dated from the 7th century, at the council of Nantz. In the Gallican church we still find panis benedictus, pain benit, used for that offered for benediction, and afterwards distributed to pious persons who attend divine service in chapels. 4. Consecrated bread is a piece of wax, paste, or even earth, over which several ceremonies have been performed with benedictions, &c. to be sent in an Agnus Dei, or relic-box, and presented for veneration. 5. Unleavened bread, panis azymus. The Jews eat no other bread during their passover; and exact search was made in every house, to see that no leavened bread was left. The usage was introduced in memory of their hasty departure from Egypt, when they had not leisure to bake leavened. 6. Shew-bread was that offered to God every Sabbath-day, being placed on the golden table in the holy of holies.\n\nHorse-Bread is made of wheat, oats, and beans; to which sometimes are added aniseed, gentian, liquorice, fennel, eggs, and ale; and sometimes rye and white wine are used.\n\nFor race-horses three sorts of bread are usually given with success, for the second, third, and fourth nights feeding: they are all made of beans and wheat worked with barm; the difference consisting chiefly in the proportion of the two former. In the first kind, three times the quantity of beans is used to one of wheat; in the second, equal quantities of both; in the third, three times the quantity of wheat to one of beans.\n\nSago-Bread. See Sago.\n\n* See Affix * of Bread. The price and weight of bread is regulated by the magistrates according to the price of wheat. We have divers tables of the weights of the loaves both of wheat, wheaten, and household bread, at every price of wheat. If bread want one ounce in 36,\n\nthe baker formerly was to suffer the pillory: now, to forfeit 5s. for every ounce wanting; and for every defect less than an ounce, 2s. 6d.; such bread being complained of and weighed before a magistrate within 24 hours after it is baked or exposed to sale within the bills of mortality, or within three days in any other place. It is to be observed, bread loses weight by keeping: in some experiments recited by Bartholomew, the diminution was near one-fourth in six months. The same author affirms us, that in Norway they make bread which keeps 30 or 40 years; and that they are there fonder of their old hard bread, than elsewhere of new or soft; since the older it is, the more agreeable it grows. For their great feasts, particular care is taken to have the oldest bread; so that, at the christening of a child, they have usually bread which had been baked perhaps at the christening of his grandfather. It is made of barley and oat-meal baked between two hollow stones.\n\nBread-Room, in a ship, that destined to hold the bread or biscuit.\n\nThe boards of the bread-room should be jointed and caulked, and even lined with tin-plates or mats. It is also proper to warm it well with charcoal for several days before the biscuit is put into it; since nothing is more injurious to the bread than moisture.\n\nBreadth, in Geometry, one of the three dimensions of bodies, which multiplied into their length constitutes a surface.\n\nBreak, in a general sense, signifies to divide a thing into several parts with violence.\n\nIn the art of war, to break ground, is to open the trenches before a place.\n\nAmong sportsmen, to break a horse in trotting, is to make him light upon the hand in trotting, in order to make him fit for a gallop. To break a horse for hunting, is to supple him, to make him take the habit of running.\n\nBreakers, a name given by sailors to those billows that break violently over rocks lying under the surface of the sea. They are distinguished both by their appearance and sound, as they cover that part of the sea with a perpetual foam, and produce a horrible and terrible roaring, very different from what the waves usually have in a deeper bottom. When a ship is unhappily driven among breakers, it is hardly possible to save her, as every billow that heaves her upwards serves to dash her down with additional force when it breaks over the rocks or sands beneath it.\n\nBreaking, in a mercantile style, denotes the becoming bankrupt. See Bankrupt.\n\nBreaking-Bulk, in the sea-language, is the same with unloading part of the cargo.\n\nBreakspear, Nicholas. See Adrian IV.\n\nBream. See Cyprinus, Ichthyology Index.\n\nTo Bream, to burn off the filth, such as grats, ooze, shells, or sea-weed, from a ship's bottom, that has gathered to it in a voyage, or by lying long in a harbour. This operation is performed by holding kindled furze, faggots, or such materials, to the bottom, so that the flame incorporating with the pitch, sulphur, &c., that had formerly covered it, immediately loosens and throws off whatever filth may have adhered to the planks. After this, the bottom is covered anew with a composition of sulphur, tallow, &c., which not only makes\nBreast makes it smooth and slippery, so as to divide the fluid more readily, but also poisons and destroys those worms which eat through the planks in the course of a voyage. Breathing may be performed either when the ship lies aground after the tide has ebbed from her, or by docking, or by careening.\n\nBreast, in Anatomy, denotes the fore-parts of the thorax. See Anatomy Index.\n\nSmiting the breast is one of the expressions of penitence. In the Romish church, the priest beats his breast in rehearsing the general confession at the beginning of the mass.\n\nBreasts, or Mamme, in Anatomy. See Anatomy Index.\n\nThe breasts are usually two; though we also meet with instances of trimamie or women with three breasts*, and even some with four, all yielding milk alike\u2020.\n\nBreast-Hooks, in Ship-Building, are thick pieces of timber incurvated into the form of knees, and used to strengthen the fore-part of the ship, where they are placed at different heights directly across the stem, so as to unite it with the bows on each side. The breast-hooks are strongly connected to the stem and hawse-pieces by tree-nails, and by bolts driven from without through the planks and hawse-pieces, and the whole thickness of the breast-hooks, upon whose inside these bolts are forelocked or clinched upon rings. They are usually about one-third thicker, and twice as long, as the knees of the decks they support.\n\nBreast-Plate, in antiquity, a piece of armour worn to defend the breast, originally believed to be made of hides, or hemp, twisted into small cords, but afterwards made of brafs, iron, or other metals, which were sometimes so exquisitely hardened, as to be proof against the greatest force.\n\nBreast-Plate, in Jewish antiquity, one part of the priestly vestments anciently worn by the high-priests. It was a folded piece of the same rich embroidered stuff of which the ephod was made; and it was set with twelve precious stones, on each of which was engraven the name of one of the tribes. They were set in four rows, three in each row; and were divided from each other by little golden squares or partitions in which they were set. The names of these stones, and that of the tribes engraven on them, as also their disposition on the breast-plate, are as follows:\n\n| Sardine | Emerald | Ligare | Beryl |\n|---------|---------|--------|-------|\n| Reuben  | Judah   | Gad    | Zebulun |\n\n| Topaz   | Sapphire | Agate | Onyx |\n|---------|----------|-------|------|\n| Simeon  | Dan      | Asher | Joseph |\n\n| Carbuncle | Diamond | Amethyst | Jasper |\n|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|\n| Levi      | Naphtali| Issachar  | Benjamin |\n\nThis breast-plate was fastened at the four corners; those on the top to each shoulder by a golden hook or ring at the end of a wreathed chain; and those below, to the girdle of the ephod, by two strings or ribbons, which had likewise two rings and hooks.\n\nThis ornament was never to be severed from the priestly garment! and it was called the memorial, to put the high-priest in mind how dear those tribes ought to be to him, whose names he wore on his breast. It is also called the breastplate of judgment, because it had the divine oracle of Uriim and Thummim annexed to it. See Uriim and Thummim.\n\nBreast-Plate, in the manege, the strap of leather that runs from one side of the saddle to the other, over the horse's breast, in order to keep the saddle tight, and hinder it from sliding backwards.\n\nBreast-Work, in fortification, the same with Parapet.\n\nBreath, the air inspired and expelled again in the action of respiration.\n\nThe ancients were very watchful over the last breath of dying persons, which the nearest relations, as the mother, father, brother, or the like, received in their mouths.\n\nBreathing, the same with Respiration.\n\nBrechin, a town of Scotland, in the county of Angus, situated in W. Long. 2. 18. N. Lat. 56. 40. It consists of one large handsome street, and two smaller; and is on the side of a small hill, and washed by the river Southelk, over which there is a stone-bridge of two large arches. At the foot of the town is a long row of houses independent of it, built on ground held in feu from the family of Northesk. It is a royal borough, and, with four others, sends a member to parliament. In respect to trade, it has only a small share of the linen manufacture. It lies at no great distance from the harbour of Montrose; and the tide flows within two miles of the town; to which a canal might be made, which perhaps might create a trade, but would be of certain service in conveying down the corn of the country for exportation.\n\nBrechin was a rich and ancient bishopric founded by Pemant's David I. about the year 1150. At the Reformation, Tur in its revenues, in money and in kind, amounted to 700l. Scotland a-year; but, after that event, were reduced to 150l. chiefly by the alienation of lands and tythes by Alexander Campbell, the first Protestant bishop, to his chieftain the earl of Argyll.\u2014The Culdees had a convent here. Their abbot Leod was witness to the grant made by King David to his new abbey of Dunfermline. In after times, they gave way to the Mathurines or Red Friars. The ruins of their house, according to Maitland, are still to be seen in the College Wynd.\u2014Here was likewise an hospital called Maison de Dieu, founded in 1266, by William de Brechin, for the repose of the souls of the kings William and Alexander; of John earl of Chester, and of Huntingdon his brother; of Henry his father, and Juliana his mother. Albinus bishop of Brechin, in the reign of Alexander II. was witness to the grant. By the walls which are yet standing, behind the west end of the chief street, it appears to have been an elegant little building.\n\nThe cathedral is a Gothic pile, supported by 12 pillars; is in length 166 feet, in breadth 61: part is ruinous, and part serves as the parish-church. The west end of one of the aisles is entire: its door is Gothic, and the arch consists of many mouldings; the window of it neat tracery. The fleche is a handsome tower, 120 feet high; the four lower windows in form of long narrow openings; the belfry windows adorned with that species of opening called the quatrefoil: the top battlemented, out of which rises a handsome spire.\u2014At a final\nsmall distance from the aisle stands one of those singular round towers whose use has so long baffled the conjectures of antiquaries. These towers appear to have been peculiar to North-Britain and Ireland; in the last they are frequent; in the former, only two at this time exist. That at Brechin stood originally detached from other buildings. It is at present joined near the bottom by a low additional aisle to the church, which takes in about a fifth of its circumference. From this aisle there is an entrance into it of modern date, approachable by a few steps, for the use of the ringers; two handsome bells are placed in it, which are got at by means of six ladders placed on wooden semicircular floors, each resting on the circular abutments within side of the tower. The height from the ground to the roof is 80 feet; the inner diameter, within a few feet of the bottom, is 8 feet; the thickness of the wall at that part, 7 feet 2 inches; so that the whole diameter is 15 feet 2 inches; the circumference very near 48 feet; the inner diameter at top is 8 feet 7 inches; the thickness of the walls 4 feet 6 inches; the circumference, 38 feet 8 inches; which proportion gives the building an inexplicable elegance: the top is roofed with an octagonal spire 23 feet high, which makes the whole 103. In this spire are four windows placed alternate on the sides, resting on the top of the tower; near the top of the tower are four others facing the four cardinal points: near the bottom are two arches, one within another, in relief; on the top of the outmost is a crucifixion: between the mouldings of the outmost and inner are two figures; one of the Virgin Mary; the other of St John, the cup, and lamb. On each corner of the bottom of this arch is a figure of certain beasts; one possibly the Caledonian bear; and the other, with a long snout, the boar. The stone-work within the inner arch has a small slit or peep-hole, but without the appearance of there having been a door within any modern period: yet there might have been one originally; for the filling up confills of larger stones than the rest of this curious rotund. The whole is built with most elegant masonry, which Mr Gough observed to be composed of 60 courses.\u2014This tower hath often been observed to vibrate with a high wind.\n\nThe castle of Brechin was built on an eminence, a little south of the town; it underwent a long siege in the year 1393; was gallantly defended against the English under Edward III.; and, notwithstanding all the efforts of that potent prince, the brave governor Sir Thomas Maule, ancestor of the family of Panmure, held out this small fortress for 20 days, till he was slain by a stone cast from an engine on the 20th of August, when the place was instantly surrendered. The family of Panmure have now a noble house on the site of the old castle.\u2014Brechin is also remarkable for a battle fought near it, in consequence of the rebellion raised in 1452, on account of the murder of the earl of Douglas in Stirling castle. The victory fell to the royalists under the earl of Huntly. The malecontents were headed by the earl of Crawford, who, retiring to his castle of Finhaven, in the frenzy of disgrace declared, that he would willingly pass seven years in hell, to obtain the glory that fell to the share of his antagonist.","sp":459,"ep":466},{"h":"BRECKNOCK","t":"or Brecon, a town of Brecknockshire in Wales, and capital of the county.

It is a large, populous, well built city, regularly fortified after the modern way, and is one of the strongest places on the Dutch frontiers. It is seated on the river Meck, in a marshy country, which may be overflowed and rendered inaccessible to an army. It is 4000 paces in circumference, and contains upwards of 2000 houses. The town is of a triangular figure, and the ramparts are all planted round with elms. At every angle there is a gate built with brick. The great church is a noble structure, remarkable for its fine spire, which is 362 feet high. The mausoleum of Angelbert II., count of Nassau, is a curious piece, adorned with several statues and inscriptions suitable to the occasion. In 1577 the garrison delivered this city to the States-general; but it was retaken in 1681 by Claude de Barlaimount, assisted by the baron de Fresin, who was prisoner therein. In 1590, Prince Maurice took it again from the Spaniards.\n\nIn 1625 it was invested by Spinola; when it endured a siege too remarkable not to deserve a particular detail.\n\nThe citadel, which formed the residence of the princes of that family, was surrounded by a ditch of prodigious depth filled with water, and a strong wall defended by three great bastions; and the arsenal was celebrated for its extent, and the vast quantities of arms and military stores it contained. Spinola, perfectly acquainted with the strength of the place, thought he should expose his whole army to imminent destruction, should he attempt an assault before he had regularly carried\ncarried on his approaches. He even resolved upon reducing the city by famine, as the method attended with least danger to his army; and accordingly began with drawing trenches round, for the space of four miles, erecting forts and redoubts at certain distances.\n\nOn the other hand, the garrison, consisting of seven thousand infantry, and several troops of horse, composed of English, French, and Dutch soldiers, took the most vigorous measures for their own defence. The English were under the command of Colonel Morgan, who had frequently distinguished his valour in the service of the States; the French were directed by Colonel de Haueterive; and the Dutch troops were subject to the immediate orders of Colonel Lohre, though the whole received their instructions from Justin de Nassau, the governor. The first advantage was gained by Baglioni, who seized a large convoy of provisions and stores coming up the river, converting the boats into a bridge. This loss dispirited the besieged, and reduced them to a stated allowance of bread; and what added to their misfortunes, though they were ignorant of it, was the death of Prince Maurice, from whom they were in hopes of receiving relief.\n\nMeanwhile Spinola prosecuted the siege with the utmost diligence and vigour. On his pushing his trenches near the battlements, the besieged began a terrible fire to retard his approaches, and kept it up with such vehemence and obstinacy, that Spinola was in hopes they must soon surrender for want of ammunition. But here he formed a false judgment of the prudence of Justin de Nassau, who finding he could not accomplish his purpose by his firing, resolved to try the effect of water. With this view, he stopped up the course of the river Marck; and having formed a large basin of water, opened the sluices, swept away men, horses, and houles, in an inundation, and overflowed the whole country. The chief force of the torrent fell upon Spinola's quarters, and he exerted his utmost ability to remove the consequences. He dug large pits, and cut out ditches and canals to receive the water; but these being filled, and the whole ground covered over, so as to appear one uniform mass of water, served only to entrap his cavalry. The inundation was augmented by the rains which happened to fall; a mortality among the soldiers and horses ensued; and of his whole army, Spinola had scarce twelve thousand men fit for service by the month of December. With these inconsiderable remains, lines of vast extent were to be defended, the works were to be advanced, the fallies from the garrison repulsed, and provisions to be conveyed into the camp, while Spinola, the soul of action, was confined to a sick-bed.\n\nIn the garrison, an epidemical disease and scarcity likewise prevailed; but the excellent regulations made, and strictly observed, enabled the town to hold out three or four months beyond the time expected. The magistrates bought the corn for the bakers; obliging them to sell the bread to the inhabitants and garrison at a price affixed, and returning the overplus of their pay to the soldiers. A variety of other prudent regulations were established by the magistrates and governor, such as we do not find equalled by any instances recorded in history upon a similar occasion, and all evincing the steadiness, sagacity, courage, and ability, of\n\nJustin de Nassau. A kind of rivalship appeared between him and Spinola, which should best fulfil their several duties. The Spanish general caused himself to be carried about the works in a litter; he inspected and directed every thing; and displayed the activity of full health at the time his life was in imminent danger from an acute malady. He ordered several breaches in the lines to be repaired. These the Hollanders had made by sap, with a view of introducing succours to the besieged. He drove piles into all the ditches and canals through which their boats could pass. He made drains, to clear off the waters of the river Marck; and succeeded in a great measure by dint of perseverance, vigilance, and conduct. He was now reinforced with a body of eight thousand foot, and one thousand five hundred horse; many of the sick were perfectly recovered by his extreme care; and his army was again become formidable, amounting to twenty-five thousand infantry, and eight thousand cavalry. Nor was Prince Henry idle, who now succeeded to the titles and dominions of his brother Maurice, and was elected governor of Holland, Zeeland, Guelderland, Utrecht, and Overijssel. He prefled France for assistance, and was joined by a body of cavalry under the conduct of the count de Rouff and the marquis de Rambures. With this reinforcement; and a body of German infantry, he attacked the enemy's lines, and after an obstinate conflict was repulsed. He advanced a second time; but Spinola, who entertained a high opinion of his valour and conduct, did not choose to wait for him in his lines; he marched out with the greater part of his army, seized upon a convenient post, and obliged the prince a second time to retire towards Boileduc. Henry, finding no prospect of being able to relieve the garrison, sent a permission to the governor to surrender on the best conditions he could obtain. This plan, which was figured with no name, fell into the hands of the besiegers, and Spinola sent it open, by a trumpet, to Justin de Nassau, offering him an honourable capitulation; but that intrepid governor, suspecting the letter was forged, because it was anonymous, replied civilly, that a permission was not an order to surrender; and that he should better follow the prince of Orange's intention, and show his respect for Spinola, by continuing to defend the city to the last extremity.\n\nBy this time the garrison was diminished by disease, fatigue, want, and hardship, to half the original number; but Justin put on such a countenance, as concealed his situation from Spinola. He frequently fell out upon Baglioni's quarters, where the Italians were perishing with cold and hunger, the whole subsistence of the besiegers depending on the contributions raised in the neighbouring territories. This inconvenience produced a mutiny in the camp, that could not be appeased without applying violent remedies, and executing within sight of the whole army the chief ring-leaders. One of the mutineers blew up Spinola's chief magazine, valued at two hundred thousand livres. Urged more by necessity than compassion for the besieged, Spinola sent a message to the governor, exhorting him not to force him to extremities, which might be attended with fatal consequence to a brave garrison; but Justin, with equal art and dissimulation, answered, that Spinola was certainly ill served by his\nspies, as he appeared wholly unacquainted with the state of affairs in Breda, which was fully provided for a siege of several months, and defended by soldiers who preferred death to the necessity of surrendering. At that time the besieged were not informed of the death of the prince of Orange. They flattered themselves with the hopes of speedy succour, and were entirely ignorant of Prince Henry's late disappointment. When they wrote to the army an account of their miserable condition, Henry returned an answer, written with his own hand, and signed with his name, apprising them of the death of Maurice, the unsuccessful attempts made to raise the siege and throw in succours, the great inferiority of his troops in point of numbers, and the death of King James, whereby he was disappointed of a strong reinforcement; concluding, that he left the city entirely to the discretion of the governor and other principal officers. Jutfin was thunderstruck with the contents of this letter. He had hitherto concealed the total want of provision and ammunition from the enemy, and his own garrison, except a few officers and other persons in whom he repose confidence. The colonels Hauterive and Morgan would listen to no propositions, saying, that the honour of their several countries was concerned, and that they were responsible for the conduct of the English and French forces. They therefore required an express order from the prince of Orange to surrender, notwithstanding they pined under the united pressure of fatigue, scarcity, and disease. Jutfin acquainted the prince with their resolution, and he sent back an order to surrender, threatening with capital punishment whoever should disobey; but he requested that the garrison would first acquaint him by a certain number of fires, lighted up in different parts of the city, how many days they should be able to hold out. Upon receipt of this order, eleven fires were kindled; but as the prince had sent a duplicate of the order by another messenger, and this fell into the hands of the enemy, Spinola was now acquainted with the desperate circumstances of the besieged. By this acquisition he likewise discovered the mystery of the eleven fires: a council of war was assembled to deliberate whether they should lay the eleven days, and then oblige the garrison to surrender at discretion, or immediately offer conditions worthy of so brave a garrison. The Spanish officers were of the former opinion; the count de Berg and Spinola supported the latter. At last the marquis, determined to pursue the dictates of his noble generosity, sent such terms as could not be refused. The count de Berg conducted the negociation. Two separate capitulations were drawn up, one for the garrison and the other for the city, and both the most honourable and advantageous that could be devised. They were accepted, and the garrison marched out on the 6th of June, after having sustained a siege for ten months, whereby they were diminished two thirds; nor was the loss inferior on the part of the inhabitants. Spinola drew up his army to salute them, and, surrounded by his field officers, paid particular compliments to the governor, the colonels Morgan, Hauterive, and Lohre. He distributed money among the soldiers, ordered the sick and wounded to be treated with the utmost tenderness, conveyed the rest in the manner most commodious for them to Gertruydenburgh, and displayed all the fenti-\n\nments of a hero in the regard paid to the valour and merits of his enemies.\n\nBreda was retaken by the prince of Orange, for the United Provinces, in 1637. There was a congress held there, and peace concluded, in 1667, between the Dutch and the English. E. Long, 4. 45. N. Lat. 51\u00b0 35'.\n\nBreda, John Van, painter of history, landscape, and conversations, was born at Antwerp in 1683, the son of Alexander Van Breda, an artist who was much esteemed for landscapes, views of particular scenes in Italy, fairs, and markets, with a variety of animals and figures. He was instructed by his father: and having the advantage of a good example and a good director, added to his own great application, he continued his studies with his father till he was 18 years of age. Among the variety of capital paintings which were at that time in the possession of John de Wit at Antwerp, Breda fixed upon those of Velvet Breughel, which he copied with extraordinary success; and he was also employed for nine years in copying the pictures of several other great masters; which he performed with such incredible exactness as scarcely to leave it in the power of any judicious person to distinguish the originals from the copies. Having at length established his reputation in Holland, he went to London with Ryfbrack the sculptor, and there gradually rose into such esteem, that he was visited by persons of the highest rank, and particularly patronized by the unfortunate earl of Derwentwater, who was beheaded for rebellion in 1715. He found so much encouragement in London, that he was employed by the court and the nobility, and could scarce execute the large demands for his performances. After a residence of some years in England, he returned to Antwerp loaded with riches, the honourable testimonies of English liberality, as well as of his own merit; and in the year 1740, when Louis XV. arrived in that city, he so far honoured this master as to purchase four of his pictures: One represented Christ at the sea of Tiberias; another, Christ performing miracles; and the other two were landscapes, with a number of figures, so exquisitely drawn and finished that it would be difficult to distinguish them from those of Velvet Breughel. He certainly approached nearer to those great masters whose manner he imitated, namely, Breughel and Wouvermans, than any other artist of his time. His landscapes are in the style and taste of the former; and his conversations, historical figures, fairs, skirmishes, or battles, are in the manner of the latter. His colouring is good; his touch neat; his skies and distances natural and beautiful; and his taste of design agreeable. He had as much fire in his composition, and perhaps more genius, than Breughel, in those subjects which he painted in the style of that master; his figures are generally well placed, his grounds skilfully broken; every small figure hath its particular character, and occupies its proper place; and, in short, he is a painter of such a rank, that the value and estimation of his works must always increase. He died in 1750.\n\nBREECH of a great gun, or cannon, the end next the touch-hole.","sp":466,"ep":468},{"h":"BREECHES","t":"a garment worn by males, reaching from the girdle to the knees, and serving to cover the hips, thighs, &c.\nBreechings. The ancient Romans had nothing in their dress answering to our breeches and stockings; instead of which, under their lower tunics and waistcoats they sometimes bound their thighs and legs round with silken scarves or fasciae, called tibialis and femorata. Breeches appear to be a habit peculiar to the barbarous nations, especially those inhabiting the colder countries of the north; whence Tacitus calls them barbarum tegmen. We find mention made of them among the ancient Get\u00e6, Sarmat\u00e6, Gauls, Germans, and Britons; they also obtained among the Medes and Persians, as being a people of Scythian origin; they also afterwards got footing in Italy, some pretend, as early as the time of Augustus; but without much foundation, that emperor's breeches, mentioned by Suetonius, being apparently only swaths tied over his thighs. However this be, breeches were at last received into Italy, and grew so highly in fashion, that it was thought necessary, under Honorius and Arcadius, to restrain them by law, and expel the bracarii or breeches-makers out of the city; it being thought unworthy of a nation that commanded the world, to wear the apparel of barbarians.","sp":468,"ep":469},{"h":"BREECHINGS","t":"in the sea-language, the ropes with which the great guns are lashed or fastened to the ship's side.

In this sense we say well-bred, ill-bred, a man of breeding, &c. Good-breeding is hard to define; none can understand the speculation but those who have the practice. Good-breeding amounts to much the same with what is otherwise called politeness, among the ancient Romans urbanity. Good-breeding is near to virtue, and will of itself lead a man a great part of the way towards the same. It teaches him to rejoice in acts of civility, to seek out objects of compassion, and to be pleased with every occasion of doing them good offices. Lord Shaftesbury compares the well-bred man with the real philosopher: both characters aim at what is excellent, aspire to a just taste, and carry in view the model of what is beautiful and becoming. The conduct and manners of the one are formed according to the most perfect ease, and good entertainment of company; of the other, according to the strictest interest of mankind: the one according to his rank and quality in his private station; the other according to his rank and dignity in nature. Horace seems to have united both characters,\n\nQuid verum atque decens curo et rogo, et omnis in hoc sum.\n\nSee the article Good Manners.\n\nBREEDING of Horses. See Equus.\n\nBREEDING of Fish. The necessary qualities of a pond, to make it serve well for breeding fish, are very different from those which are to make it serve for the feeding of them, insomuch that some particular ponds serve only for one of these purposes, and others for the other; and scarce ever the same pond is found to answer for them both. In general, it is much more rare to find a good breeding pond than a good feeding one.\n\nThe best indications for a good breeding pond are these; Breeding that there be a good quantity of rushes and grass about its sides, with gravelly shoals, such as horse-ponds usually have: when a pond has this property, and takes to the breeding of fish, it is amazing what a progress will be made in a little time. The spawn of fish is prodigious in quantity; and where it succeeds, one is able to produce many millions: thus, in one of these breeding ponds, two or three melters, and as many fishawners, will, in a very little time, flock the whole country. When these ponds are not meant entirely for breeding, but the owner would have the fish to grow to some size in them, the method is to thin the numbers, because they would otherwise starve one another, and to put in other fish that will prey upon the young, and thin them in the quickest manner. Eels and perch are the most useful on this account; because they prey not only upon the spawn itself, but upon the young fry from the first hatching to the time they are of considerable size. Some fish are observed to breed indifferently in all kinds of waters, and that in considerable plenty; of this nature are the roach, pike, and perch.","sp":469,"ep":469},{"h":"BREENBERG","t":"Bartholomew, an excellent painter, was born in 1620.

There is an arsenal with sea-stores, which was placed there on account of its nearness to the woods, mines of iron, and other things proper for the building of ships. It was entirely consumed by fire in 1744, which was an irreparable loss to France. The entrance into the port is guarded by a strong castle seated on a rock, which cannot be attempted on the sea-side, because it is craggy, and is defended on the land-side by a large ditch and other fortifications. The streets of Brest are very narrow, ill contrived, few in number, and have all a deficient. A great quay surrounds this side of the port, which is above a mile in length, and 200 paces broad; and there are magazines on the quay full of all foreign merchandizes. On the other side of the port, the fine church of Notre Dame is situated; and in a suburb, which is as big as half the city, there is a strong tower opposite to the castle, at the entrance of the port; there is also a great quay on this side, bordered with large magazines, partly within the rock, which has been cut away to enlarge the place. These are extended almost as far as the bottom of the harbour, where there are two docks very commodious for the building of large ships: the flops and houses of the workmen are all around them: the ropewalks are separated from the city by one of these docks. The entrance into the harbour is called the gu\u00e9let, and is a passage extremely difficult on account of the sunk rocks on both sides of the shore; but there are experienced pilots who carry ships in very safely.

They took their denomination from the words of St Paul, Rom. chap. viii. ver. 2, 14, and maintained, that the true children of God were invested with the privilege of a full and perfect freedom from the jurisdiction of the law. They were enthusiasts to a degree of distraction, both in their principles and practice. They resembled the Beghards, by which name they were sometimes called, in their aspect, apparel, and manner of living. Some of their professed principles resembled those of the Pantheists; for they held, that all things flowed by emanation from God; that rational souls were portions of the Deity, and that the universe was God; and that, by the power of contemplation, they were united to the Deity, and acquired hereby a glorious and sublime liberty, both from the sinful lusts and the common instincts of nature; and hence they conclude, that the person, who was thus absorbed in the abyss of the Deity, became a part of the Godhead, and was the son of God, in the same sense and manner that Christ was, and that he was freed from the obligation of all laws human and divine. They treated with contempt all Christian ordinances, and all external acts of religion, as unsuitable to the state of perfection at which they were arrived. Some of them were honest but deluded enthusiasts; and they endured the torments inflicted upon them by the inquisitors with astonishing calmness and triumph. Others proceeded to the most extravagant licentiousness of conduct. They held their secret assemblies stark naked, and lay in the same beds with their spiritual sisters, and indiscriminately with other women, without the least scruple or hesitation: modesty and decency being, according to their creed, marks of inward corruption. And some of them proceeded still farther, and maintained, that the divine man, or believer, could not sin, let his conduct be ever so horrible or atrocious. Many edicts were published against them; but notwithstanding the severities they suffered, they continued till about the middle of the fifteenth century. They were called by several other names, such as Schwefrones, Picards, Adamites, and Turlupins.\n\nBrethren and Clerks of the Common Life, a denomination assumed by a religious fraternity towards the latter end of the fifteenth century. They lived under the Brethren, rule of St Augustin, and were eminently useful in promoting the cause of religion and learning. Their society was first formed, in the preceding century, by Gerard de Groote, a native of Deventer; but did not flourish till about the period above mentioned, when it obtained the approbation of the council of Constance, and became very respectable in Holland, the Lower Germany, and the adjacent provinces. It was divided into two classes; the lettered brethren or clerks, and the illiterate: they lived in separate habitations, but maintained the closet fraternal union. The former applied to the study of polite literature, and the education of youth; whilst the latter were employed in manual labour, and the mechanic arts. They were frequently called Beghards and Lollards, by way of reproach.\n\nWhite Brethren, fratres albaei, were the followers of a leader about the beginning of the fifteenth century, who was arrayed in a white garment; and as they were also clothed in white linen, they were distinguished by this title. Their leader was a priest from the Alps, who carried about a cross, like a standard, and whose apparent sanctity and devotion drew together a number of followers. This deluded enthusiast practiced many acts of mortification and penance, endeavored to persuade the European nations to renew the holy war, and pretended that he was favored with divine visions. Boniface IX. ordered him to be apprehended and committed to the flames, upon which his followers dispersed.","sp":472,"ep":472},{"h":"BRETONS","t":"or Cape-Britain, an island near the eastern continent of North America, lying between 45 and 47 degrees of north latitude. It is separated from Nova Scotia by a narrow strait called Canjo, and is about 100 miles in length, and 50 in breadth. It is surrounded with little sharp-pointed rocks, separated from each other by the waves, above which some of their tops are visible. All its harbours are open to the east, turning towards the south. On the other parts of the coast there are but a few anchoring places for small vessels, in creeks, or between inlets. Except in the hilly parts, the surface of the country has but little solidity, being everywhere covered with a light moss, and with water. The dampness of the soil is exhaled in fogs, without rendering the air unwholesome. In other respects, the climate is very cold; owing either to the prodigious quantity of lakes, which cover above half the island, and remain frozen a long time; or to the number of forests, that totally intercept the rays of the sun; the effect of which is besides decreased by perpetual clouds.\n\nThough some fishermen had long resorted to this island every summer, not more than 20 or 30 had ever fixed there. The French, who took possession of it in August 1713, were properly the first inhabitants. They changed its name into that of Isle Royale, and fixed upon Fort Dauphin for their principal settlement. This harbour was two leagues in circumference. The ships came to the very shore, and were sheltered from winds. Forests affording oak sufficient to fortify and build a large city, were near at hand; the ground appeared less barren than in other parts, and the fishery was more plentiful. This harbour might have been rendered impregnable at a trifling expense; but the difficulty\ndifficulty of approaching it (a circumstance that had at first made a stronger impression than the advantages resulting from it) occasioned it to be abandoned, after great labour had been bestowed upon the undertaking. They then turned their views to Louisbourg, the access to which was easier; and convenience was thus preferred to security: the fortification of Louisbourg, however, was not begun till 1720.\n\nIn the year 1714, some fishermen, who till then had lived in Newfoundland, settled in this island. It was expected that their number would soon have been increased by the Acadians, who were at liberty, from the treaties that had been granted them, to remove with all their effects, and even to dispose of their estates; but these hopes were disappointed. The Acadians chose rather to retain their possessions under the dominion of Britain, than to give them up for any precarious advantage they might derive from their attachment to France. Their place was supplied by some distempered adventurers from Europe, who came over from time to time to Cape Breton, and the number of inhabitants gradually increased to 4000. They were settled at Louisbourg, Fort Dauphin, Port Toulouse, N\u00e9ruoka, and on all the coasts where they found a proper beach for drying the cod. The inhabitants never applied themselves to agriculture, the soil being unfit for it. They often sowed corn, but it seldom came to maturity; and when it did thrive so much as to be worth reaping, it had degenerated so considerably, that it was not fit for seed for the next harvest. They have only continued to plant a few pot-herbs that are tolerably well tasted, but must be renewed every year from abroad. The poorness and scarcity of pastures has likewise prevented the increase of cattle. In a word, the soil of Cape Breton seemed calculated to invite none but fishermen and soldiers.\n\nThough the island was entirely covered with forests before it was inhabited, its wood has scarce ever been an object of trade. A great quantity, however, of soft wood was found there fit for firing, and some that might be used for timber; but the oak has always been scarce, and the fir never yielded much resin. The peltry trade was a very inconsiderable object. It consisted only in the skins of a few lynxes, elks, musk-rats, wild cats, bears, otters, and foxes both of a red and silver-grey colour. Some of these were procured from a colony of Micmac Indians who had settled on the island with the French, and never could raise more than 60 men able to bear arms. The rest came from St John's, or the neighbouring continent. Greater advantages might possibly have been derived from the coal-mines which abound in the island. They lie in a horizontal direction; and being no more than six or eight feet below the surface, may be worked without digging deep, or draining off the waters. Notwithstanding the prodigious demand for this coal from New England, from the year 1745 to 1749, these mines would probably have been forsaken, had not the ships which were sent out to the French islands wanted ballast. In one of these mines a fire has been kindled, which could never yet be extinguished.\n\nThe people of Cape Breton did not send all their fish to Europe. They sent part of it to the French southern islands, on board 20 or 25 ships from 70 to 140 tons burden. Besides the cod, which made at least half their cargo, they exported to the other colonies timber, planks, thin oak-boards, salted salmon and mackerel, train-oil, and sea-coal. All these were paid for in sugar and coffee, but chiefly in rum and molasses. The island could not consume all these commodities; Canada took off but a small part of the surplus; it was chiefly bought by the people of New England, who gave in exchange fruits, vegetables, wood, brick, and cattle. This trade of exchange was allowed; but a smuggling trade was added to it, carried on in flour, and salt fish.\n\nThis island, the key of Canada, was attacked by the English in 1745; and the event is of so singular a nature, that it deserves a particular detail. The plan of this first invasion was laid at Bolton, and New England bore the expense of it. A merchant named Pepperell, who had excited, encouraged, and directed the enterprise, was intrusted with the command of an army of 6000 men, which had been levied for this expedition.\n\nThough these forces, convoyed by a squadron from Jamaica, brought the first news to Cape Breton of the danger that threatened it; though the advantage of a surprise would have secured the landing without opposition; though they had but 600 regular troops to encounter, and 800 inhabitants hastily armed; the success of the undertaking was still precarious. What great exploits, indeed, could be expected from a militia suddenly assembled, who had never seen a siege or faced an enemy, and were to act under the direction of officers only. These unexperienced troops stood in need of the assistance of some fortunate incident, which they were indeed favoured with in a singular manner.\n\nThe construction and repairs of the fortifications had always been left to the care of the garrison of Louisbourg. The soldiers were eager of being employed in these works, which they considered as conducive to their safety, and as the means of procuring them a comfortable subsistence. When they found that those who were to have paid them, appropriated to themselves the profit of their labours, they demanded justice. It was denied them, and they were determined to assert their right. As these depredations had been shared between the chief persons of the colony and the subaltern officers, the soldiers could obtain no redress. Their indignation against these rapacious extortioners rose to such a height, that they despised all authority. They had lived in an open rebellion for six months, when the British appeared before the place.\n\nThis was the time to conciliate the minds of both parties, and to unite in the common cause. The soldiers made the first advances; but their commanders mistrusted a generosity of which they themselves were incapable. It was firmly believed that the soldiers were only desirous of falling out, that they might have an opportunity of deserting; and their own officers kept them in a manner prisoners, till a defence so ill managed had reduced them to the necessity of capitulating. The whole island shared the fate of Louisbourg, its only bulwark.\n\nThis valuable possession, restored to France by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, was again attacked by the British in 1758. On the 2d of June, a fleet of 23 ships of the line and 18 frigates, carrying 16,000 well disciplined troops, anchored in Gabarus bay, within half a league.\nleague of Louisbourg. As it was evident it would be to no purpose to land at a great distance, because it would be impossible to bring up the artillery and other necessaries for a considerable siege, it had been attempted to render the landing impracticable near the town. In the prudent precautions that had been taken, the besiegers saw the dangers and difficulties they had to expect; but, far from being deterred by them, they had recourse to stratagem, and while by extending their line they threatened and commanded the whole coast, they landed by force of arms at the creek of Cormorant.\n\nThis place was naturally weak. The French had fortified it with a good parapet planted with cannon. Behind this rampart they had posted 2000 excellent soldiers and some Indians. In front they had made such a close hedge with branches of trees, that would have been very difficult to penetrate, even if it had not been defended. This kind of pallisade, which concealed all the preparations for defence, appeared at a distance to be nothing more than a verdant plain.\n\nThis would have prevented the colony, had the assailants been suffered to complete their landing, and to advance with the confidence that they had but few obstacles to surmount. Had this been the case, overpowered at once by the fire of the artillery and the small arms, they would infallibly have perished on the shore or in the hurry of embarking; especially as the sea was just then very rough. This unexpected loss might have interrupted the whole project.\n\nBut all the prudent precautions that had been taken were rendered abortive by the impetuosity of the French. The English had scarcely begun to move towards the shore, when their enemies halted to discover the snare they had laid for them. By the brisk and hasty fire that was aimed at their boats, and still more by the premature removal of the boughs that marked the forces, which it was much the interest of the French to conceal, they guessed at the danger they were going to rush into. They immediately turned back, and saw no other place to effect their landing but a rock, which had been always deemed inaccessible. General Wolfe, though much taken up in reembarking his troops, and fending off the boats, gave the signal to Major Scot to repair thither. That officer immediately removed to the spot with his men. His own boat coming up first, and finding at the very instant he was stepping out, he climbed up the rock alone. He was in hopes of meeting with 100 of his men who had been sent thither some hours before. He found only ten. With these few, however, he gained the summit of the rock. Ten Indians and 60 Frenchmen killed two of his men, and mortally wounded three. In spite of his weakness, he stood his ground under cover of a thicket, till his brave countrymen, regardless of the boisterous waves and the fire of the cannon, came up to him, and put him in full possession of that important post, the only one that could secure their landing. The French, as soon as they saw that the enemy had got a firm footing on land, betook themselves to the only remaining refuge, and shut themselves up in Louisbourg. The fortifications were in a bad condition, because the sea sand, which they had been obliged to use, is by no means fit for works of masonry. The revetments of the several curtiling were entirely crumbled away. There was only one casemate and a small magazine that were bomb-proof. The gar-rifon which was to defend the place consisted only of 2900 men.\n\nNotwithstanding all these disadvantages, the besieged were determined to make an obstinate resistance. It is scarce credible that the French were confirmed in their resolution by the courage of a woman. Madame de Drucourt was continually upon the ramparts, with her purse in her hand; and firing herself three guns every day, seemed to dispute with the governor her husband the glory of his office. The besieged were not dismayed at the ill success of their several sallies, or the masterly operations concerted by Admiral Boscawen and General Amherst. It was but at the eve of an assault, which it was impossible to sustain, that they talked of surrendering. They made an honourable capitulation; and the conqueror showed more respect for his enemy and for himself, than to fully his glory by any act of barbarity or avarice.\u2014The possession was confirmed to Great Britain by the peace 1763; since which the fortifications have been blown up, and the town of Louisbourg dismantled.","sp":472,"ep":474},{"h":"BRETTIGAW","t":"a territory or valley of the Grisons, lying between the Rhine and the county of Tyrol, and along the river Lanquet.

Its taste is warm, bitterish, and subacrid. It communicates its properties to wine, water, and spirit; but it is best in substance, and may be taken from half a drachm to two drachms for a dose. There is no doubt of its possessing antispasmodic virtues in an eminent degree. It is often prescribed with advantage in hysterical cases, and instances are not wanting where it appears to have removed some obstinate epilepsies. In habitual coughs it is an excellent medicine, and frequently loosens the bowels when other stronger purgatives have been tried in vain. Cows eat the leaves. Sheep are not fond of them. Cats are greatly delighted with the roots. Rats are said to be equally fond of them, and that the rat-catchers employ them to draw the rats together.\n\n7.

At the commencement of the succeeding clasps, however, we shall give a further example, taken from the extensive genus Protea, of the manner in which the species of plants ought to be defined. With this exception, however, we shall confine ourselves to the definition of the more important plants. At the same time that our work may be as complete as its nature will permit, we shall state the names of all the species included under every genus, (excepting the almost boundless clasps of Cryptogamia,) taking care to distinguish the foreign from the British plants, by affixing to the latter the usual mark (*). Thus there will be exhibited to the reader, nearly a complete enumeration of the objects contained under this extensive and curious branch of science; together with an account of whatever it contains most interesting or useful.\n\n76.

Crocus, or Saffron.\nTwo species; viz. *fatius, *vernus.\n\n* C. sheath one valve rising from the root; tube of the blossom very long.\u2014The summits of the pithils of the Cr. officinalis carefully collected, and moderately dried, are the saffron of the shops. That collected in England is preferred to all other. It affords a beautiful colour to water, wine, or spirit, and gives out the whole of its virtues to them. It has been held in high repute as a cordial; but modern practice pays no great attention to it, since it has been found to produce no sensible effect, even when given in doses greatly larger than those generally prescribed.\n\n93. Ixia.\n47 Species; viz. fruticola, minuta, rosea, chloroleuca, *bulbocodium, cruciata, fragrans, humilis, pilosa, hirta, secunda, villosa, rubrocyanea, pumicea, purpurea, crista, cinamomea, corymbosa, heterophylla, anemoniflora, coelestina, spicata, plantaginea, linearis, incarnata, patens, capillaris, flexuosa, angustia, radiata, virgata, longiflora, filiformis, arilata, pendula, bulbifera, leucantha, erecta, maculata, densa, crocata, squamida, lancea, pentandra, sulica, falcata, excisa.

Iris\nContains 54 species; viz. the following: ciliata, minuta, pumila, lutelensis, cristata, fusiana, florentina, flaviflora, hirta, aphylla, variegata, iqualens, japonica, sambucina, lurida, germanica, pallida, compressa, dichotoma, tripetala, tricuspis, * xiphium, xiphoides, * pseud-acorus, * foetida, virginica, versicolor, halophile, ochroleuca, spatheae, ramota, fify-rinchium, verna, perlica, juncea, augusta, fetacea, tenuifolia, ventricosa, graminea, enfata, spuria, orientalis, fibirica, martinicensis, pavonia, cripla, papilionacea, edulis, triflisis, polyflachya, viifaria, bituminosa, tuberosa. Europe, Barbary, Persia, N. America. Of these the following deserve notice.\n\nI. Every other segment of the cor. or blossom smaller than the summit. The juice of the fresh fruit of this species is very acid, and has been found to produce plentiful evacuations from the bowels, after other powerful means had failed. It may be given for this purpose in doses of 80 drops every hour or two; but the degree of its acrimony is so uncertain that it can hardly ever come into general use. In some cases it proves diuretic. The fresh roots have been mixed with the food of swine bitten by a mad dog; and they escaped the disease when others bitten by the same dog died raving mad. The root loses most of its acrimony by drying. Goats eat the leaves when fresh; but cows, horses, and swine refuse them; cows will eat them when dry. The roots are used in the island of Jura to dye black.\n\nI. Stem with one angle. The juice of the root, factidias, both of this and the preceding species is sometimes used to excite sneezing; but it is an unsafe practice. Violent convulsions have sometimes been the consequence. Neither horses, sheep, nor cows eat it. The icarlet feeds displayed by the opening capsules give the hedge banks in England a gay appearance in autumn. The leaves when bruised smell like rancid bacon.\n\n98. Mor\u00e6a.\nThis genus chiefly inhabits the C. of G. Hope, and has 17 species; viz. melaleuca, spiralis, pulilla, magellanica, gladiata, aphylla, filiformis, spatheae, flexuosa, polyanthus, cerulea, plicata, umbellata, cripla, iriopetala, iridioides, chinensis.

S. Europe, E. & W. Indies, America. Of these S. Lacufris is worthy of notice. It is thus described: Straw cylindrical, naked, spikes several, egg shaped on fruit-stalks, terminating; calyx fringed, 3-cleft, middle segment awl shaped. When fodder is exhausted, cattle will live upon this species. Cottages are sometimes thatched, and pack-faddles stuffed with it. Bottoms of chairs are very commonly made of this rush. If cut at one year old it makes the fine bottoms. Coarse bottoms are made of it at two years old; and such as are still older, mixed with the leaves of the iris pseudacorus, make the coarsest bottoms of all. Mats are likewise made either of the scirpus la cufris alone, or mixed with the aforeaid leaves. Goats and swine eat it, cows and sheep refuse it.\n\n114.

CENCHRUS, or Hedgebob-graft,\n\nHas ten species, viz. lappaceus, capitatus, echinatus, tribuloides, ciliaris, tetofus, geniculatus, hordeiformis, purpureescens, frutescens. Generally hot climates.\n\nORDER II. DIGYNIA.\n\nIt is highly worthy of being remarked, that under this second order of the class of triandria in the Lin nean system are included a considerable number of the plants that are very valuable in agriculture, especially the grasses. This branch of botany, therefore, deserves the attention of those engaged in the culture of artificial grasses, and even of all persons in any way engaged in the cultivation of the soil. Several advantages result from being able to discriminate the particular grasses that naturally rise upon a field, and the name which they bear. A farmer or other cultivator of lands may thus, in the first place, be enabled to derive greater benefit from the perusal of publications upon the art in which he is engaged. In the next place, it is to be remarked, that some grasses rising spontaneously upon a soil indicate that it is of bad quality, or that it has been impoverished by severe cropping; whereas there are other grasses, which demonstrate, by their spontaneous growth, that the land is in excellent condition. It is of obvious utility to be able to discriminate such plants. It is also of importance, when artificial grasses have sprung up to be able to discern the kinds to which they belong, and consequently to know whether the proper sorts of seed have been sown, and which of the sorts may have failed to spring up. For these and other reasons we shall give the botanical description in as concise terms as possible of a considerable number of the species of this order.\n\n120. CORNUCOPIA, or Horn-of-plenty Grass,\n\nIncludes two species; * cucullatum, with an awnless spike, and * alopecuroides, with an awned spike received in a hemispherical cone.\n\n121.

P. spike cylindrical, very long; calyx fringed pratense, and awned; straw upright.\u2014This grass is represented by all travellers in America as the great support of cattle, &c., wherever meadows are found. It is there called timothy-grass. It is best adapted to clayey soils, moist loam, and especially peat. The seeds are to be had very clean dressed, at about one guinea a buttel.\n\n4. P. spike cylindrical; straw ascending; leaves nodiflorum, slanting; root bulbous.\n\n5. P. spike cylindrical. alpinum.\n\n129. Alopecurus, or Foxtail Grass,\n\nCal. 2-valved. Cor. 1 valve. Neft. none. Some kinds of this grass are very valuable.\n\n1. P. spiked, straw upright. Cal. hairy. Cor. awn-pratenis.\n\ned. This grass (meadow foxtail) has scarcely a superior for the use of the farmer. It is very early, and abides on the farm, when sown, for many years. It produces few feed-stalks. It is difficult to procure the seed in any degree of plenty, on account of an insect that feeds upon it and destroys it.\n\n* 2.

P. panicle spreading; spikets flowered, woody at the base; straw upright, rough; sheath-scale tapering to a point. It is said that Mr Boys of Bethanger in Kent has been the largest cultivator of this species in the kingdom, and sold large quantities of the seed; but gave it up for want of a demand. It is an excellent grass on good and found and moist loams. It is accounted in Lombardy \"the queen of meadow plants\" (la regina dell' erbe) whether for dry pastures or water meadows; multiplying itself much by seed and little by the root; so that if attention be not paid to permit some feed to fall, its quantity will sensibly diminish. Excellent for all sorts of cattle.\n\n* 9. P. panicle spike-like. Cal. hulls rather hairy, 2 or 3 (rarely) 4-flowered, longer than the little fruit-stalk; petals awned, awn-pointed.\n\n* 10.

D. spikes terminating sometimes in pairs; florets not expanding; straw and leaves stiff and straight.\n\n* 2. D. panicle crowded, pointing one way. This glomerata, grass is cultivated to advantage on wet loams on a clayey marl bottom, upon which the finer grasses are apt to give way to the indigenous produce. If suffered to rise high, it is very coarse; but, when fed close, is a very valuable sheep-pasture. Women and children are said to make good earnings in gathering the feed at 4s. a bushel. Upon an English acre two bushels may be sown, with ten pounds of common red clover. When the clover wears out, the grass covers the land, and abides well in it. It grows well in winter.\n\nAdd the species cynuroides, cespitosa, littoralis, levis, villosa, ferrata, ciliaris, hispida, geniculata, brevifolia, lagopoides, pungens, of America, India, and Africa.\n\n138. CYNOBUS, or Dogs-tail Grass.\n\nCal. 2-valved, many-flowered, equal; cor. 2-valved; 1 valve concave, longer. Necl. 2-leaved.\n\n* 1. C. floral leaves, with winged clefts. The crested eriophyllum, dogs-tail is highly spoken of in the Milanese. The Rev. Arthur Young speaks thus of it: \"To judge from the appearance of the bents of this grass, in poor soil and moist pastures, a man would think it a very unpromising plant; but the rich marshes of Bridgewater and Bolton; the famous pasturages of Paniton in Devonshire, and those close to Mr Butler's castle near Liskeard in Cornwall; Mr Thorne's bullock ground, on Dunstone bottom, near Tavistock; Mr William's at Little Malvern in Worcestershire, (which are among the richest pastures in the kingdom) all abound very greatly in this grass; in some of them it is the predominant herbage.\" Mr Marshal places it as the most prevailing plant in the best grass meadows of the vale of Pickering; some of which will feed a large cow from Mayday to Michaelmas. Very fortunately it abounds much with feed; so that I have had many bushels gathered in a season by poor women and children, at 1s. a pound, and laid down many acres of it successfully. Attention should be paid to its being ripe; for I once ordered eight bushels to be sown on eight acres, and it failed from deficiency in ripeness.\"\n\n* 2. C. floral leaves winged, segments awned.\n\n* 3. C. floral leaves entire; spike nearly egg-shaped.\n\nThe remaining species are the following, calcatus, of C. of Good Hope; cruciformis, of Europe; pani-culatus, of C. of G. Hope; lima, of Spain; olorus, of Europe; retroflexus, sphacelophalus, uniole, filiformis, monostachyos, coracanum, floccifolius, penicillatus, pafpaloides, tegyptius, indicus, virgatus, aureus.\n\n139. FESTUCA, or Fescue-grass.\n\nCal. 2-valved; spikes oblong, roundish; husks tapering to a point, or terminating in an awn.\n\n* 1. H. spikes upright, smooth. Cal. valves, one en-bromoides, tire, the other tapering to an awn-like point.\n\n* 2. H. panicle spike-like, drooping. Cal. smaller, myurus. Valve very minute; florets rough, awns very long.\n\n* 3. H. panicle compact, awned; straw four corner-rubricated, almost naked; leaves brittle-shaped. It flourishes best in a dry sandy soil; cows, horses, and goats will eat it; but it is the favourite food of sheep; they prefer it before all other grasses, and are said soonest to grow fat upon it; for, though small, it is succulent. The Tartars, who lead a wandering life, tending their flocks...\nflocks and herds, always choose those spots where this grass abounds. Such may be its just character in the uncultivated wilds of nature; and, as it prefers a dry soil, its growth is an indubitable indication of the salubrity of such places for flocks of sheep; but in a more rich and cultivated country, it is said to be of little value as a pasture grass, being extremely diminutive; nor will it remain long in the ground if sown, but will soon give place to more luxuriant grasses.\n\n* 4. F. panicle rough; spikets 6-flowered, awned; floret at the end awnless; straw semi-cylindrical.\n\nduriuscula. * 5. F. panicle oblong; spikets oblong, smooth; leaves brittle-shaped. A very excellent grass for the agriculturist, as springing very early, being productive, and grateful to all kinds of cattle, and is found in most good meadows and pastures.\n\ndimidiorum. * 6. F. panicle spike-like, pubescent; leaves thread-shaped.\n\nglabra. * 7. F. panicle branched, upright, compact; spikets awl-shaped, 3-flowered, awned, smooth.\n\ncambrica. * 8. F. panicle oblong, upright, branched; spikets awned, smooth; leaves flat, naked.\n\ntenulifolia. * 9. F. leaves like bristles, rather long, upright; straw naked, spikets rough.\n\nelatior. * 10. F. panicle upright; spikets scarcely awned, the outer ones cylindrical. It makes an excellent pasture, but requires a rich soil. Horses, cows, sheep, and goats eat it.\n\nfluitans. * 11. F. panicle branched, upright; spikets nearly fitting, cylindrical, awnless. The seeds are small, but very sweet and nourishing. They are collected in several parts of Germany and Poland under the name of manna seeds; and are esteemed a delicacy in soups and gruels, on account of their nutritious quality and excellent flavour. When ground to meal, they make bread very little inferior to that in common use from wheat. The bran, separated in preparing the meal, is given to horses that have the worms; but they must be kept from water for some hours afterwards. Geese are very fond of the seeds, and well know where to look for them. The plant affords nourishment to the phalena pellucida. Horses and swine will run risks to get at it.\n\nloliacea. * 12. F. spiket; spikets alternate, fitting, compressed, awnless.\n\ndecumbens. * 13. F. panicle upright; spikets nearly egg-shaped, awnless; cal. larger than the florets; straw lying down.\n\npinnata. * 14. F. spikets fitting; straw undivided; awn shorter than the blossoms.\n\nsylvatica. * 15. F. spikets fitting, straw undivided, awn as long as the blossom.

Chiefly European. The following are thus described.\n\nVol. IV. Part I.\n\n* B. panicle expanding; spikets egg-shaped; awn polymorphous; straight. Its merit or demerit in an agricultural view plus, does not seem sufficiently ascertained. It is said to be disliked by farmers, as being in corn fields a troublesome weed, and in pastures and mowing grounds of little value, since it has generally fed its feed by the time of mowing, and produces very few root-leaves.\n\n* B. panicle drooping; spikets egg-shaped; awns squarroso-straddling; panicle imbranched.\n\n* B. panicle upright, ending abruptly; spikets ob-crectus, long, hairy, awned, about 5 florets in each; straws upright; leaves hard. A coarse grass disliked by cattle, as are all the bromes. Properly a fescue, but has the habit of a brome.\n\n* B. panicle diffuse, upright but open; spikets strap-madrinet-shaped, the middlemost in pairs; pedicles thickest at first, the top.\n\n* B. panicle drooping, rough; spikets hairy, awned; asper, leaves rough.\n\n* B. panicle spreading; spikets oblong; florets two-florilis, rowed; cal. taper-pointed.

Stipa, or Feather-grass.\n\nCal. 2-valved, 1-flowered. Cor. outer valve ending in an awn; awn jointed at the base. This genus includes 11 species; viz. pennata, juncea, capillata, aristella, pilaceae, tenaciflora, capensis, spicata, bicolor, avanacea, membranacea. Europe, and Cape of Good Hope. The following is thus described.\n\n* S. awns woolly.\n\npennata.\n\n142. Avena, or Oats.\n\nCal. 2-valved, many flowered. Awn from the back of the cor. twisted. This genus includes 34 species; viz. fibricia, elatior, stipitiformis, arisifidoides, triflata, pallida, penylvanica, loeflingiana, brevis, alba, frigofa, orientalis, sativa, forskaeli, nuda, satua, elephantina, sequitertia, lutea, tenuis, pubescens, ferilis, flavescens, lupulina, purpurea, antarcta, fragilis, hirta, pratinus, vericolor, diflicophylla, filiformis, spica, bromoides, chiefly Cape of Good Hope and mild climates. The following are thus described.\n\n* A. panicked: cal. 3-flowered; male floret awned; elatior, hermaphrodite floret sometimes awnless. Cows, sheep, and goats eat it. The roots are sometimes very troublesome to the farmers in arable lands, producing a kind of quitch. It produces a large crop, but is unpalatable to cattle, especially to horses, as are the avene in general.\n\n* A. panicked: cal. 3-flowered, shorter than the re-nuda, ceptacle; petals awned upon the back; the third floret awnless. This is nearly as good as the cultivated oat; it will make gruel or oat cake, and feed cattle, as well as that. Ray says it falls in Cornwall at the price of wheat.\n\n* A. panicked: cal. 3-flowered, all the florets awn-fatua, ed and hairy at the base. Horses, sheep and goats eat it. The awns are used for hygrometers. Sometimes so prevalent amongst barley as almost entirely to choke it. It may be extirpated by repeated fallowing, or laying down the land in grass.\npubescens. * A. panicle spike-like; cal. 3-flowered; cor. bearded at the base; leaves flat, downy.\n\nflaveolens. * A. panicle loose; cal. 3-flowered, short all the florets awned.\n\npratensis. * A. panicle spike-like; cal. 5-flowered.\n\nstregoza. * A. panicle oblong, compact, pointing one way; florets in pairs, with 2 awns at the end, and a jointed awn on the back.\n\n143. Lagurus, or Hares-tail Grasses.\n\nCal. 2-valved, awn woolly. Cor. entire, petal with 2 awns at the end, and a twisted awn at the back.\n\nThis genus includes one species; viz.\n\novatus. * L. spike egg-shaped, awned.\n\n144. Arundo, or Reed.\n\nCal. 2-valved. Cor. awn-less, surrounded with down at the base. This genus includes 11 species; viz. donax, phragmites, bitaria, benghalensis, tenax, karka, conspicua, epigejos, calamagrostis, colorata, arenaria. Chiefly of warm climates, except the following, which are thus described.\n\nphragmites. * A. cal. 5-flowered; panicle spreading. The panicles are said to be used by the country people in Sweden to dye woollen green. The reeds are much more durable than straw for thatching: Screens to keep off the cold winds in gardens are made of them; and they are laid across the frame of wood-work as the foundation for plaster floors.\n\nepigejos. * A. cal. 1-flowered; panicle upright; leaves smooth underneath.\n\ncalamagrostis. * A. cal. 1-flowered, smooth; blossoms woolly; straw branched.\n\narenaria. * A. cal. 1-flowered; leaves rolled in at the edges, sharp pointed.\n\n145. Pappahorum\n\nHas one species; viz. alopecuroideum.\n\n146. Aristida, or Oat-grass.\n\nIncludes ten species; viz. adscensionis, americana, gigantea, hystrica, velfita, plumosa, capensis, setacea, deprefa, arundinacea. Cape, and milder climates.\n\n147. Lolium, or Darnel or Rye-grass.\n\nCal. 1 leaf, fixed, many-flowered; spikes alternate. This genus includes five species; viz. perenne, tenuis, temulentum, maximum, diftachyon. The following are thus described:\n\nperenne. * L. spike awnless; spikes compressed, many-flowered, longer than the cal. It makes an excellent hay upon dry chalky or sandy soils. It is cultivated with advantage along with clover, and springs earlier than the other grasses, thereby supplying food for cattle at a season when it is most difficult to be obtained. Cows, horses, and sheep eat it. Goats are not fond of it. Though it succeeds best upon light soils, it will flourish on any land except stiff clay, and will grow even on that; but upon rich sands and loams it becomes not only a good spring grass, but if properly managed by due mixtures, turns out well as permanent pasture land; always, however, most valuable by being sheep-fed, for which it is singularly adapted. It is worthy of remark, however, that there is reason to think that the common cultivated rye-grass has degenerated from its natural qualities; and that it is inferior in many respects, particularly in its duration, to the ryegrass which grows naturally in the best British meadows and pastures.\n\n* L. spikes awned, compressed, many-flowered; not temulent-longer than the cal.; straw rough. The seeds mixed turn, with bread corn produce but little effect, unless the bread be eaten hot; but, if malted with barley, the ale soon occasions drunkennels.\n\n* L. spikets awnless, rather shorter than the calyx; arvensis. cal. 2-valved; straw smooth. It is very injurious to a wheat crop, but may readily be avoided as it is sown along with the seed.\n\n* L. panicle undivided, pointing one way; spikets bromoides. awned.\n\n148. Rottboellia, or Sea hard-grass.\n\nCal. of 1 or 2 valves, egg-shaped, flat. Florets alternate, on a zigzag spike-stalk. Cor. 2-valved, awnless. This genus includes 16 species; viz. incurvata, filiformis, cylindrica, thomaca, repens, laevis, pilosa, compressa, hirtuta, cymbache, chlorachis, dimidiatata, exaltata, corymbosa, muricata, sauginea. Chiefly of Europe and India. The following is thus described.\n\n* R. spike cylindrical, awl-shaped; cal. husk awl-incurvata, shaped, contiguous, divided into two.\n\n149. Elymus, or Lime-grass.\n\nCal. lateral, 2-valved, several together, many-flowered. This genus contains 12 species; viz. arenarius, giganteus, fibricus, tener, philadelphicus, canadensis, caninus, virgincus, litratus, europaeus, caput medusae, hystrix. Chiefly of Europe and America. The following are thus described.\n\n* E. spike upright, compact; cal. woolly, longer arenarius. than the floret. It resists the spreading of the loose sand on the sea shore. It is not capable of being formed into ropes as the stipa tenacissima is in Spain. Cows, horses, and goats eat it; sheep refuse it.\n\n* E. spike compact, leaning; spikets upright without caninus, an involucrem, the lowermost in pairs.\n\n* E. spike upright; spikets 2-florets in each, as long europaeus, as the cal.\n\n150. Secale, or Rye,\n\nContains four species, viz. cereale, villosum, orientale, creticum.\n\n151. Hordeum, or Barley.\n\nCal. lateral, 2-valved, 1-flowered; three together. This genus includes ten species; viz. vulgare, hexallichon, ditlichon, zeocriton, bulbosum, nodosum, murinum, fecalimum, maritimum, jubatum. The following are thus described.\n\n* H. lateral florets male, awned, smooth on the heel; murinum. involucrem of the intermediate florets fringed. Sheep and horses eat it. It feeds the brown moth (pbalana granella), and the barley fly (musca frit).\n\n* H. lateral florets male, awnless; involucrem brittle-pratense. shaped, rough. In moist meadows it produces a considerable quantity of hay, but is not to be recommended as one of the best grasses for the farmer.\n\n* H. lateral florets male, awnless; middle floret her-maritimamphrodite, with a long awn.\n\n* H. all the florets hermaphrodite, awned; cal. sylvaticum growing together at the base, shorter than the awns.\n\n152. Triticum, or Wheat.\n\nCal. 2-valved, solitary, mostly 3-flowered; floret bluntish.\nbluntish. This genus includes 18 species; viz. \u00e6chium, hybernium, compositum, turgidum, polonicum, spelta, monococcum, hilpanicum, prostratum, pumilum, junceum, distichum, repens, maritimum, tenellum, unioloides, loliaceum, unilaterale. Of mild climates. The following are thus described.\n\n*T. cal. 5-flowered, lopped; leaves edges rolled in.\n\n*T. cal. 4-flowered, awl-shaped, tapering to a point; leaves flat. It is a most troublesome weed in arable lands, and can only be destroyed by fallowing in a dry summer. At Naples the roots are collected in large quantities and sold in the market to feed horses: they have a sweet taste, something approaching to that of liquorice: when dried, and ground to meal, they have been made into bread in years of scarcity. The juice of them drank liberally is recommended by Boerhaave in obstructions of the viscera; particularly in cases of scirrous liver and jaundice. Cattle are frequently found to have scirrous livers in the winter, and they soon get cured when turned out to graze in the spring. Dogs eat the leaves to excite vomiting; horses eat them when young, but leave them when fully grown; cows, sheep, and goats eat them.\n\n*T. cal. pointed, mollly 4-flowered; awns longer than the cor.; spikelets upright.\n\n*T. spike simple, compressed; spikelets egg-shaped, but pointed; cal. many-flowered.\n\n153. Lappago\n\nHas one species, called racemosa. Europe, India, and Arabia.\n\nORDER III. TRIGYNYIA.\n\n154. Eriocaulon, or Net-work,\n\nHas eight species; viz. triangulare, quinquangulare, fexangulare, fetaceum, decangulare, repens, fasciculatum, umbellatum. India, and S.

Dipsacus, or Teazel.\n\nHas four species; viz. *fullonum, *fylvefris, laciniatus, and *pilosus.\n\n* D. leaves fitting, serrated; chaff bent backwards, fullonum.\n\nIt is cultivated for the use of the clothiers, who employ the heads with crooked awns, to raise the knap upon woollen cloths. For this purpose they are fixed round the circumference of a large broad wheel, which is made to turn round, and the cloth is held against them. The plant flowers in June and July, and the heads are collected in August. It is sometimes grown along with caraway and coriander; by which means three crops are on the soil at once, without inconvenience, as they ripen at different periods.\n\n172. Scabiosa, or Scabious.\n\nHas 41 species; viz. alpina, uffulata, rigida, attenuata, scabra, tranylvanica, syriaca, leucantha, *sucifera, integrifolia, amplexicaulis, humilis, decurrens, tatarica,\ntatarica, * arvensis, uralensis, sylvatica, gramantia, * colubraria, pyrenaica, ficula, rutea, * maritima, italica, prolifera, atropurpurea, argentea, indurata, africana, montpelienis, pumila, cretica, limonifolia, graminifolia, lyra, palestina, iliciflora, ucrainica, ochroleuca, papoosa, and pterocaphala.

Eur. Arab. N. Amer. Of these the following deserve notice.\n\n* G. leaves 8 in a whirl, strap-shaped, furrowed; flower-verum, branching short. The flowers will coagulate boiling milk; and their juice changes blue infusions to a red colour, thereby discovering marks of acidity. The French prescribe them in hysterical and epileptic cases. Boiled in alum-water they tinge wool yellow. The roots dye a very fine red, not inferior to madder, and are used for this purpose in the island of Jura. (Pentan 1772, p. 212.) Sheep and goats eat it. Horses and swine refuse it. Cows are not fond of it. It is subject to a disease, in which the stem and plants are set with flethy balls, about the size of a pea, hollow within and covered with a purplish skin.\n\n* G. leaves 4 in a whirl, spear-shaped, smooth, 3-fibred; boreales, stem upright. The roots afford a red dye for woollens.\n\n* G. leaves 8 in a whirl, spear-shaped; keel rough aparine, with prickles pointing backwards; joints woolly. The branches are used by the Swedes instead of a foi to strain milk. Young geese are very fond of them. The seeds may be used instead of coffee. The plant is eaten by horses, cows, sheep and goats. Swine refuse it. (Linn.) The expressed juice of the stem and leaves, taken to the amount of four ounces night and morning, is very efficacious in removing many of those cutaneous eruptions, which are called, although improperly, scorbutic. It must be continued for several weeks.\n\n186. Crucianella, or Petty madder.\n\nNine species; viz. angustifolia, latifolia, egyptiaca, patula, ciliata, pubescens, maritima, capita, montpeliana. S.

Eur. Egypt, China, N. Amer.\n* P. leaves spear-shaped; spike nearly egg-shaped, na-lanceolata.\nked; flalk angular. It is usually called ribwort or rib-gras. Linnaeus says it is eaten by horses, sheep, and goats, and that cows refuse it; but Haller attributes the richness of the milk in the famous alpine dairies to this plant, and to the alchemilla vulgaris.\u2014The total absence of this plant in marshy lands, is a certain criterion of the wretched quality thereof: in proportion as such soils are meliorated by draining, this plant will flourish and abound. When sown for pasture upon rich sands and loams, this plant gives a considerable herbage; and on poorer and drier soils, it does well for sheep, but is inferior to some others. Mr Marshall observes that it has stood the test of 20 years established practice, in Yorkshire, and is in good estimation, though not well affected by horses, and bad for hay from retaining its sap. The plantago major or great plantain, is called septinervia, from its having 7 large nerves or ribs running along each leaf; the narrow-leaved sort, above described, has only five ribs, and hence it is called quinquenervia. The leaves are slightly astringent, and the seeds are said to be so; and hence they stand recommended in hemorrhages and other cases of this kind where medicines of this kind are proper. The leaves bruised a little are the common application of the common people to slight flesh wounds.\n\nPlantain has been alleged to be a cure for the bite of the rattle-snake; but for this there is probably little foundation, although it is one of the principal ingredients in the remedy of the negro Caesar, for the discovery of which he received a considerable reward from the assembly of S. Carolina.\n\n223. SCOPARIA.\nThree species; viz. dulcis, procumbens, arbores. Egypt, N. America.\n\n224. CENTUNCULUS, or Bafe Pimpernel.\nOne species; called minimus. Germany, S. Eur.\n\n225.

What is usually called White Sanders wood, is brought from the East Indies, in billets about the size of a man's leg, of a pale whitish colour. It constitutes the outer part of the timber or that part of the tree which is nearest the bark. This white part has little sensible smell or taste. The inner part of the timber, which usually receives the appellation of Yellow Sanders wood, is of a pale yellowish colour, of a pleasant smell and a bitterish aromatic taste, accompanied with an agreeable sort of pungency. Distilled with water it yields a fragrant essential oil, which thickens in the cold to the consistence of a balsam. Digested in pure spirit it imparts a rich yellow tincture, which being committed to distillation, the spirit arises without bringing over anything considerable of the virtues of the Sanders. The residuum contains the virtues of five times its weight of the wood. Hoffman looks upon this extract as a medicine of similar virtues to ambergris, and recommends it as an excellent restorative in great debilities.\n\n252. **Struthiola**.\n\nFive species; viz. virgata, nana, juniperina, erecta, ovata.

As soon as the shoots have twined about an adjoining plant, they send out from their inner surface a number of little vessels or papillae, which attach themselves to the bark or rind of the plant. By degrees the longitudinal vessels of the stalk, which appear to have accompanied the vessels, shoot forth from their extremities and make their way to the foister plant, by dividing the vessels and infusing themselves into the tenderest part of the stalk; and so intimately are they united with it, that it is easier to break than to disengage them from it.\n\n263. *Hypecoum*.\nFour species; viz. procumbens, littorale, pendulum, erectum.\n\n264. *Nerteria*.\nOne species; viz. depressa.

Sheep are fed in the winter with the crops, as are also deer. Birds eat the berries. The bark fermented, and afterwards washed from the woody fibres, makes the common bird-lime. It makes an impenetrable fence, and bears cropping; nor is its verdure, or the beauties of its scarlet berries ever observed to suffer from the severity of our winters. The wood is used in fencing, and is sometimes stained black to imitate ebony. Handles for knives and cogs for mill-wheels are made of it.\u2014It is said to have been observed by Linnaeus, that the lower branches within reach of cattle bear thorny leaves, whilst the upper ones which stand in need of no such defense are without thorns.\n\n268. *Coldenia*.\nOne species; viz. procumbens.

Laurus, or Bay-tree.\n\n34 species; viz. cinnamonum, caffia, camphora, culibana, montana, chloroxylon, glauca, pedunculata, cauflca, nobilis, indica, foetens, perfica, borbonia, martinicensis, exaltata, alpigena, triandra, fanguinea, furanenensis, hexandra, falcifolia, coriacea, leucoxyon, membranacea, patens, parviflora, pendula, floribunda, lucida, umbellata, \u00e6stivalis, benzoin, saffraffas. Of these we shall take notice of the following, as of considerable importance.\n\n1. The nobilis, or evergreen bay tree, is a native of Italy, and hath an upright trunk branching on every side from the bottom upward; with spear-shaped, nervous, stiff, evergreen leaves, three inches long and two broad; and small, yellowish, quadrifid, dioecious flowers, succeeded by red berries in autumn and winter. Of these species there are varieties, with broad, narrow, striped, or waved leaves. 2. The \u00e6stivalis, or deciduous bay, grows naturally in North America. It rises, with an upright stem, covered with a purplish bark; having oblong, oval, acuminate, veined, deciduous leaves, two or three inches long, and half as broad, growing opposite; with small white flowers, succeeded by red berries. 3. The benzoin, or benjamin tree, is also a native of North America; grows 15 or 20 feet high, divided into a very branchy head; with oval, acute, deciduous leaves, three or four inches long, and half as broad; and small yellowish flowers, not succeeded by berries in this country. 4. The saffraffas is a native of the same country. It hath a shrub-like straight stem, garnished with both oval and three-lobed, thinning, deciduous leaves, of different sizes, from three to six inches long, and near as broad, with small yellowish flowers, succeeded by blackish berries, but not in this country. 5. The indica, or Indian bay tree, rises with an upright straight trunk, branching regularly 20 or 30 feet high; adorned with very large, spear-shaped, plane, nervous, evergreen leaves on reddish footstalks; and bunches of small whitish green flowers, succeeded by large oval black berries which do not ripen in this country. 6. The borbonia, or Carolina red bay tree, rises with an upright straight stem, branching 15 or 20 feet high; with large, spear-shap-\n\ned, evergreen leaves, transfervely veined; and long bunches of flowers on red footstalks, succeeded by large blue berries sitting in red cups. 7. The camphora, or camphire tree, grows naturally in the woods of the western parts of Japan, and in the adjacent islands. The root smells stronger of camphire than any of the other parts, and yields it in greater plenty. The bark of the stalk is outwardly somewhat rough; but in the inner surface smooth and mucous, and therefore easily separated from the wood, which is dry and of a white colour. The leaves stand upon slender footstalks, have an entire undulated margin, running out into a point; have the upper surface of a lively and shining green, the lower herbaceous and silky; and are furnished with a few lateral nerves, which stretch archwise to the circumference, and frequently terminate in small warts; a circumstance peculiar to this species of laurus. The flowers are produced on the tops of footstalks, which proceed from the armpits of the leaves; but not till the tree has attained considerable age and size. The flower-stalks are slender, branched at the top, and divided into very short pedicles, each supporting a single flower. These flowers are white, and consist of six petals, which are succeeded by a purple and thinning berry of the size of a pea, and in figure somewhat top-shaped. It is composed of a soft pulpy substance that is purple, and has the taste of cloves and camphire; and of a nucleus or kernel of the size of a pepper, that is covered with a black, thinning, oily rind, of an insipid taste. 8. The cinnamonum, or cinnamon tree, is a native of Ceylon. It hath a large root, and divides into several branches, covered with a bark, which on the outer side is of a greyish brown, and on the inside has a reddish cast. The wood of the roots is hard, white, and has no smell. The body of the tree, which grows to the height of 20 or 30 feet, is covered, as well as its numerous branches, with a bark which at first is green and afterwards red. The leaf is longer and narrower than the common bay tree; and it is three-nerved, the nerves vanishing towards the top. When first unfolded, it is of a flame colour; but after it has been for some time exposed to the air, and grows dry, it changes to a deep green on the upper surface, and to\na lighter on the lower. The flowers are small and white, and grow in large bunches at the extremity of the branches; they have an agreeable smell, something like that of the lily of the valley. The fruit is shaped like an acorn, but is not so large. 9. The cassis, or balsam cinnamon, has lanceolate leaves, triple-nerved.\n\n10. The persea, avocado pear tree, or alligator pear, rises to a considerable height, with a straight trunk, of which the bark and wood are of a grayish colour. The leaves are long, oval, pointed, of a substance like leather, and of a beautiful green colour. The flowers are produced in large knots or clusters at the extremities of the branches, and consist each of six petals disposed in the form of a star, and of a dirty white or yellow colour, with an agreeable odour, which diffuses itself to a considerable distance. It is a native of the West Indies. The persea begins to bear two years and a half, or at most three years, after being planted; and, like most of the trees in warm climates, bears twice a year. The other species of this genus are possessed of no remarkable properties.\n\nThe first species are propagated by layers, or by the berries. In order to raise a quantity of these trees by layers, some stools should be planted for the purpose; and after these are shot about a yard high, the branches must be brought down to the ground in the winter, all the preceding summer's shoots laid on it, and pegged down (being first slit in the joint), and the leaves taken off, which would otherwise be under ground. In one year's time these layers will have taken root; and in the spring they should be taken up, and planted in the nursery a foot asunder, in rows two feet distance. After they are planted out, if the weather should prove dry, they must be constantly watered; for without such care, it is difficult to make this tree grow. After they have taken well to the ground, they will require no farther trouble than keeping them clean from weeds, and digging between the rows each winter, till they are finally planted out. 2. In order to raise this tree from the berries, they ought to hang on the trees till about January before they are gathered. A well sheltered spot of ground for the sowing must be made choice of; and having the mould smooth and fine, they should be sown soon after they are gathered, in beds or drills, rather more than half an inch deep. Towards the close of the spring the plants will come up, and during summer must be duly attended, by watering and weeding. In the winter following, their sheltered situation must not be trusted to, to defend them from the frost: Furze bushes, or some such things, ought to be stuck in rows between the beds or drills, to guard them from the black frosts. Indeed, without this precaution, if the winter should prove very frosty, few of the young seedlings will be alive in spring. During the following summer, weeding and watering must be observed, and the winter after that they should be defended with covering as before; for they will be still in danger of being destroyed by severe frosts. In the ensuing spring, the strongest may be taken out of the seed-beds, and planted in the nursery way; though, if they have not by that time made good shoots, it will be advisable to let them remain in their beds till the third spring; for a small plant of this kind is with more difficulty made to grow than one which is larger. When they are planted in the nursery, the distance which should be allowed them is the same as the layers, a foot asunder and two feet distance in the rows; and this will not be found too close; for notwithstanding the greatest care is exerted in planting them in the nursery, even making choice of rainy and cloudy weather, which must always be observed in setting them out, many of them will be lost by being transplanted. After they are thus planted out in the nursery, whether layers or seedlings, they must be still watered in dry weather, kept free from weeds, and the rows dug between every winter. You will even find, that those plants which suffer least by being transplanted will have met with a check, which they will not recover in two or three years; and till they have acquired new strength they should not be taken from the nursery; but when they appear to be good stiff plants, having the year before made a vigorous shoot, they will be then proper plants for planting out where they are to remain. Holes should be got ready for their reception; and as soon as the first autumnal rains fall, the work should be set about, especially if the land be gravelly or dry; but if it be moist, the spring will do as well. Being now planted at one yard distance, they will make a poor progress for two or three years more; but after this, when they have overcome all these difficulties, they will grow very fast, and arrive to be good trees in a few years. Although this tree flourishes best in old gardens, where the soil has been made rich and deep, and loves the shade, Hanbury tells us, \"it thrives nevertheless exceedingly well in our hottest gravels and sands; and after it has surmounted the hardships of transplanting, will grow in such situations extremely fast, and arrive to a large bulk.\"\n\nThe propagation of the three next sorts of trees may be performed two or three ways: 1. By the seeds. These we receive, from the places where the trees grow naturally, in the spring. They should be preferred in sand; and as soon as they arrive, should be sown in large pots an inch deep. The soil for their reception should be taken from a rich pasture at least a year before, with the fward. It should also be laid in a heap, and frequently turned, until the fward is grown rotten, and the whole appears well mixed and fine. If the pasture from whence it was taken near the surface is a sandy loam, this is the best compost for these seeds; if not, a small addition of drift or sea sand should be added, and well mixed with the other mould. After filling the pots with this soil, the seeds should be sown an inch deep; and then they should be plunged into common mould up to the rim. If the soil be naturally moist, it will keep them cooler, and be better; and if the place be well sheltered and shaded, it will be better still. Nothing more than weeding, which must be constantly observed during the summer, will be necessary; and in this situation they may remain until the March following: about the middle of which month, having prepared a good hot bed, the pots should be taken up and plunged therein. Soon after the seeds will come up; and when the young plants have sufficiently received the benefit of this bed, they should be injured by degrees to the open air. Weeding and watering must be observed during the summer; and at the approach of the cold weather in the autumn, they should be removed under a hotbed frame, or some cover.\ncover, to be protected from the frosts during the winter. In the spring, when this danger is over, they should resume their first station; namely, the pots should be plunged up to the rim, as when the seeds were first sown; and if this place be well sheltered, they may remain there all winter: if not, and severe frosts threaten, they should be taken up and placed under cover as before. After they have been thus managed three years from the seeds, they should be taken out of the pots with care, and planted in the nursery ground at small distances, where they may remain until they are strong enough to be finally set out. By sowing the seeds in pots, and afflicting them by a hotbed, a year at least is saved; for they hardly ever come up, when sown in a natural border, under two years from the seeds; nay, they have been known to remain three, and even some plants to come up the fourth year after sowing; which at once shows the preference of the former practice, and should caution all who have not such convenience, not to be too hasty in disturbing the beds when the seeds are sown in the natural ground; as, especially if they are not well preserved in mould or sand, there may be some years before they appear. Indeed, it is the long time we are in obtaining these plants, either by seeds, layers, &c., that makes them at present so scarce amongst us.\n\n2. These plants may also be increased by layers; but very slowly; for they will be two, and sometimes three, or even four years, before they have struck out good roots; though the benjamin tree is propagated the fastest by this method. The young twigs should be laid in the ground in the autumn; and it will be found that twisting the wire round the bud, so as in some degree to stop the growth of the sap, and taking away with a knife a little of the bark, is a more effectual method of obtaining good roots soon than by the slit or twisting, especially when practised on the saffron tree.\n\n3. Plants of these sorts are likewise sometimes obtained by cuttings, which they will at all times throw out, and which may be often taken off with pretty good roots; but when they are weak, and with bad roots, they should be planted in pots, and afflicted by a moderate heat in a bed: with such management they will be good plants by the autumn, and in the spring may be planted out anywhere.\n\n4. Cuttings of these trees, when planted in a good bark bed, and duly watered, will also oftentimes grow. When this method is practised, and plants obtained, they must be insured by degrees to the open air, till they are hardy enough to be finally planted out.\n\nThe Indian bay, the camphire, the avocado, and the cinnamon tree, require the treatment common to greenhouse plants; the latter, however, is rather a flowery plant in this country.\u2014Of its culture or propagation in its native places, no particular account has been given by botanical writers; but it must now become an important consideration with us, since the island of Ceylon, where cinnamon chiefly grows, now belongs to Great Britain. Of the advantages promised by this acquisition, we are indebted for the first accounts to Dr Wright in 1787; from whom also we learn that its propagation is very easy, and its culture requires little care, as more particularly noticed below. Since that time, some observations by Dr Dancer, relative to its cultivation, have appeared in the Transactions of the Society of Arts, &c. These observations confirm, without adding anything essential to, the concise notice of Dr Wright. We are informed, that as the tree \"puts out numerous bine branches, with a dense foliage, from the very bottom of the trunk; this furnishes an opportunity of obtaining plenty of layers, and facilitates the propagation of the tree, as it does not perfect its seeds in any quantity under six or seven years; when it becomes so plentifully loaded, that a single tree is sufficient almost for a colony. It seems to delight in a loo moist soil, and to require a southern aspect; the trees, thus planted, flourishing better than others growing in loam, and not so well exposed to the sun. When healthy, it is (from layers) of pretty quick growth, reaching in eight years the height of fifteen or twenty feet, is very spreading, and furnished with numerous branches of a fit size for decortication. The seeds, however, are a long time in coming up, and the plants make small progress for the first year or two.\" It is added, that \"the birds appear to be very fond of the berries, and will probably propagate this tree in the same way they do many others everywhere over the island; so that in a short time it will grow spontaneously, or without cultivation.\" The age for decortication, said above to be eight years, it will be observed, is different from that specified below for the trees in Ceylon.\n\nEvelyn says, he has seen bay trees near 30 feet high, and almost two feet in diameter; and enumerates the bay among useful trees. Hanbury catches at this idea, and tells us in general terms, that \"it will grow to 30 feet in height, with a trunk of two feet in diameter;\" and accordingly he arranges it among his forest trees; he acknowledges, however, at the same time, that the wood is of little value. The bay is nevertheless a fine aromatic and a beautiful evergreen: It is said to be the true laurus or laurel of the ancients, with which they adorned the brows of their successful generals. Like the holly, box, and laurel, the bay will bear the shade and drip of taller trees; and it is upon the whole a very desirable, as being a very ornamental, evergreen.\n\nThe leaves and berries of this tree have a moderately strong aromatic smell, and a warm, bitterish, pungent taste: the berries are stronger in both respects than the leaves, and afford in distillation a larger quantity of essential aromatic oil; they yield also an almost infipid oil to the press, in consequence of which they prove unctuous in the mouth. They are warm carminatives, and sometimes exhibited in this intention against flatulent colics, and likewise in hysterical disorders. Their principal use in the present practice is in glysters, and some external applications. The deciduous bay, in a moist rich soil, in which it principally delights, will grow to about 16 feet high; but in some soils, that are possessed of the opposite qualities, it will hardly arrive at half that height. The flowers are succeeded in May by large red berries, which never ripen in England: so that, notwithstanding the leaves in summer are very pretty, and the colour of the bark makes a variety in winter, it is principally the scarcity of this plant which makes it valuable.\n\nThe benzoin tree will grow to a much larger size than the other, and its branches are more numerous. They\nThey are smooth, and of a fine light green colour. The leaves on their upper surface are smooth and of a fine light green colour, but their upper surface is veined, and of a whitish cast. When bruised, they emit a fine fragrance. This tree was formerly mistaken for that which produces the drug called benzoin; which is now known to be obtained from a species of flyrax.\n\nThe saffraas will grow to nearly the height of the others, though the branches are not so numerous. Its bark is smooth, and of a red colour, which beautifully distinguishes it in winter; whilst the fine shining green of its leaves constitutes its greatest beauty in summer. In these, indeed, there is a variety, and a very extraordinary one. Some are large and of an oval figure; others are smaller, and of the same shape; whilst others again are divided into three lobes, so as to resemble the leaves of some foils of the fig tree. In America, the saffraas generally stands single in the woods, and along the fences round the fields. It flowers in May before the leaves come out; and being entirely covered with them, it is distinguished at a great distance by their beautiful yellow colour.\n\nThe root of the saffraas has a fragrant smell, and a sweetish, aromatic, subacid taste; the bark tastes much stronger than any other part, and the small twigs stronger than the large pieces. It is a warm aperient and corroborant, and frequently employed with good success for purifying and sweetening the blood and juices. For these purposes, infusions made from the rashed root or bark may be drank as tea. In some constitutions indeed, such liquors are, by their fragrance, apt, on first taking them, to affect the head; but in such cases they may be advantageously freed from their flavour by boiling. A decoction of saffraas, boiled down to the consistence of an extract, proves simply bitterish and subastringent. Hoffman assures us, that he has frequently given this extract to the quantity of a scruple at a time, with remarkable success, for strengthening the tone of the viscera in cachexies; as also in the decline of intermittent fevers and in hypochondriacal spasms. Saffraas yields in distillation an extremely fragrant oil of a penetrating pungent taste, so ponderous (notwithstanding the lightness of the drug itself) as to sink in water. Rectified spirit extracts the whole taste and smell of saffraas; and elevates nothing in evaporation: hence the spirituous extract proves the most elegant and efficacious preparation, as containing the virtue of the root entire.\n\nThe bark of this tree is used by the women in Pennsylvania and other parts of North America in dying worsted a fine lasting orange colour, which does not fade in the sun. They use urine instead of alum in dyeing; and boil the dye in a brass boiler, because in an iron vessel it does not yield to fine a colour. The wood is made use of for posts belonging to the enclosures, for it is said to last a long time in the ground; but it is likewise said, that there is hardly any kind of wood which is more attacked by worms than this when it is exposed to the air without cover; and that in a short time it is quite worm-eaten through and through. On cutting some part of the saffraas tree, or its shoots, and holding it to the nose, it has a strong but pleasant smell. Some people peel the root, and boil the peel with the beer which they are brewing, because they believe it wholesome. For the same reason, the peel is put into brandy either whilst it is distilling or after it is made. Professor Kalm informs us, that a decoction of the root of saffraas in water, drank every morning, is used with success in the dropsy. When part of a wood is destined for cultivation, the saffraas trees are commonly left upon it, because they have a very thick foliage, and afford a cool shade to the cattle during the great heats. Some people get their bed-pots made of saffraas wood, in order to expel the bugs; for its strong scent, it is said, prevents those vermin from settling in them. For two or three years together this has the desired effect, or about as long as the wood keeps its strong aromatic smell; but after that time it has been observed to lose its effect. In Pennsylvania some people put chips of saffraas into their chests, where they keep all sorts of woollen stuffs, in order to expel the moths (or larvae of caterpillars of moths or tinies) which commonly settle in them in summer. The root keeps its smell for a long while; Professor Kalm saw one which had lain five or six years in the drawer of a table, and still preserved the strength of its scent. The people also gather its flowers, and use them as tea.\n\nThe persea, or alligator pear-tree, is cultivated universally in the West Indies by all ranks of people. The fruit is pear-shaped, and from one to two pounds in weight. On removing a green skin or covering, we come to a yellow butyraceous substance; and in the heart find a large round seed or stone, which is unequal in the surface, and exceedingly hard and woody. This fruit is ripe in August and September, and constitutes one of the most agreeable articles of diet for six or eight weeks to the negroes. These pears, with a little salt and a plantain or two, afford a hearty meal. They are also served up at the tables of white people as choice fruit. When the pear is ripe, the yellow or eatable substance is firmer than butter, and tastes somewhat like butter or marrow: hence it is called by some the vegetable marrow. But however excellent this fruit is when ripe, it is very dangerous when pulled and eaten before maturity. Dr Wright says, he has repeatedly known it to produce fever and dysentery, which were removed with difficulty. The leaves of this tree and those of the bead-vine or wild liquorice are made into pectoral decoctions by the common people. The large stone is used for marking linen. The cloth is tied or held over the stone, and the letters are pricked out by a needle through the cloth and into the flesh. The stain is a reddish brown, which never washes out.\u2014The buds of the alligator tree are said to be used with success in plasters against the venereal disease. An infusion of them in water, drank in the morning fasting, is strongly recommended for dislodging congealed blood in the stomach produced by a fall or a severe stroke on that important entrail. \"The wild boars in the East Indies (says Labat) eat greedily of the mammees and avocado pears, which give their flesh a luscious and most agreeable flavour.\"\n\nCassia. The bark of this species is known in the shops by the name of cassia lignea. This bark, which is imported from different parts of the East Indies and from China, has a very near resemblance to the cinnamon; though distinguishable from it by being of a thicker\nthicker and coarser appearance, and by its breaking short and smooth, while the cinnamon breaks fibrous and shivery. It resembles cinnamon still more exactly in its aromatic flavour than in its external appearance; and seems only to differ from it in being somewhat weaker, in abounding more with a viscid mucilaginous matter, and in being less astringent. Accordingly, it has not only a place in the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia, but is also the basis of a distilled water. It is perhaps surprising that the London College have given it no place in their lists. But although it does not enter their Pharmacopoeia, yet we may venture to affirm, that it will not be neglected by the apothecaries. At present it is very common with many of them to substitute the cassia in every case for the more expensive article cinnamon: and indeed almost the whole of what is at present sold under the title either of simple or spirituous cinnamon water is entirely prepared from cassia; and not even entirely from the bark, but from a mixture of the bark and buds.\n\nCinnamon is the under bark of the *cinnamomum*. The best season for separating it from the outer bark, which is gray and rugged, is the spring, when the sap flows in the greatest abundance. It is cut into thin slices, and exposed to the sun, and curls up in drying. The old trees produce a coarse kind of cinnamon; the spice is in perfection only when the trees are not older than three or four years. When the trunk has been stripped of its bark, it receives no further nourishment; but the root is still alive, and continues to throw out fresh shoots. The fruit of the tree is shaped like an acorn, but is not so large. Its seed, when boiled in water, yields an oil which swims at top, and takes fire. If left to cool, it hardens into a white substance, of which candles are made, which have an agreeable smell, and are reserved for the use of the king of Ceylon. The cinnamon is not reckoned excellent unless it be fine, smooth, brittle, thin, of a yellow colour inclining to red, fragrant, aromatic, and of a poignant, yet agreeable taste. The connoisseurs give the preference to that, the pieces of which are long, but slender. That which comes to us is generally mixed with the cassia bark; but this last is easily distinguished. Cinnamon splinters in breaking, and has a roughness along with its aromatic flavour; while the cassia breaks over smooth, and has a mucilaginous taste. Cinnamon is a very elegant and useful aromatic, more grateful both to the palate and stomach than most other substances of this class. By its astringent quality it likewise corroborates the viscera, and proves of great service in several kinds of alvine fluxes, and immoderate discharges from the uterus.\n\nThe cinnamon plant, with other valuable ones, was taken in a French ship by Admiral Rodney in the last war, and presented by him to the assembly of Jamaica. One of the trees was planted in the botanic garden in St Thomas in the East; the other by Hinton East, Esq., in his noble garden at the foot of the Blue Mountains. From these parent trees some hundreds of young trees are already produced from layers and cuttings, and dispersed to different parts of the country, in all which it thrives luxuriantly with little trouble: we may therefore hope it will soon be a valuable addition to our commerce. Upon comparing the parts of the tree with the description and figure given by Burman and other botanists, it appears to be the real Ceylon cinnamon, and of the best kind, called by the natives *Rafl\u00e9 Coronde*: but the specimens of bark taken put it out of all doubt, being, in the opinion of the best judges, of an equal, if not superior, quality to any imported from India. The smallest bit of the bark, Dr Wright affirms us, is quite a cordial. The cinnamon we have from Holland, he observes, is often inert, and gives room to suspect that it has been subjected to a slight process in distillation.\n\nIn regard to the trees growing in Jamaica, Dr Dancker informs us, in his paper already quoted, that \"The best cinnamon bark, according to the different trials I have made, is taken from the small branches, of about an inch diameter, the larger limbs not being so easily decorticated, and not yielding so good or so strong a cinnamon. The smaller twigs, or those that have not acquired a cineritious bark, are too full of sap and mucilage, and have little aroma. It is the liber, or inner bark, that constitutes the cinnamon; from which the two external barks must be carefully and entirely separated, or they vitiate the flavour of the cinnamon; to do which with dexterity, and to raise the bark from the wood, requires some practice. The bark being separated, the smaller pieces are to be placed within the larger: which, by exposure to the sun or the air, presently coil up, and require no further preparation. A dry season is the proper one for taking the bark; as it is found to be weakened after long or heavy rains. Cinnamon, though more retentive of its virtues than any of the other spices, yet requires to be protected when taken, from the air and moisture, by close packing in cedar chests. The leaves of this tree, whether recent or dried, are so strongly impregnated with an aroma, as to afford a good succedaneum for the bark both in cookery and medicine. Distilled, they give an excellent simple and spirituous water, and an essential oil. Powdered, they are a good aromatic species, or marshal perfume.\"\n\nCamphor, though solid, is the essential oil of the *laurus camphora*; and is obtained from it by distillation in the East Indies. (See the article CAMPHORA).\u2014The tree is another of the captured plants given to the inhabitants of Jamaica; and, if cultivated with care, will also be an useful acquisition.\n\nThe Abb\u00e9 Grofier informs us, that in China some of these trees are found above 100 cubits in height, and so thick that 20 persons cannot enclose them. The tree is there called *tebang*; and it is said that the trunk, when old, emits sparks of fire, but of so subtle a nature as not even to injure the hair of those who are near it. Common camphor costs only a penny the ounce at Pe-king; but it is inferior to that of Borneo, in the judgment even of the Chinese.\n\nThe manner in which some authors have spoken of camphire (the Abb\u00e9 obliteres), gives us reason to conclude that they have been entirely ignorant of the processes employed to obtain this salutary gum. The camphire does not drop to the earth, like the gums of certain resinous trees, which are preserved by discharging that part of their substance which is too oily; neither does it distil from the top to the bottom of the tree through an incision made in it. The Chinese would practise this method could it be employed with success; for it is very common in China to make such kind\nkind of incisions in resinous trees. The method used by the Chinese for obtaining camphire is as follows.\u2014They take some branches fresh from the tebang, chop them very small, and lay them to steep in spring water for three days and three nights. After they have been soaked in this manner, they are put into a kettle, where they are boiled for a certain time, during which they keep continually stirring them with a stick made of willow. When they perceive that the sap of these small chips adheres sufficiently to the stick in the form of white froth, they strain the whole, taking care to throw away the dregs and refuse. This juice is afterwards poured gently into a new earthen bason well varnished, in which it is suffered to remain one night. Next morning it is found coagulated, and formed into a solid mass. To purify this first preparation, they procure some earth from an old earthen wall, which, when pounded, and reduced to a very fine powder, they put into the bottom of a basin made of red copper; over this layer of earth they spread a layer of camphire, and continue thus until they have laid four strata. The last, which is of very fine earth, they cover up with the leaves of the plant po-bo, or pennyroyal; and over the whole they place another basin, joining it very closely to the former by means of a kind of red earth that cements their brims together. The basin thus prepared is put over a fire, which, must be managed so as to keep up an equal heat: experience teaches them to observe the proper degree. But above all, they must be very attentive lest the plaster of fat earth which keeps the basins together should crack or fall off; otherwise the spirituous part would evaporate, and ruin the whole process. When the basins have been exposed to the necessary heat, they are taken off and left to cool; after which they are separated, and the sublimated camphire is found adhering to the cover. If this operation be repeated two or three times, the camphire is found purer and in larger pieces. Whenever it is necessary to use any quantity of this substance, it is put between two earthen vessels, the edges of which are surrounded with several bands of wet paper. These vessels are kept for about an hour over an equal and moderate fire; and when they are cool, the camphire is found in its utmost perfection and ready for use. This method of procuring camphire, even from the heart of the tree, may be practised in all seasons of the year; which would not be the case (our author observes), were it extracted like other resinous substances that only flow during a certain short space of time. Besides, by lopping the branches of the camphire tree, less hurt is done to it than by making incisions, which are always hazardous.\n\n799. Anacardium, or Cashew-nut, or Acajou.

Eight species; viz. rhaponticum, undulatum, palmatum, compactum, tartaricum, ribes, hybridum, lenocorhizum. Siberia, Levant, Tartary, India, China.\n\nThe rheum palmatum, which is of the dock kind, grows spontaneously in China, and endures the colds of our own climate. Two sorts of rhubarb are met with in the shops. The first is imported from Turkey and Russia, in roundish pieces, freed from the bark, with a hole through the middle of each; they are externally of a yellow colour, and, on cutting, appear variegated with lively reddish streaks. The other, which is less esteemed, comes principally from China, in length pieces, harder, heavier, and more compact than the foregoing. The first sort, unless kept very dry, is apt to grow mouldy and worm-eaten; the second is less subject to these inconveniences. Some of the more industrious artists are said to fill up the worm holes with certain mixtures, and to colour the outside of the damaged pieces with powder of the finer sorts of rhubarb, and sometimes with cheaper materials; this is often so nicely done, as effectually to impose upon the buyer, unless he very carefully examines each piece. The marks of good rhubarb are, that it be firm and solid, but not flinty; that it be easily pulverable, and appear, when powdered, of a fine bright yellow colour: that upon being chewed, it imparts to the spittle a saffron tinge, without proving slimy or mucilaginous in the mouth. Its taste is subacid, bitterish, and somewhat astringent; the smell lightly aromatic.\n\nRhubarb is a mild cathartic, which operates without violence or irritation, and may be given with safety even to pregnant women and to children. In some people, however, it always occasions severe griping. Besides its purgative quality, it is celebrated for an astringent one, by which it strengthens the tone of the stomach and intestines, and proves useful in diarrhoea, and disorders proceeding from a laxity of the fibres. Rhubarb, in substance, operates more powerfully as a cathartic than any of the preparations of it. Watery tinctures purge more than the spirituous ones; whilst the latter contain, in greater proportion, the aromatic, astringent, and corroborating virtues of the rhubarb. The dose, when intended as a purgative, is from a scruple to a dram or more.\n\nThe Turkey rhubarb is, among us, universally preferred to the East India sort, though this last is, for some purposes, at least equal to the other; it is manifestly more astringent, but has somewhat less of an aromatic flavour. Tinctures drawn from both, with rectified spirit, have nearly the same taste; on distilling off the menstruum, the extract left from the tincture of the East India rhubarb, proved considerably the strongest. They are both the produce of the same climate, and probably the roots of the same plant, taken up at different times, or cured in a different manner.\n\nRhubarb is now raised in Britain equal to any that is imported.\n\nThe officinal preparations of this drug are a watery and\nand a vinous infusion, a simple and a compound tincture. It is also an ingredient in different compositions, such as the elixir ex aloe et rheo, the pilula stomachica, and some others.\n\nORDER III. HEXAGYNIA.\n\n804.

It communicates its flavour to the milk and butter of cows that eat it.\n\n* A. filaments undivided; leaves semi-cylindrical, *oleraceum*, rough furrowed underneath; (leaves not rough.)\u2014The tender leaves are very commonly boiled in soups, or fried with other herbs. Cows, goats, sheep, and swine, eat it.\n\nA. stalk 3-square; leaves spear-shaped on leaf-flasks; *urfnunum*, umbel flat-topped.\u2014An infusion of this plant in brandy is esteemed a good remedy for the gravel. Other plants growing near it do not flourish. Cows eat it in the spring when grass is scarce; but it communicates an offensive flavour to the milk and butter.\n\nA.\u2014The roots of this plant, which is the proper garlick, are of an irregularly roundish shape, with several fibres at the bottom; each root is composed of a number of lesser bulbs, called cloves of garlick, enclosed in one common membranaceous coat, and easily separated from each other. All the parts of this plant, but more especially the roots, have a strong offensive smell, and an acrimonious, almost caustic, taste. The root applied to the skin inflames and often ulcerates the part. Its smell is extremely penetrating and diffusive. When the root is applied to the feet, its scent is soon discoverable in the breath; and when taken internally its smell is communicated to the urine, or the matter of an illuse, and perpiles through the pores of the skin.\n\nThis pungent root warms and stimulates the solids, and attenuates tenacious juices. Hence in cold leucophlegmatic habits, it proves a powerful expectorant diuretic, and, if the patient be kept warm, sudorific; it has also been by some supposed to be an emmenagogue. In catarrhous disorders of the breast, flatulent colics, hysterical and other diseases, proceeding from laxities of the solids, it has generally good effects; it has likewise been found serviceable in many hydropic cases. Sydenham relates, that he has seen the dropsy cured by the use of garlick alone; he recommends it chiefly as a warm strengthening medicine in the beginning of the disease.\n\nGarlick is with some also a favourite remedy in the cure of intermittents; and it has been said to have sometimes succeeded in obstinate quartans after the Peruvian bark had failed, particularly when taken to the extent of one or two cloves daily in a glass of brandy or other spirits. The liberal use of garlick, however, is apt to occasion headaches, flatulencies, thirst, febrile heats, inflammatory distempers, and sometimes discharges of blood from the hemorrhoidal vessels. In hot bilious constitutions, where there is already a degree of irritation, and where there is reason to suspect an unsound state of the viscera, this stimulating medicine is manifestly improper, and never fails to aggravate the distemper.\n\nThe most commodious form of taking garlick, a medicine to most people not a little unpleasant, is that\nof a bolus or pill. Infusions in spirit, wine, vinegar, and water, although containing the whole of its virtues, are so acrimonious as to be unfit for general use. A syrup and oxymel of it were formerly kept in the shops; but it does not now enter any officinal preparation in our pharmacopoeias; and it is proper that even the pills should always be an extemporaneous prescription, as they suffer much from keeping.\n\nGarlick made into an ointment with oils, &c. &c., applied externally, is said to resolve and destroy cold tumours, and has been by some greatly esteemed in cutaneous diseases. It has likewise sometimes been employed as a repellent. When applied under the form of a poultice to the pubes, it has sometimes proved effectual in producing a discharge of urine, when retention has arisen from want of a due action of the bladder; and some have recommended, in certain cases of deafness, the introduction of a single clove, wrapt in thin muslin or gauze, into the meatus auditorius or passage of the ear. Sydenham affirms us, that among all the substances which occasion a derivation or revolution from the head, none operates more powerfully than garlick applied to the foles of the feet; hence he was led to make use of it in the confluent smallpox. About the eighth day after the face began to swell, the root cut in pieces, and tied in a linen cloth, was applied to the foles, and renewed twice a-day till all danger was over.\n\nThe roots of the allium cepa, or onion, are considered rather as articles of food than of medicine. They are supposed to afford little nourishment, and when eaten liberally in their raw state, produce flatulencies, occasion thirst, headaches, and troublesome dreams. In cold phlegmatic habits, where viscid mucus abounds, they doubtless have their use; as by their stimulating quality they tend to excite appetite, attenuate thick juices, and promote their expulsion: by some they are strongly recommended in suppressions of urine, and in dropsies. The chief medicinal use of onions in the present practice is in external applications, boiled as a cataplasm, for suppurring tumours.\n\n627.

Europe, Japan, N. America.\u2014The Lilium candidum, or white lily, is cultivated in gardens more for its beauty than utility. The mucilaginous root is used by some as a poultice; but it possesses no advantage over the poultices formed of vegetable farines.\n\n628.

Eur. Barb. Madeira, Japan.\n\nS. flowers naked; floral leaves bent backwards as if maritima, broken.\u2014This is the squill or sea-onion well known in medicine. It is a kind of onion growing spontaneously upon dry sandy shores in Spain and the Levant, from whence the root is annually brought into Europe. It should be chosen plump, sound, fresh, and full of clammy juice: some have preferred the red root, others the white, though neither deserves the preference to the other. The only difference perceivable between them is that of the colour, and hence both may be used promiscuously. This root is to the taste very nauseous, intensely bitter, and acrimonious. Much handled it ulcerates the skin. With regard to its medical\ndical virtues, it powerfully stimulates the solids and attenuates viscid juices; and by these qualities promotes expectoration, urine, and, if the patient be kept warm, sweat; if the dose be considerable it proves emetic, and sometimes purgative. The principal use of this medicine is where the prime via abound with mucous matter, and the lungs are oppressed by tenacious phlegm.\n\nDr. Wagner, in his clinical observations, recommends it given along with nitre in hydropical swellings, and in the nephritis; and mentions several cures that he performed by giving from four to ten grains of the powder for a dose, mixed with a double quantity of nitre: he says, that thus managed, it almost always operates as a diuretic, though sometimes it vomits or purges. In dropply, dried iquills are often combined with mercury. The most commodious form for the taking of iquills, unless when designed as an emetic, is that of a bolus or pill: liquid forms are too moff people too offensive, though these may be rendered less disagreeable both to the palate and stomach by the addition of aromatic distilled waters. This root yields the whole of its virtues both to aqueous and to vinous menstrua, and likewise to vegetable acids. Its officinal preparations are a conserve of dried iquills, a syrup, and vinegar, an oxymel, and pills.\n\n641. Cyanella.\n\nFour species; viz. capensis, orchidiformis, lutea, alba. C. of G.

Africa.\n\nThese plants are chiefly or rather only valuable, on account of the medicinal virtues of their insipid juice. The ancients distinguished two sorts of aloes: The one was pure and of a yellowish colour inclining to a red, resembling the colour of a liver, and thence named hepatic; the other was full of impurities, and hence supposed to be only the dross of the better kind. At present various sorts are met with in commerce, which are distinguished from the place in which they are produced, or from their sensible qualities.\n\n1. The Socotrine aloes, said to be obtained from a variety of the aloe perfoliatia. This is the purest sort. It is brought from the island Socotra in the Indian ocean wrapped in skins. It is of a glossy surface, clear, and in some degree pellucid; in the lump, of a yellowish red colour, with a purple cast; when reduced to powder, of a bright golden colour. It is hard and friable in the winter, and somewhat pliable in summer, and grows soft between the fingers. Its taste is bitter, accompanied with an aromatic flavour, but insufficient to prevent its being disagreeable; the smell is not very unpleasant, and somewhat resembles that of myrrh.\n\n2. Barbadoes or hepatic aloes. Hepatic aloes is not so clear and bright as the foregoing sort: it is also of a darker colour, more compact texture, and for the most part drier. Its smell is much stronger and more disagreeable: the taste intensely bitter and nauseous, with little or nothing of the fine aromatic flavour of the Socotrine. The best hepatic aloes comes from Barbadoes in large gourd shells: an inferior sort of it (which is generally soft and clammy), is brought over in casks.\n\n3. Fetid, caballine, or horse aloes, may easily be distinguished from each of the foregoing, by its strong rank smell; although in other respects it agrees pretty much with the hepatic, and is not unfrequently sold in its stead. Sometimes the caballine aloes is prepared so pure and bright, as not to be distinguished by the eye from the Socotrine; but its offensive smell, of which it cannot be divested, readily betrays it. It has not now a place in almost any pharmacopoeia, and is employed chiefly by farriers.\n\nAll the sorts of aloes dissolve in pure spirit, proof spirit, and proof spirit diluted with half its weight of water; the impurities only being left. They dissolve also by the influence of heat in water alone; but as the liquor grows cold, the resinous part subsides, the gummy remaining united with the water. The hepatic aloes is found to contain more resin, and less gum than the Socotrine, and this than the caballine. The resins of all the sorts, purified by spirit of wine, have little smell: that obtained from the Socotrine has scarcely any perceptible taste; that of the hepatic, a slight bitterish relish; and the resin of the caballine a little more of the aloetic flavour. The gummy extracts of all the sorts are less disagreeable than the crude aloes: the extract of Socotrine aloes has very little smell, and is in taste not unpleasing; that of the hepatic has a somewhat stronger smell, but is rather more agreeable in taste than the extract of the Socotrine: the gum of the caballine retains a considerable share of the peculiar rank smell of this sort of aloes, but its taste is not much more unpleasant than that of the extracts made from the two other sorts.\n\nAloes is a stimulating cathartic bitter: if given in too large a dose as to purge effectually, it often occasions an irritation about the anus, and sometimes a discharge of blood. Small doses of it, frequently repeated, not only cleanse the prime vice, but likewise warm the habit, quicken the circulation, and promote the uterine and hemorrhoidal fluxes. This medicine is particularly serviceable in habitual coliciveness, to persons of a phlegmatic temperament and sedentary life, and where the stomach is oppressed and weakened. In dry bilious habits, aloes prove injurious, immoderately heating the body and inflaming the bowels.\n\nThe juice is likewise, on account of its bitterness, supposed to kill worms, either taken internally, or applied in plasters to the umbilical region. It is also celebrated for restraining external hemorrhages, and cleansing and healing wounds and ulcers.\n\nThe ancients gave aloes in much larger doses than is customary at present. Dioscorides orders half a dram or a dram for gently loosening the belly; and three drams where intended to have the full effect of a cathartic. But modern practice rarely exceeds a scruple, and limits the greatest dose to two scruples. For the common purposes of this medicine ten or twelve grains suffice; taken in these or less quantities, it acts as a gentle stimulating ecbiotic, capable of removing, if duly continued, very obstinate obstructions. Aloes are much less frequently used to operate as a purgative than merely to obviate coliciveness: and indeed their purgative effect is not increased in proportion to the quantity that is taken. Perhaps the chief objection to aloes, in cases of habitual coliciveness, is the tendency which they have to induce and augment hemorrhoidal affections; and with those liable to such complaints they can seldom be employed. Their purgative effect seems chiefly to depend on their proving a stimulus to the rectum.\n\nSome are of opinion that the purgative virtue of aloes resides entirely in its resin: but experience has shown that the pure resin has little or no purgative quality; and that the gummy part, separated from the resinous, acts more powerfully than the crude aloes. If the aloes indeed be made to undergo long coction in the preparation of the gummy extract, its cathartic power will be considerably lessened, not from the separation of the resin, but from an alteration made in the juice.\njuice itself by the heat. The strongest vegetable cathartics become mild by a like treatment, without any remarkable separation of their parts.\n\nSocotrine aloes, as already observed, contain more gummy matter than the hepatic; and hence are likewise found to purge more, and with greater irritation. The first fort therefore is most proper where a stimulus is required, as for promoting or exciting the menstrual flux; whilst the latter is better calculated to act as a common purge. It is supposed that the vulnerary and balsamic virtues of this juice reside chiefly in the resin, and hence the hepatic aloes, which is most resinous, is most serviceable in external application.\n\nAloes enter many of the officinal preparations and compositions, particularly different pills and tinctures; and according to the particular purposes for which these are intended, sometimes the Barbadoes, sometimes the Socotrine aloes are the most proper.\n\n660. Agave, or Common American Aloe.\nSeven species; viz. americana, vivipara, virginica, cubensis, lurida, tuberosa, foetida. America.\n\n661.

Europe, India.\n\n* A. floral leaf very much longer than the spike.\u2014The root powdered might supply the place of our foreign spices. It is our only native truly aromatic plant. The powder of the root has cured agues, when the Peruvian bark has failed. The roots have a strong aromatic smell, and a warm pungent bitterish taste. The flavour is greatly improved by drying. They are commonly imported from the Levant, but those of our own growth are full as good. The Turks candy the roots, and think they are a preservative against contagion. Neither horses, cows, goats, sheep, or swine will eat it.\n\n664. Orontium, or Floating Arum.\nTwo species; viz. aquaticum, japonicum. N. America, Japan.\n\n665.

The flowers are offensive to the smell when near, but at a proper distance their odour is extremely fine. The berries are so very acid that birds will not eat them, but boiled with sugar they form a most agreeable rob or jelly. They are used, likewise, as a dry sweatmeat, and in sugar plumbs. An infusion of the bark in white wine is purgative. The roots boiled in lye dye wool yellow. In Poland they dye leather of a most beautiful yellow with the bark of the root. The inner bark of the stems dyes linen of a fine yellow, with the assistance of alum. This shrub should never be permitted to grow in corn lands, for the ears of wheat that grow near it never fill, and its influence in this respect has been known to extend as far as 3 or 4 hundred yards across a field. This very extraordinary fact well merits investigation.\n\n678. Psathura.\nOne species; viz. borbonica. Isle of Bourbon.\n\n679. Nandina.\nOne species; viz. domestica. Japan.\n\n680.

ORYZA, or Rice.\nOne species; viz. sativa. E. and W. Indies, N. America.\u2014Rice is the produce of many countries, particularly of the East Indies; but as used in Britain, it is brought chiefly from Carolina, where this plant is cultivated in large quantities. It is sufficiently nutritious, and affords an useful food in diarrhoeas, dysenteries, and other disorders from a thin acrimonious state of the juices.\n\n696. NECTRIS.\nOne species; viz. aquatica.

Europe, Egypt, Barbary.\n\n* R. valves strongly veined; leaves spear-shaped, acute, crispus, waved and curled at the edge.\u2014In Norfolk this plant is the pest of clover fields. The fresh roots bruised, and made into an ointment or decoction, cure the itch. The seeds have been given with advantage in the dysentery. Cows, goats, and horses refuse it.\n\n* R. valves veinless; leaves oval-ppear-shaped, uneven acutus, at the edges.\u2014Cows and horses refuse it. It is infected by the aphis rumicis. The root is used by the dyers. It gives a great variety of shades, from straw colour to a pretty fine olive, and a fine deep green to cloths which have been previously blued.\n\n* R. leaves (pear-shaped, smooth, acute, very entire, hydrola tapering at the base. It is a medicine of considerable pathum, efficacy, both externally applied as a wash for putrid spongy gums, and internally in some species of scurvy. In rheumatic pains and chronic diseases, owing to obstructed visera, it is said to be useful. The powdered root is one of the best things for cleaning the teeth. The root has sometimes a reddish tinge, but soon changing to a yellowish brown when exposed to the air. The curculio lopathi is found upon the leaves.\n\n* R. leaves heart-oblong, bluntish, finely notched.\u2014obtusifolia. Fallow-deer eat this and the R. acutus with avidity, biting it close to the root, so that it is very rare to see a dock growing in a park.\n\n* R. leaves oblong, arrow-shaped.\u2014The leaves are acetosa, eaten in sauces and in salads. The Laplanders use them to turn their milk sour. In France they are cultivated for the use of the table, being introduced in soups, rago\u00fbts and fricassees. In some parts of Ireland they eat them plentifully with milk, alternately biting and sipping. The Irish also eat them with fish, and other alkaline food. The dried root gives out a beautiful red colour when boiled. Horses, cows, goats, sheep, and swine eat it. The aphis acetosae feeds upon it.\n\n700. FLAGELLARIA.\nOne species; viz. indica. East Indies, Guiana.\n\n701. SCHEUCHZERIA, or Lesser Flowering Rush.\nOne species; viz. palustris. Lapland, Sweden, Helvetia.\n\n702. TRIGLOCHIN, or Arrow-headed Grass.\nThree species; viz. *pallustre, bulbofum, *maritimum. Europe.\n\n* T. Capsule 3-celled, nearly strap-shaped.\u2014Cows are palyser, extremely fond of this plant. Horses, sheep, goats, and swine eat it.\n\n* T. Capsule 6-celled, egg-shaped.\u2014It is salt to the mariti taste; but horses, goats, sheep, and swine are very much fond of it.\n703. WURMBEA.\nThree species; viz. pumila, campanulata, longiflora.\n\n704.

South of Europe, Archipelago.\n\n* C. leaves flat, spear-shaped, upright.\u2014This is one of those plants which, upon the concurrent testimony of ages, was condemned as poisonous; but Dr Storck of Vienna hath taught us that it is an useful medicine. The roots have a good deal of acrimony. An infusion of them in vinegar, formed into a syrup by the addition of sugar or honey, is found to be a very useful pectoral and diuretic; it seems in its virtues very much to resemble squill, but is less nauseous, and less acrimonious, though more sedative. In a pasture in which were several horses, and eaten down pretty bare, the grass was closely cropped, even under the leaves, but not a leaf bitten.\n\n708.

North of Europe.\n\n* E. leaves scattered, strap-spear-shaped; blossoms irregular.\u2014Goats are extremely fond of this plant. Cows and sheep eat it. Horses and swine refuse it. The phalena porcellus and sphinx elpenor are found upon it. The suckers of the root are eatable. An infusion of the plant has an intoxicating property, and the Kamtschatcadales brew a sort of ale from the pith, and from the ale make vinegar. The down of the seeds also, mixed with cotton or fur, has been manufactured into stockings and other articles of clothing.\n\nhirustum. * E. leaves egg-spear-shaped, hairy, half embracing the stem; stem very much branched and hairy.\u2014The top-shoots have a delicate fragrance, resembling scalded codlings (whence one of its names), but so transitory, that before they have been gathered five minutes, it is no longer perceptible. Horses, sheep, and goats, eat it. Cows are not fond of it. Swine refuse it.\n\n733. Antichorus.\nOne species; viz. depressus. Arabia.\n\n734.

E. Indies, Carolina, Jamaica.\n\nThe A. elemifera produces a resin, which is brought from the Spanish W. Indies, and sometimes from the E. Indies, in large roundish cakes, generally wrapped up in flag leaves. The best sort is foetid, somewhat transparent, of a pale, whitish yellow colour, inclining a little to green; of a strong, not unpleasant smell. It almost totally dissolves in pure spirit, and sends over some part of its fragrance along with this menstruum in distillation: distilled with water it yields a considerable quantity of pale-coloured, thin, fragrant essential oil. This resin gives name to one of the official unguents, and is at present scarce any otherwise made use of; though it is certainly preferable for internal purposes to some others, which are held in greater esteem.\n\nThe fruit of the amyris gileadensis is the product of the tree that yields the opobalsam, or balsam of Gilead. It is about the size of a pea, of a whitish colour, enclosed in a dark-brown wrinkled bark. This fruit, when in perfection, has a pleasant warm glowing taste, and a fragrant smell, resembling that of the opobalsam itself. It is very rarely found in the shops; and such as we now and then do meet with, has almost entirely lost its smell and taste. It had formerly a place in the mithridate and theriaca formulas, now banished from our pharmacopeias; but even then the college permitted cubeb to be employed as a substitute for the opobalsam, which could seldom be procured; and it is probably on this account that it has now no place in our lists.\n\n756.

Vaccinium, or Bilberry, or Whortleberry.\n27 species; viz. * myrtillus, pallidum, hirtum, stamineum, * uliginosum, album, mucronatum, diffluum, angustifolium, corymbosum, bracteatum, ciliatum, fulcatum, frondosum, venustum, ligulatum, refinatum, amoenum, virgatum, tenellum, arctotaphyllum, meridionale, cerceum, * vitis-idea, * oxycoccus, hifidulum, macrocarpum. N. Europe, Levant, N. America, Jamaica.\n\nmyrtillus. * V. fruit-stalks 1-flowered; leaves serrated, egg-shaped; stem angular.\u2014The berries of this plant are very acceptable to children, either eaten by themselves, or with milk, or in tarts. The moor game live upon them in the autumn. The juice of its paper or linen purple. Goats eat it. Sheep are not fond of it. Horses and cows refuse it.\n\nuliginosum. * V. fruit-stalks 1-flowered; leaves very entire, inversely egg-shaped, blunt, smooth.\u2014Children are said sometimes to eat the berries; but in large quantities they occasion dizziness and a flight headache, especially when full grown, and quite ripe. Many vintners in France are said to make use of the juice to colour their white wines red. Horses, cows, sheep, and goats, eat it. Swine refuse it.\n\nvitis-idea. * V. bunches terminating, nodding; leaves inversely egg-shaped; edge very entire, and rolled back, dotted underneath.\u2014The berries are acid, and not very grateful; but they are eaten by the Finanders, and by the country people in Sweden, and are sent in large quantities from W. Bothnia to Stockholm for pickling. They are also made into tarts, rob, and jelly. Goats eat it. Cows, sheep, and horses, refuse it.\n\noxycoccus. V. fruit-stalks single or in pairs; leaves egg-shaped, very entire, edges rolled back; stem thread-shaped, trailing, not hairy.\u2014The berries made into tarts, are much esteemed; but, on account of a peculiar flavour, are disliked by some. They may be kept several years if wiped clean; and then closely corked in dry bottles, or the bottles may be filled with water.\u2014At Longtown in Cumberland, 20 or 30l.'s worth are sold by the poor people each market day, for five or six weeks together. The most general name, cranberry, probably originated from the fruitstalks being crooked at the top, and before the expansion of the blossom, resembling the neck and head of a crane.\n\n769. Menziesia.\nOne species; viz. ferruginea.\n\n770. Erica, or Heath.\n137 species; viz. glutinosa, lutea, paniculata, deprefa, halicacaba, monsoniana, dificolor, dendrolia, cruenta, nigrita, phylicoides, regerminans, urceolaris, marifolia, planiflora, hirta, bicolor, articularris, viridi-purpurea, pubefens, perloluta, gracilis, trigoa, caffra, arborea, stricta, florida, mucola, pitulifera, amoena, * tetralix, inflata, gliva, abietina, verticillata, patteronia, mammola, empertrilla, spicata, octophylla, fascicularis, obliqua, * vulgaris, gnaphaloides, corfolia, calycina, triflora, scoparia, bergiana, formosa, rubens, incarnata, * cinerea, australis, ramentacea, quadriflora, lateralis, margaritacea, baccans, pedula, physodes, cornua, retorta, * daboecia, tenutilla, albens, bracteata, thunbergii, tetragona, umbellata, nudiflora, petiolata, bryantha, stelleriana, fucata, axillaris, imbricata, sexfaria, melathura, leucantha, taxifolia, fpumosa, capitata, bruniales, paflerina, tota, absynthioides, ciliaris, coerulea, hilipudula, petiverii, bankii, febana, monadelphia, plukentii, versicolor, perspicua, aitonii, cephalotes, pulchella, longifolia, veluta, pinea, leea, coccinea, purpurea, concina, grandiflora, cylindrica, curviflora, fimipliciflora, tubiflora, lanata, procera, confpicua, glandulofa, transparenis, cerinthoides, fparrmannii, mafloni, veneticoa, ampullacea, faligiata, incurva, globosa, comosa, denticulata, mufcari, vilcaria, pyramidalis, mediterranea, multiflora, herbacea, purpurascens, * vagans, cubic, racemosa. Europe, Madeira, Cape.\n\n* E. leaves arrow-shaped.\u2014This plant, but little regarded in happier climates, is made subservient to a great variety of purposes, in the bleak and barren highlands of Scotland. The poorer inhabitants make walls for their cottages, with alternate layers of heath, and a kind of mortar made of black earth and straw, the woody roots of the heath being placed in the centre, the tops externally and internally. They make their beds of it, by placing the roots downwards, and the tops only being uppermost, they are sufficiently soft to sleep upon. Cabins are thatched with it. In the island of Ilay, ale is frequently made by brewing one part malt and two parts of the young tops of heath; sometimes they add hops. It is said, that this liquor was much used by the Picts. Woollen cloth boiled in alum water, and afterwards in a strong decoction of the tops of heath, comes out a fine orange colour. The stalks and tops will tan leather. In England beoms are made of it, and faggots to burn in ovens, or to fill up drains that are to be covered over. Sheep and goats will sometimes eat the tender shoots, but they are not fond of them. Bees extract a great deal of honey from the...\nthe flowers; but where heath abounds, the honey has a reedily caft.\n\n771. Ophira.\nOne species; viz. striata.\u2014Africa.\n\n772. Grubbia.\nOne species; viz. rosmarinifolia. C. of G. Hope.\n\n773. Daphne, or Mezereon, Spurge-laurel.\n30 species; viz. *mezereum, thymelae, dioica, calycina, pubescens, vermiculata, villosa, tartan-raira, nitida, alpina, *laureola, pontica, pendula, lagetto, polyflachya, monofochya, tinifolia, gnidium, indica, fortida, rotundifolia, odora, occidentalis, cneorum, altaica, squarrola, glomerata, oleoides, sericea, collina.\u2014Europe, China, Japan, W. Indies.\n\n* D. flowers fitting on the stem, mostly three together; leaves spear-shaped, deciduous; berries globular.\u2014An ointment prepared from the bark or the berries, has been successfully applied to ill-conditioned ulcers. The whole plant is very corrosive; five of the berries will kill a wolf. A woman gave 12 grains of the berries to her daughter, who had a quartan ague; she vomited blood, and died immediately.\u2014A decoction made of two drams of the cortical part of the root, boiled in three pints of water till one pint is wafted, and this quantity drank daily, is found very efficacious in resolving venereal nodes, and other indurations of the periosteum. It is said to have been once given, in a case of difficulty in swallowing, seemingly occasioned by a paralytic affection. The patient was directed to chew a thin slice of the root, as often as she could bear to do it; and in about two months, she recovered her power of swallowing. This woman bore the disagreeable irritation, and the ulcerations its acrimony occasioned in her mouth, with great resolution; but she had been reduced to skin and bone, and for three years before, had suffered extremely from hunger, without being able to satisfy her appetite, for the swallowed liquids very imperfectly, and solids not at all. This complaint came on after lying-in.\n\n* D. bunches of about five flowers; axillary leaves spear-shaped, smooth.\u2014Very happy effects have been experienced from this plant in rheumatic fevers. It operates as a brisk and rather feverish purgative. It is an efficacious medicine in worm cases; and upon many accounts deserves to be better known to physicians; but in less skilful hands, it would be dangerous, as it is possessed of considerable acrimony. The whole plant has the same qualities, but the bark of the root is the strongest. Dr Allton fixes the outside dose at ten grains.\n\n774. Dirca, or Leather-wood.\nOne species; viz. palustris.

Eur. E. Indies; China, N. Amer.\n\n* P. flowers with cloven pitsils; stipulae somewhat fringed; leaves spear-shaped.\u2014The whole plant has an acrid burning taste. It cures little aphthous ulcers in the mouth; it dyes wool yellow. The ashes of this plant, mixed with salt soap, is a nostrum in a few hands for dissolving the stone in the bladder; but it may be reasonably questioned, whether it has any advantage over other semi-caulic preparations of the vegetable alkali. Its acrimony rises in distillation, and the distilled water drank to the amount of two or three half pints daily, has been found very effectual in some nephritic cases. Horses, cows, goats, sheep, and swine, refuse it.\n\n* P. styles 2; spikes egg-oblong; leaves spear-shaped; pericariae stipulae fringed.\u2014Its taste is slightly acid and astringent. Woollen cloth, dipped in a solution of alum, obtains a yellow colour from this plant. Goats, sheep, and horses, eat it; cows and swine refuse it.\n\n* P. leaves egg-shaped, extended at the base along the biflora leafstalks.\u2014The root is one of the strongest vegetable astringents. The young shoots are eaten in herb-pudding in the north of England; and about Manchester they are substituted for greens, under the name of patience dock.\n\n* P.\nOctandria.\n\nviviparum. * P. leaves spear-shaped; spike terminating.\u2014Plants cultivated for four years in a garden, constantly produced perfect seeds in July, and flowered as constantly a second time in September. These latter germs vegetated on the stem.\n\noviculare. * P. flowers axillary; leaves spear-shaped, stem trailing.\u2014The seeds are useful for every purpose in which those of the next species are employed. Great numbers of small birds feed upon them. Cows, goats, sheep, horses, and swine eat it. The stubbles in Sweden are purled over with this plant. It affords nourishment to the chrysonela polygoni.\n\nfagopyrum * P. leaves heart-arrow shaped; stem nearly upright, without prickles; angles of the seeds equal.\u2014This plant is very impatient of cold, dying at the very first attack of frost. The seeds furnish a nutritious meal, which is not apt to turn acid upon the stomach. It is made into thin cakes in some parts of England called Crampits. It is usual with farmers to sow a crop of buckwheat, and to plough it under when fully grown as a manure to the land. The seeds are excellent food for poultry. Sheep that eat this plant become unhealthful.

Myrtus, or Myrtle.\n14 species; viz. communis, brasiliiana, biflora, angustifolia, levis, lucida, cumini, dioica, chyraculia, zuzygnum, zeylanica, androsceoides, caryophyllata, pimenta. S. Europe, Asia, Africa, America.\u2014The myrtus communis is an evergreen shrub, growing in Italy, and cultivated in our botanic gardens. The leaves and berries have been sometimes made use of as astringents, but not at present regarded. The pimenta is the fruit of a large tree growing spontaneously in the mountainous parts of Jamaica, called by Sir Hans Sloan, myrtus arborea aromatica, folis laurinis. The smell of this spice resembles a mixture of cinnamon, cloves, and nutmegs; its taste approaches to that of cloves, or a mixture of the three foregoing; whence it has received the name of allspice. The shops have been for some time accustomed to employ this aromatic as a substitute to the more costly spices, and from them it has been introduced into our hospitals.\n\nPimento is now in our pharmacopoeias the basis of a distilled water, a spirit, and an essential oil; and these are\nare not unfrequently employed, where aromatics are indicated.\n\n930. Punica, or Pomegranate tree.\n\nTwo species; viz. granatum, nana. Spain, Italy, Barb. W. Indies.\u2014The pomegranate is a low tree, or rather shrub, growing wild in Italy, and other countries in the south of Europe; it is sometimes met with in our gardens; but the fruit, for which it is chiefly valued, rarely comes to such perfection as in warmer climates. This fruit has the general qualities of the other sweet summer fruits, allaying heat, quenching thirst, and gently loofening the belly. The rind is a strong astringent, and as such, is occasionally made use of. The flowers are of an elegant red colour, in appearance resembling a dried red rose. Their taste is bitterish and astringent. They are recommended in diarrhoeas, dysenteries, and other cases where astringent medicines are proper.\n\n931. Amygdalus, or Almond tree.\n\nFour species; viz. persica, communis, pumila, nana. Peria, Jordan, Barbary.\u2014The flowers of the amygdalus persica have an agreeable smell, and a bitterish taste. Distilled without any addition, by the heat of a water bath, they yield one fifth their weight, or more, of a whitish liquor; which, as Mr Bolduc observes, communicates to a large quantity of other liquids, a flavour like that of the kernels of fruits. An infusion in water, of half an ounce of the fresh gathered flowers, or a dram of them when dried, sweetened with sugar, proves for children a useful laxative and anthelmintic; the leaves of the tree are, with this intention, somewhat more efficacious, though less agreeable. The fruit has the same quality with the other sweet fruits, that of abating heat, quenching thirst, and gently loofening the belly.\n\nThe almond of the amygdalus communis, is a flatish kernel, of a white colour, covered with a thin brownish skin, of a soft sweet taste, or a disagreeable bitter one. The skins of both sorts are unpleasant, and covered with an acid powdery substance; they are very apt to become rancid on keeping, and to be preyed on by a kind of insect which eats out the internal part, leaving the almond to appearance entire. To these circumstances regard ought to be had, in the choice of them.\n\nThe fruit which affords these kernels, is the produce of a tree nearly resembling the peach. The eye distinguishes no difference betwixt the trees which produce the sweet and bitter, or betwixt the kernels themselves; it is said, that the same tree, has by a difference in culture, afforded both.\n\nBoth sorts of almonds yield, on expression, a large quantity of oil, which has no smell, or any particular taste; this oil separates, likewise, upon boiling the almonds in water, and is gradually collected on the surface; but on triturating the almonds with water, the oil and water unite together, by the mediation of the other matter of the kernel, and form an unctuous milky liquor.\n\nSweet almonds are of greater use in food than as medicines, but they are reckoned to afford little nourishment; and when eaten in subsistence, are not easy of digestion, unless thoroughly comminuted. They are supposed, on account of their soft unctuous quality, to obviate acrimonious juices in the prime vis. Peeled sweet almonds, eaten six or eight at a time, sometimes give present relief in the heartburn.\u2014Bitter almonds have been found poisonous to dogs, and sundry other animals; and a water distilled from them, when made of a certain degree of strength, has had the same effects. Nevertheless, when eaten, they appear innocent to men, and have been not unfrequently used as medicines. Boerhaave recommends them in subsistence, as diuretics which heat but moderately, and which may therefore be ventured upon in acute diseases.\n\nThe oils obtained by expression from both sorts of almonds, are in their sensible qualities the same. The general virtues of these oils are, to blunt acrimonious humours, and to soften and relax the solids; hence their use, internally, in tickling coughs, heat of urine, pains and inflammations; and externally in tension and rigidity of particular parts.\u2014The milky solutions of almonds in watery liquors, commonly called emulsions, contain the oil of the subject, and participate in some degree of its emollient virtue; but have this advantage above the pure oil, that they may be given in acute or inflammatory disorders, without danger of the ill effects which the oil might sometimes produce; since emulsions do not turn rancid or acrimonious by heat, as all the oils of this kind in a little time do. Several unctuous and resinous substances, of themselves not miscible with water, may, by trituration with almonds, be easily mixed with it into the form of an emulsion; and are thus excellently fitted for medicinal use. In this form camphor and the resinous purgatives may be commodiously taken. The only official preparations of almonds, are the expressed oil and emulsion. The common emulsion, or the lac amygdala, as it is now called by the London college, is prepared from the sweet almond alone; but in the emulsion of the Edinburgh college, a small proportion of bitter almonds is added, which has a much better effect in improving its taste, than the sugar added by the London college.\u2014An emulsion formed entirely of bitter almonds, taken to the quantity of a pint or two daily, is said to have been given in obstinate intermittents with success.\n\n932. Prunus, or Plum tree.\n\n22 species; * padus, virginiana, canadensis, lusitanica, lauro-cerasus, elliptica, paniculata, mahaleb, armeniaca, fibricra, pumila, * cerasus, * avium, pennylvanica, * domestica, * infititia, * spinosa, alpina, japonica, glauca, incisa, tomentosa. Europe, N. America, W. Indies.\n\n* P. flowers in bunches; leaves deciduous, with two padus glands at the base on the under side.\u2014This plant grows well in woods, groves, or fields, but not in a moist soil. It bears lopping, and suffers the grafts to grow under it. The fruit is nauseous, but bruised and infused in wine or brandy, it gives it an agreeable flavour. A strong decoction of the bark is used by the Finlanders to cure venereal complaints, which practice is corroborated by the testimony of M. Broerland. He directs six ounces of the dry, or eight of the fresh bark, to be boiled in eight to four pints of water. The dose is four ounces, four times a day. It alone cures the lighter infections, and combined with mercury facilitates the cure of the feverer states of the disease; and a decoction of the berries is sometimes given with succus in the dysentery. The wood being smooth and tough, is made into han...\ndles for knives and whips. Sheep, goats, and swine eat it. Cows are not fond of it. Horses refuse it.\n\n* P. umbels mostly on short fruitstalks; leaves egg-spear-shaped, smooth, doubled together.\u2014This plant loves a sandy soil and an elevated situation. The gum that exudes from this tree is equal to gum arabic. It is said, that more than 100 men during a siege were kept alive for near two months, without any other sustenance than a little of this gum taken into the mouth sometimes and suffered gradually to dissolve. The common people eat the fruit either fresh or dried; and it is frequently infused in brandy for the sake of its flavour. The wood is hard and tough. It is used by the turner, and is formed into chairs, and stained to imitate mahogany. This tree is the original stock from which many of the cultivated kinds are derived.\n\n* P. umbels fitting; leaves egg-spear-shaped, downy underneath, doubled together.\u2014This plant grows best in a rich soil on the sides of hills, unmixed with other trees. It bears cropping, and suffers the grafts to grow under it. In Hertfordshire there is a cultivated variety, called carrons, which are larger and much finer flavoured than the common sort.\n\n* P. fruitstalks mostly solitary; leaves spear-egg-shaped, coiled; branches thornless.\u2014This plant loves a lofty exposure, and is favourable to pasturage. The varieties have probably originated from the red and white cultivated plums, either sown by design or accident. The cultivated garden plums are derived from this species. The bark dyes yellow. Its medical effects are to abate heat and gently loosen the belly; which they perform by lubricating the passage, and softening the excrement. They are of considerable service in coliciveness, accompanied with heat and irritation, which the more stimulating cathartics would tend to aggravate. Where prunes are not of themselves sufficient, their effects may be promoted by joining with them a little rhubarb or the like; to which may be added some carminative ingredient, to prevent their occasioning flatulencies.\n\n* P. fruitstalks in pairs; leaves egg-shaped, slightly woolly, coiled; branches with thorns.\u2014The fruit is acid, but so tempered by a sweetness and roughness, as not to be unpleasant, particularly after it is mellowed by the frosts. A conserve is prepared by mixing the pulp with thrice its weight of sugar. The bark of the root and branches is considerably tereptic. An infusion of the flowers, sweetened with sugar, is a mild purgative, not improper for children.\n\n* P. fruitstalks solitary; leaves spear-shaped, smooth; branches thorny.\u2014This plant is not well adapted to grow in hedges, because it spreads its roots wide, and encroaches upon the pasturage; but it makes a good dead fence. The wood is hard and tough, and is formed into teeth for rakes, and walking-sticks. From some effects which have been repeatedly observed to follow the prick of the thorns, there is reason to believe there is something poisonous in them, particularly in autumn. The tender leaves dried are sometimes used as a substitute for tea, and are thought the best substitute that has yet been tried. The fruit bruised and put into wine, gives it a beautiful red colour, and a pleasant subacid roughness. An infusion of a handful of the flowers is a safe and easy purge. The bark powdered, in doses of 2 drams, will cure some agues. Letters written upon linen or woollen with the juice of the fruit will not wash out. Sheep, goats, and horses eat the leaves. The different species of Prunus furnish nourishment to various insects.\n\n983. PLINIA.\n\nTwo species; viz. crocea, pendunculata. Surinam, Brazil.\n\n984.

CRATAEGUS, or Wild Service Tree.\n\n15 species; viz. * avia, * torminalis, coccinea, vi-ridis, punctata, crus galli, tomentola, indica, * oxyacantha, monogyna, azarolus, maura, villofa, levis, glabra, Europe, India, N. America.\n\n* C. leaves egg-shaped, cut, ferrated, cottony underneath.\u2014It loves dry hills and open exposures, and flourishes either in gravel or clay. It bears lopping, and permits the grafts to grow. The wood, being hard, tough, and smooth, is used for axle-trees, wheels, walking-sticks, carpenters and others tools. The fruit is eatable when mellowed by the autumnal frosts, and an ardent spirit may be distilled from it. It seldom bears a good crop of fruit two years together. Sheep and\nand goats eat it. The wood affords an excellent charcoal for the makers of gunpowder.\n\n* C. leaves mostly 3-cleft; segments blunt, serrated.\n\n\u2014Upon account of the stiffness of its branches, the sharpness of its thorns, its roots not spreading wide, and its capability of bearing the severest winters without injury, this plant is universally preferred for making hedges, whether to clip or to grow at large. The wood is tough, and is formed into axle-trees and handles for tools. The berries are the winter food of thrushes and many other birds. Its different species afford nourishment to various insects.\n\n988. Waldstenia.\n\nOne species; viz. geoides. Hungary.\n\nORDER III. TRIGYNYIA.\n\n989. Sorbus, or Service-tree.\n\nThree species; viz. *ancuparia, *hybrida, *domestica. Europe.\n\nancuparia. * S. leaves winged, smooth on both sides.\u2014It grows either in woods or open fields, but best on the sides of hills and in fertile soil. It will not bear lopping. Plants grow well in its shade. The wood is soft, tough, and solid. It is converted into tables, spokes for wheels, shafts, chairs, &c. The roots are formed into handles for knives and wooden spoons. The berries, dried and reduced to powder, make wholesome bread; and an ardent spirit may be distilled from them, which has a fine flavour, but it is small in quantity. The berries too, infused in water, make an acid liquor somewhat like perry, which is drank by the poorer people in Wales. In Germany, the fowlers use the berries to entice the redwings and fieldfares into nooses of hair, suspended in the woods; hence its trivial name.\n\ndomestica. * S. leaves winged, woolly underneath.\u2014The fruit is mealy and astringent, not much unlike the medlar. The wood is valuable for making mathematical rulers and excise-men's gauging sticks.\n\n990. Sesuvium.\n\nOne species; viz. portulacastrum. W. Indies.\n\nORDER IV. PENTAGYNYIA.\n\n991. Mespilus, or Medlar-tree.\n\nEight species; viz. pyracantha, *germanica, arbustifolia, amelanchia, cham\u00e6-melsius, canadensis, japonica, gotoncaster. Europe, N. America.\n\ngermanica. * M. thornless; leaves spear-shaped, cottony underneath; flowers solitary, fitting.\u2014Many people are fond of the fruit when it becomes soft by keeping; it is somewhat astringent, and binds the bowels.\n\n992. Pyrus, or Pear-tree.\n\nNine species; viz. *communis, pollveria, *malus, baccata, coronaria, cydonia, nivalis, falcifolia, japonica.\n\ncommunis. * P. leaves serrated, smooth; flowers forming a corymb.\u2014This plant loves a fertile soil and sloping ground; but will not thrive well in moist bottoms. It stands the severest winters, and does not destroy the grafts. The wood is light, smooth, and compact; it is used by turners, and to make joiners' tools; and for picture frames to be stained black. The leaves afford a yellow dye, and may be used to give a green to blue cloths. The fruit is astringent; but when cultivated, highly grateful, as is proved by the great variety of excellent pears which the industry of mankind has raised, for they all originate from this. The juice of the fruit, fermented, is called perry, large quantities of which are raised in Worcestershire and Herefordshire for that purpose. The squash, the Oldfield, and the Barland perrys are reckoned the best, and are little inferior to wine. Horses, cows, sheep, and goats, eat the leaves, which afford nourishment to various insects.\n\n* P. leaves serrated; flowers in umbels, fitting.\u2014This malus plant flourishes better on declivities and in shady places, than in open exposures or boggy lands. Grapes, and even corn, will grow beneath it. It is much used as a stock, on which to ingraft the better kind of apples, because its fruits are neither killed by frost nor eaten by field-mice. The bark affords a yellow dye. The wood is tolerably hard; it turns very clean, and when made into cogs for wheels, obtains a polish and wears a long time. The acid juice of the fruit is called by the country people verjuice, and is much used in sprains and in other cases, as an astringent or repellent. With a proper addition of sugar, it is probable, that a very grateful liquor might be made with the juice, but little inferior to old hock. Horses, cows, sheep, and goats, eat it. Swine are very fond of the fruit.\n\nThe fruit of the pyrus cydonia have a very astringent acid taste; taken in small quantity, they are supposed to restrain vomiting and alvine fluxes, and, more liberally, to loosen the belly. The seeds abound with a mucilaginous substance of no particular taste, which they readily impart to watery liquors; an ounce will render three pints of water thick and ropy, like the white of an egg. A mucilage of the seeds is kept in the shops. A syrup of the fruit had formerly a place, but is now rejected.\n\n993. Tetragonia.\n\nSeven species; viz. fruticola, herbacea, iv\u00e6folia, hirfuta, spicata, expanfa, japonica. Cape, Peru, New Zealand.\n\n994. Mesembryanthemum, or Fig-marigold.\n\n50 species; viz. nodiflorum, crysfallinum, coppticum, geniculiflorum, noctiflorum, splendens, umbellatum, expansum, tripolium, calamiforme, apetala, crinitiflorum, cordiflorum, bellidiflorum, deltoides, barbatum, hispidum, villosum, sebrum, emarginatum, uncinateum, spinosum, tuberosum, tenuifolium, stipulaceum, crassifolium, glomeratum, loreum, filamentosum, falcatum, forficatum, edule, bicolorum, ferratum, micans, glaucum, corniculatum, tortuosum, pomeridium, veruculatum, papulofum, pinnatifidum, rostratum, ringens, dolabriforme, disforme, albicum, linguiforme, pugioniforme, capillare. Greece, Cape, New Zealand.\n\n995. Aizoon.\n\nTen species; viz. canariense, hispanicum, lanceolatum, farmentofum, paniculatum, perfoliatum, glinoides, secundum, fruticosum, rigidum. Spain, Cape, Canary.\n\n996. Spirea, or Spiked Willow, Dropwort.\n\n18 species; viz. lavigata, *falicifolia, tomentofa, callofa,\ncallosa, hypericifolia, cham\u00e6drifolia, incisa, crenata, argentea, triloba, opulifolia, sorbilifolia, aruncus, * filipendula, * ulmaria, lobata, palmata, trifoliata. Europe, N. America.\n\nfilipendula.* S. leaves interruptedly winged; leaflets spear-shaped, irregularly serrated, very smooth; flowers in tufts.\u2014The tuberous pea-like roots of this plant, dried and reduced to powder, make a kind of bread, which in times of scarcity is not to be despised. Hogs are very fond of them. When expanded and enlarged by cultivation, it is a beautiful addition to the flower-garden.\n\nulmaria.* S. leaves interruptedly winged; leaflets egg-shaped, double serrated, hoary underneath; flowers in tufts.\u2014The flowers, infused in boiling water, give it a fine flavour, which rises in distillation. Sheep and swine eat it. Goats are extremely fond of it. Cows and horses refuse it.\n\nORDER V. POLYGYNIA.\n\n997. Rosa, or Rose.\n\n21 species; viz. eglanteria, * rubiginosa, cinnamonacea, * arvensis, pimpinellifolia, * spinosissima, rugosa, carolina, * villosa, finica, sempervivens, centifolia, gallica, pumila, alpina, canina, collina, indica, pendulina, alba, multiflora. Europe, Persia, China, N. America.\n\nspinosissima* R. germs and fruitstalks smooth; stem and leafstalks fully set with straight prickles; leaflets circular, smooth.\u2014The ripe fruit is eaten by children; it has a grateful subacid taste. The juice of it, diluted with water, dyes silk and muslin of a peach colour, and, with the addition of alum, a deep violet; but it has very little effect on woollen or linen. Its dwarfish growth, and the singular elegance of its little leaves, which resemble those of the upland burnet, entitle it to a place in the flower-garden.\n\ncanina.* R. germs and fruitstalks smooth; stem and leafstalks prickly.\u2014A perfumed water may be distilled from the blossoms. The pulp of the berries, beat up with sugar, makes the conserve of hips of the London dispensatory. Mixed with wine, it is an acceptable treat in the north of Europe. Several birds feed upon the berries. The leaves of every species of rose, but especially of this, are recommended as a substitute for tea, giving out a fine colour, a sub-astringent taste, and a grateful smell, when dried, and infused in boiling water. It is a difficult matter to say, which are species, and which are varieties only, in this genus; some think that there are no certain limits prescribed by nature. Various insects are nourished by the different species; and those mostly prickly excrements which are frequently found upon the branches of roses, especially upon the last species, are the habitations of the cynips rosea. This excrement was formerly in repute as a medicine, and was kept in the shops under the name of bedeguar. An infusion of the full blown blossoms of all the roses, especially the paler kinds, is purgative; but the petals of the red roses, gathered before they expand, and dried, are astringent.\n\nThe rosa centifolia is an elegant flower, common in our gardens. Its smell is very pleasant, and almost universally admired; its taste bitterish and subacid. In distillation with water, it yields a small portion of a butyrateous oil, whose flavour exactly resembles that of the roses. This oil, and the distilled water, are very useful and agreeable cordials. Hoffman strongly recommends them as of a singular efficacy for raising the strength, cheering and recruiting the spirits and allaying pain; which they perform without raising any heat in the constitution, rather abating it when inordinate. Damask roses, besides their cordial aromatic virtue, which resides in their volatile parts, have a mildly purgative one, which remains entire in the decoction left after the distillation; this with a proper quantity of sugar forms an agreeable laxative syrup, which has long kept its place in the shops.\n\nThe rosa gallica has very little of the fragrance of the foregoing pale sort, and instead of its purgative quality, a mild gratefully astringent one, especially before the flower has opened: this is considerably improved by hasty evaporation; but both the astringency and colour are improved by slow drying. In the shops there are prepared a conserve, an infusion, a honey, and a syrup of this flower.\n\n998. Rubus, or Raspberry.\n\n20 species; viz. * idaeus, occidentalis, hispidus, parvifolius, jamaicensis, triphyllus, * casius, * fruticosus, canadensis, odoratus, molluscans, palmatus, villosus, incisus, japonicus, trifidus, * saxatilis, * arcticus, * chamemorus, dalibarda. North Europe, Asia, America.\n\nR. leaves winged with five or three leaflets; stem idaeus, prickly; leaf-stalk channelled.\u2014The fruit of this plant is extremely grateful as nature presents it, but made into a fruitmeat with sugar, or fermented with wine, the flavour is improved. It is fragrant, subacid, and cooling. It dissolves the tartarous concretions of the teeth; but for this purpose it is inferior to the strawberry. The white berries are sweeter than the red, but they are generally contaminated by insects. The fresh leaves are the favourite food of kids.\n\nR. leaves winged with three or five leaflets; stem and fruticosus, leafstalks prickly; panicle oblong.\u2014The berries when ripe are black, and do not eat amiss with wine. The green twigs are of great use in dyeing woollen, silk, and mohair, black. Cows and horses eat it. Sheep are not fond of it. Silk worms will sometimes feed upon the leaves in defect of those of the mulberry.\n\nR. leaves simple, lobed; stem without prickles, with chamemorus, one flower; male and female flowers on different plants.\u2014The berries are not unpleasing, and held to be an excellent antiscorbutic. The Norwegians pack them up in wooden vessels and send them to Stockholm, where they are served up in deserts or made into tarts. The Laplanders bury them under the snow, and thus preserve them fresh from one year to another. They bruise and eat them with the milk of the reindeer. In the Highlands of Scotland also they are sometimes brought to table with the desert.\n\n999. Fragaria, or Strawberry.\n\nThree species; viz. * vesca, monophylla, * sterilis. North Europe, America.\n\nF. leaves three together; runners creeping.\u2014The vesca berries eaten either alone or with sugar, or with milk, are universally esteemed a most delicious fruit. They are grateful, cooling, subacid, juicy, and have a delightful smell. Taken in large quantities, they seldom disagree.\ndiffer from the stomach. They promote perspiration, impart a violet scent to the urine, and dissolve the tartarous incrustations upon the teeth. People afflicted with the gout or stone, have found great relief from using them largely. The bark of the root is astringent. Sheep and goats eat it. Cows are not fond of it. Horses and swine refuse it.\n\n1002. Potentilla, or Cinquefoil.\n\n3 species; viz., * fruticosa, * anserina, feracea, multifida, fragarioides, * rupestris, biflora, pimpinelloides, pentylvanica, supina, recta, argentea, intermedia, hirta, stipularis, opaca, * verna, * aurea, alfracanica, canadensis, * alba, caulecens, elatia, nitida, valeria, * reptans, monspelienis, norvegica, nivea, grandiflora, subcaulis. Europe, North America.\n\n* P. leaves winged, stem shrub-like.\u2014The beautiful appearance of its numerous flowers has gained it admittance into gardens. Bees are made of it. Cows, horses, goats, and sheep eat it. Swine refuse it.\n\n* P leaves winged, ferrated; stem creeping; fruit-stalks with one-flower.\u2014The leaves are mildly astringent. Dried and powdered they have been given with success in agues. The usual dose is a meal spoonful of the powder every three hours between the fits. The roots in the winter time eat like parsnips. Swine are fond of them. Cows, horses, goats, and swine eat it. Sheep refuse it.\n\n* P. leaflets five together, stem creeping; fruit-stalks one-flowered.\u2014The red cortical part of the root is mildly astringent and antiseptic. A decoction of it is a good gargle for loose teeth and spongy gums. Horses, cows, goats, and sheep, eat it.\n\n1001. Tormentilla, or Tormentil.\n\nTwo species; viz., erecta, * reptans. Europe.\u2014The tormentil is found wild in woods and on commons; it has long slender stalks, with usually seven long narrow leaves at a joint; the root is for the most part crooked and knotty, of a blackish colour in the outside, and reddish within. This root has an agreeable aromatic taste, accompanied with a slight kind of aromatic flavour; it is one of the most agreeable and efficacious of the vegetable astringents, and is employed with good effect in all cases where medicines of this class are proper. It is more used both in extemporary prescriptions, and officinal composition, than any of the other strong vegetable astringents. It is an ingredient in the two compound powders of chalk. A tincture made from it with rectified spirit, possesses the whole astringency and flavour of the root, and loses nothing of either in insipidising.\n\n1002. Geum, or Avens, Herb-bennet.\n\nEight species; viz., virginianum, * urbanum, canadensis, japonica, * rivale, hybridum, montanum, repens. Europe, North America.\n\n* G. flowers upright; fruit globular, woolly; awns hooked, bare; root-leaves lyre-shaped; stem-leaves in threes.\u2014The roots gathered in the spring before the stem grows up, and put into ale, give it a pleasant flavour, and prevent its growing sour. Infused in wine it is a good stomachic. Its taste is mildly agreeable and aromatic, especially when it grows in a warm dry situation; but in shady and moist places it has little virtue. Cows, goats, sheep, and swine eat it.\n\n* G. flowers nodding, fruit oblong; awns feathered, twisted; petals blunt, roundish, wedge-shaped; leaves winged. The powdered root will cure tertian agues, and is daily used for that purpose by the Canadians. Sheep and goats eat it. Cows, horses, and swine are not fond of it. It is made use of to cure racy malt liquor.\n\n1003. Dryas.\n\nThree species; viz., anemonoides, geoides, * octopetalos. Alps of Europe, Kamtschatka.\n\n1004. Comarum, or Marsh-cinquefoil.\n\nOne species; viz., * palustre. Europe.\n\n* C. leaves winged, petals smaller than the calyx.\u2014The root dyes a dirty red. The Irish rub their milking pails with it, and it makes the milk appear thicker and richer. Goats eat it. Cows and sheep are not fond of it. Horses and swine refuse it.\n\n1005. Calycanthus, or Carolina All-spice.\n\nTwo species; viz., floridus, precox. Carolina, Florida, Japan.\n\nIn the class Icosandria are\n\n39 Genera, including 346 Species, of which 42 are found in Britain.","sp":206,"ep":213},{"h":"CLASS XIII","t":"POLYANDRIA.\n\nORDER I.

S. Europe, East and West Indies, South America.\u2014The bush of the capparis fsp. nofa is a low prickly bush, found wild in Italy and other countries; it is raised with us by sowing the seeds upon old walls, where they take root between the bricks, and endure for many years. The bark of the root is pretty thick, of an ash colour, with several transverse wrinkles on the surface; cut in slices and laid to dry, it rolls up into quills. This bark has a bitterish acid taste; it is reckoned aperient and diuretic, and recommended in several chronic disorders for opening obstructions of the viscera. The buds pickled with vinegar, &c. are used at table. They are supposed to excite\nexcite appetite and promote digestion; and to be particularly useful, as detergents and aperients, in obstructions of the liver and spleen. Their taste and virtues depend more upon the saline matter introduced into them, than on the caper buds.\n\n1011. ACTEA, or Herb-christopher.\nThree species; viz. * spicata, racemosa, japonica. Europe. North America, Japan.\n\n* A bunch egg-shaped; fruit berry-like.\u2014The plant is a powerful repellent. The root is useful in some nervous cases, but it must be administered with caution. The berries are poisonous in a very high degree. It is said that toads, allured by the fetid smell of this plant, resort to it; but it grows in shady places, and toads are fond of damp and shady situations. Sheep and goats eat it. Cows, horses, and swine refuse it.\n\n1012. SANGUINARIA, or Puccoon, Blood-root.\nOne species; viz. canadensis. North America.\n\n1013.

CHELIDONIUM, or Celandine.\nFive species; viz. * majus, japonicum, * glaucium, * corniculatum, * hybridum. Europe, Egypt, Japan.\n\n* C. fruit-stalks forming umbels.\u2014This plant grows upon old walls, among rubbish, and in waste shady places. The bark is of a bluish green colour; the root of a deep red; both contain a gold-coloured juice. Their smell is disagreeable, the taste somewhat bitterish, very acrid, biting and burning the mouth; the root is the most acrid. The juice of celandine has long been celebrated in disorders of the eyes; but it is too sharp, unless plentifully diluted, to be applied with safety to that tender organ. It has been sometimes used, and it is said with good success, for exterminating warts, cleansing old ulcers, and in cataplasms for the herpes miliares. This acrimonious plant is rarely given internally. The virtues attributed to it are those of a stimulating aperient, diuretic, and sudorific; it is particularly recommended in the slow kind of jaundice, where there are no symptoms of inflammation, and in dropsies. Some suppose the root to have been Helmont's specific in the hydrops afection. Half a dram or a dram of the dry root is directed for a dose; or an infusion in wine of an ounce of the fresh root.\n\n1015. PAPAVER, or Poppy.\nNine species; viz. * hybridum, * argemone, alpinum, nudicaule, rhoeas, dubium, * somniferum, * cambricum, orientale. Europe.\n\n* P. capsules smooth, urn-shaped; stem hairy, many-flowered; leaves wing-cleft, jagged.\u2014The petals give out a fine colour when infused, and a syrup prepared from the infusion is kept in the shops. It partakes in a small degree of the properties of opium.\n\n* P. calyx and capsules smooth; leaves embracing the stem, jagged.\u2014Opium is the juice of this plant. This juice has of late been collected by way of experiment, by certain individuals, from poppies cultivated in Great Britain, and has been found not inferior in quality to that brought from the warmer climates. It is obtained by making wounds with a small sharp instrument in the smooth capsule of the plant when nearly ripe, and thereafter collecting the juice that exudes from the wounds. It is probable, however, that the high price of labour will scarcely permit the rearing of British opium to become an important object of agriculture. Egypt, Persia, and Hindostan, have hitherto supplied us with this commodity: in those countries large quantities of poppies are cultivated for this purpose. The opium prepared about Thebes in Egypt, hence named Thebaic opium, has been usually esteemed the best; but this is not now distinguished from that collected in other places. This juice is brought to us in cakes or loaves covered with leaves and other vegetable matters, to prevent their sticking together: it is of a solid consistence, yet somewhat soft and tenacious; of a dark reddish-brown colour in the mass, and when reduced into powder yellow; of a faint disagreeable smell, and a bitterish taste, accompanied with a pungent heat and acrimony.\n\nIn the province of Bahar in the East Indies, it is said, the poppy seeds are sown in October or November, at about eight inches distance; and are well watered till the plants are about half a foot high, when a compost of nitrous earth, dung, and ashes, is spread over the areas; and a little before the flowers appear they are again watered profusely till the capsules are half grown: and then the opium is collected; for when fully ripe they yield little juice. Two longitudinal incisions, from below upwards, without penetrating the cavity, are made at unfrequent three or four successive evenings; and then they are allowed to ripen their seeds. In the morning the juice is scraped off with an iron scoop, and worked in an earthen pot, in the sun's heat, till it be of a consistence to be formed into thick cakes of about four pounds weight, which are covered over with the leaves of poppy or tobacco, and dried. It is said to be adulterated with various unknown substances, with the extract of the poppy plant procured by boiling, and even with cow-dung. It is purified by reducing it to a pulp with hot-water, and strongly pressing it while hot through a linen cloth from its impurities. It is then evaporated by a water-bath, or other gentle heat, to its original consistence. This extract is found to contain a resin, a kind of essential oil, a principle of odour, an essential salt, and a foamy extract.\n\nOpium has a reddish brown colour, a strong peculiar smell, a taste at first nauseous and bitter, but soon becoming acrid, with a slight warmth: and it appears to have some astringency, as a watery tincture of it forms an ink with a chalybeate solution.\n\nThe external and internal effects of opium appear to be various in different constitutions, and in the same at different times. By some, when applied to the tongue, the nose, the eye, or any part deprived of skin, it has been said to stimulate, and to induce, in the eye in particular, a slight degree of redness. But if this effect do take place, it is at the utmost extremely inconsiderable, particularly when compared with the effect of volatile alkali, ardent spirit, or a variety of other articles applied to the same organ. And there can be no doubt, that in a very short time the sensibility of the part to which it is applied, even when there has not taken place the slightest mark of preceding stimulus or inflammation, is very considerably diminished. Some allege, that when applied to the skin, it allays pain and\nand spasms, procures sleep, and produces all the other salutary or dangerous effects which result from its internal use; while others allege, that thus applied, it has little or no effect whatever. This variety probably arises from differences in the condition of the subcutaneous nerves, and of the sensibility of the surface, as being more or less defended. But there is no doubt that when mixed with caustic, it diminishes the pain, which would otherwise ensue, probably by deadening the sensibility of the part. It sometimes allays the pain from a carious tooth; and a watery solution of it has been used in various ulcers, certain ophthalmias, and virulent gonorrhoea, when pain and inflammation have before that given very great distress.\n\nOpium, when taken into the stomach to such an extent as to have any sensible effect, gives rise to a pleasant serenity of mind, in general proceeding to a certain degree of languor and drowsiness. The action of the sanguiferous system is diminished, the pulse becoming for the most part softer, fuller, and slower than it was before. There often take place swelling of the subcutaneous veins, and sweating; both probably the consequences of a diminution of resistance at the surface, from a diminution of muscular action, as is particularly exemplified in its effect of binding the belly. Opium taken into the stomach in a larger dose, gives rise to confusion of head and vertigo. The power of all stimulating causes, as making impressions on the body, is diminished; and even at times, and in situations, when a person would naturally be awake, sleep is irrefutably induced. In still larger doses, it acts in the same manner as the narcotic poison, giving rise, not only to vertigo, headache, tremors, and delirium, but to convulsions also; and these terminating in a state of stupor, from which the person cannot be roused. This stupor is accompanied with slowness of the pulse, and with stertor in breathing; and the scene is terminated in death, attended with the same appearances as take place in apoplexy.\n\nFrom these effects of opium, in a state of health, it is not wonderful that recourse should have been had to it in disease, as mitigating pain, inducing sleep, allaying inordinate action, and diminishing morbid sensibility. That these effects do result from it is confirmed by the daily experience of every observer; and as answering one or other of these intentions, most, if not all, of the good consequences derived from it in actual practice are to be explained. If, therefore, by a sedative medicine, we mean an article capable of allaying, affluaging, mitigating, and composing, no substance can have a better title to the appellation of sedative than opium.\n\nAs answering the purposes of mitigating pain, inducing sleep, allaying inordinate action, and diminishing sensibility, it naturally follows, that opium may be employed with advantage in a great variety of different diseases. Indeed there is hardly any affection in which it may not, from circumstances, be proper; and in all desperate cases, it is the most powerful means of alleviating the miseries of patients.\n\nSome practitioners are averse to its use where there takes place an active inflammation; but others have recourse to it in such cases, even at an early period, especially after blood-letting; and where such affections are attended, not only with pain and spasms, but with watchfulness and cough, it is often productive of the greatest benefit. Opium, combined with calomel, has of late been extensively employed in every form of active inflammation, and with the greatest success. It is found also to be of very great service in allaying the pain and preventing the symptomatic fever liable to be induced by wounds, fractures, burns, or similar accidents.\n\nIn intermittents, it is said to have been used with good effect before the fit, in the cold stage, in the hot stage, and during the interval. Given even in the hot stage, it has been observed to allay the heat, thirst, headache, and delirium; to induce sweat and sleep; to cure the disease with the least bark, and without leaving abdominal obstructions or dropsy.\n\nIt is often of very great service in fevers of the typhoid type, when patients are distressed with watchfulness or diarrhoea. But where these or similar circumstances do not indicate its use, it is often distressing to patients, by augmenting thirst and constipation.\n\nIn smallpox, when the convulsions before eruption are frequent and considerable, opium is liberally used. It is likewise given from the fifth day onwards; and is found to allay the pain of suppuration, to promote the ptyalism, and to be otherwise useful.\n\nIn dysentery, after the use of gentle laxatives, or along with them, opium, independently of any effect it may have on the fever, is of consequence in allaying the torments and tenesmus, and in obviating that laxity of bowels which is so frequently a relief of that disease.\n\nIn diarrhoea, the disease itself generally carries off any acrimony that may be a cause, and then opium is used with great effect. Even in the worst symptomatic cases it seldom fails to alleviate.\n\nIn cholera and pyrosis it is almost the only thing trusted to. In choleric it is employed with laxatives; and no doubt often prevents ileus and inflammation, by relieving the spasms. Even in ileus, and in incarcerated hernia, it is often found to allay the vomiting, the spasms, the pain, and sometimes to diminish the inflammation, and prevent the gangrene of the strangulated gut. It is given to allay the pain and favour the descent of calculi, and to relieve in jaundice and dysuria proceeding from spasms.\n\nIt is of acknowledged use in the different species of tetanus, affords relief to the various spasmodic symptoms of dysepsia, hysteria, hypochondriasis, asthma, rabies canina, &c., and has been found useful in some kinds of epilepsy.\n\nOf late, in doses gradually increased to five grains, three, four, or even six times a day, it has been used in syphilis; and some instances are recorded in which it would seem, that by this remedy alone, a complete cure had been obtained: In other instances, however, after the fairest trial for a considerable length of time, it has been found ineffectual; and upon the whole, it seems rather to be useful in combating symptoms, and in counteracting the effects resulting from the improper use of mercury, than in overcoming the venereal virus.\n\nIt is found useful in certain cases of threatened abortion and lingering delivery, in convulsions during parturition, in the after-pains and excessive flooding.\n\nThe only form perhaps necessary for opium, is that\nof pill; and as it is so soluble in every menstruum, there seems the less occasion for the addition of either gum or soap. This form is more apt to fit on the stomach than any liquid form, but requires rather more time to produce its effects. The administration of opium to the unaccustomed, is sometimes very difficult. The requisite quantity of opium is wonderfully different in different persons, and in different states of the same person. A quarter of a grain will, in one adult, produce effects, which ten times the quantity will not do in another; and a dose that might prove fatal in cholera or colic, would not be perceptible in many cases of tetanus or mania. The lowest fatal dose to the unaccustomed, as mentioned by authors, seems to be four grains; but a dangerous dose is apt to puke, that it has seldom time to occasion death. When given in too small a dose, it is apt to produce disturbed sleep and other disagreeable consequences; and in some cases, it seems impossible to be made agree in any dose or form. Often, on the other hand, from a small dose, sound sleep and alleviation of pain will be produced, while a larger one gives rise to vertigo and delirium. Some prefer the repetition of small doses, others the giving of a full dose at once. In some, it seems not to have its proper effect till after a considerable time. The operation of a moderate dose is supposed to last, in general, about eight hours from the time of taking it.\n\nPure opium is partially soluble in water and in rectified spirit, and totally in proof spirit, wine, or vinegar. Water, rubbed with opium, and decanted repeatedly till it come off colourless, yields, on gentle evaporation, an extract which some use and recommend as one of the best preparations of this substance, and which requires to be given in double the dose of common opium.\n\nIt is said that alkalies diminish its soporific effects; that the fixed render it diuretic, the volatile determine it to the skin; and that acids destroy its activity almost entirely. But when conjoined with acids, particularly the diluted vitriolic acid, it often fits easily on the stomach, when it would not otherwise be retained, and afterwards produces all its sedative effects.\n\nThe chief official preparations of opium are, the opium purificatum, pilulae ex opio, pulvis opiatus, tinctura opii, and tinctura opii camphorata. Besides this, it enters a great variety of different compositions, as the pulvis sudorificus, balsamum anodynum, electuarium japonicum, pulvis e creta compositionis, &c.\n\nThe occasional bad effects of opium may result from the same power, by which in other states of the system it proves beneficial. The methods, therefore, proposed of correcting these by roasting, fermentation, long-continued digestion, repeated solutions and dilutions, have not succeeded.\n\n1016. Argemone, or Prickly Poppy.\nThree species; viz. mexicana, armeniaca, pyrenaica. West Indies, Mexico, Pyrenees.\n\n1017. Muntingia.\nOne species; viz. calabura. West Indies.\n\n1018.

Nymphaea, or Water Lily.\nSeven species; viz. *lutea, advena, *alba, odorata, flellata, lotus, pubescens. Europe, India, Africa, America.\n* N. leaves heart-shaped, very entire; cal. 5-leaved, lutea, much larger than the petals.\u2014The roots, rubbed with milk, destroy crickets and cockroaches. Swine eat it. Goats are not fond of it. Cows, sheep, and horses refuse it. An infusion of a pound of the fresh root, to a gallon of water, taken in the dose of a pint night and morning, cured a leprous eruption of the arm.\n* N. leaves heart-shaped, very entire; calyx 4-cleft, alba.\n\u2014It extends itself by long runners, which form a root at the end, and send up leaf-stalks in deep water. The root is bulbous. It is one of the most beautiful of the English plants, and may be propagated by transplanting the bulbous roots in winter. The petals gradually lessen as they approach the centre of the flower, where the outer filaments expanding in breadth, gradually assume the form of petals, as is generally the case in the double flowers of our gardens. The roots are used in Ireland, and in the island of Jura, to dye a dark-brown. Swine eat it. Goats are fond of it. Cows and horses refuse it.\n\n1020. Bixa, or Anotta.\nOne species; viz. orellana. West Indies.\n\n1021. Sloanea, or Apeiba of the Brazils.\nThree species; viz. dentata, maffioni, finemariensis. Brazil, Caribbee Isles.\n\n1022.

America.\n* T. flowers without a nectary; berry 4-celled.\u2014europaea.\nThis plant flourishes best on the side of hills, but it will live very well in meadow grounds. It is easily transplanted, and grafts grows beneath it: it is useful to form shady walks and clipped hedges. The wood is soft, light, and smooth; close grained, and not subject to the worm. It makes good charcoal for gunpowder and for designers. It is used for leather-cutters boards, and for carved works. It is also employed by the turner. The leaves are dried in some countries as winter food for sheep and goats. Cows eat them in the autumn; but they give a bad taste to the milk. The bark, macerated in water, may be made into ropes.\nropes and fishing nets. The flowers are fragrant, and afford the best honey for bees. The sap, insipidated, affords a quantity of sugar.\n\n1029. L\u00c6TIA.\nFour species; viz. apetala, guidonia, thamnia, completa. Jamaica.\n\n1030. RYANIA.\nOne species; viz. Ipecacua.\n\n1031.

FREZIERA.\nTwo species; viz. theacoides, undulata.\n\n1047. THEA, or Tea-tree.\nTwo species; viz. bohea, viridis. China, Japan.\n\nThe several sorts of tea met with among us, are the leaves of this same genus collected at different times, and cured in somewhat different manner; the small young leaves very carefully dried, are the finer green, the older afford the ordinary green and bohea. The two first have a sensible flavour of violets, the other of roses; the former is the natural odour of the plant, the latter, as Neumann observes, is probably introduced by art. Some of the dealers in this commodity in Europe, are not ignorant that bohea tea is imitative by the leaves of certain plants, artificially tinctured and impregnated with the rose flavour. The taste of both sorts is lightly bitterish, tubafringent, and somewhat aromatic. The medical virtues attributed to these leaves are sufficiently numerous, though few of them have any foundation; little more can be expected from the common infusions than that of a diluent acceptable to the palate and stomach; the diuretic, diaphoretic, and other virtues for which they have been celebrated, depend more on the quantity of warm fluid, than any particular qualities which it gains from the tea. Nothing arises in distillation from either sort of tea with rectified spirit; water elevates the whole of their flavour.\n\nGood tea, in a moderate quantity, seems to refresh and strengthen; but if taken in a recent highly flavoured state, and in considerable quantity, its use is apt to be succeeded by weakness and tremors, and other similar consequences, resulting from the narcotic vegetables; yet it is highly probable that many of the bad, as well as good effects, said to result from it, are consequences of the warm water.\n\n1048.

PAEONIA, or Peony.\nSeven species; viz. officinalis, corallina, albiflora, humilis, anomala, hybrida, tenuiflora. Switz. Ukraine.\nThe *paeonia officinallis* is cultivated in our gardens on account of the beauty of its flowers. The female peony, which is the largest and most elegant, and for this reason the most common, is the only one with which the shops are supplied. In quality they are scarcely sufficiently different; and hence they may be taken promiscuously. The roots and seeds of peony have, when recent, an unpleasant scent, approaching to that of the narcotic plants, and a somewhat glutinous subacid taste, with a light degree of bitterness and astringency; the leaves also discover an astringent quality, both to the taste, and by changing chalybeate solutions of a purple colour; the flowers have little taste, and a very faint not agreeable smell. The parts which have chiefly been used for medicinal purposes, are the roots and seeds. These are looked upon as emollient, corrosive, and lightly anodyne, and supposed to be of service in some kinds of obstructions, erosions of the viscera, heat of urine, pains in the kidneys, and the like. The virtue they are chiefly celebrated for, is that of curing spasmodic and epileptic complaints, which many have been absurd enough to believe, that the root of this plant would do by being only worn about the neck.\n\n**1056.

America.\n\n* A. leaves doubly winged; petals the ends turned back.\u2014This is the most acid of the anemonies; and is recommended by Dr Stoerk in the quantity of half an ounce of the distilled water, or five grains of the extract, twice or thrice a-day, in venereal nodes, pains, ulcers with caries, chronic eruptions, amenorrhoea, various chronic affections of the eye, particularly blindness from obscurities of the cornea. Its common effects are nausea or vomiting, an augmented discharge of urine, diarrhoea, and increase of pain at first in the affected part.\n\npulsatilla. * A. leaves doubly winged; petals straight.\u2014The whole plant is acid, and blisters the skin. The juice of the petals stains paper green. Goats and sheep eat it. Horses, cows, and swine, refuse it.\n\nnemorosa. A. seeds pointed; leaflets snipt; petals roundish; stem mostly 2-flowered.\u2014The flowers fold up in a curious manner against rain. The whole plant is acid. When sheep are unaccustomed to eat it, it brings on a bloody flux. Goats and sheep eat it. Horses, cows, and swine, refuse it. This plant is sometimes found with yellow dots on the under surface of the leaves.\n\n1082. Atragene.\n\nSix species; viz. alpina, ochotensis, japonica, capensis, tenuiflora, zeylanica.

Europe, N. America.\u2014The clematis erecta is introduced into but few of the modern pharmacopoeias, and has never been found in Britain. As well as many other active articles, supposed to be of a poisonous nature, it was sometime ago recommended to the attention of practitioners by Dr Stoerk of Vienna. Its leaves and flowers are so acid as to blister. Dr Stoerk recommends it in venereal, cancerous, and other cutaneous affections, in those headachs, pains of the bones, and wastings of the habit, the consequences of lues venerea. Externally the acid powder is sprinkled on the ulcers, and the forms for internal use, are those of infusion and extract.\n\n1084.

The root dyes wool yellow. Cows, horses, goats, and sheep, eat it. Swine are not fond of it.\n\n1085. Adonis, or Pheasant's Eye.\n\nEight species; viz. * asfivalis, * autumnalis, flammea, vernalis, apennina, filia, capensis, veicatoria. S. Europe, Cape.\n\n1086.

Europe, Asia, N. America.\n\n* R. leaves heart shaped, angular, on leaf-stalks; stem fiscaria, 1-flowered; flowers with eight petals; calyx with three leaves.\u2014This is a very small plant, found in most meadows, and by hedge sides. The roots consist of slender fibres with some little tubercles among them, which are supposed to resemble the hemorrhoids; from thence it has been concluded, that this root must needs be of wonderful efficacy for the cure of that distemper. To the taste it is little other than mucilaginous; and although still retained in several of the foreign pharmacopoeias, it is hardly in use in this country.\n\n* R. leaves egg-pearshaped, on leaf-stalks; stem de-flammula-clining.\u2014This plant is very acid; applied externally, it inflames and blisters the skin. Horses eat it. Cows, sheep, goats, and swine refuse it. Its acrimony rises in distillation. Some years ago, a man travelled in several parts of England administering vomits, which, like white vitriol, operated the instant they were swallowed. The distilled water of this plant was his medicine. It is said, that in the case of poison being swallowed, or other circumstances occurring, in which it is desirable to make a patient vomit instantaneously, it is preferable to any other medicine yet known, and does not excite those painful contractions in the upper part of the stomach, which the white vitriol sometimes does, thereby defeating the intention for which it was given.\n\n* R. lower leaves hand-shaped, the upper fingered; feceleratus, fruit oblong.\u2014The whole plant is very corrosive; and beggars are said to use it to ulcerate their feet, which they expose in that state to excite compassion. Goats eat it. Cows, horses, and sheep refuse it.\n\n* R. cal. expanding; fruit-stalks cylindrical; leaves acris, with three divisions, and many clefts, the uppermost\nstrap-shaped.\u2014Sheep and goats eat it. Cows, horses, and swine refuse it. Cows and horses leave this plant untouched, though their pasture be ever so bare. It is very acrid, and easily blisters the skin.\n\narvensis. * R. feeds prickly; upper leaves doubly compound, strap-shaped.\u2014It has lately been said that cows, horses, and sheep, in Italy, eat it greedily, though it is so acrid as to poison the latter. Three ounces of the juice killed a dog in four minutes. Its growing chiefly, if not solely, in corn fields where cattle are excluded, may possibly be the reason why we have not heard of mischief being done by it in this country.\n\n1087. Trollius, or Globe-ranunculus.\n\nTwo species; viz. * europaeus, aitaticus. Europe, Asia.\n\n1088. Isopyrum.\n\nThree species; viz. fumarioides, thalictroides, aquilegoides. Siberia, Alps of Austria, Italy.\n\n1089. Helleborus, or Black Hellebore.\n\nEight species; viz. hyemalis, ranunculinus, niger, * viridis, orientalis, * fetidus, lividus, trifolius. Austria, Italy, Canada.\n\n* H. item many flowered, leafy; leaves bird-footed. Bear's-foot, or Helleboraster.\u2014The leaves of this plant, taken in several different forms, have been by some recommended as a very powerful anthelmintic. They are particularly extolled by Dr Biffett, in his essay on the medical constitution of Great Britain, especially under the form of syrup, made by moistening the leaves of the fresh herb in vinegar, and then pressing out their juice, which was formed into a syrup with coarse sugar. Of this syrup, Dr Biffett gave to children from two to six years of age, one tea spoonful at bed-time, and another in the morning, for two or three days successively. The dose was increased or diminished according to the strength of the patient; and in this way he found it very successful in the expulsion of lumbrici.\n\nWhere the helleboraster is to be employed, this form is perhaps the best, and we doubt not that it may succeed where others have failed; but it should not, we apprehend, be employed till safer anthelmintics have been tried in vain. For we have heard of some instances where the imprudent administration of it has been attended even with fatal consequences.\n\nThe species called helleborus niger, black hellebore or melampodium, grows wild in the mountainous parts of Switzerland, Austria, and Stiria; the earliness of its flowers, which sometimes appear in December, has gained it a place in our gardens. In some parts of Germany, a species of black hellebore has been made use of, which not unfrequently produced violent and sometimes deleterious effects; this the W\u00fcrtemberg college particularly caution against, though without mentioning any marks by which it may be distinguished, or even giving the precise name of the plant. It appears to be the fetid hellebore of Linn\u00e6us, called in England where it grows, fetterwort, settlerwort, or bastard hellebore; the roots of this may be distinguished from the officinal sort by their being less black. The roots of the poisonous aconites resemble in appearance those of the black hellebore; and in the Brecknock collections we find some instances of fatal effects occasioned by mistaking the former for the latter; these also are happily discoverable by their colour; the aconitum being lighter coloured than even the palest of the black hellebores. The faculty of Paris, by allowing the use of one of the paler hellebores (the green-flowered which grows wild in England, and is called by our farriers peg-root) have in some degree deprived the shops of the benefit of this criterion. Since, therefore, the two noxious roots which the buyer is most apt to mistake for this, are distinguishable from it by their colour, but have no other external mark by which they may be with certainty known, particular regard ought to be had to this circumstance; only the deepest black being chosen, and all the paler roots rejected.\n\nThe taste of the hellebore is acrid and bitter. Its acrimony is first felt on the tip of the tongue, and then spreads immediately to the middle, without being much perceived on the intermediate part; on chewing it for a few minutes the tongue seems benumbed and affected with a kind of paralytic stupor, as when burnt by eating anything too hot; the fibres are more acrimonious than the head of the root from which they issue. Black hellebore root, taken from fifteen grains to half a dram, proves a strong cathartic, and as such has been celebrated for the cure of maniacal and other disorders proceeding from what the ancients called the atra bilis; in these cases medicines of this kind are doubtless occasionally of use, though they are by no means possessed of any specific power. It does not however appear, that our black hellebore acts with so much violence as that of the ancients, whence many have supposed it to be a different plant; and indeed, the descriptions which the ancients have left us of their hellebore, do not agree to any of the sorts usually taken notice of by modern botanists. Another species has been discovered in the Eastern countries, which Tournefort distinguishes by the name of black oriental hellebore, with a large leaf, a lofty stem and purple flower; and supposes to be the true ancient hellebore, from its growing in plenty about Mount Olympus, and in the island of Anticyra, celebrated of old for the production of this antimaniacal drug; he relates that a scruple of this sort given for a dose, occasioned convulsions.\n\nOur hellebore is at present looked upon principally as an alternative; and in this light is frequently employed in small doses, for attenuating viscid humours, promoting the uterine and urinary discharges, and opening inveterate obstructions of the remoter glands; it often proves a very powerful emmenagogue in plethoric habits, where itself is ineffectual or improper. An extract made from this root with water, is one of the mildest, and, for the purposes of a cathartic, the most effectual preparations of it; this operates sufficiently, without occasioning the irritation which the pure resin is accompanied with. A tincture drawn with proof spirit contains the whole virtue of the hellebore, and seems to be one of the best preparations of it when designed for an alternative; this tincture and the extract are kept in the shops.\n\nThe melampodium is the basis of Bacher's tonic pills for the dropsy. The root is ordered to be macerated in rectified spirit of wine; the liquor expressed is repeatedly mixed with water, and duly evaporated. This is made up into pills, with an extract of myrrh and...\nand powder of carduus benedicus. They are said to be cathartic and diuretic, and at the same time strengtheners of the folds.\n\n1090. Caltha, or Marsh-marygold.\nTwo species; viz. * palustris, natans. Europe.\npalustris. C. The flowers of this plant gathered before they expand, and preserved in salted vinegar, are a good substitute for capers. The juice of the petals, boiled with a little alum, stains paper yellow. The remarkable yellowness of butter in the spring has been supposed to be caused by this plant; but cows will not eat it, unless compelled by extreme hunger, and then, as some say, it occasions such an inflammation that they generally die. Upon May-day the country people in England strew the flowers before their doors.\n\n1091. Hydrastis, or Yellow-root.\nOne species; viz., canadensis. Carolina, Canada.\n\nIn the class Polyandria are\n85 Genera, including 563 Species, of which 50 are found in Britain.","sp":213,"ep":225},{"h":"CLASS XIV","t":"DIDYNAMIA, OR TWO STAMENS LONGER.\n\nOrder I.

The\ntree, though small, bears a large fruit, shaped like a cu-\ncumber, which contains 30 or more of the nuts. These,\nby pressure, yield a considerable quantity of a fluid oil.\nBoiled in water, they give out a large portion of a fe-\nbaceous matter, which congeals on the surface of the\nliquor as it cools. The principal use of these nuts is\nfor the preparation of the dietetic liquor chocolate.\nThis is a mild, unctuous, nutritious fluid, capable of\nsoftening acrimonious humours, and of great service in\nconsumptive disorders, especially if made with milk,\nand with only a small proportion of aromatics.\n\n1418.

Asia, India.\n\nThe citron or the citrus medica is an evergreen tree\nor shrub, of the same genus with the orange and le-\nmon; it was first brought from Assyria and Media\n(whence the fruit is called mala assyria, mala medica)\ninto Greece, and thence into the southern parts of\nEurope, where it is now cultivated. Citrons are rare-\nly made use of among us; they are of the same qua-\nlity with lemons, except that their juice is somewhat\nless acid. They are with us frequently employed as a\ncondiment.\n\nThe juice of lemons is similar in quality to that of\noranges, from which it differs little otherwise than its be-\ning more acid. The yellow peel is an excellent aromatic,\nand is frequently employed in stomachic tinctures and in-\nfusions: it is considerably less hot than orange peel, and\nyields in distillation with water a less quantity of essen-\ntial oil; its flavour is nevertheless more perfumable, yet\ndoes not arise to readily with spirit of wine; for a spi-\nrituous extract made from lemon peel possesses the aro-\nmatic taste and smell of the subject, in much greater\nperfection than an extract prepared in the same manner\nfrom\nfrom the peel of oranges. In the shops a syrup is prepared from the juice, and the peel is candied; the peel is an ingredient in the bitter infusions and wines: the essential oil enters the volatile aromatic spirit, or spiritus amonis compositus, as it is now called, and some other formulas.\n\nThe orange or the citrus aurantium is a beautiful evergreen tree, or rather shrub; it is a native of the warmer climates, and does not easily bear the winters of this.\n\nThe flowers are highly odoriferous, and have been for some time past of great esteem as a perfume; their taste is somewhat warm, accompanied with a degree of bitterness. They yield their flavour by infusion to rectified spirit, and in distillation both to spirit and water; the bitter matter is dissolved by water, and on evaporating the decoction, remains entire in the extract. An oil distilled from these flowers is brought from Italy, under the name of oleum or efflata neroni.\n\nOrange flowers were at one time said to be a useful remedy in convulsive and epileptic cases; but experience has not confirmed the virtues attributed to them. The leaves of the orange have also been recommended for the same purpose, but have by no means answered the expectations entertained by some.\n\nThe outer yellow rind of the fruit is a grateful aromatic bitter; and proves an excellent stomachic and carminative, promoting appetite, warming the habit, and strengthening the tone of the viscera. Orange peel appears to be very considerably warmer than that of lemons, and to abound more with essential oil; to this circumstance, therefore, regard ought to be had in the use of these medicines. The flavour of the first is likewise supposed to be less perishable than that of the other; hence the London college employ orange-peel in the spirituous bitter tincture, which is designed for keeping; whilst in the bitter watery infusion, lemon-peel is preferred. A syrup and distilled water are for the same reason prepared from the rind of oranges in preference to that of lemons.\n\nThe outer rind of the orange is the basis of a conserve both in the Edinburgh and London pharmacopoeias; and this is perhaps one of the most elegant and convenient forms for exhibiting it.\n\nThe juice of oranges is a grateful acid liquor, of considerable use in febrile or inflammatory distempers for allaying heat, abating exorbitant commotions of the blood, quenching thirst, and promoting the salutary excretions; it is likewise of use in genuine scorbutus or sea-scurvy. Although the seville or bitter orange, as it is called, has alone a place in our pharmacopoeias, yet the juice of the china, or sweet orange, is much more employed. It is more mild and less acid; and it is employed in its most simple state with great advantage, both as a cooling medicine, and as an useful antiseptic in fevers of the worst kinds, as well as in many other acute distempers, being highly beneficial in alleviating thirst.\n\nORDER IV.

Carolina.\n\n677. Symlocos.\nOne species; viz. martinicensis. Jamaica, Martinico.\n\n902.

Europe, Azores, China, N. America.\n\n* H. stem 2-edged; leaves blunt; with pellucid dots, perforata. \u2014This plant has long held a place in the materia medica, but its use is very much undetermined. The semi-transparent dots on the leaves are the receptacles of an essential oil. The leaves given in substance are said to destroy worms. The flowers tinge spirits and oils of a fine purple colour, which is probably derived from the little glands upon the anther, and upon the edges of the petals. Cows, goats, and sheep eat it. Horses and swine refuse it.\n\n903. Ascyrum, or St Peter's Wort.\nThree species; viz. crux andrews, hypericoides, villosum. N.

Tartary.\n\n1426. ARTOCARPUS, or Bread-fruits.\nTwo species; viz. incisa, integriflora. It has a cylindric amentum or catkin, which thickens gradually, and is covered with flowers; the male and female in a different amentum. In the male, the calyx is two-valved, and the corolla is wanting. In the female, there is no calyx nor corolla; the stylus is one, and the drupa is many-celled.\n\nThough this tree had been mentioned by many voyagers, particularly by Dampier, by Rumphius, and by Lord Anson, yet very little notice seems to have been taken of it till the return of Captain Wallis from the South seas, and since that time by others who have touched at Otaheite and some countries in the East Indies. Captain Dampier relates, that in Guam, one of the Ladrones islands, \"there is a certain fruit called the bread-fruit, growing on a tree as big as our large apple-trees, with dark leaves. The fruit is round, and grows on the boughs like apples, of the bigness of a good penny-loaf; when ripe, it turns yellow, soft, and sweet; but the natives take it green, and bake it in an oven till the rind is black; this they scrape off, and eat the inside, which is soft and white, like the inside of new-baked bread, having neither seed nor stone; but if it is kept above 24 hours it is harsh. As this fruit is in season eight months in the year, the natives feed upon no other sort of bread during that time. They told us that all the Ladrones islands had plenty of it. I never heard of it in any other place.\"\n\nRumphius, after describing the tree, observes, that \"the fruit is shaped like a heart, and increases to the size of a child's head. Its surface or rind is thick, green, and covered everywhere with warts of a quadrangular or hexagonal figure, like cut diamonds, but without points. The more flat and smooth these warts are, the fewer seeds are contained in the fruit, and the greater is the quantity of pith, and that of a more glutinous nature. The internal part of the rind, or peel, consists of a fleshy substance, full of twisted fibres, which have the appearance of fine wool; these adhere to, and in some measure form it. The fleshy part of this fruit becomes softer towards the middle, where there is a small cavity formed without any nuts or seeds, except in one species, which has but a small number, and this sort is not good, unless it is baked or prepared some other way: but if the outward rind be taken off, and the fibrous flesh dried and afterwards boiled with meat as we do cabbage, it has then the taste of artichoke bottoms. The inhabitants of Ambonya dress it in the liquor of cocoa-nuts; but they prefer it roasted on coals till the outward part or peel is burnt. They afterwards cut it into pieces, and eat it with the milk of the cocoa-nut. Some people make fritters of it, or fry it in oil; and others, as the Sumatrans, dry the internal soft part, and keep it to use instead of bread with other food. It affords a great deal of nourishment, and is very satisfying, therefore proper for hardworking people: and being of a gentle astringent quality, is good for persons of a laxative habit of body.\n\nIt is more nourishing boiled in our manner with fat meat than roasted on coals. The milky juice which distils from the trunk, boiled with the cocoa-nut oil, makes a very strong bird lime. This tree is to be found on the eastern parts of Sumatra, and in the Malay language is called foccus and foccum capas. It grows likewise about the town of Bantam in Java, and in Ballega and Madura, and is known there by the name of foccum.\"\n\nIn Anson's voyage we are informed, \"that the rima, or bread-fruit tree, is common in all the Ladrones islands and some of the Philippines. It is somewhat larger than our apple tree, and bears a broad darkcoloured leaf with five indentures on each side. The fruit hangs on the boughs like apples; and is of the size of a penny loaf, with a thick tough rind, which when full ripe turns yellow. The natives gather it before it is quite ripe, and bake it till the crust is pretty black; then they rasp it, and there remains a pretty loaf, with a tender yellow crust, and the crumb of it is soft and sweet as a new baked roll: it is without any seeds or stones. This fruit the inhabitants enjoy for about seven months; during which they never eat any other kind of bread: but they are obliged to bake it every day; for when it grows a little stale, it becomes harsh and husky, somewhat like the potato bread made in the west of England. There is, however, a remedy for this; which is cutting the loaf into slices when it is new, and drying it in the sun, by which it is changed into the pleasantest rusk that can be eaten.\"\n\nCaptain Cook, in his voyage, observes, that this fruit not only serves as a substitute for bread among the inhabitants of Otaheite and the neighbouring islands, but also, variously dressed, composes the principal part of their food. It grows on a tree that is about the size of a middling oak; its leaves are frequently a foot and a half long, of an oblong shape, deeply sinuated like those of the fig tree, which they resemble in colour and consistence, and in the exuding of a milky juice upon being broken. The fruit is about the size and shape of a new-born child's head; and the surface is reticulated, not much unlike a truffle; it is covered with a thin skin, and has a core about as big as the handle of a small knife. The eatable part lies between the skin and the core; it is as white as snow, and somewhat of the consistence of new bread; it must be roasted before it is eaten, being first divided into three or four parts; its taste is insipid, with a slight sweetness somewhat resembling that of the crumb of wheaten bread mixed with a Jerusalem artichoke. This fruit is also cooked in a kind of oven, which renders it soft, and something like a boiled potato; not quite so farinaceous as a good one, but more so than those of the middling sort. Of the bread-fruit they also make three dishes, by putting either water or the milk of the cocoa nut to it, then beating it to a paste with a stone pestle, and afterwards mixing it with ripe plantains, bananas, or the four paste which they call mahie.\n\nThe mahie, which is likewise made to serve as a succedaneum for ripe bread-fruit before the season comes on, is thus made: The fruit of the bread tree is gathered\nthered just before it is perfectly ripe; and being laid in heaps, is closely covered with leaves; in this state it undergoes fermentation, and becomes disagreeably sweet; the core is then taken out entire, which is done by gently pulling out the stalk, and the rest of the fruit is thrown into a hole which is dug for that purpose generally in the houses, and neatly lined in the bottom and sides with grats: the whole is then covered with leaves and heavy stones laid upon them; in this state it undergoes a second fermentation, and becomes four, after which it will suffer no change for many months. It is taken out of the hole as it is wanted for use; and being made into balls, it is wrapped up in leaves and baked: after it is dressed, it will keep five or six weeks. It is eaten both cold and hot; and the natives seldom make a meal without it, though to Europeans the taste is as disagreeable as that of a pickled olive generally is the first time it is eaten. The fruit itself is in season eight months in the year, and the mahie supplies the inhabitants during the other four.\n\nTo procure this principal article of their food (the bread-fruit), costs them happy people no trouble or labour except climbing up a tree: the tree which produces it does not indeed grow spontaneously; but if a man plants ten of them in his life time, which he may do in about an hour, he will as completely fulfill his duty to his own and future generations, as the native of our less temperate climate can do by ploughing in the cold of winter, and reaping in the summer\u2019s heat, as often as these seasons return; even if, after he has procured bread for his present household, he should convert a surplus into money, and lay it up for his children.\n\nWe have said that there are two species of artocarpus, viz. the incifa, with galled leaves; and the integatifolia, with entire leaves. There is also said to be another distinction, into which that bears fruit with stones or seeds, and that in which the fruit has none. The parts of fructification of that tree which bears the fruit without stones are defective. The amentum, or catkin, which contains the male parts, never expands. The styli, or female part of the fruit, are likewise deficient. From which it follows, that there can be no stones or seeds, and therefore that this tree can be propagated only by suckers or layers; although it is abundantly evident, that it must originally have proceeded from the seed-bearing bread-fruit tree. Instances of this kind we sometimes find in European fruits; such as the barberry, and the Corinthian grape from Zante, commonly called currants, which can therefore be increased only by layers and cuttings. Dr Solander was assured by the oldest inhabitants of Otaheite and the adjoining islands, that they well remembered there was formerly plenty of the seed-bearing bread-fruit; but they had been neglected upon account of the preference given to the bread-fruit without seeds, which they propagate by suckers.\n\nThe British government sent Lieutenant Bligh in the Bounty in 1787 to Otaheite to procure and transport to our West India colonies this valuable plant. The project was at that time unsuccessful, in consequence of a mutiny of the ship\u2019s crew, who seized the vessel, and carried her back to Otaheite. The object, however, was accomplished at a future period, and the bread-fruit is now reared in Jamaica and the other West India islands. Plants of this genus have also been brought to His Majesty\u2019s gardens at Kew. The taste of the fruit is said to be a sort of medium between the taste of common wheaten bread, and the taste of a boiled potato. Those who prefer potatoes to ordinary bread also prefer the bread-fruit to it.\n\n**Order II.

Russia, Austria, Italy, N. America.\u2014The V. album grows spontaneously on the mountains of Switzerland and Germany. The root is nauseous and acrid. If wounded, when fresh, it emits an acid juice, which is said to prove dangerous when mixed with the blood by an wound. The powder of the dry root applied to an influe, occasions violent purging. Sniffed up the nose, it is a strong, but not always a safe sternutatory. It is also a violent emetic. The ancients used it in desperate cases, but modern practice rejects it, though it is said to have been given with success to the amount of a scruple in cases of mania.\n\n1333.

S. Europe, E. and W. Indies, America.\n\nThe A. nardus, Indian nard or spikenard, as it comes from the East Indies, is a matted congeries of fibres issuing from one head, and probably forming the root of the plant. Spikenard has a warm, pungent, bitterish taste, and a strong not very agreeable smell. It is stomachic and carminative; and said to be alexipharmac, diuretic, and emmenagogue; but is at present little employed.\n\n1146.

Sycamore-tree, *platanus, camore maple.\u2014It flourishes best in open places and sandy ground, but will thrive in a richer soil. It grows quick, is easily transplanted, bears cropping, and the grafts flourishes under its shade. It is said to grow well near the sea, and that a plantation of these trees, at 50 feet a-funder, with three sea-fallow thorns between every two of them, will make a fence sufficient to defend the herbage of the country against the sea spray. Gent. Mag. 1757, p. 252. The wood is soft and very white, and is used by the turners. By boring a hole into the body of the tree, when the sap rises in spring, a sweetish watery liquor is obtained, which is used in making wine, and, if fermented, affords a fine sugar. From the A. saccharinum large quantities of sugar are annually thus made in North America. See United States, and Sugar.\n\n1143.

Egypt, E. and W. Indies, New Holland.\n\u2014The plants of this genus possess the singular property of shrinking or drawing in their leaves, when touched, which has obtained for them the English appellation of sensitive plants. From the species M. catechu a vegetable extract is obtained, which has long improperly received the appellation of terra japonica or Japan earth. This extract is outwardly of a reddish colour, internally of a dark brown, with a slight cast of red. It is capable of being reduced to the state of a powder; and is a mild, but powerful astringent. It is particularly useful in alvine fluxes; and where these require astringents, no one is so beneficial. It is likewise employed in uterine profusia, and in laxity and debility of the viscera in general. It is often suffered to dissolve leisurely in the mouth, as a topical astringent, for laxities and ulcerations of the gums, for aphous ulcers in the mouth, and similar affections: and it is in some other cases applied externally under the form of solution, and as an ointment. Catechu dissolves in water, with the exception of its impurities, which amount to an eighth part of the mass. Rectified spirit dissolves seven-eighths of the pure matter into a red liquor, leaving, undissolved, an insipid mucilaginous substance. The best form of administering it is that of simple infusion in warm water, with the addition of some cinnamon or cassia. From the M. nilotica gum arabic exudes, the uses of which are well known to be extremely numerous. The inspissated juice of the unripe fruit of this tree is termed acacia, and is used as a mild astringent medicine.\n\nOrder II. DICECIA.\n\n1159.

America.\n* F. leaflets serrated; flowers without petals.\u2014It flourishes best in groves, but grows in a rich soil, though in the open field. It bears transplanting and lopping. Horses, cows, sheep, and goats, eat it; but it is said to spoil the milk of cows. It will give a good, though not a beautiful green, to cloths that have been dyed blue. The wood is nearly as good when young as when old. It is hard and tough, and much used to make the tools employed in husbandry. The bark is used to tan calf-skin. An infusion of the leaves, from half an ounce to an ounce, is a very good purge; and a decoction of two drams of the bark, or of six drams of the leaves, has been used to cure agues.\n\n1161.

It is also found in North America, and frequently exported from thence to China. It has a very sweet taste, accompanied with a slight bitterness and warmth.\n\n1335.

The structure too of these vegetables differs considerably from that of other plants.\n\nThe Filices or Ferns constitute the first order. Their flowers are generally disposed in spots or lines, on the under surface of the leaves, but sometimes in spikes. In the male flowers the anthers are found fitting or supported on a very short filament, egg-shaped or globular, scattered on the under surface of the leaves. The male flowers unite so as to form a spike or bunch, or form lines or dots underneath the leaves, either on the surface at the edge, or at the point. In some cases they entirely cover the under surface. None of the flowers have any corolla, or even a calyx, excepting perhaps a scale formed from the leaf, opening, containing globules. The seeds are very minute, and globular.\n\nThe second order, called Musci or Mollis, have the female parts of fructification inclosed in a veil, which adheres to the top of the ripe capsule, and covers it. Capsule opening transversely. Stems leafy. Leaves membranaceous, reticulated; after being dead, reviving when soaked in water. In general the stamens and pistils are on separate flowers on the same or distinct plants.\n\nThe third order, or Algae, includes a division of plants which scarcely admit of a distinction of root, stem, and leaf; much less can the parts of their flowers be described. Their substance is flesh-like or leather-like, membranaceous or fibrous, jelly-like or horn-like, or resembling calcareous earth. The female fructifications are either found in saucers or tubercles, as in lichens; in hollow bladders, as in fucus; or dispersed through the substance of the plant, as in ulva. The aquatic genera, which grow on the sea coast, are called, in ordinary language, sea-weeds, or sea-weare, and by incineration, produce soda or mineral alkali. The lichens are of much importance in the economy of nature. They grow on the barest rocks, and their remains form a foil on which better vegetables afterwards flourish. Some of them afford valuable colours.\n\nThe order of Fungi, or Mushrooms, consists of plants mostly of a cork-like texture, and short duration, bearing their seeds either in gills or tubes, or attached to fibres or to a spongy substance. As little is known of their fructification, the generic characters are taken from their external form.\n1176. *Hemonitis.* Lineae d\u00edfic\u00ed decussantes.\n\n*1178.

Allo Cape, India, America.\n\nLord Dundonald obtained a patent, dated July 31, 1802, for the discovery of a substitute for the foreign gums, to be obtained from the plants of this genus. The specification of his lordship's patent is in these terms: \"My invention consists in procuring a substitute or substitutes for gum benegal, or other gums, from the clasps of plants called in botany lichens; from the plants of hemp and flax, previous to being steeped in water, or after being steeped; likewise from the bark or rind of the willow or lime tree. The process for obtaining the gum may be varied according to circumstances, and is done by washing the materials in water, digestion, and boilings, and with or without the aid of fixed or volatile alkaline salts or their solutions.\n\n\"It does not appear, from such trials as I have hitherto made, that there is any very great difference of the produce of gum from the lichen collected from different trees or shrubs; all of them answer equally well for yielding a gum fit for calico printing.\" The lichen is most abundant on the trees which grow on a poor stiff clay soil, and particularly if situated at some considerable height above sea level. It should be pulled in dry weather; otherwise it is apt to break in the pulling; besides, in this case, requiring to be dried before it can with safety be laid up in the storehouse, where, if put in dry, it may be kept for years. Should a sufficient quantity of it not be found in this country, it may be had in almost unlimited abundance in Sweden, Norway, and in the northern parts of America, where it grows to the length of from a foot to 18 inches, depriving the branches of the tree by its weight. There is, however, every reason to believe that a sufficient quantity is to be had in this country. According to information received from botanists, it takes three or four years in coming to maturity or its full size; so that a crop from the same tree may be had every fourth year. The lichen does not consist entirely of a gummy matter; there is the outer skin or cuticle, below that a green refrinous matter. The remainder of the plant consists of partly gum, partly somewhat analogous to animal substances, and a small proportion of fibrous matter, which cannot be dissolved by boiling, or the action of alkaline salts.\n\n\"The first process in preparing gum from the lichen, is to free it of the outer skin of the plant and the refrinous matter. This is done by scalding the lichen two or three times with boiling water, allowing it to remain so long in the water as by absorbing it to swell; in doing this the skin cracks, and comes off along with the greatest part of the refrinous matter; or it may be freed from them by gently boiling the lichen for about 15 or 20 minutes, then washing it in cold water,\nwater, laying it afterwards on a stone or brick floor, where it should lie for 10 or 12 hours, perhaps more. The reason for this is, that the exposure for that time to air, greatly facilitates the subsequent extraction of the gum.\n\nThe scalded lichen is then to be put into a copper boiler, with a due proportion of water, say three Scots pints, or two wine gallons, to every pound of lichen, and boiled during 10 or 12 hours, adding about a quarter of an ounce of soda or pearl ashes, for every pound of lichen; or instead of these salts, about two ounces of volatile alkali. The boiling should be continued until the liquor acquires a considerable degree of gummy consistence. It is then to be taken out of the boiler, allowed to drain or drip through a wire or haircloth screen. The residuum is to be put into a hair-cloth bag or bags, and to be squeezed in a press similar to that which is used by the melters or renderers of tallow.\n\nThe first boiling does not extract the whole of the gum. The lichen should be boiled a second, or even a third time, repeating the process as above described, diminishing at each process the quantity of water and the quantity of alkali, which a little experience will soon point out: when three boilings are employed, the gummy extract of the last boiling should be kept for the first boiling of a fresh batch of lichen; the extract proceeding from the first and second boilings should be mixed together, and evaporated to the consistence necessary for block or press printing. The evaporating vessels should be of tin or thin lead, placed over a range of stoves, and moderately heated by fire, or the steam of water. It has been neglected to state, that before evaporating the gummy extract to the consistence necessary, it should be kept 10 or 12 hours, so as to allow the sediment or dregs to subside. The clean liquor may either be drawn off by a syphon, or the dregs may be drawn off by a cock at the bottom of the wooden vessel; the bottom of which should be made sloping, higher at the back than the fore part, in order that the dregs may run more completely off. The proportion of gummy matter remaining in the dregs may be got off by mixing them with a due proportion of boiling water, allowing the liquor to clear, and proceeding as above directed, employing this weak solution for boiling the next batch of lichen. When volatile alkali is used, the boiler should be of iron, as volatile alkali acts on copper. Hemp, flax, and the bark of the willow and the lime trees, or sea weed, are to be heated in a similar manner, to extract the gum or mucilage contained in them. Likewise it is intended that this patent shall include every tree, plant, or vegetable, of whatever kind, from whence a mucilage or gum is to be obtained by the action of volatile or fixed alkaline salts, or their solutions, when used in the processes of maceration, digestion, or boiling, these vegetable matters; being a method of obtaining a mucilage or gum never before practised and adopted by any other person.\"\n\nThe above invention was for some time practised to a great extent by the calico printers in the west of Scotland, where it was found to answer for almost all colours. We have heard, however, that the use of it has been discontinued; whether from the price of gum senegal, for which it was employed as a substitute, having fallen, or that it has otherwise failed of its effect, we have not been informed.\n\nL. tubercles black, crust clear white.\u2014Grows only calcareous, on limestone rocks. When dried, powdered, and steeped in urine, it is used to dye scarlet by the Welsh and the inhabitants of the Orkneys. The colour is said to be very fine.\n\nL. faucers white, mealy, with yellowish white, thick, parellus, blunt borders; crust yellow white.\u2014Grows on rocks, walls, trunks of trees, &c. Litmus is prepared from this species. For this purpose it is collected from the rocks in the north of England, and sent to London in casks.\n\nL. faucers yellow, with a white border; crust whit-tartareus-ish.\u2014Grows on rocks and stones. In Derbyshire it is gathered for the dyers. It gives a purple colour.\n\nL. faucers dull purple; leaves hoary, smooth, blunt, omphalomy-cleft, sprinkled with rising dots. Cork, corker lodges, or arcell.\u2014It dyes wool a reddish brown, or a dull but durable crimson or purple, paler but more lasting than that of orchil. In Ireland it is prepared by steeping in stale urine, adding a little salt to it, and making it up into balls with lime. Wool dyed with it, and then dipped in the blue vat, becomes of a beautiful purple. With rotten oak it makes a dark brown. It has been used as a styptic.\n\nL. tubercles brown; plant hoary, hollow, much rangiferi-branched; terminating branches turned downwards.\u2014nus.

Lungwort, basil-rag or hasecrotter.\u2014It is recommended for consumptive cases. Woollen cloth, boiled in it, is said to become of a durable orange. In Herefordshire it is used to dye flockings of a durable brown.\n\nL. faucers red brown; foliage pale green, wrinkled, caperatus-waved at the edge, creeping.\u2014In Ireland and the Isle of Man it is used to dye wool of an orange colour. Serge, dyed with it, becomes of a lemon colour; but, if previously infused and boiled in urine, of a russet brown.\n\nL. faucers black, flattish; foliage gray brown, consift-pustulatus-ing of a single leaf, circular, slightly lobed, sprinkled with a black bran-like powder; pitted underneath.\u2014A beautiful red colour may be prepared from it (Linnaeus).

America.\n\neuropaeum. * A. leaves kidney-shaped, blunt, in pairs.\u2014This is a very low plant, growing naturally in France, Italy, and other warm countries. It grows readily in our gardens; and although the dried roots have been generally brought from the Levant, those of our own growth do not seem to be weaker. Both the roots and leaves have a nauseous, bitter, acrimonious, hot taste. Their smell is strong, and not very disagreeable. Given in substance from half a dram to a dram, they evacuate powerfully both upwards and downwards. It is said, that tinctures made in spirituous menstrua, possess both the emetic and cathartic virtues of the plant; that the extract, obtained by infusing these tinctures, acts only by vomiting, and with great mildness; that an infusion in water proves cathartic, rarely emetic; that aqueous decoctions, made by long boiling, and the watery extract, have no purgative or emetic quality, but prove good diaphoretics, diuretics, and emmenagogues. The principal use of this plant among us is as a sternutatory. The root of asarum is perhaps the strongest of all the vegetable rhines, white hellebore itself not excepted. Sniffed up the nose in the quantity of a grain or two, it occasions a large evacuation of mucus, and raises a plentiful spitting. The leaves are considerably milder, and may be used, to the quantity of three, four, or five grains. Geoffroy relates, that after sniffing up a dose of this errhine at night, he has frequently observed the discharge from the nose to continue for three days together; and that he has known a paralysis of the mouth and tongue cured by one dose. He recommends this medicine in stubborn disorders of the head, proceeding from viscid tenacious matter, in palsy, and soporific distempers. The leaves are the principal ingredient in the pulvis sternulatorius, or pulvis afari compositus, as it is now termed, of the shops.\n\n926.

Aristotelia.\n\nOne species; viz. macqui. Chili.\n\n942. Canella, or White Cinnamon.\n\nOne species; viz. alba. West Indies.\n\nThe bark of the canella alba is brought to us rolled into\ninto long quills, thicker than cinnamon, and both outwardly and inwardly of a whitish colour, lightly inclining to yellow. It is the produce of a tall tree, growing in great plenty in the low lands in Jamaica, and other American islands. Infusions of it in water, are of a yellowish colour, and smell of the canella; but they are rather bitter than aromatic. Tinctures in rectified spirit have the warmth of the bark, but little of its smell. Proof spirit dissolves the aromatic, as well as bitter matter of the canella, and is therefore the best menstruum. The canella is the interior bark, freed from an outward thin rough one, and dried in the shade. The shops distinguishing two sorts of canella, differing from each other in the length and thickness of the quills; they are both the bark of the same tree, the thicker being taken from the trunk, and the thinner from the branches. This bark is a warm pungent aromatic, not of the most agreeable kind, nor are any of the preparations of it very grateful. Canella alba is often employed where a warm stimulant to the stomach is necessary, and as a corrigent of other articles. It is now, however, little used in composition by the London college, the only officinal formula which it enters being the pulvis aloeticus; but with the Edinburgh college it is an ingredient in the tinctura amara, vinum amarum, vinum rhei, &c. It is useful as covering the taste of some other articles.\n\n943. CRATEVA, or Garlic-pear.\nFive species; viz. gynandra, tapia, obovata, religiosa, marmelos. E. and W. Indies.\n\n944.

Europe, N.

An infusion of five ounces of the crown of the root, in a quart of boiling water, sweetened with honey, and half a pint of it drank three times a-day, Dr Hill says, is an effectual cure for the jaundice. He advises to begin with a vomit, afterwards to keep the bowels soluble, and to continue the medicine as long as any symptoms of the disease remain. Sheep and goats eat it. Cows, horses, and swine refuse it. The flowers freshly gathered smell like apricots.\n\nORDER III. TRIGYNYA.\n\n958.

Europe, Egypt, Cape.\n\n* R. leaves spear-shaped, entire, with a tooth on each luteola-side the base; cal. 4-cleft.\u2014This plant affords a most beautiful yellow dye for cotton, woollen, mohair, silk, and linen, and is that which is most commonly used by the dyers for that purpose, as it gives the brightest dye. Blue clothes dipped in a decoction of it become green. The yellow colour of the paint called Dutch pink is got from this plant. The colouring quality resides in the stems and roots, and it is cultivated in sandy soils, rich soil making the stalk hollow and not so good. Cattle will not eat it, but sheep sometimes browse it a little.\n\n959.

Eur. Asia, Afr. Am.\n\nThe Euphorbia officinarum, or gummi-resinous substance, is a spontaneous exudation from a large oriental tree. It is brought to us immediately from Barbary, in drops of an irregular form, some of which, upon being broken, are found to contain little thorns, small twigs, flowers, and other vegetable matters; others are hollow, without anything in their cavity. The tears are in general of a pale yellow colour externally, somewhat white within; they easily break between the fingers. Slightly applied to the tongue they affect it with a very sharp biting taste; and upon being held for some time in the mouth, prove vehemently acrimonious, inflaming and ulcerating the fauces, &c. Euphorbia is extremely troublesome to pulverize, the finer part of the powder, which flies off, affecting the head in a violent manner. The acrimony of this substance is so great, as to render it absolutely unfit for internal use; several corrections have been contrived to abate its virulence, but the best of them are not to be trusted to; and as there seems to be no real occasion for it, unless for some external purposes, some think that it ought to be expunged from the catalogue of internal medicines; and accordingly, it has now no place in the London or Edinburgh pharmacopoeia; but it is still retained in most of the foreign ones, and is sometimes used as a sternutatory.\n\ncharacias. * E., umbel with many spokes, spokes forked; involucellums perforated, notched at the end; leaves very entire; stem shrub-like.\u2014The powdered leaves in doses of 15 to 25 grains operate as a purge. The juice of every species of purgative is so acid, that it corrodes and ulcerates the body wherever it is applied; so that physicians have seldom ventured to use it internally. Warts or corns anointed with the juice presently disappear. A drop of it put into the hollow of a decayed and aching tooth, destroys the nerve, and consequently removes the pain. Some people rub it behind the ears, that it may blister and by that means give relief.\n\n960. Visnea.\nOne species; viz. mocanera. Canary Isles.\n\nORDER IV. TETRAGYNIA.\n\n961.

The essential character of a compound flower, consists in the anthers being united so as to form a cylinder, and a single seed being placed upon the receptacle under each floret. The dandelion and thistle are compound flowers; that is, each of these flowers is composed of a number of small flowers called florets. The plants of this class are supposed to have various specific virtues. Most of them are bitter; almost none of them are poisonous. The lactuca virosa when growing in shady situations, is however said to be an exception to this last rule.\n\nThe elasticity of the calyx in the pteris, carduus, and many other genera, is too remarkable to pass unnoticed, by the slightest observer. It seems as if the expansion of the plants first burst the calyx open, and when these wither it closes again. The downy hairs that crown the seeds, before upright, now begin to expand, and by this expansion again open the leaves of the calyx, and bend them quite back. The seeds now escape, and the calyx, becoming dry and withered no longer retains its elastic power.\n\nThe hairy or downy appendages of the seeds occasion them to be wafted about in the air, and disseminated far and wide. The structure of this down deserves our notice; there is hardly a child that is insensible to its curious and beautiful appearance in the leontodon or dandelion.\n\nIn this class the orders are determined by the state of the florets with regard to stamens and pistils.\n* 913.

Horses are\n\nvery fond of it.\n\n909. Lactuca, or Lettuce.\n\nTen species; viz. * scariola, * virosa, * saligna,\n\nquercina, intybacea, sativa, tuberosa, canadensis, indica,\n\nperennis. Europe, East Indies, North America.\n\n* L. all the leaves horizontal, toothed; their mid-rib virosa,\n\nprickly on the back. Wild lettuce.\u2014The juice smells\n\nlike opium. It is milky, acrid, and bitter. Dr Cullen\n\nrelates 24 cases of dropsy, out of which 23 were cured\n\nby taking the extract prepared from the expressed juice\nin doses, from 18 grains to three drams in the 24 hours. It commonly proves laxative, promotes urine and gentle sweats, and removes the thirst. It must be prepared when the plant is in flower.\n\n910. Chondrilla or Gum Succory.\n\nThree species; viz. juncea, crepoides, nudicaulis. Germany, Switzerland, France.\n\n911. Prenanthes, or Wild Lettuce.\n\n19 species; viz. tenuifolia, chinensis, vimeina, purpurea, * muralis, altissima, chondrilloides, japonica, alba, repens, pinnata, integra, debilis, dentata, hastata, humilis, multiflora, lyraea, squalrosa. Europe, Japan, North America.\n\n912. Leontodon, or Dandelion.\n\n10 species; viz. * taraxacum, bulbosum, aureum, haftile, tuberolum, * autumnale, alpinum, * hifipidum, * hirtum, tomentosum. Europe, Africa, N. Amer.\n\n913. Hieracium, or Hawkweed.\n\n39 species; viz. incanum, pumilum, * alpinum, * taraxaci, alpestre, venosum, * pilofella, * dubium, * auricula, cynoicum, premosum, aurantiacum, gronovii, gmelini, fanctum, capenfe, pontanum, paniculatum, porrifolium, chondrilloides, * murorum, humile, * paludofum, lyratum, cerinthoides, amplexicaule, pyrenaicum, blattarioides, pilosum, austricum, helveticum, * molle, stipitatum, * villosum, glutinosum, kalmii, fprengerianum, * sabandum, * umbellatum.\n\n* H. leaves oblong, entire, toothed; silk almost naked; calyx hairy.\u2014This differs from the other lacteefcent plants, being less bitter and more alluring. It is esteemed hurtful to sheep. Goats eat it. Sheep are not fond of it. Horses and cows refuse it.\n\n914. Crepis, or Base Hawkweed.\n\n16 species; viz. pygmea, burhfolia, barbata, vesicaria, alpina, rubra, * foetida, alpea, rhagadioloides, fibrica, * tectorum, * biennis, viridis, disforidus, pulchra, neglecta. Siberia, Alps, Azores, Arabia.\n\n915. Andryala, or Downy Sow-thistle.\n\nThree species; viz. integrifolia, rugulosa, lanata. S. Europe, Archipelago, Canary.\n\n916. Hyoseris, or Yellow-eye.\n\nNine species; viz. foetida, radiata, lucida, scabra, virginica, * minima, hedypnois, rhagadioloides, cretica. Europe, N. America, Madeira.\n\n917. Seriola.\n\nFour species; viz. levigata, athmenis, cretenis, urens. South of Europe.\n\n918. Hypocheris, or Gysmore.\n\nFour species; viz. helvetica, * maculata, * glabra, * radicata. Europe.\n\n* H. stem almost bare, with a solitary branch; leaves egg-oblong, entire, toothed.\u2014The leaves of this plant are boiled, and eaten as cabbage. Horses are fond of this plant when green, but they do not like it when dry. Cows, goats, and swine eat it. Sheep are not fond of it. The country people believe it a cure for tetters and other cutaneous eruptions, possibly through a vulgar prejudice, founded on its spotted leaves.\n\n919. Lapsana, or Nipple-wort.\n\nFive species; viz. * communis, zacintha, stellata, kolpinii, rhagadiolus. Siberia, South of Europe.\n\n920. Catrananche, or Candia Lion's-foot.\n\nThree species; viz. ccrulea, lutea, greca. South of Europe.\n\n921. Cichorium, or Succory, Endive.\n\nThree species; viz. * intybus, endivia, spinosum. Europe.\n\n* C. flowers in pairs, sitting; leaves notched.\u2014The intybus, leaves, when blanched, are eaten early in the spring in salads. They lose their bitterness by cultivation. The roots, gathered before the stem shoots up, are eatable, and when dried, will make bread. Sheep, goats, and swine eat it.\n\nThe feed of the cicorium endivia is raised in gardens for culinary use. It is a gentle cooler and apertent, nearly of the same quality with the former species. The seeds are ranked among the four lesser cold seeds.\n\n922. Scolymus, or Golden Thistle.\n\nTwo species; viz. maculatus, hispanicus. S. Eur.\n\n923. Arctium, or Burdock.\n\nThree species; viz. lappa, perfonata, carduelis. Europe.\n\n* A. leaves heart-shaped, without thorns, on leaf-lappa stalks.\u2014Before the flowers appear, the items, stripped of their rind, are boiled, and eaten like asparagus; when raw, they are good with oil and vinegar. A decoction of the roots is esteemed by some very sensible physicians, as equal, if not superior to that of farfara-lla. Boys catch bats by throwing the prickly heads up into the air. Cows and goats eat it. Sheep and horses refuse it. Swine are not fond of it.\n\n924. Serratula, or Saw-wort, Way-thistle.\n\n15 species; viz. * tinctoria, coronata, japonica, * alpina, salicifolia, multilora, noveboracensis, praeculta, glauca, squarrofa, ficaria, spicata, amara, centaurioides, * arvensis. Europe, N. America.\n\n* S. leaves lyre-shaped and wing-cleft; the terminating segment very large; florets all alike.\u2014This plant is very much used by the dyers to give a yellow colour, but is inferior to the reded; therefore its use is confined to the coarser woollen cloths. Goats eat it. Horses are not fond of it. Sheep, swine, and cows refuse it.\n\n* S. leaves toothed, thorny.\u2014This species is said to arvensis yield a very pure vegetable alkali when burnt. Goats eat it: neither cows, horses, sheep or swine are fond of it. Horses sometimes eat the young tops.\n\n925. Carduus, or Thistle.\n\n38 species; viz. leucographus, * lanceolatus, arabicus, * nutans, * acanthoides, crifus, polyanthemus, * palustris, pycnocephalus, argentatus, australis, diffeclus, cyanoides, canus, pectinatus, defloratus, monspellianus, panunicus, tuberosus, chius, parvillorus, linearis, cafabona,stellatus, * marianus, syriacus, * epiophorus, altissimus, virginiacus, heterophyllus, * helienoides, ferratuloides, tataricus, ciliatus, flavescens, rivularis, mollis, * acaulis. Europe, N. America, Barbary, Japan.\n\n* C. leaves toothed, thorny at the edge; flowers in palustris, bunches, upright; fruitstalks without thorns.\u2014This, and almost all the other species of this genus, may be eaten like the burdock, before the flowers are formed. Swine eat it. Horses are very fond of it. Cows refuse it.\nlanceolatus * C. leaves with winged-clefts, hispid; segments straddling; calyx egg-shaped, thorny, woolly; stem hairy.\n\nFew plants are more disregarded than this, and yet its use is very considerable. If a heap of clay is thrown up, nothing would grow upon it for several years, did not the seeds of this plant, wafted by wind, fix and vegetate thereon. Under the shelter of this other vegetables appear, and the whole loom becomes fertile. The flowers, like those of the artichoke, have the property of curdling milk. Sheep and swine refuse it. Neither horses, cows, nor goats are fond of it.\n\nmarianus. * C. leaves embracing the stem, halberd-shaped and wing-cleft, thorny; calyx without any leaves near it; thorns channelled and set with other little thorns.\u2014This plant is eaten as a salad when young. The young stalks, peeled and soaked in water to take off the bitterness, are excellent. The scales of the cup are as good as artichokes. The root is good to eat early in the spring.\n\nacaulis. * C. stemless; calyx smooth.\u2014Cows refuse the plant. It kills all plants which grow beneath it, whence it is very injurious in meadows.\n\n926. Cnicus, or Blest Thistle.\n\nNine species; viz. oleraceus, erithales, ferox, pygmaeus, acarna, spinolifimus, centauroides, uniflorus, cernuus. Europe.\n\n927. Onopordum, or Woolly or Cotton Thistle.\n\nFive species; viz. * acanthium, illyricum, arabicum, gracum, acaulon. Europe, Arabia.\n\nacanthium. * O. calyx scales expanding, their points standing out; leaves egg-oblong, indented.\u2014The receptacle and the young stems may be boiled and eaten like artichoke. The ancients thought this plant a specific in cancerous cases. Cows, sheep, and horses refuse it.\n\n928. Cynara, or Artichoke.\n\nFour species; viz. foliynus, cardunculus, humilis, acanlis. S. Europe, Madeira, Barbary.\n\n929. Carlina, or Carline Thistle.\n\nEight species; viz. acaulis, lanata, corymbosa, * vulgaris, racemosa, pyrenaica, xeranthemoides, atractylodes. Europe, Cape, Barbary.\n\nvulgaris. * C. stem, with many flowers in a corymbus; flowers terminating; rays of the calyx yellow white.\u2014Its flowers expand in dry, and close in moist, weather. They retain this property a long time, and therefore are employed as hygrometers. It is said to be an excellent remedy in hysterical cases. Goats eat it. Cows refuse it. Its presence indicates a very barren soil.\n\nThe carlinia acaulis is a very prickly sort of thistle, growing spontaneously in the southern parts of France, Spain, Italy, and the mountains of Switzerland; from whence the dried roots are brought to us. This root is about an inch thick, externally of a pale rusty brown colour, corroded, as it were, on the surface, and perforated with numerous small holes, appearing, when cut, as if worm-eaten. It has a strong smell, and a subacrid, bitterish, weakly aromatic taste. Carlina is looked upon as a warm diaphoretic and alexipharma; and has been for some time greatly esteemed by foreign physicians, but never came much into use among us: the present practice has entirely rejected it, nor is it often to be met with in the shops.\n\n930. Atractylis, or Dijaff Thistle.\n\nEight species; viz. gummifera, humilis, cancellata, lancea, ovata, oppositifolia, purpurea, mexicana. S. Europe, Mexico, Japan.\n\n1419. Barnadesia.\n\nOne species; viz. spinosa. S. America.\n\n931. Carthamus, or Bafe Saffron.\n\n10 species; viz. tinctorius, lanatus, creticus, tingitanus, coerules, mitifimus, carduncellus, arborecens, salicifolius, corymbosus. S. Europe, Barbary, Madeira, Carolina.\n\nThe carthamus tinctorius is a soft kind of thistle, with only a few prickles about the edges of the leaves. It is cultivated in large quantity in some parts of Germany, from whence the other parts of Europe are supplied with the flowers as a colouring drug, and the seeds as a medicinal one. The flowers, well cured, are not easily distinguishable by the eye from saffron; but their want of smell readily discovers them. The seeds are white, smooth, of an oblong roundish shape, yet with four fendible corners, about a quarter of an inch in length, so heavy as to sink in water; of a vivid sweetish taste, which in a little time becomes acid and nauseous. These seeds have been celebrated as a cathartic: they operate very slowly, and for the most part disorder the bowels, especially when given in substance. Triturated with aromatic distilled waters, they form an emulsion less offensive, yet inferior in efficacy to more common purgatives.\n\n1287. Spilanthus.\n\nSeven species; viz. urens, pseudo-acmella, acmella, salivaria, atriciplfolia, infida, oleracea. E. Indies, Peru, Jamaica.\n\n932. Bidens, or Water Hemp-agrimony.\n\n12 species; viz. * tripartita, minima, nodiflora, ternella, * cernua, frondosa, pilosa, bipinnata, nivea, verticillata, scandens, bullata. Europe, E. and W. Indies, America.\n\n933. Cacalia, or Foreign Colts-foot.\n\n27 species; viz. papillaris, anteuphorbium, cuneifolia, kleinia, ficoides, laciniata, repens, suffruticosa, laurifolia, cotyledonia, aclepiadea, appendiculata, tomentoia, porophyllum, fonchiloria, incana, faracenica, hastata, fuaveolens, atriciplicfolia, alpina, echinata, bifrons, bipinnata, acalis, radicans, articulata. Alps, E. Indies, N. America.\n\n934. Ethulia.\n\nFive species; viz. conyzoides, sparganophora, divaricata, tomentosa, bidentis. India, Jamaica, Carolina.\n\n935. Eupatorium, or Hemp Agrimony.\n\n28 species; viz. dalea, hydropisum, scandens, houblonis, zeylanicum, feffilifolium, album, chinene, rotundifolium, altissimum, haftatum, lyraicum, trifoliatum, * cannabium, cinereum, purpureum, maculatum, sebrum, perfoliatum, culeelimum, aromaticum, aeratoideis, odoratum, ivaeolium, urticaeolium, stechadifolium, microphyllum, japonicum. Europe, America, E. and W. Indies, Japan.\n\n* E. calyx 5-flowered; leaves with finger-like divi-cannabi-fions.\u2014An infusion of a handful of it vomits and purges smartly. An ounce of the root, in decoction,\nis a full dose. In smaller doses the Dutch peasants take it as an alterative, and as an antiflatus. Goats eat it. Cows, horses, sheep, and swine refuse it.\n\n936. *Ageratum*, or *False Hemp*-agrimony.\n\nTwo species; viz. conyzoides, ciliare. America.\n\n937. *Petronia*.\n\n17 species; viz. camphorata, oppotitfolia, flexicau-\n\nlis, retorta, hirtuta, glabrata, inflexa, scariola, glome-\n\nrata, cinerea, villosa, membranacea, spinosa, cepha-\n\nlotes, pallens, minuta, fasciculata. C. of G. Hope.\n\n938. *Stachelia*.\n\nEight species; viz. gnaphaloides, dubia, arboref-\n\ncens, fruticosa, ilicifolia, corymbosa, chamaepeuce, im-\n\nbricata. S. of France, Spain, Cape, S. America.\n\n939. *Chrysocoma*, or *Goldylocks*.\n\n13 species; viz. oppotitfolia, comaurea, dichotoma,\n\nferacea, patula, cornua, ciliata, tomentosa, scabra, li-\n\nnolirys, bitora, graminifolia, villosa. Europe, Cape,\n\nCarolina.\n\n940. *Tarchoanthus*, or *Shrubby African Flea-bane*.\n\nThree species; viz. camphoratus, glaber, cricoides.\n\nC. of G. Hope.\n\n941. *Calia*, or *Halbert*-weed.\n\nFour species; viz. jamaicensis, oppotitfolia, amel-\n\nlus, scoparia. W. Indies, S. sea illes, Carolina.\n\n942. *Santolina*, or *Lavender Cotton*.\n\nFour species; viz. chamaecyparissus, rosmarinifolia,\n\nalpina, anthemoides. S. of Europe.\n\n943. *Athanasia*.\n\n20 species; viz. squarrosa, felsiliora, pumila, cre-\n\nnata, uniflora, capitata, maritima, genitifolia, pubef-\n\ncens, annua, trifurcata, crithmifolia, linifolia, dentata,\n\nparviflora, pinnata, pectinata, dentata, filiformis, ci-\n\nnerea. S. Europe, Africa, Carolina.\n\nOrder II. POLYGAMIA SUPERFLUA.\n\n944. *Tanacetum*, or *Tansey*.\n\nSeven species; viz. fibricum, incanum, cotuloides,\n\nannuum, monanthos, *vulgare*, balsamita. Europe,\n\nC. of G. Hope.\n\n*T. leaves doubly winged, cut, serrated.\u2014This plant\n\nis a warm deobstruent bitter, and its flavour not un-\n\ngrateful. The tender leaves are sometimes used to give\n\na colour and flavour to puddings. If a dead animal\n\nsubstance is rubbed with this plant, the fleh-fly will\n\nnot attack it. The Finlanders obtain a green dye\n\nfrom it. Cows and sheep eat it. Horses, goats, and\n\nswine refuse it. The seeds are an excellent vermi-\n\nfuge.\n\nThe tanacetum balsamita was formerly a very com-\n\nmon garden plant, and of frequent use both for culi-\n\nnary and medicinal purposes; but it is at present very\n\nlittle regarded for either, though it should seem from\n\nits tenible qualities to be equal or superior, as a medi-\n\ncine, to some aromatic herbs which practice has re-\n\ntained. The leaves have a bitterish warm aromatic\n\ntaste; and a very pleasant smell, approaching to that\n\nof mint, or a mixture of mint and mandrake. Water\n\nelevates their flavour in distillation, and rectified spirit\n\nextracts it by infusion. It has been recommended in\n\nhysterical affections; and by some it has been supposed\n\nto be very powerful in correcting the influence of opi-\n\num. The leaves should be collected in the month of\n\nJuly or August.\n\n945. *Artemisia*, or *Wormwood*, *Mugwort*.\n\n29 species; viz. vermiculata, capillaris, judaica, xe-\n\nthiopicus, contra, abrotanum, arborefens, santonica,\n\ncampestris, palustris, pontica, africana, annua, tana-\n\ncetifolia, *abfinium*, *vulgaris*, pectinata, integri-\n\nfolia, japonica, *cerulefens*, dracunculus, chinensis,\n\nmaderapatana, minima. Eur. Cape, Egypt, China.\n\n*A. leaves many-cleft, cottony; bunches on crooked maritima,\n\nfootstalks; female florets 3.\u2014This plant, in its wild\n\nstate, smells like marum or camphor; but in our gar-\n\ndens it is less grateful, though still much more grate-\n\nful than the next species. It is used as an ingredient\n\nin distilled waters, and beat with thrice its weight of\n\nfine sugar, it is formed into a conserve. Its virtues\n\nare the same with those of the next species, but in a\n\nweaker degree. Horses eat it. Cows, goats, and\n\nsheep, refuse it.\n\n*A. leaves compound, many-cleft; flowers somewhat abfinium,\n\nglobular, pendent; receptacle woolly.\u2014The leaves\n\nand flowers of this species are very bitter: the roots\n\nare warm and aromatic. A considerable quantity of\n\nessential oil rises from it in distillation. This oil is used\n\nboth externally and internally to destroy worms. The\n\nleaves, put into four beer, soon destroy the acetylene.\n\nThey resist putrefaction, and are therefore a principal\n\ningredient in antiseptic fomentations. An infusion of\n\nthem is a good stomachic; and, with the addition of\n\nfixed alkaline salt, a powerful diuretic in some dropp-\n\ning cafes. The ashes afford a more pure alkaline salt\n\nthan most other vegetables, excepting bean-stalks,\n\nbroom, and the larger trees. Linnaeus mentions two\n\ncafes, wherein an essence prepared from this plant, and\n\ntaken for a considerable time, prevented the formation\n\nof stones in the kidneys or bladder: the patients for-\n\nbearing the use of wine and acids. It might be sus-\n\npected, that, like other bitters, its long continued use\n\nmust weaken the action of the nervous system; but in\n\nthese instances no such effect took place. An infusion\n\nof it given to a woman that suckles, makes her milk\n\nbitter. It gives a bitterness to the flesh of sheep that\n\neat it. Horses and goats are not fond of it. Cows\n\nand swine refuse it. Turkeys are fond of it. The\n\nplant, steeped in boiling water, and repeatedly applied\n\nto a bruise, will remove the pain in a short time, and\n\nprevent the swelling and discoloration of the part.\n\n*A. leaves wing-cleft, flat, cut, cottony underneath; vulgaris,\n\nbunches simple, bending; florets of the circumference\n\n5.\u2014In some countries this plant is used as a culinary\n\naromatic. A decoction of it is taken by the common\n\npeople to cure the ague. The Chinese make use of it\n\nin healing wounds, applying the fresh plant bruised.\n\nA dram of the leaves, powdered, was given four times\n\na day, by Dr Home, to a woman who had been af-\n\nfected with hysterical fits for many years. The fits\n\nceased in a few days. Sheep and swine refuse it. Nei-\n\nther horses, cows, or goats, are fond of it. Dr An-\n\nderson informs us, that sheep are very fond of it, de-\n\nvouring it with great greediness, especially the roots,\n\nwhich seem to form a most delicate morsel.\n\nThe artemisia abrotanum, or southernwood, is a shrub-\nby plant, clothed with very finely divided leaves, of a light-green colour. The flowers, which are very small and yellowish, hang downwards, several together, from the middle of the branches to the top. It is not, like some other species of the artemisia, indigenous in Britain; but although a native of warm climates, it readily bears the vicissitudes of ours, and is easily cultivated in gardens; from thence alone it is obtained when employed for medical purposes. The leaves fall off every winter, but the roots and stalks continue for many years.\n\nSouthernwood has a strong smell, which to most people is not disagreeable. It has a pungent, bitter, and somewhat nauseous taste. These qualities are very completely extracted by rectified spirit; and the tincture, thus formed, is of a beautiful green colour. They are less perfectly extracted by watery liquors, the infusion being of a light brown colour.\n\nSouthernwood, as well as some other species of the same genus, particularly the abietinum and santonicum, has been recommended as an anthelmintic, and it has also been sometimes used as a stimulant, detergent, and sudorific. It has likewise been employed externally in difficult and antiseptic fomentations. It has also been used under the form of lotion or ointment for cutaneous eruptions, and for preventing the hair from falling off. It is at present very little employed in practice.\n\nThe worm-seed of the artemisia austriaca is the produce of a plant of the wormwood or mugwort kind, growing in the Levant. It is a small, light, chaffy seed, composed, as it were, of a number of thin membranous coats, of a yellowish colour, an unpleasant smell, and a very bitter taste. These seeds are celebrated for anthelmintic virtues, which they have in common with other bitters; and are sometimes taken with this intention, either mixed with molasses or candied with sugar: their unpleasant taste renders the form of a powder or decoction inconvenient.\n\n946. Gnaphalium, or Everlasting, or Cudweed.\n\n59 species; viz. eximium, arboreum, grandiflorum, fruticans, crifipum, appendiculatum, coronatum, difformum, muricatum, ericoides, teretifolium, mucronatum, floecas, igneiflens, dentatum, ferratum, patulum, petiolatum, crafifolium, maritimum, repens, umbellatum, hispidum, cylindricum, orientale, arenarium, rutilans, milleflorum, imbricatum, cyomifum, nudifolium, * luteo-album, pedunculare, odoratilimum, sanguineum, foetidum, undulatum, crifipum, helianthemifolium, squarofum, stellatum, obtusifolium, * margaritaceum, plantagineum, * dioicum, alpinum, indicum, purpureum, denudatum, * sylvaticum, verticillatum, oculus cati, pilosellum, declinatum, coronatum, * supinum, uliginosum, glomeratum, japonicum. Eur. Ind. Africa, N. America.\n\n947. Heranthemum, or Austrian Sneezewort.\n\n16 species; viz. annuum, vestitum, speciosissimum, proliferum, imbricatum, canefens, retortum, spinofum, sefamoideis, virgatum, flachelina, variegatum, paniculatum, fulgidum, foloniferum, recurvatum. S. Europe, Cape.\n\n948. Carpesium.\n\nTwo species; viz. certinum, abrotanoides. Austria, Spain, Italy, China.\n\n949. Baccharis, or Ploughman's Spikenard.\n\nEight species; viz. ivaefolia, nervifolia, arborea, halimitolifa, dioforidis, indica, brasiliensis, foetida. Cape, India, America.\n\n750. Conyza, or Greater Fleabane.\n\n25 species; viz. * iquatrofa, linifolia, fordiana, faxatilis, canefens, rupestris, scabra, alteroides, bifrons, lobata, bifoliata, pubigera, tortuosa, candida, anthelmintica, ballamifera, cinerea, odorata, chinensis, hirtuta, arboreifrons, fruticola, virgata, decurrens, aurita. Europe, Cape, E. and W. Indies, America.\n\n951. Erigeron, or Lesser Fleabane.\n\n22 species; viz. viscolum, graveolens, glutinosum, ficulnum, carolinianum, * canadense, bonariense, jamai- cenfe, philadelphicum, egyptiacum, gouani, * acre, * alpinum, uniflorum, gramineum, camphoratum, japo- nicum, icandens, tuberosum, tectorum, tricuneatum, pin- natum. Europe, China, Africa, America.\n\n952. Tussilago, or Colts-foot.\n\n12 species; viz. anandra, dentata, nutans, alpina, dificolor, sylvestris, * farfara, japonica, frigida, alba, * hybrida, * petalites. Europe, Japan, Newfoundland, Jamaica.\n\n* T. stalk with one flower, tiled; leaves somewhat heart-shaped, angular, finely toothed.\u2014This is the first plant that vegetates in marle, or limestone rubble. The downy substance on the under surface of the leaves, wrapped in a rag, dipped in a solution of saltpetre, and dried in the sun, makes the best tinder; the leaves are the basis of the British herb-tobacco. They are somewhat astringent, bitterish, and mucilaginous to the taste. They were formerly much used in coughs and consumptive complaints; and perhaps, not without reason, for Dr Gullen has found them to do considerable service in scrophulous cases: he gives a decoction of the dried leaves, and finds it succeed where sea-water has failed. And Fuller relates a case of a girl, with 12 scrophulous sores, who was cured by drinking daily as much as she could, for above four months, of a decoction of the leaves, made so strong as to be sweetish and glutinous. Goats and sheep eat it. Cows are fond of it. Horses and fives refuse it. It may be destroyed by cutting off the crown of the root in March.\n\n* T. panicle egg-shaped; female florets few.\u2014Its roots abound with a resinous matter. They have a strong smell, and a bitterish acrid taste. Horses, cows, goats, and sheep, eat it. Its large leaves afford shelter from showers to poultry and other small animals.\n\n953. Senecio, or Groundsel, Ragwort.\n\n59 species; viz. hieracifolius, purpureus, cernuus, perifolius, virgatus, divaricatus, pseudo-chyna, reclini- natus, vulgaris, arabicus, peucedanifolius, japonicus, triflorus, egyptius, lividus, trilobus, * villosus, * sylvaticus, nebrodensis, glaucus, varicosus, haftatus, pubigerus, elegans, squamidus, crucifolius, incanus, abrotanifolius, canadensis, diffusus, * jacobaea, * tenufolius, aureus, lyraeus, alpinus, umbellatus, linifolius, rosmarinifolius, * paludosus, nemorensis, * farracencis, fibricus, dorea, doronicum, longifolius, cruciatus, juniperinus, byzantinus, halimifolius, ilicifolius, rigidus, polifolius, angulatus, maritimus, erosus, marginatus, lanatus, cor- difolius, glaftifolius. Europe, Africa, E. Indies, Japan, N. America.\n\n* S.\nSyngenesia.\n\nvulgaris. * S. leaves winged, indented, embracing the stem; flowers scattered.\u2014A strong infusion of this plant vomits. The bruised leaves are a good application to boils. The seeds are very acceptable to linnets and goldfinches when confined in cages. Cows are not fond of it. Goats and swine eat it. Horses and sheep refuse it.\n\njacobaea. * S. leaves lyre-shaped, almost winged; segments finely jagged; stem upright.\u2014If this plant is gathered before the flowers open, and used fresh, it dyes wool of a full green, but the colour is apt to fade. If woollen cloth is boiled in alum water, and then in a decoction of the flowers, it takes a beautiful deep yellow. Horses and sheep refuse it. Cows are not fond of it. Horses and cows, however, eat it when young.\n\n954.

Cows and swine refuse it. Sheep are not fond of it.\n\n955. Solidago, or Golden Rod.\n\n14 species; viz. sempervirens, canadensis, altissima, lateriflora, bicolor, lanceolata, caesia, mexicana, flexicaulis, latifolia, * virgaurea, minuta, rigida, noveboracensis. Europe, N. America.\n\nvirgaurea. * S. stem serpentine, branched; leaves mostly fitting; flowers in crowded panicles.\u2014This plant is found wild on heaths and in woods, producing spikes of yellow flowers in August. The leaves have a moderately astringent bitter taste; and hence prove serviceable in debility and laxity of the viscera, and disorders proceeding from that cause.\n\n957. Cineraria, or Skyflower.\n\n26 species; viz. geifolia, cymbalarifolia, fibrica, glauca, fonchfolia, cordiflora, crispa, * integriflora, longiflora, * palustris, aurea, maritima, canadensis, capillacea, liniflora, purpurata, smelloides, americana, alata, elongata, cacahoides, denticulata, perfoliata, lineata, haftfolia, japonica.\u2014Europe, Africa, N.

Europe, Cape, E. Indies, N. America.\n\nbelenium. * I. leaves embracing the stem, egg-shaped, wrinkled, cottony underneath; scales of the calyx egg-shaped.\u2014This is a large downy plant, sometimes found wild in moist rich soils. The eleocharis, or root, especially when dry, has an agreeable aromatic smell; its taste on first chewing, is glutinous, and as it were somewhat rank; in a little time it discovers an aromatic bitterness, which by degrees becomes considerably acid and pungent. Eleocharis root possesses the general virtues of alexipharmics; it is principally recommended for promoting expectoration in humoral asthmas and coughs; liberally taken, it is said to excite urine, and loosen the belly. In some parts of Germany large quantities of this root are candied and used as a stomachic, for strengthening the tone of the viscera in general, and for attenuating tenacious juices; spirituous liquors extract its virtues in greater perfection than watery ones: the former scarcely elevate anything in distillation; with the latter an essential oil arises, which concretes into white flakes: this possesses at first the flavour of the eleocharis, but is very apt to lose it on keeping. An extract made with water, possesses the bitterness and pungency of the root, but in a less degree than one made with spirit. The root is esteemed a good pectoral. Dr Hill says, he knows, from his own experience, that an infusion of the fresh root, sweetened with honey, is an excellent medicine in the hooping-cough. A decoction of the root cures sheep that have the scab. Horses and goats eat it. Cows, sheep, and swine, refuse it.\n\n* I. leaves embracing the stem, heart-oblong; stem dyfenteriwoolly, forming a kind of panicle; scales of the calyx ca. brittle-shaped.\u2014It has a peculiar scent, compared by some to that of soap. The Russian soldiers in the Persian expedition under General Keit were much troubled with the bloody flux, which was cured by the use of this plant. Cows are not fond of it. Sheep and goats refuse it.\n\n958. Arnica, or Leopard's Bane.\n\n11 species; viz. montana, piloselloides, scorpioides, doronicum, maritima, crocea, ciliata, japonica, palma-ta, gerbera, coronopifta. Europe, Africa, Japan.\n\nThe arnica montana had formerly a place in our pharmacopeias under the title of doronicum germanicum. Then, however, it was little known or used; and being justly considered as one of the deleterious vegetables, it was rejected: but it has again been introduced into the list both of the London and Edinburgh colleges on the authority of fresh observations, particularly of those of Dr Collins of Vienna, who has lately published a dissertation on the medical virtues of the arnica.\n\nThis plant grows in different parts of Europe, particularly in Germany. It has an acrid bitter taste, and when bruised, emits a pungent odour, which excites sneezing. On this account the country people in some parts of Germany use it in snuff, and smoke it like tobacco. It was formerly represented as a remedy of great efficacy against effusions and suffusions of blood from falls, bruises, and the like; and it was then also mentioned as a remedy in jaundice, gout, nephritis, &c., but in these affections it is now very little if at all employed.\n\nOf late it has been principally recommended in paralytic affections, and in cases where a loss or diminution of sense arises from an affection of the nerves, as in instances of amaurosis. In these it has chiefly been employed under the form of infusion. From a dram to half an ounce of the flowers has been directed to be infused in a pint of boiling water, and taken in differ-\nent doses in the course of the day; sometimes it produces vomiting, sometimes sweating, sometimes diarrhoea; but frequently its use is attended with no sensible operation, unless it can be considered as such, that in some cases of paralysis, the cure is said to be preceded by a peculiar prickling, and by shooting pains in the affected parts.\n\nBesides being employed in paralytic affections, it has also been of late represented as a very powerful antispasmodic; and it is said to have been successfully employed in fevers, particularly those of the intermittent kind, and likewise in cases of gangrene. In these diseases it has been said to prove as efficacious as the Peruvian bark, when employed under the form of a pretty strong decoction, taken in small doses frequently repeated, or under the form of an electuary with honey.\n\nBut these alleged virtues of the arnica have not been confirmed by any trials made in Britain, with which we are acquainted; and we are of opinion that its real influence still remains to be determined by future observations. It is, however, one of those active substances from which something may be expected.\n\n959. Doronicum, or Leopard's Bane.\nThree species; viz., * pardalanthus, plantagineum, bellidiastrum. Europe, N. America.\n\n960. Perdicium.\nFive species; viz., semifloscularia, radiale, brasiliense, magellanicum, tomentosum. Cape, Japan, Jamaica, S. America.\n\n1421.

Europe.\n\n* B. stalk naked.\u2014The leaves are slightly acid. The roots have a penetrating pungency. No attention is paid to it, except what it claims from the beauty of its flowers. The flowers close at night. Horses, sheep, and cows refuse it.\n\n1322. Bellium, or Base Daisy.\nTwo species; viz., bellidoides, minutum. Levant, India.\n\n964. Tagetes, or African Marigold.\nThree species; viz., patula, erecta, minuta. Mexico, Chili.\n\n965. Leysera.\nThree species; viz., gnaphalodes, callicornia, paleacea.

Chrysanthemum, or Corn Marigold.\n24 species; viz., fruticens, serotinum, atratum, alpinum, * leucanthemum, montanum, graminifolium, montpelienne, ballamita, * inodorum, achillae, corymbosum, indicum, pinnatifidum, arcticum, pectinatum, * segetum, myconis, italicum, millefoliatum, bipinnatum, coronarium, flocculosum, japonicum. Europe, India, Africa, N. America.\n\n* C. leaves embracing the stem, oblong, serrated upwards, toothed at the base.\u2014The young leaves may be eaten in salads. Horses and goats eat it. Cows and swine refuse it.\n\n* C. leaves embracing the stem, jagged upwards, tooth-ferrated towards the base.\u2014This species was imported into Sweden along with corn from Jutland about the end of the last century. In Denmark there is a law to oblige the farmers to root it up from their corn fields. It may be destroyed by dunging the ground in autumn, followed by a summer fallow, and harrowing the land about five days after sowing the grain. Its yellow flowers, however, which follow the sun in a very remarkable manner, give a very remarkable brilliancy to the fields in tillage, and please the eye of the passing traveller.\u2014A large quantity which grew on some arable land, was cut when in flower, dried and eaten by horses as a substitute for hay. It is used by the Germans for dyeing yellow.\n\n967. Matricaria, or Feverfew.\nSix species; viz., * parthenium, * maritima, suaveolens, * chamomilla, argentea, asteroides. Europe, Curacao, S. America.\n\n* M. leaves compound, flat; leaflets egg-shaped, cut; fruitstalks branched.\u2014The whole plant has a strong smell and a bitter taste, and yields an essential oil by distillation. A horse refused it.\n\n* M. Receptacle conical, rays expanding; calyx scales equal at the edge.\u2014Its properties resemble those of milla. anthemis nobilis. The Finanders use an infusion of it in consumptive cases. Cows, goats and sheep eat it. Horses are not fond of it. Swine refuse it.\n\n1420. Unxia.\nOne species; viz., camphorata. Surinam.\n\n968. Cotula, or May-weed.\n13 species; viz., anthemoides, aurea, stricta, coronopifolia, umbellata, quinqueloba, vifola, turbinata, tanacetifolia, verbosina, capensis, pilulifera, servicea. S.

Europe, Africa, N. America.\n\n* A. receptacle conical; chaff bristle-shaped; seeds cotula, naked.\u2014Toads are said to be fond of this plant. It is very ungrateful and displeasing to bees. Goats and sheep are not fond of it. Horses, cows, and swine refuse it. It frequently blisters the skin of reapers, and of children who happen to gather it. The heads rubbed between the fingers smell intolerably disagreeable.\n\n* A. leaves winged compound, strap-flapped, acute, nobilis, somewhat woody.\u2014The leaves and flowers have a strong not ungrateful smell, and a bitter nauseous taste. They afford an essential oil. An infusion of the flowers is often used as a stomachic, and as an antispasmodic. In large quantities it excites vomiting. The powdered\nflowers in large doses have cured agues, even when the bark had failed. Both the leaves and flowers possess very considerable antiseptic properties, and are therefore used in antiseptic fomentations and poultices. From their antipathogenic powers they are frequently found to relieve pain, either applied externally or taken internally. Ray recommends the flowers in calculous cases.\n\n**Achillea**, or **Milfoil, Yarrow**.\n\n21 species; viz. santolina, ageratum, falcata, tomentosa, pubescens, abrotanifolia, bipinnata, regyptica, macrophylla, impatiens, clavennae, *ptarmica*, alpina, atrata, moschatia, nana, magna, *millefolium*, nobilis, odorata, cretica. Europe, Africa.\n\n*ptarmica*. A. leaves strap-shaped, embracing the stem, finely serrated.\u2014The roots have a hot biting taste. The young tops are sharp and pleasant in spring salads. The powdered leaves excite sneezing. Horses, cows, sheep, goats and swine eat it.\n\n*millefolium* A. leaves doubly winged; segments of the wings strap-shaped, toothed.\u2014The flowers of this plant yield an essential oil. The leaves are celebrated by the materia medica writers for a variety of purposes, but they are little attended to at present. Sheep and swine refuse it. Horses, cows, and goats are not fond of it.\n\n972. **Tridax**, or **Trailing Starwort**.\n\nOne species; viz. procumbens.

Europe, Egypt, Arabia, Persia.\n\n*C. calyx* leaves serrated; leaves strap-shaped, very cyanus, entire; the lower ones toothed.\u2014The expressed juice of the petals is a good blue ink; it stains linen of a beautiful blue, but the colour is not permanent in the mode it has hitherto been applied. Mr Boyle says, the juice of the central florets, with the addition of a very small quantity of alum, makes a lasting transparent blue, not inferior to ultramarine. Cows, goats, and sheep eat it. Horses and swine refuse it.\n\nThe *centaurea centaurium* is a large plant cultivated in gardens. The root has a rough, somewhat acrid taste, and abounds with a red viscid juice; its rough taste has gained it some esteem as an astringent; its acrimony as an aperient; and its glutinous quality as a vulnerary. The present practice takes little notice of it with any intention.\n\nThe *centaurea benedicta* is an annual plant cultivated in gardens; it flowers in June and July, and perfects its seeds in the autumn. The herb should be gathered when in flower, dried in the shade, and kept in a very dry airy place, to prevent its rotting or growing mouldy, which it is very apt to do. The leaves have a penetrating bitter taste, not very strong or durable, accompanied with an ungrateful flavour, which they are in a great measure freed from by keeping. Water extracts, in a little time, even without heat, the lighter and more grateful parts of this plant; if the digestion be continued for some hours, the disagreeable parts are taken up.\nup; a strong decoction is very nauseous and offensive to the stomach. Rectified spirit gains a very pleasant bitter taste, which remains uninjured in the extract.\n\nThe virtues of this plant seem to be little known in the present practice. The nauseous decoction is sometimes used to provoke vomiting, and a strong infusion to promote the operation of other emetics. But this elegant bitter, when freed from the offensive parts of the herb, may be advantageously applied to other purposes. Excellent effects have frequently been experienced from an infusion of this plant, in loss of appetite, where the stomach was injured by irregularities. A stronger infusion made in cold or warm water, if drank freely, and the patient kept warm, occasions a plentiful sweat, and promotes all the secretions in general.\n\nThe seeds of this plant are also considerably bitter, and have been sometimes used with the same intentions as the leaves.\n\n**Order IV. POLYGAMIA NECESSARIA.**\n\n985. MILLERIA.\n\nTwo species; viz. quinqueflora, biflora. Panama, Vera Cruz.\n\n1323. BALTIMORA.\n\nOne species; viz. recta. Maryland, Virginia.\n\n986.

Europe, Cape.\n\n* C. feeds boat-shaped, prickly, turned inwards; the innermost crowded together, the outermost upright, furnished with a tail.\u2014This is a very common plant in the corn fields, and in the vineyards in Portugal; and is used as food for milch cows. It is found in England near Falmouth, to which place it has probably been imported from Portugal, in consequence of the frequent communication by the packets and otherwise. The milk yielded by the cows which are fed upon it is very good.\n\nThe herb of the calendula officinalis is common in gardens, where it is found in flower greatest part of the summer. Marygold flowers are supposed to be aperient and attenuating, and also cardiac, alexipharmac, and sudorific; they have been principally celebrated in uterine obstructions, in the jaundice, and for throwing out the small pox. Their sensible qualities give little foundation for these virtues; they have scarcely any taste and no considerable smell. The leaves of the plant discover a vicid sweetnessness, accompanied with a more durable faponaceous pungency and warmth: these seem capable of answering some useful purposes as a stimulating and aperient medicine; but at present they are so little employed in Britain, that they have now no place in our pharmacopoeias, and they are also rejected from several of the latest and best foreign ones.\n\n991.

Cape, East and West Indies, America.\n\nThe lobelia fiphiitica grows in moist places in Virginia, and bears our winters. It is perennial, has an erect stalk three or four feet high, blue flowers, a milky juice, and a rank smell. The root consists of white fibres about two inches long; resembles tobacco in taste, which remains on the tongue, and is apt to excite vomiting. It is used by the North American Indians as a specific in the venereal disease. The form is that of decoction; the dose of which is ordered to be gradually increased, till it bring on very considerable purgings, then to be intermitted for a little, and again used in a more moderate degree till the cure be completed. The ulcers are also washed with the decoction, and the Indians are said to sprinkle them with the powder of the inner bark of the spruce tree. The same strictness of regimen is ordered as during a fallation or mercurial course. The benefit to be derived from this article, has not, as far as we know, been confirmed either in Britain or by the practitioners in Virginia; for there, as well as in this country, recourse is almost universally had to the use of mercury; and it is probably from this reason that the London college have not received it into their list. It, however, seems to be an article which, in some cases at least, deserves a trial.\n\n1008.

The difference in length of the stamens is not always very obvious, but as the Hexandra class contains no plants with four petals, this last circumstance readily distinguishes the plants of the present class. The orders are two, and are distinguished by the figure of the seed-vessel, which in the first order is a broad and short pouch; that is, a roundish flat seed-vessel furnished with a style, which is sometimes as long as the seed-vessel itself. In the second order, the seed vessel is a long pod; that is, a very long seed-vessel, without any remarkable style. This is a natural rather than an artificial class.

It is not a little singular, that they are most acrimonious in moist situations, and wet seasons.

LEPIDIUM, or Dittander.\n29 species; viz. perfoliatum, vesicarium, nudicaule, procumbens, alpinum, calycinum, * petraeum, cardamines, spinosum, sativum, lyratum, crassifolium, * latifolium, amplexicaule, glaftiolium, cleraceum, piceidium, tubulatum, graminifolium, apetalum, fuffruticosum, * didymum, * ruderaie, virginicum, divaricatum, iberis, pollichii, bonariense, chalepense. Europe, Cape, America, New Zealand.\n\n* L. leaves egg-shape, entire, ferrated.\u2014This is latifolium; one of the antirheutics, and was formerly used in the place of horsetail. An infusion of it excites vomiting.\n\n1227. THLASPI, or Treacle Mustard.\n14 species; viz. peregrinum, arabicum, * arvense, alliaceum, plyphine, faxatile, hirtum, * campestre, * monachum, alpinum, * perfoliatum, * alpefre, * burfa pafloris, ceratocarpum. Europe.\n\nTwo sorts of the thlaspi arvense are used promiscuously; they both grow wild: their seeds have an acid biting taste like common mustard, with which they agree in medical qualities.\n\nThe thlaspi burfa pafloris is common in waste places, and is found in flower all the summer. Shepherds-purse, or the leaf, has long been celebrated as an astringent, and strongly recommended in diarrhoeas, dysenteries, uterine fluxes, and in general in all diseases where astringents of any kind can avail. Some have esteemed it so powerful a styptic as scarce to be safely exhibited internally. Others have thought it to be of a hot fiery nature, and supposed it to stop fluxes and hemorrhages, by coagulating the juices like alcohol, and burning or tearing the orifices of the vessels. The sensible qualities of the shepherds-purse discover little foundation for either of these opinions: it has no perceptible heat, acrimony, pungency, and scarcely any astringency: the taste is almost merely herbaceous, so as sufficiently to warrant the epithet given to this plant fatuum. It is hardly in use in Britain.\n\n1228. COCHLEARIA, or Scourvy-grass.\n11 species; viz. * officinalis, * danica, * anglica, * groenlandica, fibirica, acaulis, * coronopus, * armoricana, macrocarpa, glaftfolia, draba. Europe.\n\n* C. root-leaves heart-circular; stem-leaves oblong, * officinalis, little indented.\u2014Notwithstanding this plant is a native of the sea coast, it is cultivated in our gardens without any sensible alteration of its properties. It possesses a considerable\nconsiderable degree of acrimony, and this acrimony seems to reside in a very subtile essential oil. Its effects as an antiflatus are universally known, and it is a powerful remedy in the puitious asthma, and in what Sydenham calls the februtic rheumatism. A distillate water and a conserve are prepared from the leaves, and its juice is prescribed along with that of oranges, by the name of antiflatus juices. It may be eaten as a salad. Cows eat it. Horses, goats, and sheep, refuse it.\n\narmoracia. * C. root-leaves spear-shaped, scolloped; stem-leaves fleshy.\u2014The root of this plant, scraped, is in common use in England as a condiment for fish, roast beef, &c., and it is used for many other culinary purposes. An infusion of it in cold milk makes one of the softest and best cosmetics. In paralytic and dropsical cases, it is a useful stimulant and diuretic. A strong infusion of it excites vomiting. A distilled water is prepared from it. Horses, cows, goats, sheep, and swine refuse it.\n\n* C. all the leaves egg-spear-shaped.\u2014This is a pungent stimulating medicine, capable of dissolving viscid juices, opening obstructions of the viscera and the more distant glands, and promoting the fluid secretions; it is particularly celebrated in scurvy, and is the principal herb employed in these kinds of disorders in the northern countries.\n\n1239. IBERIS, or Candy-tuft.\n\n18 species; viz. sempervirens, capnodocia, sempervirens, gibraltarica, saxatilis, vermiculata, rotundifolia, cephalota, carnola, ciliata, parviflora, nana, umbellata, * amara, linifolia, odorata, * nudicaulis, pinnata.

Europe, America.\n\n* C. leaflets of the root-leaves roundish, those of the pratensis. Stem-leaves spear-shaped, very entire.\u2014This is a perennial plant which grows in meadow grounds, sends forth purple flowers in the spring, and in its sensible qualities resembles the ranunculus aquatilis. Long ago it was employed as a diuretic, and of late it has been introduced in nervous diseases. A dram or two of the powder is given twice or thrice a day. It has little sensible operation, except that it sometimes sweats. Goats and sheep eat it. Horses and swine refuse it. Cows are not fond of it.\n\n* C. leaves winged; leaflets from the bottom of the amara, leaves; leaflets of the stem-leaves angular, fitting.\u2014Sheep eat it. Cows are not fond of it. The young leaves are acid and bitterish, but do not taste amiss in salads. They are much used for that purpose in Lancashire. The leaves are pungent, bitter, and aromatic, in such a degree as to promise very considerable uses.\n\n1238. Sisymbrium, or Water-creftes.\n\n53 species; viz. * nafturtium, * fylvetre, palustre, * amphibium, pyrenaicum, tanacetifolium, ceratophyllum, coronopifolium, tenifolium, sagittatum, ampli caule, supinum, polyceratum, filifolium, bursifolium, torulosum, * murale, * monenfe, repandum, tillieri, vinimeum, barrelleri, arenarium, valentinum, parra, asperum, leavigatum, millefolium, * sophia, album, cinearum, altiflimum, echartibergene, pannonicum, erythoides, * irio, columnae, loefelli, obtufangulum, orientale, barbaree, lyratum, catholicum, heterophyllum, glaciare, strictiflimum, pendulum, hispanicum, pumilum, fallugoenum, integrifolium, indicum, hispidum. Europe, Canaries, India.\n\n* S. leaves winged; leaflets egg-shaped.\u2014This plant nafturtium is very universally used as an early and wholesome spring salad. It is an excellent antiflatus and stomachic, with less acrimony than the fever-grass. It is an ingredient in the antiflatus juices. It is recommended as of singular efficacy for accelerating the circulation, strengthening the viscera, opening obstructions of the glands, promoting the fluid secretions, and purifying the blood and humours; for these purposes the expressed juice, which contains the peculiar taste and pungency of the herb, may be taken in doses of an ounce or two, and continued for a considerable time.\n\n* S. pods oblong egg-shaped; leaves wing-cleft, serrated; petals longer than the cup.\u2014The ends of the bium, general fruit-stalks are often swollen into a cauliflower-like substance, purplish, and containing small grubs of the same colour. Cows refuse it. Sheep and goats are not fond of it.\n\n* S. petals smaller than the cups; leaves doubly compound, winged.\u2014The pods retain the seeds all winter, and small birds feed upon them. The plant has been sometimes prescribed in hysterical and dyseretic cases; and the seeds are given to destroy worms. Sheep and cows eat it. Horses and goats are not fond of it. Swine refuse it.\n1293. Erysimum, or Hedge-mustard.\n\n14 species; viz. * officinale, * barbarea, precox, * allaria, repandum, * cheiranthoides, heiracifolium, odoratum, virgatum, diffusum, angustifolium, junceum, bicorne, quadricorne. Europe, Barbary, Canary, Carolina.\n\n* E. pods prefled to the spike-stalk; leaves notched.\u2014This plant is warm and acid to the taste; and when cultivated is used as a spring pot-herb. Birds are fond of the seeds. Sheep and goats eat it. Cows, horses, and swine refuse it. By means of it a hoarfrost, occasioned by loud speaking, is said to have been cured in three days by Rondeletius.\n\nbarbarea. * E. pods indistinctly four-cornered; leaves lyre-shaped, the terminating segment circular.\u2014The common people in Sweden are said to use this plant in salads, early in the spring, and late in the autumn; they also boil them as kale. It is sown in gardens as an early spring salad; and also in England, where it is called French cress. Cows eat it. Horses and swine refuse it. Goats and sheep are not fond of it.\n\nallaria. * E. leaves heart-shaped.\u2014The Prussians are said to eat the leaves along with salted meats in the spring. They are useful with lettuce and the colder salads. The seeds excite sneezing. Cows and goats eat it. Horses, sheep, and swine, refuse it. When it grows in poultry yards the fowls eat it, and it gives an intolerably rank taste to their flesh. In Wales it is much used as a frying herb.\n\ncheiranthoides. * E. very much branched; leaves spear-shaped, oblique, waved and toothed; pods expanding.\u2014The country people give the seeds of this plant to destroy worms, and with good effect. Horses, cows, goats, sheep, and swine, eat it.\n\n1240. Cheiranthus, or Stock July-flower.\n\n34 species; viz. erythroides, helveticus, alpinus, lancteatus, * cheiri, fruticulosus, callosus, strictus, tenuifolius, mutabilis, apricus, chius, maritimus, parviflorus, falinus, bicuspidatus, incanus, fenestratis, annuus, littoreus, contortuplicatus, leucanthemus, triflitis, tribulos, pulchellus, pinnatifidus, tricupidatus, tentomotus, odoratissimus, finuatus, taraxacifolius, cuspidatus, quadrangulus, farsetia. Alps, S. Europe, Egypt, Madeira.\n\n* C. leaves spear-shaped, acute, smooth; branches angular; stem shrub-like.\u2014This plant has found a place in our gardens, where it has produced a considerable number of varieties, but none which have a more delightful scent than the wild one. The flowers have a pleasant smell, and a subacid, bitterish, not agreeable taste; they are said to be cordial, anodyne, aperient, and emmenagogue, but are wholly neglected in the present practice.\n\n1241. Heliantha.\n\n12 species; viz. integrifolia, incana, circaroides, amplexicaulis, flava, canescens, pufilla, filiformis, pendula, pinnata, coronopifolia, digitata. C. of G. Hope.\n\n1242. Hesperis, or Dame's-violet, Rocket.\n\nTen species; viz. triflitis, lanciniata, matronalis, * odorata, tatarica, africana, ramoiffima, arenaria, verna, lacera. Siberia, S. Europe, Africa.\n\n1243. Arabis, or Base Tower-mustard.\n\n21 species; viz. alpina, grandiflora, * thaliana, crantziana, recta, serpillifolia, reptans, coerulea, bellidifolia, nutans, lyrata, hispida, * stricta, halleri, ovivenis, caudadensis, lucida, pendula, * turrita, faxatilis, alpina. N. Europe, N. America.\n\n1244. Turritis, or Tower-mustard.\n\nEight species; viz. * glabra, lavigata, stricta, * hirta, patula, pubescens, ciliata, alpina. Europe.\n\n1245. Brassica, or Cabbage.\n\n24 species; viz. * orientalis, aultrica, * campestris, arvensis, alpina, * napus, * rapa, * oleracea, richeiri, cretica, suffruticola, chinensis, violacea, tubiflatta, polymorpha, teretiflora, erucastrum, eruca, pinnatifida, elongata, cheiranthus, vesicaria, lyrata, crafifolia. Europe, China.\n\n* B. the root a regular continuation of the stem, napus, spindle-shaped.\u2014The roots of the cultivated variety may be eaten like the turnip, but they have a stronger taste; and its seeds, which are called cole-seed, afford a large quantity of expressed oil, called rape oil; what remains after expressing the oil, is called oil-cake, and is used for fattening oxen. In Norfolk, the cakes are broken to pieces, and strewed on the land as a manure. It is thought to be a very efficacious one, and is sold from 4l. to 6l. per ton. About half a ton is laid on an acre. Cows, goats, and swine eat it.\n\n* B. the root a regular continuation of the stem, cylindrical, fleshy. Turnip.\u2014The roots of it are either eaten raw, boiled, or roasted. Pepper is commonly used with them. They relax the bowels, and are supposed to sweeten the blood. They are hurtful to pregnant and hysterical women, and to those who are subject to flatulencies. The juice well fermented affords by distillation an ardent spirit. The rind is acrimonious. If the roots are kept in sand, or in a cellar, during the winter, they send out white shoots, and yellowish leaves, which being rather sweet, and not unpleasant to the palate, are used as salad, when other succulent plants are not to be had. But the greatest use of turnips is in feeding oxen and sheep in the winter.\n\n* B. the root a regular continuation of the stem, cylindrical, fleshy. Sea and Common Cabbage.\u2014Early in the spring the sea-cabbage is preferred to the cultivated kinds, but when gathered on the sea coast, it must be boiled in two waters, to take away the saltness. The roots may be eaten like those of the preceding species, but they are not so tender. The different varieties of cultivated garden cabbage originate from this, all of which are much in use at our tables. The red cabbage is chiefly used for pickling. In some countries they bury the white cabbage when fully grown in the autumn, and thus preserve it all winter. The Germans cut them to pieces, and along with some aromatic herbs and salt press them close down in a tub, where they soon ferment, and are then eaten under the name of sour-crust. If cabbages are sowed or planted for several years together in the same soil, the heads become smaller, and the roots knotty. This is occasioned by the larvae of flies. Horses eat the leaves, but do not seem fond of them. Cows grow fat upon them.\n\nThe brassica eruca was formerly much cultivated in gardens for medicinal use, and for salads; but is at present less common. In appearance it resembles mustard, but it is easily distinguishable, by the smoothness of its leaves and its disagreeable smell. The seeds have a pungent taste of the mustard kind but weaker; they have\nhave long been celebrated as aphrodisiacs; and may probably have in some cases a title to this virtue, in common with other acid plants.\n\n1246. Sinapis, or Mustard.\n\n19 species; viz. *arvensis, orientalis, brassicata, *alba, *nigra, pyrenaica, pubescens, hispida, chinensis, juncea, allioni, erucoides, cornua, hispanica, javonica, incana, frutescens, radicata, l\u00e6vigata. Europe, China, Madeira.\n\n* S. pods with many angles, fwoin and bunched out by the seeds; smooth, longer than the 2-edged beak.\u2014The Scandinavians are said to boil and eat it as a cabbage, and in Ireland the tender tops are collected for the same purpose. Cows, goats, and swine eat it. Sheep are very fond of it. Horses generally refuse it.\n\n* S. pods rough with hair; beak very long, flanging, sword-shaped.\u2014It is sown in the winter and early in the spring, to supply our tables with salading. The seeds have nearly the same properties as those of the next species.\n\n* S. pods smooth, laid flat to the spike-flank.\u2014The seeds of this plant reduced to powder, make the common mustard so much in request at our tables. They yield a considerable quantity of expressed oil, which partakes but little of the acrimony of the plant. The seeds when unbruised impart but little taste to boiling water. Taken inwardly, in the quantity of a table spoonful or more, they gently loosen the bowels, and are of service in asthma, chronic rheumatism, and palsy. The powdered seeds curdle milk, and give a strong impregnation to boiling water. This infusion taken in considerable quantity vomits, in smaller doses it is an useful aperient and diuretic. Cataplasms formed with crumb of bread, vinegar, and powdered mustard seed, are very commonly applied to the soles of the feet, as stimulants, in fevers that require such treatment; they are used with advantage, topically applied, in fixed rheumatic and sciatic pains. Upon the whole, wherever we want a strong stimulus, that acts upon the nervous system, without exciting much heat, we know none preferable to mustard seed. Its acrimony consists in an essential oil.\n\n1247. Raphanus, or Radish.\n\nEight species; viz. sativus, caudatus, *raphaniflorum, fibricus, tenellus, arcuatus, lanceolatus, pilulosus. Europe, Egypt, China.\n\n* R. pods round, jointed, smooth, of one cell.\u2014In raphaniflorum wet seasons it grows in great quantity amongst the bar-trium. In Sweden, and the common people who eat barley bread, are afflicted with very convulsive complaints, in those provinces, and in those seasons, wherein this plant abounds. Horses eat it. Cows refuse it.\n\n1248. Cordylocarpus.\n\nTwo species; viz. muricatus, l\u00e6vigatus.\n\n1249. Cleome, or Baja mustard.\n\n23 species; viz. juncea, heptaphylla, pentaphylla, triphylla, polygama, icoandra, vilcofa, dodecandra, felina, chelidoni, gigantea, aculeata, spinosa, ferrata, ornithopodioides, violacea, arabica, tenella, filifolia, guianensis, monophylla, capensis, procumbens.

The plants of this class were considered by Tournefort as having only one petal. But all the petals are distinct at the base; though, by the intervention of the united filaments, they cohere all together as one body; on which account they may properly be considered as having five petals. Linnaeus remarks, that the fruit does not afford sufficient marks whereby to distinguish the genera in this class; but that the calyx is of the utmost importance, as it furnishes invariable characters. Withering observes, that the petals are truly a continuation of the cylindrical sheath formed by the united filaments, which inclosethe styles and germs as it descends; when rising upwards it spreads out into petals.\nMonadelphia.\n\n1252.

Egypt, East and West Indies.\u2014The fruit of this species is a pod resembling that of a bean, including several hard seeds, together with a dark-coloured viscid pulp of a pleasant acid taste; the East India tamarinds are larger than the West India fruit; the former containing six or seven seeds each, the latter rarely above three or four. The pulp of these fruits, taken from the quantity of two or three drams to an ounce or more, proves gently laxative or purgative; and at the same time, by its acidity quenches thirst, and allays immoderate heat. It increases the action of the purgative sweets, castor oil, and manna, and weakens that of the resinous cathartics. Some have supposed it capable of abating the virulence of antimonial preparations; but experience shows that it has rather a contrary effect, and that all vegetable acids augment their power. Tamarinds are an ingredient in the electuary of castor, the lenitive electuary, and decoction of tamarinds with fennel.\n\n1251.

All the parts of it have a flinty taste, and abound with a soft mucilaginous substance which is readily extracted by water: the mucilage of the roots appears to be the strongest; and hence this part is generally made use of in preference to the others.\n\nThis plant has the general virtues of an emollient medicine, and proves serviceable where the natural mucus of the intestines is abraded. It is chiefly recommended in sharp defluxions upon the lungs, hoarseness, dysenteries, and likewise in nephritic and calculous complaints; not, as some have supposed, that this medicine has any peculiar power of dissolving or expelling the calculus, but as, by lubricating and relaxing the veffels, it procures a more free and easy passage. Althaea root is sometimes employed externally for fomenting and maturing hard tumours; chewed, it is said to give ease in difficult dentition of children.\n\n1290. **Malva**, or Mallow.\n\n55 species; viz. *ispicata*, *polyflachya*, *tomentosa*, *scoparia*, *gangetica*, *coromandeliana*, *americana*, *calycina*, *cuneifolia*, *anguifolia*, *fubhaftata*, *scabra*, *peruviana*, *lin\u00e9ifus*, *capitata*, *bryonifolia*, *umbellata*, *abutiloides*, *abulentis*, *lobata*, *fatigiata*, *bonariensis*, *stricta*, *laetca*, *operculata*, *fragrans*, *capensis*, *balamicca*, *gro\u00dfflarifolia*, *virgata*, *miniata*, *retula*, *tridactylides*, *althoides*, *caroliniana*, *prolifera*, *cretica*, *parviliora*, *nicceiensis*, *rotundifolia*, *acaulis*, *therardiana*, *fylvefris*, *mauritiana*, *hispanica*, *verticillata*, *cripa*, *papaver*, *stipulaca*, *alcea*, *moschata*, *elegans*, *tournefortiana*, *egyptia*, *trifida*. Europe, Barbary, Cape, China, America.\n\n*M.* Stem rough; leaves 5 or 7 lobed, toothed; out. *fylvefris*.\u2014The calyx leaves partly united at the base.\u2014The leaves of this plant have somewhat mucilaginous sweetness. They are ranked the first of emollient herbs; they were formerly in some esteem as food of a laxative quality; at present decoctions of them are sometimes employed in dysenteries, heat and sharpness of urine, and in general for obtunding acrimonious humours; their principal use is in emollient glysters, cataplasm, and fomentations. The leaves enter the officinal decoction for glysters, and a conserve was formerly prepared from the flowers.\n\n1291. **Lavatera**, or Mallow tree.\n\n12 species; viz. *arbores*, *micans*, *hippida*, *olbia*, *trilo\u00efa*, *lusitanica*, *maritima*, *thuringiaca*, *cretica*, *flava*, *punctata*, *timeffris*.

Syria, Cape, E. and W. Indies, N. America.\n\nThe seeds of the *hibiscus abelmoschus* are the product of a plant indigenous in Egypt, and in many parts both of the East and West Indies. They are of a small size and reniform shape; they are very remarkable from possessing a peculiar and very fragrant odour; the smell which they give out may be compared to that of musk and amber conjoined; those brought from the island of Martinico are generally esteemed the most odorous, but we have seen some, the product of hot-houses in Britain, which in point of flavour seemed not inferior to any imported from abroad.\n\nThese seeds, although introduced into some of the foreign pharmacopeias, have hitherto been used principally, if not only, as a perfume; and as their medical powers still remain to be ascertained, it is perhaps with propriety, that hitherto no place has been given them in the list either of the London or Edinburgh colleges. But their flavour as well as other sensible qualities point them out as a subject well deserving a particular investigation.\n\n**1298 Pavonia.**\n\n15 species; viz. pr\u00e6morsa, leptocarpa, typhalea, hafata, spinifex, papilionacea, cancellata, racemosa, corymbola, paniculata, odorata, coccinea, columella, urens, zeylanica.

Linnaeus takes the character of the class from the number of the stamens, and the character of the orders from their number. From the title of this class, Diadelphia or two brotherhoods, it might be supposed, that the filaments are always found in two sets. This, however, is by no means always correctly the case. The papilionaceous or butterfly shape of the corolla or blossom, as in a garden pea, will therefore be a surer guide. The class is not artificial, but perfectly natural, and the structure of the flowers extremely singular: their situation is generally obliquely pendent. The seeds of this class furnish food for men and other animals: they are farinaceous and glutinous. The leaves are food for cattle. None of them are poisonous.\n\nIn the class Monadelphia are\n\n60 Genera, including 682 Species, of which 15 are found in Britain.\nOrdo II. Hexandria.\n\n* 849. Fumaria. Cal. 2-phyllus.

Europe, Barb. Cape, N. America.\n\n* F. feed-veffels in bunches, 1 seed in each; item spreading.\u2014Cows and sheep eat it. Goats are not fond of it. Horses and swine refuse it. The leaves are succulent, saline, and bitter. The expressed juice, in doses of two or three ounces, is useful in hypochondriacal, scorbutic, and cachectic habits. It corrects acidity, and strengthens the tone of the stomach. Some prefer it to all other medicines as a sweetener of the blood. There is no doubt of its utility in obstructions of the viscera and the diseases arising therefrom. An infusion of the leaves is used as a cosmetic to remove freckles and clear the skin.\n\nOrder III. OCTANDRIA.\n\n851. Polygala, or Milkwort.\n38 species; viz. incarnata, alpafatha, brasiliensis, tricholperma, amara, * vulgaris, major, monspeliaca, paniculata, fibrica, bracteolata, umbellata, myrtifolia, oppositifolia, spinola, teretifolia, theezans, trinervia, penaea, diversifolia, microphylla, \u00e6tuans, chinensis, chamaebuxus, alopecuroides, mixta, squarroa, heif\u00e9ria, stipulacea, feneqa, lutea, viridefescens, triflora, glaucoides, ciliata, sanguinea, verticillata, cruciata. Europe, Cape, India, N. America.\n\n* P. flowers in bunches; stems herbaceous, simple, trailing; leaves strap-spear-shaped.\u2014This plant has been found to possess the properties of the Senega rattlesnake root (polygala senega), but in an inferior degree. The powdered root may be given in doses of half a dram. Cows, goats, and sheep eat it. Swine refuse it. An infusion of the herb, which is very bitter, taken in the morning fasting, about one fourth of a pint daily, promotes expectoration, and is good for a catarrhous cough.\n\nThe polygala senega grows spontaneously in Virginia, and bears the winters of our own climate. This root is usually about the thickness of the little finger, variously bent and contorted, and appears as if composed of joints, whence it is supposed to resemble the tail of the animal whose name it bears: A kind of membranous margin runs on each side, the whole length of the root. Its taste is at first acid, afterwards very hot and pungent.\n\nThe Senegavo Indians are said to prevent the fatal effects which follow from the bite of the rattlesnake, by giving it internally, and by applying it externally to the wound. It has been strongly recommended in pleuritis, peripneumonies, and other inflammatory distempers. Its more immediate effects are those of a diuretic, diaphoretic, and cathartic; sometimes it proves emetic: the two last operations may be occasionally prevented by giving the root in small doses along with aromatic simple waters, as that of cinnamon. The usual dose of the powder is 30 grains or more.\n\nSome have likewise employed this root in hydropic cases, and not without success. There are examples of its occasioning a plentiful evacuation by stool, urine, and perspiration; and by this means removing the disease, after the common diuretics and hydragogues had failed. Where this medicine operates as a cathartic it generally proves successful; if it acts by liquefying the blood and juices, without occasioning a due discharge, it should either be abstained from, or assisted by proper additions.\n\n852. Securid\u00e6a, or Hatebet-vetch.\nTwo species; viz. erecta, volubilis. W. Indies.\n\n1416. Dalbergia.\nTwo species; viz. lanceolaria, monetaria. Surinam, Ceylon.\n\nOrder IV. DECANDRIA.\n\n853.

S. Europe, Barbary, Cape, Madeira.\n\n* S. leaves in threes, and solitary; branches without scoparium; prickles.\u2014The young flowers are sometimes preserved as pickles. The plant, when burnt, affords a tolerable pure alkaline salt. Dr Mead relates the case of a dropical patient, that was cured by taking half a pint of a decoction of green broom-tops, with a spoonful of whole mustard seed, every morning and evening. The patient had been tapped three times, and tried the usual remedies before. An infusion of the seeds, drank freely, has been known to produce similar happy effects; but whoever expects these effects to follow in every dropical case, will be greatly deceived. A strong lixivium of the ashes was used in the Swedish army in the year 1719, to cure dropsies, consequential to a catarrhal epidemic fever. The urine became plentiful, and the dropsies soon disappeared. Some use the seeds\nfeeds toasted, so as to make a kind of coffee. The plant, when growing large, merits a place among our flowering shrubs, on account of the profusion of its golden-coloured blossoms. Cows, horses, and sheep, refuse it.\n\n859. Genista, or Dyers Broom.\n\n14 species; viz. canariensis, candicans, linifolia, sagittalis, tridentata, * tinctoria, fibrica, florida, * pilosa, humifusa, * anglica, germanica, hispanica, lusitana. Europe, Canaries.\n\n* G. branches scored, cylindrical, upright; leaves spear-shaped, smooth; legumen cylindrical.\u2014A yellow colour may be prepared from the flowers; and for wool that is to be dyed green, the dyers prefer it to all others. A dram and a half of the powdered seeds operates as a mild purgative. A decoction of the plant is sometimes diuretic, and therefore has proved serviceable in tropical cases. Horses, cows, goats, and sheep, eat it.\n\nThe wood or root of the genista canariensis is chiefly brought to us from the Canary islands. In the shops of the apothecaries it usually receives the appellation of lignum rhodium. It is in long crooked pieces full of knobs, which when cut, appear of a yellow colour like box, with a reddish tinge. The largest, smoothest, most compact, and deepest coloured pieces, should be chosen; and the small, thin, or pale ones, rejected. The taste of this wood is lightly bitterish, and somewhat pungent; its smell very fragrant, resembling that of roses: long kept, it seems to lose its smell; but, on cutting or rubbing one piece against the other, it smells as well as at first. Distilled with water, it yields an odoriferous essential oil, in very small quantity. Rhodium is at present in esteem, only upon account of its oil, which is employed as a high and agreeable perfume in scenting pomatums and the like. But if we may reason from analogy, this odoriferous simple might be advantageously applied to more useful purposes; a tincture of it in rectified spirit of wine, which contains in small volume the virtues of a considerable deal of the wood, bids fair to prove a serviceable cordial, not inferior perhaps to any thing of this kind.\n\n862. Aspalathus, or African Broom.\n\n35 species; viz. spinosa, verrucosa, capitata, glomerata, alticola, chenopoda, albens, thymifolia, ericifolia, nigra, carnea, ciliaris, genistoides, hybrida, galioides, retroflexa, uniflora, araneoidea, afraparagoides, ferricea, canescens, heterophylla, indica, ebenus, cretica, quinquefolia, tridentata, pilosa, anthylloides, lasata, argentea, callofa, orientalis, mucronata, pinnata. Crete, Cape, E. Indies.\n\n881. Ulex, or Furze, Whinstone, Gorse.\n\nTwo species; viz. * europaeus, capensis. Germany, France, Cape.\n\n* U. leaves woolly, acute; thorns scattered.\u2014Gorse is in some respects a very hardy plant, and will make fences upon the bleakest mountains and close to the sea side, where the spray of the sea destroys almost every other shrub; but it is impatient of cold, is often destroyed by severe frost, and is rarely found in the northern parts of our island. In Cornwall, where fuel is scarce, it is cultivated to advantage, and it is generally cut to make faggots for heating ovens, which it does very soon, burning rapidly, and with a great degree of heat. The ashes are used to make ley. Team horses may be supported by this plant, if it is cut young and bruised in a mill to break the thorns. Goats, cows, sheep, and horses feed upon the tender tops.\n\n861. Amorpha, or Shrubby Bafe Indigo.\n\nOne species; viz. fruticosa. Carolina.\n\n862. Crotalaria, or Rattle-wort.\n\n23 species; viz. perforata, perfoliata, amplexicaulis, fagittalis, chinensis, juncea, imbricata, retula, fessiliflora, triflora, verrucosa, biflora, opposita, linifolia, bifaria, latiflora, lunaris, laburniflora, cordiflora, incana, incanescens, heterophylla, quinquefolia. East and West Indies, Africa, America.\n\n863. Ononis, or Red-barrow.\n\n31 species; viz. antiquorum, * spinosa, * arvensis, repens, minutissima, mitiflora, alopecuroides, variegata, pubescens, hircina, cernua, umbellata, argentea, involucrata, filiformis, capensis, prostrata, reclinata, cenifa, cherleri, villosa, ornithopodioides, pinguis, natrix, tridentata, crispa, hispanica, fruticosa, rotundiflora, microphylla, mauritanica. Europe, Cape.\n\n* O. flowers in bunches, solitary; leaves solitary or spinosa, three together; branches thorny.\u2014A decoction of the roots has been recommended in cases of stone and jaundice. Cows and goats eat it. Sheep are very fond of it. Horses and swine refuse it. A horse is said to have refused the whole branch, but ate of the younger shoots when picked off.\n\n864. Anthyllis, or Lady's Finger, Kidney-vetch.\n\n15 species; viz. tetraphylla, * vulneraria, montana, cornicina, lotoides, gerardi, quinqueflora, involucrata, linifolia, barba-jovis, heterophylla, villosa, cytiloides, hermaniae, crinacea. Europe.\n\n* A. herbaceous; leaves winged, unequal; flowers in vulneraria a double head.\u2014The country people get a yellow dye from it. It makes an excellent pallurage for sheep. Where the soil was a reddish clay, Linnaeus observed the blossoms to be red, but in white clay white. Goats and cows eat it.\n\n876. Arachis, or Ground Nut.\n\nOne species; viz. hypogaea. Carolina, S. Amer.\n\n895. Ebenus, or Ebony of Crete.\n\nOne species; viz. cretica. Crete, Levant, Barb.\n\n865. Lupinus, or Lupine.\n\nSeven species; viz. perennis, albus, varius, hirsutus, pilosus, angustiflora, luteus. S. Europe, Egypt, Virginia.\n\nThe seeds of the lupinus albus have a leguminous taste, accompanied with a disagreeable bitter one. They are said to be anthelmintic, both internally taken, and applied externally. Hoffman cautions against their internal use, and tells us that they have sometimes occasioned death. Simon Pauli also observes, that he saw a boy of eight or ten years of age, after taking a dram of these seeds in powder, seized with exquisite pains of the abdomen, a difficulty of respiration, and almost total loss of voice; and that he was relieved from these complaints by a glycerine of milk and sugar, which brought away a vast quantity of worms. But Mr Geoffroy observes, very justly, that either these\nthese symptoms were owing to the worms, and not to the medicine; or that these feeds, if they have any noxious quality, lose it, with their bitters, in boiling, since they were commonly used among the Greeks as food, and recommended by Galen as very wholesome.\n\n866. Phaseolus, or Kidney Bean.\n\n17 species; viz. vulgaris, lunatus, bipinnatus, inamoenum, farinosus, vexillatus, helvulus, semierectus, alatus, caracalla, acutifolius, nanus, radiatus, max, mungo, lathyroides, sphaerofermus. E. and W. Indies, Africa, America.\n\n867. Dolichos, or Cow-tieb.\n\n31 species; viz. benghalensis, lablab, finensis, uncinatus, luteolus, ungulicatus, tranquebaricus, eniformis, tetragonolobus, sefquipedalis, altissimus, pruriens, urens, minimus, lineatus, capensis, scarabaeoides, incurvus, bulbosus, trilobus, ariftatus, filiformis, purpureus, regularis, lignosus, polytachios, eniformis, saja, catiang, biflorus, repens. Egypt, E. and W. Indies, Cape, America.\n\nThe dolichos pruriens is a plant growing in great abundance in warm climates, particularly in the West India islands; and there it is very troublesome to cattle and other domestic animals: for on account of the spicule of the seed-pod, it excites, when touched, a very uneasy itching. These spicules have been long used in South America, in cases of worms; and have of late been frequently employed in Britain. The spicules of one pod, mixed with syrup or molasses, and taken in the morning fasting, is a dose for an adult. The worms are said to appear with the second or third dose; and by means of a purge in some cases, the stools are said to have consisted almost entirely of worms; and in cases of lumbrici it is said to produce a safe and effectual cure. Those who have used it most affirm, that they have never seen any inconvenience resulting from the internal use of it, notwithstanding the great uneasiness it occasions, on the slightest touch, to any part of the surface.\n\n868. Glycine, or Kidney-bean tree.\n\n15 species; viz. subterranea, monoca, triloba, villosa, javanica, comosa, tomentola, bituminola, numularia, labialis, striata, suaveolens, apios, frutescens, monophylla. Cape, East and West Indies, North America.\n\n869. Clitoria.\n\nFive species; viz. ternatea, brasiliaca, virginiana, mariana, galacta. East and West Indies, America.\n\n870. Pisum, or Pea.\n\nFour species; viz. sativum, arvense, * maritimum, ochrus. Europe, North America.\n\n* P. leaf-stalks flattish above; stem angular; stipule arrow-shaped; fruit-stalks many flowered.\u2014In 1555, during a time of great scarcity, the people about Oxford in Suffolk were preserved from perishing by eating the seeds of this plant which grew there in great abundance upon the sea coast. Cows, horses, sheep and goats eat it.\n\n871. Orobus, or Bitter Vetch.\n\n12 species; viz. lathyroides, hirsutus, luteus, verhus, * tuberosus, * sylvaticus, angulifolius, albus, caucensis, niger, pyrenaicus, sylvaticus. Europe.\n\n* O. leaves winged, spear-shaped; stipula half-arrow-tuberosus, shaped, very entire; stem simple.\u2014The roots, when boiled, are savoury and nutritious; ground to powder they may be made into bread. They are held in high esteem by the Highlanders of Scotland, who chew them as our people do tobacco, and find that they prevent the uneasy sensation of hunger. They imagine that they promote expectoration, and are very efficacious in curing disorders of the lungs. They know how to prepare an intoxicating liquor from them. Horses, cows, goats, and sheep eat it.\n\nLathyrus, or Chickling Vetch.\n\n21 species; viz. * apiaca, * nilotica, amphicarpos, cicer, sativus, inconspicuous, fetifolius, angulatus, articulatus, odoratus, annus, tingitanus, clymenum, * hirsutus, tuberosus, * pratensis, * fylvestris, * latifolius, heterophyllus, * palustris, piliformis. Barbaray, Ceylon.\n\n* L. tendrils with two leaves, quite simple; leaflets pratensis, spear-shaped.\u2014This has been recommended as a new plant for the experiments of the farmers, and premiums have been offered for its cultivation. But it does not seem to be a plant at all agreeable to cattle, as where they have a choice of food they seldom touch it. Besides it produces very few seeds, and those are for the most part devoured by a species of curculio.\n\n873. Vicia, or Veich, Bean, Tare.\n\n20 species; viz. piliformis, dumetorum, * sylvatica, callicarpa, * crassa, gerardi, onobrychoides, nilfoliana, bicnisis, benghalensis, * sativa, * lathyroides, * lutea, * hybrida, peregrina, * sepium, * bithynica, narbonensis, faba, ferratfolia. Europe, Egypt, India.\n\n* V. legemens mostly in pairs, upright; leaflets inverse-sativaly spear-shaped, blunt, notched; stipulae toothed; seeds compressed.\u2014In Gloucestershire and Worcestershire, they sow it as pasture for horses, and eat it off early enough to allow of turnips being sown the same year.\u2014The seeds are excellent food for pigeons. Horses, cows, sheep, and goats, eat it.\n\n* V. legemens mostly four together, upright; leaflets sepium, egg-shaped, very entire, the outer ones gradually smaller.\u2014This plant shoots earlier in spring than any plant eaten by cattle, vegetates late in the autumn, and continues green all winter; but it is difficult to collect the seeds, as the pods burst and scatter them about, and moreover, hardly a third part of them will vegetate, being made the nidus of an insect. A patch of them sown in drills in a garden was cut five times in the course of the second year, and produced at the rate of 24 tons per acre of green food, which when dry would weigh near 4\u00bd tons.\n\nThe seeds of the vicia faba, or common bean, are a strong glutinous food, sufficiently nutritious, but not easy of digestion, especially when growing old. A water distilled from the flowers has been celebrated as a cosmetic, and still retains its character among some female artists.\n\n874. Ervum, or Bitter Vetch.\n\nSix species; viz. lens, * tetrapermum, * hirsutum, foloniense, monanthos, ervilla. Europe, Asia.\n\n* E. fruit-stalks many flowered; seeds 2, globular.\u2014hirustum, Horfes, cows, goats, and sheep eat it. In wet seasons whole fields of corn have been overpowered and wholly destroyed by it.\n875. Cicer, or Chick-pea.\nOne species; viz., arietinum. S. Europe, Levant.\n\n1319. Liparia.\nFive species; viz., sphaerica, graminifolia, umbellata, villosa, sericea. C. of G. Hope.\n\n876.

Aschynomene, or Bale Sensitive plant.\nEight species; viz., grandiflora, arborica, coccinea, aspera, americana, indica, sesban, pumila. Egypt, E. and W. Indies.\n\n887. Hedysarum, or French Honeysuckle.\n67 species; viz., alhagi, bupleurifolium, linifolium, nummulariifolium, moniliferum, syracifolium, reniforme, fororium, vespertilionis, gangeticum, maculatum, latebrosum, vaginale, imbricatum, triquetrum, strobiliferum, diphyllum, pulchellum, spatium, lineatum, retrotexum, umbellatum, biarticulatum, heterocarpum, vilucidum, canadense, caneflora, marilandicum, fruticosa, viridiflorum, hirtum, junceum, violaceus, paniculatum, nudiflorum, repens, hamatum, triflorum, barbatum, lapopodioides, microphyllum, racemoflum, caudatum, tomentosum, sericeum, virgatum, pilosum, striatum, volubile, gyranus, argentatum, alpinum, obfcurum, coronarium, flexuosum, humile, spinosissimum, virginiicum, fruticosum, pumilum, *onobrychis, fixatile, caput galii, crista galli, trinitum, cornutum, incanum. S. Europe, E. and W. Indies, N. America.\n\n* H. leaves winged; legumens with one seed, prickly; onobrychis wings as long as the calyx; stem growing long.\u2014This plant is cultivated like clover for feeding cattle, and is particularly advantageous in dry hilly situations and chalky soils.\n\n889. Indigofera, or Indigo.\n23 species; viz., sericea, ovata, trifoliata, pfloraloides, procumbens, larmentola, denudata, mexicana, trita, filiformis, digitata, stricta, fruticosa, enneaphylla, pentaphylla, glabra, cytoides, hirta, angustiflora, anil, tinctoria, difformis, argentea. Arabia, E. and W. Indies, Cape, Carolina.\n\n890. Galega, or Goats-rue.\n12 species; viz., officinalis, cinerea, littoralis, virginiana, villosa, spinosa, maxima, purpurea, caribea, corulea, tinctoria, fenicola. S. Europe, E. and W. Indies, America.\n\nThe galega officinalis was celebrated as an alexipharmac; but its sensible qualities discover no foundation for any virtues of this kind; the taste is merely leguminous, and in Italy, where it grows wild, it is said to be used as food.\n\n891. Phaca, or Bale Milk-vetch.\nTen species; viz., botica, alpina, falluta, fibrira, australis, trifoliata, veicaria, prostrata, microphylla, muricata. Lapland, Siberia, S. Europe.\n\n892. Astragalus, or Liquorice, or Milk-vetch.\n45 species; viz., alopecuroides, chilensis, capitatus, pilosus, fulvatus, galegiflorus, chinensis, onobrychis, uliginosus, carolinianus, asper, canadensis, cicer, microphyllus, *glycyphyllos, hamulos, contortuplicatus, beticus, laxmanni, stella, lefameus, austriacus, leontinus, pentaglottis, epiglottis, *hypoglottis, syriacus, arenarius, glaux, finicus, alpinus, amodytes, trimeltris, verticillatus, montanus, vesicarius, phyodes, caprinus, *uralensis, nonpeffulans, incanus, campelris, deprellus, uncatus, excapans.

Europe, India, Africa, North America.\n\nT. capsules in bunches, often 2-seeded, wrinkled, officinalis acute; stem upright.\u2014This plant is more fragrant when\nwhen dry than when green. A water distilled from the flowers, possesses but little odour in itself, but improves the flavour of other substances. Horses are extremely fond of it. Cows, goats, sheep, and swine eat it.\n\n* T. heads like umbels; legumens 4-feeded; stem creeping.\u2014Horses, cows, and goats eat it. Sheep are not fond of it. Swine refuse it. The leaves stand upright against rain. Wherever this plant abounds spontaneously, it is considered as an indication of the goodness of the soil, and this is a thing well known to farmers. The richness of meadows and pastures is naturally owing to their abounding principally with the trefoils, and others of the same class, with a due mixture of the more acceptable grasses.\n\n* T. spikes crowded; florets unequal; calyx with four of the teeth equal; stipule awned; stems ascending.\u2014In a great scarcity of provisions, bread has been made of the flowers. The heads are used in Sweden to dye woollen green. With alum they give a light, with copperas a dark green.\n\n897. Lotus, or Bird's-foot Trefoil.\n\n18 species; viz. maritimus, filiguoos, tetragonolobus, conjugatus, tetraphyllus, edulis, peregrinus, angustiflorus, arabicus, ornithopodoides, jacobaeus, creticus, hirtus, grecus, rectus, corniculatus, cytoides, dorycnium. Europe, Arabia, Madeira.\n\n* L. heads of the flowers flatted at the top; stems herbaceous, trailing; legumens cylindrical, expanding.\u2014The flowers of this plant become greenish when dried, in which respect they resemble the flowers of the plants which produce indigo. Cows, goats, and horses eat it. Sheep and swine are not fond of it. In Hertfordshire it is cultivated as pasturage for sheep. There is no doubt but it might be cultivated to great advantage. In moist meadows it grows to a great height, and makes extremely good hay.\n\n898. Trigonella, or Fenugreek.\n\n12 species; viz. ruthenica, platycarpus, striata, polycerata, hamata, spinosa, corniculata, monspeliaca, laevis, fenum graecum, sylvestris, indica, Siberia, S. Europe, Egypt, India.\n\nThe trigonella fenum graecum is cultivated chiefly in the southern parts of France, Germany, and Italy; from whence the seeds are brought to us. They are of a yellow colour, rhomboidal figure, a disagreeable strong smell, and a mucilaginous taste. Their principal use is in cataplasm, fomentations, and the like, and in emollient glysters.\n\n899. Medicago, or Medick, Moon-trefoil.\n\n24 species; viz. arborea, virginica, radiata, circinata, *fativa, *falcata, *lupulina, marina, polymorpha, proflora, orbicularis, feutellata, tornata, turbinate, intertexta, *arabica, coronata, ciliaris, hirtula, rigida, *minima, *muricata, nigra, laciniata. Europe, North America.\n\n* M. flowers in bunches; legumens narrow, regular, *fativa, twisted; stem upright, smooth.\u2014Modern writers upon husbandry strongly recommend the cultivation of this plant, for the purpose of feeding cattle; but it is not yet generally adopted.\n\n* M. flowers in bunches; legumens crescent-shaped; *falcata, stem prolate.\u2014In hot, dry, barren sandy places it is well worth the trouble of sowing for the purpose of making hay; a practice long since adopted in some parts of Sweden. Cows, horses, goats, and sheep eat it.\n\n* M. spikes oval; seed-vessels kidney-shaped, with 1 lupulina cell and 1 seed; stems trailing.\u2014Cows, horses, goats, and sheep eat it; but it is less grateful to them than the other species. It is cultivated in Norfolk under the name of nonluch, and is usually sown mixed with rye-grass. The crop is then called black and white nonluch. It has been sown in the Isle of Wight. It is sometimes sown along with clover, and rye grass.\n\nIn the class Diadelphia are\n\n56 Genera, including 710 Species, of which 59 are found in Britain.","sp":242,"ep":255},{"h":"CLASSIS XVIII","t":"POLYADELPHIA (H).\n\nORDO I.

Europe, Cape, Asia, W. Indies.\n* O. lip of the nectary 4-lobed, finely floccoloped; horn blunt; upper petals turned back.\u2014This species is called satyrion, or early orchis. It is frequent in shady places and moist meadows. Each plant has two oval roots of a whitish colour, a vicid sweetish taste, and a faint unpleasant smell. They abound with a glutinous slimy juice. With regard to their virtues, like other mucilaginous vegetables, they defend the solids against acrimonious humours: they have also been celebrated, though on no good foundation, for analeptic and aphrodisiac virtues, and frequently made use of with these intentions. Salep, a celebrated reftorativo among the Turks, is the prepared root of plants of this genus. It has been successfully imitated by means of the roots of this species. Mr Moulton, in a letter to Dr Percival, describes his method of making salep. He observes, that the best time to gather the roots, is when the seed is formed and the stalk going to fall; for then the new bulb, of which salep is made, is arrived at its full size. The new roots being separated from the stalk, are to be washed in water, and the outer thin skin taken off. They are then to be set on a tin-plate in an oven, heated to the degree of a bread oven. In six, eight, or ten minutes, they will have acquired a transparency like horn, without being diminished in size. They are then to be removed into another room to dry and harden, which will be done in a few days; or they may be finished in a very slow heat in a few hours. Salep, thus prepared, may be sold for less than a shilling a pound, and affords a mild nutriment, which in times of scarcity, in cases of dysentery and strangury, and on shipboard, may be extremely useful. The salep, hitherto imported from Turkey, may thus be prepared at home. The plants must be propagated by the roots, as the seeds seldom come to perfection.\n\n1010.

S. Europe, E. Indies, America.\n* A. leaves halberd-shaped, very entire; spikestalk maculatum club-shaped.\u2014This root grows wild under hedges, and by the sides of banks in moist parts of England. It sends forth in March three or four triangular leaves, which are followed by a naked stalk, bearing a pur- plish pistil, enclosed in a long sheath: this is succeeded in July by a bunch of reddish berries. In some plants the leaves are spotted with black, in others with white spots, and in others not spotted at all: the black spot- ted fort is supposed to be the most efficacious in medi- cine. All the parts of the arum maculatum, particu- larly the root, have an extremely pungent acrimonious taste; if the root be but slightly chewed, it continues to burn the tongue for some hours, occasioning at the same time a considerable thirst: these symptoms are al- leviated by butter milk and oily liquors. Dried and kept some time, it loses much of its acrimony, and be- comes at length an almost insipid farinaceous substance. The root is a powerful stimulant and attenuant. It is reckoned a medicine of great efficacy in some cachectic and chlorotic cases, in weakness of the stomach occa- sioned by a load of phlegm. Great benefit is said to have\nhave been obtained from it in deeply seated rheumatic pains. In these cases, it may be given from 10 grains to a scruple of the fresh root, twice or thrice a day, made into a bolus or emulsion, with unctuous or mucilaginous substances, which cover its pungency, and prevent its making any painful impression on the tongue. Neither wine nor spirits extract its virtues. The root, dried and powdered, is used by the French to wash the skin, and is sold at a high price under the name of cypr\u00e8s powder. It is undoubtedly a good and an innocent cosmetic. Starch may be made from the roots.\n\n1029.

West Indies.\n\n813.\n813. Cassia, or Wild Senna.\n\n59 species; viz., diphylla, abus, vimeae, bacillaris, tagra, tora, bicipularis, emarginata, obtusifolia, senooides, acuminata, corymbosa, longiflora, falcata, servicea, occidentalis, planiflora, patula, lineata, atamaria, pilota, arborecens, fenna, ruficollis, biflora, chinensis, multiglandulosa, hirsuta, tomentosa, serpens, mexicana, angustiflora, ligustrina, florida, stipulacea, alata, marilandica, faligata, frondosa, tenuiflora, virgata, sophera, bracteata, auriculata, breviflora, mollis, javanica, grandis, nigricans, polyphylla, characrita, glandulosa, mimoseoides, microphylla, flexuosa, capensis, fistula, nigritans, procumbens. Egypt, E. and W. Indies, America.\n\nThe fruit of the *cassia fistula* is a cylindrical pod, scarcely an inch in diameter; a foot or more in length. The outside is a hard brown bark; the inside is divided by thin transverse woody plates, covered with a soft black pulp, of a sweetish taste, with some degree of acrimony. There are two sorts of this drug in the shops; one brought from the East Indies, the other from the West: the canes or pods of the latter are generally large, rough, thick-rinded, and the pulp nauseous; those of the former are less, smoother, the pulp blacker, and of a sweeter taste; this sort is preferred to the other. Such pods should be chosen as are weighty, new, and do not make a rattling noise (from the seeds being loose within them) when shaken. The pulp should be of a bright shining black colour, and a sweet taste, not harsh, which happens from the fruit being gathered before it has grown fully ripe, or fourfold, which it is apt to turn upon keeping. It should neither be very dry nor very moist, nor at all mouldy, which from its being kept in damp cellars, or moistened, in order to increase its weight, it is very subject to be. Greatest part of the pulp dissolves both in water and in rectified spirit, and may be extracted from the cane by either. The shops employ water, boiling the bruised pod therein, and afterwards evaporating the solution to a due consistence.\n\nThe pulp of *cassia* is a gentle laxative medicine, and frequently given, in a dose of some drams, in costive habits. Some direct a dose of two ounces or more as a cathartic, in inflammatory cases, where the more acid purgatives have no place; but in these large quantities it generally nauseates the stomach, produces flatulencies, and sometimes gripings of the bowels, especially if the *cassia* be not of a very good kind: these effects may be prevented by the addition of aromatics, and exhibiting it in a liquid form. Some say it does excellent service in the painful tension of the belly, which sometimes follows the imprudent use of antimonials; and that it may be advantageously accuated with the more acid purgatives or antimonial emetics, or employed to abate their force. Vallisnieri relates, that the purgative virtue of this medicine is remarkably promoted by manna; that a mixture of four drams of *cassia*, and two of manna, purges as much as 12 drams of *cassia*, or 32 of manna alone. Sennertus observes, that the urine is apt to be turned of a green colour, by the use of *cassia*, and sometimes, where a large quantity has been taken, blackish. This drug gives name to an officinal electuary, and is an ingredient also in another.\n\n814. Cubea.\n\nTwo species; viz., paniculata, trigona, Guiana.\n\n815. Caesalpinia, or Brafileitto.\n\nNine species; bijuga, pulcherrima, elata, coriaria, brafiletensis, echinata, leppan, crista, mimosoides. E. and W. Indies.\n\n816. Guilandina, or Bonduc, or Nickar Tree.\n\nFive species; viz., bonduc, bonducella, nugla, paniculata, axillaris. E. and W. Indies.\n\n817. Hyperanthera, or Nephritic-wood.\n\nFour species; viz., decandra, moringa, femidecandra, cochinchinensis. Egypt, Ceylon, N. America.\n\n818. Schotia.\n\nOne species; viz., speciosa. C. of G. Hope.\n\n819. Guaiacum, or Lignum-vitae, Pockwood.\n\nThree species; viz., dubium, officinale, sanctum. Africa, China, W. Indies.\n\nThe wood of the *guaiacum officinale* is very ponderous, of a close compact texture; the outer part is of a yellow colour, the heart of a deep blackish green, or variegated with black, green, pale, and brown colours; the bark is thin, smooth, externally of a dark greyish hue; both have a lightly aromatic, bitterish, pungent taste; which exudes from incisions made in the trunk of the tree, is brought to us in irregular masses, usually friable, of a dusty greenish, and sometimes of a reddish cast, with pieces of the wood among them; its taste is more acid and pungent than that of the wood or bark.\n\nTheir general virtues are those of a warm stimulating medicine: they strengthen the stomach and other viscera; and remarkably promote the urinary and cuticular discharge. Hence, in cutaneous defecations, and other disorders, proceeding from obstructions of the excretory glands, and where sluggish ferous humours abound, they are eminently useful; rheumatic and other pains have often been relieved by them. They are also laxative. The resin is the most active of these drugs; and the efficacy of the others depends upon the quantity of this part contained in them. The resin is extracted from the wood in part by watery liquors, but much more effectually by spirituous ones. The watery extract of this wood kept in the shops, proves not only less in quantity, but considerably weaker, than one made with spirit. This last extract is of the same quality with the native resin, and differs from that brought to us only in being purer. The gum or extracts, are given from a few grains to a scruple or half a dram; which last dose proves, for the most part, considerably purgative. The official preparations of guaiacum are, an extract of the wood, a solution of the gum in rectified spirit of wine, and a solution in volatile spirit, and an empyreumatic oil distilled from the wood.\n\nGuaiac, in form of decoction, has been said to cure the venereal disease; and in this country it is frequently used as an adjuvant to mercury. The resin, dissolved in rum, or combined with water by means of mucilage or the yolk of eggs, or in the form of the volatile tincture or elixir, is much employed in gout and chronic rheumatism. The tincture or elixir has been\nbeen given to the extent of half an ounce twice a-day, and is sometimes usefully combined with laudanum.\n\n820. Cynometra.\nTwo species; viz. cauliflora, ramiflora.\n\n821. Crudia.\nTwo species; viz. spicata, aromatica. Guiana.\n\n822. Panzera.\nOne species; viz. falcata. Carolina.\n\n823. Codon.\nOne species; viz. royenii. C. of G. Hope.\n\n824. Dictamnus, or Fraxinella, White Dittany.\nOne species; viz. albus. Germany, France, Italy.\nThe dictamnus albus grows wild in the mountainous parts of France, Italy, and Germany. From thence the cortical part of the root, in a dry state, rolled up in little quills, is sometimes brought to us. It is of a white colour, of a weak, not very agreeable smell, and of a durable bitter, slightly pungent taste. It has been recommended as an alexipharmacal, a tonic, and an anthelmintic; but it is very seldom used, and has no place in the London Pharmacopoeia.\n\n825. Nicandra.\nOne species; viz. amara. Guiana.\n\n826. Petaloma.\nTwo species; viz. myrtilloides, muriri. West Indies, Guiana.\n\n827. Ruta, or Rue.\nSeven species; viz. graveolens, montana, chalepensis, pinnata, patavina, linifolia, fruticulosa. S. Europe, Africa.\n\nThe ruta graveolens is a small shrubby plant met with in gardens, where it flowers in June, and holds its green leaves all the winter. We frequently find in the markets a narrow-leaved sort, which is cultivated by some, in preference to the other, on account of its leaves appearing variegated during the winter with white streaks.\n\nRue has a strong ungrateful smell, and a bitterish penetrating taste. The leaves, when in full vigour, are extremely acid, in so much as to inflame and blister the skin if much handled. With regard to their medicinal virtues, they are powerfully stimulating, attenuating, and detergent. And hence, in cold phlegmatic habits, they quicken the circulation, dissolve tenacious juices, open obstructions of the excretory glands, and promote the fluid secretions. The writers on the materia medica, in general, have entertained a very high opinion of the virtues of this plant. Boerhaave is full of its praises; particularly of the distilled oil and the distilled water, cohobated or re-distilled several times from fresh parcels of the herb: after somewhat extravagantly commending other waters prepared in this manner, he adds, with regard to that of rue, that the greatest commendations he can bestow upon it fall short of its merit. \"What medicine (says he) can be more efficacious for promoting sweat and perspiration, for the cure of the hysteric passion and of epilepsies, and for expelling poison.\" Whatever service rue may be of in the two last cases, it undoubtedly has its use in the others: the cohobated water, however, is not the most efficacious preparation of it. An extract, made by rectified spirit, contains, in a small compass, the whole virtues of the rue; this menstruum taking up by infusion all the pungency and flavour of the plant, and elevating nothing in distillation. With water its peculiar flavour and warmth arise; the bitterness, and a considerable share of the pungency, remaining behind.\n\nThe only officinal preparation of rue now retained in our pharmacopoeias is the extract; but it is an ingredient in the compound powder of myrrh and some other compositions.\n\n828. Tolufera, or Balsam of Tolu tree.\nOne species; viz. balsamum. Carthagena.\n\nThe tolufera balsamum flows from a tree growing in Tolu in the Spanish West Indies; from whence the balsam is brought to us in little gourd shells. It is of a yellowish brown colour inclining to red; in consistence thick and tenacious: by age it grows hard and brittle, without suffering any great loss of its more valuable parts. The smell of this balsam is extremely fragrant, somewhat resembling that of lemons; its taste warm and sweetish, with little of the pungency, and nothing of the nauseous relish, which accompany the other balsams. It has the same general virtues with the balsamum rahafiri, but is much milder; and for some purposes, particularly as a corroborant in gleet and seminal weaknesses, is supposed to be more efficacious.\n\n829. Myroxylon, or Balsam of Peru.\nThree species; viz. periferium, pedicellatum, frutescens. Mexico, Peru.\n\nThe myroxylon periferium, as brought to us, is nearly of the consistence of thin honey, of a reddish brown colour, inclining to black, an agreeable aromatic smell, and a very hot biting taste. Distilled with water, it yields a small quantity of a fragrant essential oil of a reddish colour; and in a strong fire, without addition, a yellowish red oil.\n\nBalsam of Peru is a very warm aromatic medicine, considerably hotter and more acid than copaiba. Its principal effects are to warm the habit, to strengthen the nervous system, and attenuate viscid humours. Hence its use in some kinds of asthmas, gonorrhoeas, dysenteries, suppressions of the uterine discharges, and other disorders proceeding from a debility of the solids, or a sluggishness or inactivity of the juices. It is also employed externally for cleansing and healing wounds and ulcers, and sometimes against palsies and rheumatic pains.\n\nThis balsam does not unite with water, milk, expressed oils, animal fats or wax; it may be mingled in the cold with this last, and likewise with the sebaceous substance called expressed oil of mece; but if the mixture be afterwards liquefied by heat, the balsam separates and falls to the bottom. It may be mixed with water into the form of an emulsion, after the same manner as the balsam of Copaiba. Alkaline lixivia dissolve great part of it; and rectified spirit the whole.\n\nIt is an ingredient in several officinal compositions, in some of which it has rather a bad than a good effect.\n\nThere is another sort of balsam of Peru of a white colour, and considerably more fragrant than the former. This is very rarely brought to us. It is said to be the produce of the same plant which yields the common or black balsam, and to exude from incisions made\nmale in the trunk; while the former is alleged to be obtained by boiling. Besides the white, there is also a third kind, commonly called the red or dry. This is supposed to obtain a different state from the white, merely in consequence of the treatment to which it is subjected, after it is got from the tree. In its fragrance it in some degree approaches to the balsam of Gilead, held in so high esteem among the eastern nations; but it is very rarely in use in Britain, and almost never to be met with in our shops.\n\n830. HEMATOXYLON, or Logwood.\n\nOne species; viz. campechianum. Campeachy, S. America.\u2014This species is brought chiefly from Campeachy in the bay of Honduras. It is usually in large logs, very compact and hard, of a red colour, and an alluring sweet taste. It has been for a long time used by the dyers, but not till very lately as a medicine; a decoction of it, and the extract, are in use in our hospitals, and said to have proved very serviceable in diarrhoea. It frequently tinged the stools, and sometimes the urine. The extract is now received into the shops, and it is found to be a very useful alluring.\n\n831. PROSOPIS.\n\nOne species; viz. ficigera.

North America.\n\n865. Ledum, or Marsh Cistus.\nThree species; viz. palustre, latifolium, buxifolium. North Europe, North America.\n\n866. Rhodora.\nOne species; canadensis. North America.\n\n867. Rhododendron, or Dwarf Rose-bay.\n10 species; viz. ferrugineum, dauricum, cantabricum, hirsutum, chamaecytis, caucasicum, chrysanthum, ponticum, maximum, punctatum. Siberia, Alps, Gibraltar, Levant, North America.\n\nThe rhododendron chrysanthum is a native plant of Siberia, where a weak infusion of it is used as tea. The Siberians use a kind of decoction of it in rheumatism and gout. They put about two drams of the dried shrub in an earthen pot with about ten ounces of boiling water, keeping it near a boiling heat for a night, and this they take in the morning. It is said to occasion heat, thirst, a degree of delirium, and a peculiar creeping-like sensation in the parts affected. The use of liquids is not allowed during its operation, as this is apt to induce vomiting. In a few hours the pain and disagreeable symptoms are relieved; and it is said, two or three doses generally complete the cure. The powder has also been used in doses of a few grains.\n\nHitherto it has been little employed in Britain, that it has no place in the London Pharmacopoeia; but in some cases, in which it has been used at Edinburgh, it has been productive of good effects; and accordingly it is now introduced into the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia, as well as into the Pharmacopoeia Roffica, where it had first a place.\n\n868. Andromeda, or Bole Heath.\n26 species; viz. tetragona, ericoides, hypnoides, lycopodioides, empetrifolia, myrfinites, mariana, ferruginea, saliciflora, jamaicensis, octandra, pulverulenta, * poliflora, falliciflora, buxifolia, japonica, paniculata, arbores, racemosa, cataphaei, axillaris, coriacea, acuminata, rupestris, anaclomans, calyculata. North Europe, America, Cape, Jamaica.\n\n869. Epigaea, or Trailing Arbutus.\nTwo species; viz. repens, cordifolia. Virginia, Canada, Gaul.\n\n870. Gaultheria.\nTwo species; viz. procumbens, antipoda.\n\n871. Arbutus, or Strawberry Tree.\n10 species; viz. * unedo, lauriflora, andrachne, ferruginea, academica, * alpina, * uva urfi, mucronata, microphylla, pumila. Europe, North America, Terra del Fuego.\n\n* A. stem tree-like; leaves smooth, bluntly serrated; panicle terminating; berries with many seeds.\u2014It is a beautiful ornament to our shrubberies, not only on account of its foliage and flowers, but of its fruit, which is pleasing to the eye, though not grateful to the taste. The country people, however, in Ireland eat it, but always drink water after.\n\n* A. stems trailing; leaves wrinkled, somewhat serrated, and fringed with hairs.\u2014The berries have something of the flavour of black currants, but they are not so good. Goats refuse it.\n\n* A. stems trailing; leaves oblong egg-shaped, very entire, veined like net-work underneath.\u2014The berries of this plant are infundibular, pulpy, and mealy. The plant is much used in Sweden, to dye an ash colour, and to tan leather. Half a dram of the powdered leaves, given every, or every other day, has been found useful in calculous cases. It was first used for this purpose at Montpelier, and afterwards by Dr. De Haen at Vienna, who relates several cases, in which it proved of the greatest service. Its success in England has been uncertain. Sometimes the patients found no relief, but thought their complaints rather aggravated than alleviated; while, in other calculous and nephritic cases, the symptoms have been almost entirely removed. Perhaps, upon the whole, we shall find it no better than other vegetable astringents; some of which have been long used by the country people in gravelly complaints, and with very great advantage, though hitherto unnoticed by the regular practitioners. Horses, cows, goats, and sheep, refuse it.\n\n872. Clethra.\nFour species; viz. alifolia, paniculata, arborea, tinifolia. N. America, Jam. Madeira.\n\n873. Pyrola, or Winter-green.\nSix species; viz. * rotundifolia, * minor, * secunda, umbellata, maculata, * uniflora. N. Europe, Asia, America.\n\n874. Styrax, or storax tree.\nFour species; viz. officinale, grandiflorum, benzoin, levigatum. Italy, Levant, S. Carolina.\n\nThe styrax officinale is an odoriferous resinous substance, exuding from a tree growing in the warmer climates.\n\nIt has been customary to distinguish three sorts of storax, though only one is usually met with in the shops.\n\n1. Styrax calamita, or storax in the cane; so called from its having been formerly brought inclosed in reeds from Pamphylia. It is either in small distinct tears, of a whitish or reddish colour, or in larger masses composed of such.\n\n2. Storax in the lump, or red storax. This is in masses of a uniform texture, and yellowish red or brownish colour; though sometimes, likewise, interspersed with a few whitish grains. Of this sort, there has been some lately to be met with in the shops, under the name of storax in the tear.\n\n3. The common storax of the shops, is in large masses, considerably lighter and less compact than the foregoing; it appears upon examination, to be composed of a resinous juice, mixed with saw-dust. For what purpose this addition is made, it is difficult to say; but it can scarcely be supposed to be done with any fraudulent view, since the saw-dust appears at sight. This common storax is much less esteemed than the two first sorts; though, when freed from the woody matter, it proves superior in point of fragrance to either of them.\nRectified spirit, the common menstruum of resins, dissolves the storax, leaving the wood behind; nor does this tincture lose considerably of its valuable parts, in being insipidated to a solid confection; whilst aqueous liquors elevate almost all the fragrancy of the storax.\n\nStorax is one of the most agreeable of the odoriferous resins, and may be exhibited to great advantage in languors, and debilities of the nervous system; it is not, however, much used in common practice.\n\n875. INOCARPUS.\nOne species; viz. edulis. Otaheite.\n\n876. SAMYDA.\nNine species; viz. nitida, macrophylla, multiflora, villosa, glabrata, spinifex, pubescens, ferrulata, polyandra. West Indies, S. America.\n\n877. CASEARIA.\n12 species; viz. spinosa, nitida, ramiflora, hirta, parviflora, parvifolia, fyllettris, macrophylla, ferrulata, elliptica, ovata, hirsuta. Jamaica, S. America.\n\n878. AQUILARIA.\nOne species; viz. ovata. West Indies.\n\n879. AUGEA.\nOne species; viz. capensis.\n\n880. COPAIERA, or Balsam of Capivi tree.\nOne species; viz. officinalis. Brazil, Antilles.\nThe tree which produces this balsam, is a native of the Spanish West India islands, and of some parts of the continent of South America. It grows to a large size, and the balsamum copaiva flows, under the form of a resinous juice, from incisions made in the trunk.\n\nThe juice is clear and transparent, of a whitish or pale yellowish colour, an agreeable smell, and a bitterish pungent taste. It is usually about the consistence of oil, or a little thicker; when long kept, it becomes nearly as thick as honey, retaining its clearness; but has not been observed to grow dry or solid, as most of the other resinous juices do. We sometimes meet with a thick sort of balsam of copaiva, which is not at all transparent, or much less so than the foregoing, and generally has a portion of turbid watery liquor at the bottom. This sort is probably either adulterated by the mixture of other substances, or has been extracted by coction from the bark and branches of the tree; its smell and taste are much less pleasant than those of the genuine balsam.\n\nPure balsam of copaiva dissolves entirely in rectified spirit, especially if the menstruum be previously alkalized; the solution has a very fragrant smell. Diluted with water, it yields a large quantity of a limpid essential oil, and in a strong heat, without addition, a blue oil.\n\nThe balsam of copaiva is a useful corroborating detergent medicine, accompanied with a degree of irritation. It strengthens the nervous system, tends to loosen the belly; in large doses proves purgative, promotes urine, and cleanses and heals excretions in the urinary passages, which it is supposed to perform more effectually than any of the other balsams. Fuller observes, that it gives the urine an intensely bitter taste, but not a violet smell, as the turpentine does.\n\nThis balsam has been principally celebrated in gleets and the fluor albus, and externally as a vulnerary.\n\nThe author above-mentioned recommends it likewise in dysenteries, in scorbutic cachexies, in distaste of the breath and lungs, and in an acrimonious or putrefactive state of the juices; he says, he has known very dangerous coughs, which manifestly threatened a consumption, cured by the use of this balsam alone; and, that notwithstanding its being hot and bitter, it has good effects, even in hectic cases. Most physicians seem now, however, to consider balsams and resins too stimulant to be ventured on in phthisical affections.\n\nThe dose of this medicine rarely exceeds 20 or 30 drops, though some direct sixty, or more. It may be conveniently taken in the form of an eloeoaccharum, or in that of an emulsion, into which it may be reduced by triturating it with almonds, or rather with a thick mucilage of gum arabic, till they are well incorporated, and then gradually adding a proper quantity of water.\n\n881. BUCIDA.\nTwo species; viz. buceras, capitata. Jamaica.\n\nORDER II. DIGYNIA.\n\n882. ROYENA, or African Bladder nut.\nSeven species; viz. lucida, villosa, pallens, glabra, hirsuta, polyandra, angustifolia. C. of G. Hope.\n\n883. HYDRANGEA.\nFour species; viz. arborecens, hortensis, radiata, quercifolia. Virginia, Carolina.\n\n884. CUNONIA.\nOne species; viz. capensis. C. of G. Hope.\n\n885. TRIANTHEMA, or Horse Purslane.\nSeven species; viz. monogyna, crytallina, pentandra, fruticola, humifusa, anceps, decandra. Egypt, India, Jamaica.\n\n886. CHRYSOSPLENIUM, or Golden Saxifrage.\nTwo species; viz. * alternifolium, * oppositifolium. N. Europe, Canada.\n\n887. SAXIFRAGA, or Saxifrage.\n49 species; viz. cotyledon, aizoon, mutata, pennsylvanica, hieracifolia, androsacea, caelia, burseriana, feoides, tenella, bryoides, bronchealis, * stellaris, cratilfolia, * nivalis, bellardi, davurica, fermentofa, punctata, * umbrofa, hirsuta, cuneifolia, geum, * oppositifolia, * acerfa, * hirculus, * aizoides, autumnalis, rostrifolia, * granulata, bulbifera, * cernua, rivularis, geranioides, ajugifolia, fibricra, rupestris, * tridactylites, petraea, adicendens, * mochata, mucoides, cuspidata, tricupidata, cymbalaria, hederacea, orientalis, cuneata, * hypnoides.\n\n888. TIARELLA, or American Saxifrage.\nTwo species; viz. cordifolia, trifoliata. North of Asia and America.\n\n889. MITELLA, or Bafe American Saxifrage.\nThree species; viz. diphylla, cordifolia, nuda. N. of Asia, America.\n\n890. SCLEERANTHUS, or Knawel, German Knot-grass.\nThree species; viz. * annus, * perennis, * polycarpus. Europe.\n\n* S. calyx, segments thornless, tapering to a point; annus, open when the fruit is ripe.\u2014The Swedes and Germans\nare said to receive the vapour arising from a decoction of it into their mouths to cure the toothache. Goats and sheep eat it; cows refuse it.\n\nperennis. * S. cal. segments blunt, closed when the fruit is ripe.\n\n\u2014The Polish cochineal (coccus polonicus) is found upon the roots in the summer months.\n\n891. Gypsophila.\n\n13 species; viz. repens, prostrata, paniculata, viscosa, adscendens, alutacea, arenaria, struthium, fauligata, perfoliata, muralis, rigida, saxifraga. Europe.\n\n892. Saponaria, or Soap-wort.\n\nNine species; viz. officinalis, vaccaria, cretica, porrigens, illyrica, ocyrnoides, orientalis, lutea, bellidifolia. Europe.\n\nThe saponaria officinalis grows wild, though not very common, in low wet places, and by the sides of running waters; a double-flowered sort is frequent in our gardens. The leaves have a bitter not agreeable taste; agitated with water, they raise a foamy froth, which is said to have nearly the same effects with solutions of soap itself in taking out spots from clothes and the like. The roots taste sweetish, and somewhat pungent, and have a light smell like those of liquorice; digested in rectified spirit, they yield a strong tincture, which loses nothing of its taste or flavour in being infused to the confluence of an extract. This elegant root has not come much into practice among us, though it promises from its sensible qualities to be a medicine of considerable utility. It is much esteemed by the German physicians as an aperient, corroboration, and sudorific, and preferred by the college of W\u00fcrtemberg, by Stahl, Neumann and others, to taraparilla.\n\n893. Dianthus, or Pink, Carnation.\n\n32 species; viz. barbatus, carthusianorum, atrorubens, ferrugineus, armeria, japonicus, prolifer, diminutus, caryophyllus, sylvestris, pomeridianus, deltoides, albus, crenatus, chinensis, nonfilaceus, libanotis, plumarius, crinitus, superbus, attenuatus, purgens, virgineus, arenarius, repens, caesius, cespitosus, scaber, alpinus, pumilus, arboreus, juniperinus. Europe, Cape, China, America.\n\nOf the species called caryophyllus, or clove julyflower, a great variety is met with in our gardens; those made use of in medicine ought to be of a deep crimson colour and a pleasant aromatic smell, somewhat like that of cloves; many sorts have scarce any smell at all. The caryophylla rubra are said to be cardiac and alexipharmac. Simon Pauli relates that he has cured many malignant fevers by the use of a decoction of them, which he says powerfully promotes sweat and urine, without greatly irritating nature, and also raises the spirits and quenches thirst. At present the flowers are chiefly valued for their pleasant flavour, which is entirely lost even by light coction; hence the college direct the syrup, which is the only official preparation of them, to be made by infusion.\n\nOrdo III. TRIGYNYIA.\n\n894. Cucubalus, or Berry-bearing Chickweed.\n\n18 species; viz. behen, fabarius, villosus, stellatus, egyptiacus, italicus, multiflorus, fruticulosus, tartaricus, ibiricus, catholicus, mollissimus, oites, parviflorus, reflexus, saxifragus, spergulifolius, polygonoides. Europe, Egypt, North America.\n\n* C. cal. nearly globular, smooth, with a net-work of behen veins; leaves egg-shaped, glaucous, smooth.\u2014The leaves boiled have something of the flavour of pease, and proved of great use to the inhabitants of the island of Minorca in the year 1685, when a swarm of locusts had destroyed the harvest. The Gothlanders apply the leaves to erysipelas eruptions.\n\n895. Silene, or Vicious Campion.\n\n56 species; viz. anglica, lusitanica, quinquevulnera, ciliata, fericea, nocturna, gallica, cratiboides, mutabilis, chlorantha, nutans, amena, paradoxa, fruticola, bupleurodes, longiflora, gigantea, cratibfolia, vividiflora, conoidea, conica, bellidiflora, dichotoma, vespertina, behen, stricta, pendula, baccifera, maritima, procumbens, noctiflora, ornata, undulata, virginica, antirrhina, sedoides, apetala, rubella, inaperta, clandellina, portensis, cretica, mucipula, polyphylla, armeria, orchidea, egyptiaca, cathebe, cordifolia, chlorefolia, alpestris, rupestris, saxifraga, vallesea, pulmila, acaulis. Europe, Persia, Africa, N. America.\n\n896. Stellaaria, or Greater Chickweed.\n\n17 species; viz. nemorum, dichotoma, radians, bulbofa, holofea, graminea, palustris, cratibfolia, albine, undulata, ceratiboides, multicaulis, humifusa, biflora, greenlandica, arenaria, scapigera.

Sib. France, Spain, Cape, East Indies.\n\n913. Sedum, or Leffer Houfeleek, Stonecrop.\n\n29 species; viz. verticillatum, * telephium, anacampferos, divaricatum, aizoon, hybridum, populifolium, stellatum, alpinefolium, cepaea, libanoticum, * daphyllum, * reflexum, virens, * rupestre, saxatile, quadrifidum, hifpanicum, lineare, coeruleum, * album, * acre, * fexangulare, * anglicum, annuum, pubescens, * villosum, atratum, nudum. Europe, Madeira, Japan.\n\n* S. leaves flatish, ferrated; corymbus leafy, stem upright.\u2014A decoction of the leaves in milk is a formidable diuretic. It has been given with success to cure the piles. Cows, goats, sheep, and swine, eat it. Horses refuse it.\n\n* S. leaves nearly egg-shaped, growing to and sitting, bulging, nearly upright, alternate; tuft with three divisions.\u2014This species of sedum is a small perennial, succulent, evergreen plant; growing in great abundance on the tops of walls and roofs of houses. It has a faint smell, and at first an herbaceous taste; but it afterwards shows considerable acrimony, exciting a sense of biting heat in the mouth and fauces. In its recent state it shows very active powers, proving emetic, purgative and diuretic. The expressed juice, taken to the quantity of a table spoonful, has been said to prove a very drastic medicine; but the plant in its dried state shows little or no activity. In this country it is hardly employed, and has no place in our pharmacopoeias. Its activity, however, points it out as a subject deserving attention. Goats eat it; cows, horses, sheep, and swine, refuse it.\n\n* S. leaves awl-shaped in five rows, crowded, loose at base; flowers in tufts.\u2014Both this and the S. reflexum are cultivated in Holland and Germany, to mix with lettuces in salads. It is acid to the taste.\n\n914. Penthorum.\n\nOne species; viz. fedoides. Virginia.\n\n915. Bergia.\n\nTwo species; viz. verticillata, glomerata. Cape of Good Hope.\n\n916. Suriana.\n\nOne species; viz. maritima. Jamaica.\n\n917. Grielum.\n\nOne species; viz. tenuifolium. Ethiopia.\n\n918. Oxalis, or Wood-sorrel.\n\n93 species; viz. monophylla, lepidia, rostrata, asimina, lancefolia, leporina, cripla, fabefolia, laburnifolia, sanguinea, ambigua, undulata, fusca, glandulosa, tricolor, rubro-flava, flaccida, exaltata, variabilis, grandiflora, sulphurea, purpurea, breviflora, speciosa, * acetofella, magellanica, marginata, pulchella, obtula, lanata, truncatula, strumula, punctata, luteola, macrogonya, fallax, tenella, minuta, pufilla, compressa, ferrea, megalocephala, tetraphylla, violacea, caprina, cernea, dentata, livida, ciliaris, arcuata, linearis, cuneata, cuneifolia, glabra, bifida, filicaulis, longiflora, nutans, convexula, vericulosa, elongata, reclinata, polyphylla, tenuiflora, macrophylla, hirta, tubiflora, secunda, multiflora, rubella, rosea, repens, reptatrix, dilatata, incarnata, conorhiza, crenata, lateriflora, dilenii, drifita, * corniculata, plumieri, pentantha, rhombifolia, rosea, barrelleri, burmanni, tomentosa, lupinifolia, pectinata, flabelliflora, flava, sensitiva. S. Europe, Cape, North America.\n\nO. stalk with one flower; leaves three together; acetofella, leaflets inversely heart-shaped, hairy.\u2014An infusion of the leaves is an agreeable liquor in ardent fevers, and boiled with milk they make an agreeable whey. Sheep, goats, and swine eat it. Cows are not fond of it. Horses refuse it. The juice is gratefully acid. The London college directs a conserve to be made of the leaves, beaten with thrice their weight of fine sugar. The expressed juice depurated, properly evaporated, and set in a cool place, affords a crystalline acid salt in considerable quantity, which may be used whenever vegetable acids are wanted. It is employed to take iron moulds out of linen, and is sold under the name of essential salt of lemons. We are lately assured that the leaves and stalks wrapped in a cabbage leaf, and macerated in warm ashes until reduced to a pulp, have been successfully applied to scrophulous ulcers. This poultice should remain on the sore for 24 hours, and be repeated four times. Afterwards the ulcer is to be dressed with a poultice made of the roots of the meadow-sweet bruised, and mixed up with the scum of four butter-milk.\n\n919. Agrostemma, or Rose Campion, Wild Lychnis.\n\nFour species; viz. * githago, coronaria, floe jovis, celo-rofa. Europe.\n\n920.

Scape naked, spike and scales ovate, leaves lanceolate, ciliated on the margin near the apex. 2f. East Indies, and Jamaica. This plant grows to the height only of two or three feet. It is valued chiefly on account of its root which is tuberous, of the thickness of a finger, white or reddish within and pale or yellow without. Ginger is reckoned a good stomachic. It is much used by the Indians by way of seasoning. It grows in Malabar, Ceylon, Ambonina, and China, and is cultivated in the West Indies. As it is very plentiful on the mountains of Gingi, some suppose that from this circumstance the name Ginger or Zingiber was derived.\n\nmerum'et.\n\n2. AM.

In 23 of these classes, the flowers, or the pistils and stamens, or at least the stigmas and anthers, are evident. The 24th class comprehends all plants in which the flowers are invisible to the naked eye, as mosses, ferns, mushrooms.\n\nThe principles upon which the classes are formed are few, simple, and beautiful. All plants which have only one stamen, are of the first class; those that have only two, are of the second; those that have only three, are of the third: and so on, the number of stamens being the same with the number of the clas in the first ten classes. See Plate XCIV. fig. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n\nIn the next three classes, the place to which the stamens are fixed must be attended to as well as the number of the stamens. Thus the 11th contains those plants which have from 12 to 19 stamens inclusive, fixed to the receptacle. The 12th those that have 20 stamens fixed to the inside of the calyx. In this clas the place of insertion is more to be relied on than the number of the stamens, for they are sometimes less than 20, often more. The 13th clas comprehends those that have more than 20 stamens attached to the receptacle. See Plate XCIV. fig. 11, 12, 13. For an example of the 12th clas a rose may be examined, and for an example of the 13th a poppy, or a ranunculus.\n\nThe 14th and 15th classes depend upon the number and proportion of the stamens. When there are four stamens in a flower, of which two are longer, it belongs to the 14th clas. When there are five stamens, of which four are longer, it belongs to the 15th clas. For an example of the 14th clas the flowers of the dead nettle, mint, thyme, or fox-glove, may be examined;\nElements mined, and for a specimen of the 15th class, inspect the flowers of shepherds purse, or mustard. See also Plate XCIV. fig. 14. and 15.\n\nThe 16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th classes depend upon the manner in which the stamens are connected, whether they be joined by their filaments into one set, or two sets, or more than two; or be united by the anthers into a cylinder.\n\nIn the 16th class the stamens are united by their filaments into one set, forming a case round the lower part of the pistils, but separating at the top. A geranium forms a specimen of this class. In the 17th the corollas are papilionaceous, like the blossom of a bean; the stamens are connected by their filaments, but divided into two sets or parcels, one of which is thicker and forms a case round the pistil; the other is smaller and leans towards the pistil. Specimens of these may be found in the flowers of peas and beans. In the 18th class, the stamens are united by their filaments into more than two sets, or parcels. See Plate XCIV. fig. 18.\n\nThe 19th class is difficult to a beginner. It consists of compound flowers, as the common daisy, dandelion. They are called compound, because each single flower consists of a collection of little flowers or florets, attached to the same broad receptacle, and contained within one calyx. Each floret consists of a corollet, or little corolla, five stamens united by their anthers into a hollow or tubular cylinder, and a pistil which passes up through the tube of the cylinder. See Plate XCIV. fig. 19, and examine a dandelion, or thistle, or common groundsel, or a sunflower. See also the beginning of the 19th class in the system, where a fuller account will be given of this class.\n\nIn the 20th class, the stamens are attached to the pistil. An orchis will afford a specimen of this. See also Plate XCIV. fig. 20.\n\nIn the three next classes, the pistils and stamens are situated on separate flowers, or distinct plants, or on plants which bear flowers with pistils and stamens, others with stamens or with pistils, or flowers of both kinds.\n\nThe 21st class contains those plants which have flowers of different kinds on the same plant, some bearing pistils, and others bearing stamens only. The flowers with pistils we shall call pistillar or stigmata, and those with stamens staminial or anthered. The birch affords an example of this class. See also fig. 21.\n\nThe 22nd class consists of those species which have stamens on one plant and pistils on another. Instances of this may be found in the willow, poplar, and juniper. See fig. 22.\n\nThe 23rd class comprehends those plants which have at least two and sometimes three kinds of flowers. 1. Some anther-stigmata, or with pistils and stamens on the same flower. 2. Others having pistils only, or stamens only. 3. Or having flowers with pistils only, or flowers with stamens only. This may be expressed more concisely. Some having flowers anther-stigmata, some stigmata, or some anthered, or having both anthered flowers and stigmatic flowers. The common ash tree may be examined for a specimen of this class. See also fig. 23.\n\nThe names of the classes are formed from Greek words, and express the characteristic of each class. The first ten classes are named from the Greek nu-\n\n1. Mon-andria.\n2. Di-andria.\n3. Tri-andria.\n4. Tetr-andria.\n5. Pent-andria.\n6. Hex-andria.\n7. Hept-andria.\n8. Oct-andria.\n9. Enne-andria.\n10. Dec-andria.\n11. Dodec-andria, 12 stamens.\n12. Icos-andria, 20 stamens.\n13. Di-dynamia, 2 powers.\n14. Tetra-dynamia, 4 powers.\n15. Tetra-dynamia, 4 powers.\n16. Mon-adelphe, one brotherhood.\n17. Di-adelphe, two brotherhoods.\n18. Poly-adelphe, many brotherhoods.\n19. Syn-genchia means origin or production together, so called from the stamens being united by the anthers.\n20. Gyn-andria, pistils and stamens together.\n21. Mon-cecia, one house.\n22. Di-cecia, two houses.\n23. Poly-gamia, many kinds of flowers. The etymology here would throw no light upon the class to a beginner; nor does it throw any on the next class.\n24. Crypto-gamia, therefore, is to be understood to mean invisible flowers.","sp":68,"ep":69},{"h":"OF THE GENERA","t":"Having now shewn how plants are arranged into classes, orders, and sections, we come to the next division called genera. The characteristic marks of the genera are derived from the flower and fruit. A genus consists of a certain number of species, which resemble one another in some parts of the flower or of the fruit, or both. By way of illustrating the principles on which the formation and division of genera are founded, we shall run over the British genera in each class.\n\nI. In the first class, Order I. sect. 1, the calyx is Elements, one-leaved or indistinct, corolla absent. Sect. 2, the berry contains many seeds, the spadix contains many flowers, and the capsule is one-seeded. Order II. genus 5, calyx wanting, two petals present; seeds, four, not enclosed in a seed-vessel.\n\nII. In the 2d class, Diandria, Order I, the genera depend upon the figure of the corolla, which is divided, wheel-shaped, ringent, furnished with a spur, or two-petaled; on the calyx being cleft or being two-leaved; on the number of seeds which the berry contains; on the shape of the capsule, and the number of seeds enclosed in it; on the filaments being distant, or standing on a footstalk.\n\nIn the 2d order, the only genus is a grats, the calyx and corolla of which are called glumes.\n\nIII. In the 3d class, Triandria, Order I. sect. 1, the distinction of the genera depends on the number of divisions of the calyx and singularities of the stigma. In sect. 8, the genera are distinguished by the peculiarities of the glumes and seeds.\n\nIn the 2d order, Digynia, sect. 1, 2, 3, and 4, the genera are distinguished,\n\n1. By the number of valves or pieces of which the glumes or corolla and calyx consist.\n2. By the peculiarities of these valves.\n3. By the number of flowers contained in the calyx.\n4. By the peculiarities of the stigma and seed.\n5. By the form of the spikelets, and\n6. By the peculiarities of the spine or thread, or form of the receptacle.\n\nIn the 3d order, trigynia, the genera are distinguished,\n\n1. By the number of leaves of which the calyx is composed.\n2. By the number of petals.\n3. By the form of the capsule, the number of valves composing it, and seeds contained in it.\n\nIV. In the 4th class, Tetrandria, Order I. the genera are determined,\n\nSect. 1.\n\n1. By the peculiarities of the common and partial calyx, or of the calyx and calycet.\n2. By the corolla being superior.\n\nSect. 2, and 3.\n\n1. By the form of the corolla.\n2. By the peculiarities of the fruit.\n\nSect. 4.\n\n1. By the number and the peculiarities of the nectaries.\n2. By their absence.\n3. By the nature of the seed-vessel; by its situation and the number of cells or seeds it contains.\n\nSect. 5.\n\nBy the peculiarities of the calyx and seed.\n\nDigynia and Trigynia, Order I. and II.\n\n1. By the number of petals, and by their absence.\n2. By the nature of the pericarp, and by the number of its valves and cells, and seeds.\n\nV. In the 6th class, Pentandra, Order I. the genera are distinguished,\nOrder II. Angiopermia.\n\n1. By the number of cells and directions of the partitions of the capsule or seed-vessel.\n2. By the form and number of the seeds.\n3. And by other marks of the calyx and corolla, which require no explanation.\n\nXV. Tetradyamia.\n\nI. Siliculae, the genera are distinguished,\n1. By the filiate or short roundish seed-vessel, by the shape and position of its valves or pieces, by its being entire or notched, and the number of seeds it contains.\n\nII. Siliqueae. The genera are distinguished,\n1. By the shape of the filiate or long seed-vessel, which is composed of two valves or pieces, with the seeds fastened to both futures, or joinings of the valves; by the manner in which the filiate opens.\n2. By peculiar glands.\n3. By the calyx being open or spreading.\n4. By the position of the petals.\n5. By the stigma being notched or entire.\n\nXVI. In the 16th class, Monadelphia, the genera are distinguished,\n1. By the number of styles.\n2. By the divisions of the outer calyx.\n3. By the position of the capsules and number of seeds contained in each.\n4. By the seeds being beaked spirally or backwards.\n\nXVII. Diadelphia. Here it is necessary to describe the corolla, which is called papilionaceous, or pea-blossomed, and usually consists of four petals. The lower petal, shaped like a boat, is called the keel; the upper petal, which spreads and rises upwards, is called the standard, and the two side petals are called the wings. The seed-vessel is called a legume, and consists of two pieces or valves, and the seeds are fixed to one of the futures or joinings.\n\nIn the order Decandria, the genera are distinguished,\n1. By the form and divisions of the calyx.\n2. By the form and roughness of the style and stigma.\n3. By the peculiarities of the standard, keel, and wings.\n4. By the legume; its form, length, and the number of seeds it contains.\n\nXIX. In the 19th class, Synoecesia, the genera are distinguished,\n1. By the nature and form of the receptacle, by its smoothness or roughness, its being dotted, or like a honeycomb.\n2. By the nature of the pappus, which is the feathery or flying, or winged crown of the seed by which it flies.\n3. By the peculiarities of the calyx, its resembling tiles, being double, accompanied with scales, &c.\n4. By the number of florets in the ray.\n\nXX. Gynandria, Diandra, the genera are distinguished,\nBy the form of the neclary, which is the lower lip of the corolla.\n\nXXI. In the 21st clas, Monoeia, the genera are distinguished,\n\n1. By\n1. By peculiarities in the male or anthered flower of the calyx and corolla.\n\n2. By similar peculiarities in the female or stigmatic flowers.\n\n3. By the form of the ament. The ament is a species of flower consisting of a thread form receptacle, to which a number of chaffy scales are attached. A specimen of it may be seen in the flowers of the fir, birch, hazel, beech, and oak.\n\nXXII. XXIII. In the 22d and 23d classes, Dioecia and Polygamia, the genera are distinguished in a manner similar to those already described. We have only to remark, that what in other systems is called hermaphrodite flowers, in the class Polygamia we call anther-stigmatic, or pistil-staminal, that is, flowers having both anthers and stigmas, or pistils and stamens.","sp":72,"ep":74},{"h":"OF THE ORDERS","t":"The formation of the orders is as ingenious and simple as that of the classes. In the first thirteen classes, the names and characters are taken from the number of pistils or styles; when there are wanting, from the number of stigmas. Thus:\n\n- Mono-gynia, 1 style.\n- Dia-gynia, 2 styles.\n- Tri-gynia, 3 styles.\n- Tetra-gynia, 4 styles.\n- Penta-gynia, 5 styles.\n- Hexa-gynia, 6 styles.\n- Hepta-gynia, 7 styles.\n- Deca-gynia, 10 styles.\n- Dodeca-gynia, 12 styles.\n- Poly-gynia, many styles.\n\nIn the 14th class Didynamia there are only two orders, which depend on the presence or absence of the pericarp or seed-vessel.\n\n1. Gymnospermia. Four naked seeds in the bottom of the calyx; as in mint, dead-nettle, thyme.\n2. Angiospermia. Seeds enclosed in a pericarp; as in fox-glove, eye-bright, toad-flax, fig-wort.\n\nIn the 15th class, tetrodynamia, there are also two orders, which are taken from the form of the pericarp.\n\n1. Siliculosa. Seeds enclosed in a silicle or roundish seed-vessel, consisting of two pieces called valves, and the seeds fixed to both edges or sutures, as in shepherd's purse, lacy-grass.\n\n2. Siliquosa.\nElements. 2. Siliquosa. Seeds enclosed in a siliqua or long seed-vessel; as in mustard.\n\nIn the 16th, 17th, and 18th classes, the names and characters of the orders are taken from the number of stamens.\n\nIn the 19th class there are six orders, which it is difficult at first to distinguish accurately.\n\n1. Polygamia Aequalis. Florets anther-fligmate, or having both stamens and pistils in the same floret; as in dandelion, thistle, sow-thistle, artichoke.\n\n2. Polygamia Superflua. When the flower is composed of two parts, a disk or central part, and rays projecting outwards; as in corn-marygold, tanzy, daisy, golden-rod, groundsel, chamomile, milkweed. The florets of the disk are another-fligmate; those of the ray fligmate.\n\n3. Polygamia Frustranea. Florets of the disk another-fligmate; those of the rays with styles but no stigmas; as blue-bottle, knapweed.\n\n4. Polygamia Necessaria. Florets of the disk another-styled, without stigmas; those of the rays fligmate. Garden marigold will afford a specimen.\n\n5. Polygamia Segregata. When each of the florets has a calyx, besides the common or general calyx of the flower. Specimens of this can only be found in botanic gardens.\n\n6. Monogamia. When the flower is not compound but single, and the anthers united. This order ought to be transferred to the class pentandra, as, indeed, has been done in some very valuable systems. Examples of it may be found in the violet.\n\nIn the classes gynandria, monocia, and dioecia, the orders are formed from the number of stamens, with three of a different kind, monadelphia, syngenesia, and gynandria, in the classes monocia and dioecia.\n\nIn the 23rd class there are three orders.\n\n1. Monocia. When the flowers are anther-fligmate and anthered; or anther-fligmate and fligmate, on the same individual plant.\n\n2. Dioecia. When the flowers are anther-fligmate and anthered, or anther-fligmate and fligmate, on two different individual plants.\n\n3. Triocia. When the flowers of one individual plant of the same species are anther-fligmate; upon a second individual plant, anthered; and upon a third individual plant, fligmate.\n\nThe orders into which the 24th class, cryptogamia, is divided, will be explained in the introduction to that class.","sp":69,"ep":70},{"h":"OF THE SECTIONS","t":"The orders are generally subdivided into what may be called sections. These may vary in number, according as the system is partial or universal; but they are almost as well established as the classes and orders. Sections are not employed in the 11th, 12th, 16th, 18th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 22d, 23d classes. The principles on which they are formed are few and very simple.\n\nIn the first ten classes they depend upon the following circumstances: on the flower being superior or inferior or naked, complete or incomplete, calycled, enclosed in a spathe or glume, aggregate, umbellate, involucrate; on the number of petals, the seeds being naked or enclosed; on the number of seeds, and the number of cells in the capsule or seed vessel, or number of berries.\n\nThe flower is said to be superior when the receptacle of the flower is above the germen, and inferior when the receptacle is below the germen. A flower is said to be naked when the calyx is absent; it is called complete when it has both a calyx and corolla, and incomplete when either of these is wanting. It is said to be calycled when the calyx has a small calyx or calyclet at the base. An aggregate flower, is a flower composed of florets standing on footstalks, attached to a broad receptacle.\n\nAn umbellate plant, is one which sends out towards the top, from the same point or centre, a number of branches like the spokes of an umbrella, and bearing flowers on the top. All the spokes, with their flowers, form a universal umbel. On the top of each spoke arises an umbellule, or partial umbel. At the base of the spokes of the umbel, or universal umbel, is a fort of calyx, called an involucre, or universal involucre; and at the base of the spokes of the umbellule is a partial involucre, or an involucre. This will suffice for explaining the sections of the first ten classes. The sections of the 13th depend on the number of petals.\n\nIn the 14th class, didynamia, the sections depend upon the calyx; which is said to be cleft when it is cut or divided into so many parts, and two-lipped when its mouth has a resemblance to two lips.\n\nIn the 15th class the sections depend on the filicle and calyx. The filicle in one section is notched at the point, and in another unnotched or entire. In the first section of the order filiquea, the calyx is closed by its own leaflets. In the second it is not closed, and the leaflets are separated at the upper end.\n\nIn the 17th class, diadelphia, and the order decandra, there are six sections. 1. The first comprehends those flowers which have their stamens all united as in the clas monadelphia, and therefore forms an exception to the regularity of the clas. 2. In the second, the stigma is pubescent or hairy. The stamens not. 3. The seed-vessel or legume, has two cells, without the connected marks of the former sections. 4. The legume contains only one seed, without the marks of the former three sections. 5. The legume is somewhat jointed, without the marks of the former. 6. The legume has only one apartment, but many seeds, without the marks already mentioned.\n\nThe only remaining clas, whose orders are divided into sections, is the 19th, syngenesia. 1. In the first section of the first order, the corollets are ligulate, that is, flat towards the exterior or upper end, and tubular only at the base. 2. Capitate or headed, when the flowers grow in globular forms; as the thistle. 3. Diffused, when the corollets are all tubular, not ligulate. In the order polygamia superflua are two sections. 1. Diffused corollets. 2. Rayed or radiate, when all the corollets are ligulate.\nWe will now present a connected view of the Classes and Orders in a Table.\n\nI. MONANDRIA, 1 stamen.\n   1.

The species are distinguished from one another, either by marking in a few words the most striking differences, or by giving a minute description of each species. In the foreign plants, we have adopted the first method for the sake of brevity. But in the British, which is of consequence we should study more perfectly, we have adopted the second. The first is a translation of Witherow's Species Plantarum, the most complete system hitherto published, and the second, or the description of the British plants, is a translation from Dr Smith's Flora Britannica, which we have no hesitation in saying is a model of botanical description. For precision it is worthy of Linnaeus, and is so minute that nothing peculiar to any species seems to have escaped the author.\n\nThe species when numerous are formed into subdivisions. This we think should always be done, when it can be done with propriety. There are some eminent botanists who disapprove of this practice, because, say they, it separates species that have the closest resemblance to one another. This however, is of no consequence; for it is not the object of botanical arrangement to place these plants next one another, which are most like; but to point out the species, and most certain method of discovering the names of such plants as we have occasion to examine. We cannot help regretting therefore, that Mr Salisbury in his new arrangement of Erica, a genus consisting of more than 240 species, should, in order to clas them according to their affinities, have neglected to form them into subdivisions: the subdivision of the species diminishes the unnecessary labours of the botanist, and tends to increase the precision of inquiry. For example, 32 species of the campanula, have leaves smooth polished, and the rest have leaves rough to the touch. This circumstance forms a very convenient subdivision. Again, 44 species of the solanum have neither prickles nor thorns, 39 are prickled, and one is thorny or spinous. Thus in examining a solanum, we can have no occasion to run over 84 species; we are required only to go over 44, or 39, or one. There is as much propriety in forming the numerous species of a genus into subdivisions, as there is in separating plants that have a close resemblance into different genera. Who would have supposed that the botanist who has separated the Erica vulgaris or common heath, from the genus to which it has hitherto belonged, would have thought it improper to arrange so extensive a genus into subdivisions. We can only account for it by supposing that an eminent botanist may sometimes forget the principles of the Linnean classification, to seek after a natural classification; a thing which we suspect is like the government of Utopia, that exists only in the mind of the inventor.","sp":74,"ep":74},{"h":"OF VARIETIES","t":"Every part of a plant is subject to variation from climate, soil, cultivation, and diseases, or injuries produced by insects, winds, &c. The corolla and leaves are most liable to change. Variations arising from such accidents are not permanent; they may indeed be propagated by slips, but vanish in those plants which are raised from seeds. It is by rearing plants from seeds that we can determine whether a plant be a variety or a distinct species.\n\nRULES FOR DIRECTING THE YOUNG BOTANIST IN INVESTIGATING A PLANT.\n\nAfter the young botanist understands the principles upon which the classification is formed, he ought immediately to proceed to the examination of plants.\n\n1. The botanist ought to select flowers in different states, some expanded, some unopened, and if possible, some that are ripened into fruit.\n\n2. If the flower contain both stamens and pistils, it belongs to some one of the first 20 classes. If either the pistils or stamens be wanting, it belongs to the 21st, 22d, or 23d. To this rule there are a few exceptions, which if the young botanist cannot overcome, he may pass them over till he has made some progress in the art of investigation.\n\n3. He must next examine whether the stamens be connected or separate, and whether two of them be uniformly shorter than the rest. If the stamens be not connected, and two of them be not uniformly shorter, the plant belongs to one of the 13 first classes. If the stamens do not amount to 12, the number of the stamens and number of the clas is the same. If the stamens be 12 or more, then, besides counting them, it is necessary to observe whether they be fixed at the lower end to the calyx or receptacle. This may be best known by tearing off the calyx; if the stamens do not come away with the calyx, the plant belongs to the clas dodecandra. If the stamens be about 20, less or more, and fixed to the calyx, the plant belongs to icofandra. If 20 or more, and attached to the calyx, the clas is polyandra.\n\nIn all these classes the orders may be known by the pistils.\n\n4. If the stamens be four or six, and two shorter than the rest, the plant belongs to didynamia or tetradynamia. The corolla in didynamious plants is one petal divided into two lips; and the corolla of tetradynamious plants consists always of four petals, placed somewhat in the form of a cross: hence called cruciform.\n\nThe orders of the clas didynamia may be known by observing whether the seeds be enclosed in a seed-vessel,\nElements. vessel, be four in number, and naked in the bottom of the calyx.\n\nIn tetradiamia, the orders are distinguished by the form of the seed-vessel. If long, the order is filiculosa; if roundish it is filiculina.\n\n5. If the stamens be connected by the filaments into one set round the pistil, but separated at the top, and the petals five, the clas is monadelphia. If the stamens be formed into two sets, and the corolla like the blossom of a pea or bean, the clas is diadelphia, and if formed into more than two sets, the clas is polyadelphia. The orders depend upon the number of the stamens.\n\n6. If the flower be compound, that is, if one calyx contain a great many corollets, each of which has five stamens united to a cylinder at the anthers, the flower belongs to the clas gyngynoidea.\n\nThe orders are to be determined by examining the florets, that is, the corollets of the disk and ray, in order to know whether they both contain pistils and stamens, or anthers and stigmas, or otherwise. 1. If all the florets contain stamens and pistils, the order is polygamia aequalis. 2. If the disk or central part have florets with a pistil and stamens, but the rays contain only a pistil, the order is polygamia superflua. 3. If the florets of the disk have stamens, and pistils, or another-fligate, and those of the rays have only a style, the order is polygamia frutrannea. 4. If the florets of the disk have stamens and styles, but no stigmas, and those of the rays a pistil only, the order is polygamia necessaria. 5. When each of the florets has a small calyx, the order is the polygamia segregata. 6. And when the flower is not compound, but single with anthers united, the order is monogamia. But such plants are commonly now added to the clas pentandria.\n\n7. If the stamens be fixed to the pistil, the clas is gynandra. The flower has something of a monstrous or irregular appearance. The petals are five, the style grows from the inner petal of the lower lip of the corolla, so as scarcely to be distinguishable.\n\nThe orders are determined by the number of the stamens.\n\n8. When the flowers are imperfect, that is, when some in the same individual plant have only pistils and some only stamens, the plant belongs to the clas monoecia. When the pistils are in one plant, and the stamens on another, the clas is dioecia; and when perfect and imperfect flowers occur on the same plant, or on two or three different plants, the clas is polygamia.\n\nThe orders of monoecia and dioecia, are known by the number of stamens; and in polygamia, if imperfect and perfect flowers, that is, anther-fligate and stigmatic or anthered, be found on the same plant, the order is monoecia; if on two plants, the order is dioecia; and if anther-fligate flowers be on one plant, stigmatic on another, and anthered on a third, the order is tricoecia.\n\n9. Different flowers should be examined, and especially those that are unopened, if the number of stamens and pistils should vary. And if after this examination, different unopened or unexpanded flowers should vary, a preference should be given to the flowers that terminate the stalk. We ought always, therefore, to compare different flowers before we inquire after the clas or orders.\n\nII. 1. After determining the clas and order, the botanist ought to compare with the flower which he is investigating the different sections of the order when it is divided into sections. He may then proceed to examine the genus.\n\n2. In the beginning of each clas he will find all the genera arranged as they agree and differ in some essential characters of the flower and fruit. But they are numbered in that order which brings those that have the closest resemblance next to one another. After the section is determined, then the flower must be compared with each of the genera of that section, or of the order when it is not divided into sections.\n\n3. If none of the essential characters agree with the flower and fruit of the plant which is examined, then the plants which are named at the end of the orders are to be sought for and examined.\n\nIn this system we have first given the essential marks of all the genera at the beginning of each clas in Latin, and also in English.\n\n4. After determining the genus, the plant may be compared with the description of the species. In foreign plants we have in general given only the essential character of the species. But in some British plants we have added also, from Dr Smith's Flora Britannica, a minute and fuller account, as an example of botanical description.\n\nWe have not referred to those books which give plates of the species, because they are accessible but to very few, and because we do not think that a man will ever be a botanist whose knowledge is indebted to plates. It is much better to consult an experienced botanist than a book of plates. Those, however, who wish to consult plates may do so from this system as well as from any other, after ascertaining the clas and order.\n\nAs to the language which is employed in the following system, we need say very little. We have endeavoured to make it as much English as possible. We have always preferred words of English origin when we thought them sufficiently accurate; but when we had reason to believe that such words were so vague that they might lead into error, we thought it better to adopt the Linnean terms, and to give them an English termination. In a few cases we have retained the Linnean terms unaltered, as corolla, bractea, stipula, because we thought any such change would be unpleasant to the ear, as corol, bracte, stipule. Besides it would be no disadvantage to the harmony of our language to have more words ending with vowels.\n\nWe once intended to have given English names to many of the genera, and to all the species, and had done so through the first four or five classes; but it was objected, that this would increase the synonymes, which are already too numerous; and consequently would often tend to mislead than to be useful. It would certainly be much better that plants were known in all nations by the same name.\n\nOf the Method of forming an Herbarium or Horius Siccus.\n\nEvery man who wishes to be a complete botanist will find it necessary to preserve and to form into a collection the plants which he has examined.\nThe best method of preserving them is by drying them: specimens ought to be collected when dry, and carried home in a tin box. Plants may be dried by pressing, in a box of sand, or with a hot smoothing-iron. Each of these has its advantages.\n\n1. If pressure be employed, a botanical press may be procured. The press is made of two smooth boards of hard wood, 18 inches long, 12 broad, and two thick. Screws must be fixed to each corner with nuts. If a press cannot easily be had, books may be employed.\n\nNext, some quires of unlined blossom blotting paper must be provided. The specimens when taken out of the tin box must be carefully spread on a piece of pasteboard covered with a single sheet of the blossom paper quite dry; then place three or four sheets of the same paper above the plant, to imbibe the moisture as it is pressed out; it is then to be put into the press. As many plants as the press will hold may be piled up in this manner. At first they ought to be pressed gently.\n\nAfter being pressed for twenty-four hours or so, the plants ought to be examined, that any leaves or petals which have been folded may be spread out, and dry sheets of paper laid over them. They may now be replaced in the press, and a greater degree of pressure applied. The press ought to stand near a fire, or in the sunshine. After remaining two days in this situation, they should be again examined, and dry sheets of paper be laid over them. The pressure then ought to be considerably increased. After remaining three days longer in the press, the plants may be taken out, and such as are sufficiently dry may be put in a dry sheet of writing paper. Those plants which are succulent may require more pressure, and the blossom paper again renewed.\n\nPlants which dry very quickly, ought to be pressed with considerable force when first put into the press; and if delicate, the blossom paper should be changed every day. When the stem is woody it may be thinned with a knife, and if the flower be thick or globular as the thistle, one side of it may be cut away; as all that is necessary, in a specimen, is to preserve the character of the class, order, genus and species.\n\n2. Plants may be dried in a box of sand in a more expeditious manner, and this method preserves the colour of some plants better. The specimens after being pressed for ten or twelve hours, must be laid within a sheet of blossom paper. The box must contain an inch deep of fine dry sand, on which the sheet is to be placed, and then covered with sand an inch thick; another sheet may then be deposited in the same manner, and so on, till the box be full. The box must be placed near a fire for two or three days. Then the sand must be carefully removed, and the plants examined. If not sufficiently dried, they may again be replaced in the same manner for a day or two.\n\n3. In drying plants with a hot smoothing iron, they must be placed within several sheets of blotting paper, and ironed till they become sufficiently dry. This method answers best for drying succulent and mucilaginous plants.\n\n4. When properly dried, the specimens should be placed in sheets of writing paper, and may be slightly fastened by making the top and bottom of the stalk pass through a slip of the paper, cut neatly for the purpose. Then the name of the genus and species should be written down, the place where it was found, nature of the soil, and the season of the year. These specimens may be collected into genera, orders, and classes, and titled and preserved in a portfolio or cabinet. The method of preserving many of the cryptogamous plants is more difficult, on account of the greater quantity of moisture which they contain, and the greater delicacy of their texture.\n\nWe will now conclude this introduction with particular references to the plates.\n\nEXPLANATION of the PLATES.\n\nPLATE XCIV. exhibits the 24 CLASSES; fig. 1. representing the first class, or Monandria; fig. 2. the second class, or Diandra; fig. 3. the third class, or Triandra; and so on, according to the enumeration in the table.\n\nPLATE XCV. represents the parts of a plant upon which the investigation of the GENUS depends.\n\nParts of the FLOWER.\u2014Fig. 1.

This order consists of trees and shrubs only. These have always a simple stem, not branched, bearing leaves at the top, resembling those of fern, being a composition of a leaf and a branch, called fronds; and the corolla hath always three petals, or three deep divisions. The known genera are 10 in number.\nHAVING thus stated the botanical arrangement contrived by Linneus, which proceeds upon the supposition of the existence of a sexual system in the vegetable world; we proceed to take notice of some other important circumstances connected with this branch of science, more particularly its history, and the natural orders, as opposed to the above artificial classification of plants.\n\nSect. I. Ancient Writers upon Botany.\n\nThe origin of this science, like that of most others, cannot be found out from the most ancient histories; but it is very probable, that some degree of botanical knowledge has existed in every age of the world. The first botanical writings of which we have any account are those of Solomon, who we are informed by Scripture wrote a treatise upon this subject; which, however, is absolutely lost, not being quoted by any ancient author, nor the least fragment of it remaining. Among the Greeks, Anaxagoras, Pythagoras, and other ancient philosophers, wrote treatises on plants; but their works are also lost; and from the quotations that yet remain in the works of Theophrastus, Dioscorides, and Pliny, we learn, that these first botanical writings could convey but very little information.\n\nThe historical era of botany, therefore, commences with Theophrastus the disciple of Aristotle. He was born at Eresium, in the island of Lesbos; and flourished in the third century before the Christian era, being about 100 years posterior to Hippocrates. His work is entitled *The History of Plants*, and treats of their origin,\norigin, propagation, anatomy, and construction; of vegetable life, and of vegetation. It consisted originally of ten books; but of which only nine are now extant. In these, vegetables are distributed into seven classes or primary divisions; which have for their object, the generation of plants; their place of growth; their size, as trees and shrubs; their use, as pot herbs, and edulent grains; and their lactescence, or the liquor, of whatever colour, that flows from plants when cut. In his work, above 500 different plants are described.\n\nThe next botanist of any note was Dioscorides, a Grecian by birth, but under the Roman empire, being near 300 years posterior to Theophrastus. He describes about 600 plants; and these he has arranged, from their uses in medicine and domestic economy, into four classes, which are thus designed: aromatics; alimentary vegetables, or such as serve for food; medicinal, and vinous plants.\n\nAlmost contemporary with Dioscorides flourished Antonius Musa, Cato, Varro, Virgil, and Columella; the first, author of a treatise still extant on the plant botany; the four others celebrated for their useful tracts on agriculture and rural economy.\n\nPliny the Elder, in his voluminous work entitled The History of the World, hath a botanical part which is contained in 15 books. In these, besides the plants of Theophrastus and Dioscorides, he has given descriptions of several new species, extracted probably from works which would otherwise have been totally lost. Pliny uses scarce any mode of arrangement, except the ancient, but very incorrect, distinction into trees, shrubs, and herbs. His plan, however, extends not only to botanical distinctions, but to gardening, agriculture, and whatever is connected either more nearly or remotely with the science of plants. He gives descriptions of above 1000 different species; but from the want of a proper systematic arrangement, it is often difficult, and perhaps impossible, to determine what plants he or other ancient botanists do really describe.\n\nThis want of precision in properly arranging their plants was the reason why the botany of the ancients was always very limited, and after the time of Pliny declined so rapidly. On the destruction of the western empire by the Goths and other barbarous nations, it is not to be thought that botany could survive any more than the other sciences. It was not till near the close of the eighth century, that the ancient botany began again to appear in Arabia. Serapion, well known in medicine, stands first in the Arabian catalogue of botanists; to him succeeded Razis, Avicenna, Averroes, Aqutarius, &c. An author known by the name of Plato, Apuleius, or Apollonius, of whose Herbarium very old manuscript copies are preserved in some curious libraries, is supposed to have lived near this period. The works of most of these botanists, however, were only translations and compilations from the Greek writers; so that, for want of a proper systematic arrangement, the science sunk a second time into total oblivion. For near 400 years after Abengueft, an Arabian physician who flourished in the end of the 12th century, scarce any attempts were made in the botanical way. Some obscure writers indeed appeared in several parts of Europe; as Arnoldus de Ville Nova; Platearius; Matthaeus Sylvaticus; and Bartholomew Glanvil, commonly called Bartholomeus Anglus, a Franciscan monk, descended of the family of the earls of Suffolk, who lived in the reign of King Edward III. and wrote a book of natural history, entitled De proprietatibus rerum, which was translated into English by John de Trevisa in 1398; but though all these wrote of plants, they are totally destitute of method, that their works remain one great chaos, from whence it is impossible to extract anything intelligible.\n\nOn the revival of letters in the beginning of the 16th century, the botany of the ancients was restored a second time. The Greek writings were translated into Latin the common language of Europe. Gaza, a Greek refugee at Rome, made elegant translations of Aristotle and Theophrastus, who afterwards were commented upon by Scaliger and Stapel. Dioscorides was also translated and commented on. His best commentators are Hermolaus Barbarus, Fuchius, Ruellius Cordus, Geffner, and Matthiolus. The most distinguished commentators on Pliny are Dalechamp in 1624, Salmasius in 1689, Harduin and Guilandinus. Meurrius and Ursinus have written commentaries upon Cato; Campegius and Monardes upon Mefue the Arabian, and Lonicer upon Avicenna. This last hath been translated by several writers, particularly Alpagus, Coeteus, and Plenpius into Latin; and by one writer, Amaltheus, into Hebrew.\n\nHieronymus Bock, or Bouc, a German, generally known by the name of Tragus, is the first modern who has given a methodical distribution of vegetables. In 1532, he published a History of Plants, in which he describes 800 species; and these he divides into three classes, founded on the qualities of vegetables, their figure, habit, and size. The same method of arrangement was followed by Lonicer, Dodonaeus, L'Obel, Clusius, Brunfelsius, Monardes, Cordus, and some other botanists of this period. How far such a method was deficient, shall be considered in the following section; however, it was not till 1560 that Conrad Geffner first proposed to the world an arrangement of vegetables from the parts of the flower and fruit. He did not establish any plan founded upon this principle; but having suggested the idea, left the application to be made by others: and in 1582, Dr Andrew Caesalpinus, physician at Pisa, and afterwards professor of botany at Padua, first availing himself of the ingenuity of his predecessor, proposed a method of arrangement which has the fruit for its basis; and thus gave origin to systematic botany, the second grand era in the history of that science.\n\nEven this improved method of Caesalpinus was not without very great inconveniences, which shall be taken notice of hereafter. As it was, however, so greatly superior to every thing that had happened before, it might have been expected that the learned would have immediately adopted it, and that all the former equivocal and insufficient characters would have been rejected. But the fact was otherwise. Caesalpinus's method of arrangement died with him; and it was not till near a century after, that Dr Robert Morrison of Aberdeen, attaching himself to the principles of Geffner and Caesalpinus, re-established scientific arrangement upon a solid foundation; so that, from being only the restorer of system, he has been generally celebrated as its founder. In the long interval between Caesalpinus and...\nand Morrison flourished some eminent botanists. The most noted are, Dalechamp, author of A general History of Plants; Theodore, named Tabernemontanus, and Thalius, two German writers; Porta, an Italian, famous for an arrangement of plants from their relations to the stars, to men, and other animals; Propher Alpinus, author of a Catalogue of the Plants of Egypt; Fabius Columna, inventor of many of the botanical terms now used; the two Bauhins; Gerard, and Parkinson; Zaluzianski, a Pole, author of an arrangement from the qualities and habits of plants; Margrave and Piso, celebrated for their natural history of Brazil; Hernandez, equally celebrated for his history of Mexico; Pausseus, or Du Pas, author of an arrangement of plants from the time of flowering, of all characters the most uncertain and insufficient; Johnston; Bontius, a Dutchman, author of a Natural History of the East Indies; Aldrovandus, the celebrated naturalist; and Rheede, governor of Malabar, and author of the well-known Hortus Malabaricus.\n\nThe method proposed by Morrison has the fruit for its basis, as well as that of Cesalpino; to which, however, it is greatly inferior both in the plan and execution. It is indeed of all others the most difficult in practice, and was therefore not adopted by any succeeding writer, except Bobart, who in 1699 completed Morrison's Universal History of Plants, and an anonymous author whose work appeared in 1720. Imperfect, however, as his method is, it furnished many useful hints, which succeeding botanists have not failed to improve. Ray and Tournefort have owed him much, and are not ashamed to own the obligation. The same has been done even by Linnaeus; who hath established the science of botany on the most solid foundation, by introducing a method of arrangement, if not absolutely perfect, at least as nearly approaching to perfection as can be expected; and which therefore hath been deservedly followed, in preference to every other, by all botanists, since its first publication. But to give a particular account of all the different botanical systems, with the particular advantages and disadvantages attending each, shall be the business of the subsequent sections.\n\n**Sect. II. Of the Ancient Method of arranging Vegetables.**\n\nIn giving an account of the works of Theophrastus and Dioscorides, we have already taken notice that the former chose seven distinguishing characters, viz. the generation of plants; their place of growth; their size, as trees and shrubs; their use, as pot herbs and esculent grains; and their lactescence, or liquor that flows from them when cut. Dioscorides divided them into aromatics, alimentary, medicinal, and vinous plants. The good properties of this method are, that the botanist as it were comes to the point at once; and when he knows the plant, knows also its virtues and uses, or at least part of them: but this convenience is greatly overbalanced by innumerable disadvantages; for the qualities and virtues of plants are neither fixed and invariable, nor are they impressed in legible characters on the plants themselves. The different parts of a plant often possess different and even opposite virtues; so that supposing the virtues to be known, and applied to the purpose of vegetable arrangement, the roots must frequently fall under one division, the leaves under a second, and the flower and fruit under a third. Besides, if we reflect that the sole end of such arrangement is to facilitate the knowledge of plants to others, the insufficiency and even absurdity of methods founded upon their virtues will immediately appear. A stalk of vervain, for instance, is presented to me, which I am to investigate from a preposited knowledge of the virtues of plants. Before I can settle the class to which it belongs, I must discover whether or not it has the virtues belonging to any of the plants I know; and this discovery being the result of repeated experiments on various parts of the human body, may require many years for its accomplishment.\n\nThe same causes which render methods founded on the virtues of plants unfavourable for the purpose of investigation, must evidently disqualify all their other variable quantities and accidents from having a place in a genuine systematic arrangement. The natale of plants, which is one of Theophrastus's divisions, affords no better distinctive characters than their powers and virtues. Many countries as well as many soils produce the same individual plants. The same species, which crown the mountains, frequently cover the fens; and plants which have long been reckoned the peculiar inhabitants of some parts of Asia and America, are now found to grow naturally in equal perfection in the very different climates of Lapland and Siberia. The size of plants, which suggested the ancient division into trees and shrubs, is no less an equivocal mark of distinction than the circumstances already mentioned. The vine which modern botanists denominate a shrub, was ranged by Theophrastus in his third class containing trees. In fact, everything reflecting size is so much affected by differences of soil, climate, and culture, that the same plant, in different circumstances, shall differ exceedingly in height; and in a method founded upon the size, would sometimes be ranged as a tree, and sometimes as a shrub, or even an under-shrub, according as it happens to exceed, equal, or fall short of, a given standard. No less insufficient are characteristic marks drawn from the colour, taste, and smell of plants. Of all the attributes of vegetable nature, colour is perhaps the most inconstant. Heat, climate, culture, soil, &c., contribute to the production of endless diversities of colour, and render the transition from one to another natural and easy. Red and blue pass easily into white, white into purple, yellow into white, red into blue, blue into yellow, &c. In the same leaf or flower, different colours are frequently observed. Variations too in point of colour are frequently observed to take place not only in different individuals of the same species, but even in similar parts of the same plant. Marvel of Peru and sweetwilliam produce flowers of different colour upon the same stalk. Objections equally valid lie against characteristic marks drawn from the taste and smell. The former varies in different individuals from differences of age, and even in the same individual at different times, according to the morbid or sound state of the organ. The latter is different in different subjects, and varies in each; nor are the effluvia sent forth from the same body always of equal intensity. In plants, taste is subject to continual variations, from differences of climate, soil, and culture.\nGarlic in some climates, particularly in Greece, is said to lose its rankness; apples and pears, that grow naturally in the woods, are intolerably acid; celery and lettuce, which culture renders sweet and palatable, are in their wild uncultivated state bitter, disagreeable, and in some cases noxious.\n\nThese considerations are abundantly sufficient to show the imperfections of the ancient system of botany; and, indeed, considering the vague and uncertain marks by which the ancients distinguished one plant from another, we may rather wonder how such a science as botany came to have an existence among them, than that they arrived at no greater perfection in it, or suffered it so soon to fall into oblivion.\n\nSect. III. Of the different Botanical Systems from the time of Gesner to that of Linnaeus.\n\nThe insufficiency of the ancient botanical system being so fully shown in the last section, we think it needless to take much notice of the methods used by Tragus and his contemporaries and followers. The virtues of plants being found an insufficient characteristic, succeeding botanists had taken in the root, stem, and leaves; but these being also found insufficient and variable, Gesner turned his eye to the flower and fruit, as being the most permanent and unchangeable parts of the plant. In proposing the parts of fructification, however, as the most proper for arranging plants, he communicated no hints respecting the choice of some of those parts in preference to others. Each particular organ of the flower and fruit furnishes sufficient variety to serve as the foundation of a method; but all of them are not equally proper for this purpose. Casalpinus, the first follower of Gesner, made a mistake in his choice, and took his distinguishing characteristics only from the fruit. The parts of the flower, therefore, being employed by the first systematic writers only as subaltern directions in finding out orders and genera, it is evident that the plant could not be fully investigated for several months. Suppose a plant ripens its fruit in October, and does not produce flowers till the following May; the clasps, upon inspection of the fruit in the month of October, is immediately ascertained; but the plant still remains unknown, and will continue so upwards of six months after, if the characters of the order and genus have been made to depend on any part of the flower. Methods founded on the fruit have another inconvenience; plants constantly ripen their fruit in these countries where they grow naturally, but not always in the countries to which they may be accidentally transported. So far from this, that many plants that are natives of a warm climate, neither ripen nor form fruit in a cold one. Few of the African, Asiatic, and West Indian plants produce fruit in Britain. A method, therefore, founded upon the fruit, could only facilitate the knowledge of such plants to be inhabitants of those countries where they grow; to the English botanist they could be of little or no service. The same objection cannot reasonably be urged against methods founded on the flower, since the influence of climates much colder than that of Britain has not been able to destroy the faculty of producing flowers in many, perhaps in most, of the plants just mentioned.\n\nCasalpinus sets out with an ancient distinction of vegetables, from their duration, into trees and herbs. With the former he combines shrubs; with the latter, under-shrubs; and distributes his plants into the following classes. 1. Trees with the germ (radicle or principle of life in the seed) on the point of the seed. 2. Trees with the germ on the base of the seed. 3. Herbs having one seed only. 4. Herbs having two seeds. 5. Herbs having four seeds. 6. Herbs having many seeds. 7. Herbs having one grain or kernel. 8. Herbs having one capsule. 9. Herbs having two capsules. 10. Herbs having fibrous roots. 11. Herbs having bulbous roots. 12. Herbs having succory or endive-like flowers. 13. Herbs having common flowers. 14. Herbs having several follicles or seed-bags. 15. Herbs having neither flower nor seed.\n\nThe inconveniences of this method have been already pointed out pretty fully, and will evidently appear upon an attempt to refer any common plant to one of the above-mentioned classes. His sections, orders, or secondary divisions, are 47 in number, and depend upon a variety of parts and circumstances. The principal of these are, the disposition, situation, and figure of the flowers; the nature of the seed-vessel, or cover of the seeds; the situation of the radicle in the seed; the number of seed-lobes, or seminal leaves; the disposition of the leaves, and colour of the flowers. The lactecence too, or milkiness, which is observed in the compound flowers with flat florets, is made a characteristic distinction, and discriminates the first order of the 12th class. Thus, in the first systematic arrangements, the characters of the classes only were borrowed from the parts of fructification; while those of the subaltern divisions were very numerous, and respected every part of the plant; but that such divisions might be perfect, they should be constituted, like the classes, from the modifications of a single part of the fructification.\n\nThe great object had in view by Morrison, who comes next in order to Casalpinus, was to investigate the method, order of nature, not to fabricate an easy method of arranging plants. Hence his system is devoid of uniformity, and clogged with a multiplicity of characters; his classes are frequently not sufficiently distinguished from one another, and the key of arrangement seems totally lost. He sets out with a division of plants, from their consistence, into ligneous or woody, and herbaceous. He founds his system on the fruit, the corolla or blossoms, and the habit of the plants. His classes are as follow: 1. Trees. 2. Shrubs. 3. Under-shrubs. 4. Herbs climbing. 5. Herbs leguminous or papilionaceous. 6. Herbs podded. 7. Herbs tricarpicular or with three capsules. 8. Herbs with four or five capsules. 9. Herbs corymbiferous. 10. Herbs having a milky juice, or downy tops. 11. Herbs culmiferous, as grasses. 12. Herbs umbelliferous. 13. Herbs having three kernels. 14. Herbs having helmet-shaped flowers. 15. Herbs having many capsules. 16. Herbs berry-bearing. 17. Herbs called capillary plants, as the fern kind. 18. Anomalous or irregular herbs.\n\nOf these classes, the fourth and eighth possess no genuine distinctive character; nor are the ninth and tenth classes sufficiently distinguished; the fifteenth class is not sufficiently distinguished from the eighth, nor the sixteenth from the fourth. His sections or secondary divisions, which are 108 in number, arise from the figure and substance of the fruit; the number of seeds, leaves,\nleaves, and petals; the figure of the root; the direction of the stem; the colour of the flowers; the place of growth; and, in one class, from the medicinal virtues of some of the plants that compose it.\n\nIn 1682, Ray proposed his method to the world, two years after the publication of Morison's, which served in some measure as its basis. It consisted originally of the following 25 classes: 1. Trees. 2. Shrubs. 3. Herbs imperfect. 4. Herbs having no flowers. 5. Capillary plants. 6. Staminous herbs having only the stamens. 7. Those having one naked seed. 8. Umbelliferous herbs. 9. Verticillated, annular, or ring-shaped ones. 10. Rough-leaved plants. 11. Stellated or star-shaped ones. 12. Apple-bearing herbs. 13. Berry-bearing herbs. 14. Herbs having many pods. 15. Monopetalous uniform, or regular herbs. 16. Monopetalous irregular, or having different forms. 17. Tetrapetalous, having large pods. 18. Tetrapetalous, having small pods. 19. Papilionaceous. 20. Pentapetalous herbs. 21. Corns. 22. Grasses. 23. Grass-leaved plants. 24. Bulbous-rooted plants. 25. Plants near akin to the bulbous.\n\nThis method Ray carefully corrected and amended at different times; so that the plan of arrangement which now bears the name of that author, and was first published in 1700, is entirely different from what had appeared in 1682. It now consists of 33 classes. Their distinguishing marks are taken from the part or habit of the plants; their greater or less degree of perfection; their place of growth; the number of seed-lobes, or seminal leaves, petals, capsules, and seeds; the situation and disposition of the flowers, flower-cup, and leaves; the absence or presence of the buds, flower-cup, and petals; the substance of the leaves and fruit; and the difficulty of clasping certain plants. They are as follow:\n\n1. Submarine, or sea plants. 2. Fungi. 3. Mollusks. 4. Capillary plants. 5. Those without petals. 6. Plinpetalate, those with compound flowers; semitofulcious, or half-florets. 7. Those with compound flowers radiated. 8. Those with compound flowers, tofulcious, or with whole florets. 9. Plants with one seed. 10. Plants umbellated. 11. Those stellated or star-shaped. 12. Rough-leaved plants. 13. Plants verticillate or whorled. 14. Those with many seeds. 15. Apple-bearing herbs. 16. Berry-bearing herbs. 17. Those with many pods. 18. Monopetalous herbs. 19. Those with two and three petals. 20. Those with great and small, or long and short pods. 21. Leguminous plants. 22. Pentapetalous ones. 23. Bulbs, and bulbous-like plants. 24. Staminate ones, or those having only the stamens. 25. Anomalous plants, or those of an uncertain family. 26. The palms. 27. Trees without petals. 28. Trees with an umbilicated fruit. 29. Trees with fruit not umbilicated. 30. Trees with a dry fruit. 31. Trees with podded fruit. 32. Anomalous or irregular trees.\n\nThe division into herbs and trees with which Ray's method sets out, acknowledges a different, though not more certain principle than that of Caesalpinus and Morison. The former, in making this division, had an eye to the duration of the stem; the latter, to its constancy. Ray called the buds as an auxiliary; and denominates trees, \"all such plants as bear buds;\" herbs, \"such as bear none.\" But against this auxiliary there lies an unanswerable objection; namely, that though all herbaceous plants rise without buds, all trees are not furnished with them: many of the largest trees in warm countries, and some shrubby plants in every country, being totally destitute of that scaly appearance which constitutes the essence of a bud. In other respects, it is evident that neither Mr Ray's plan nor execution is in any degree calculated to facilitate the knowledge of plants. In fact, it seems to have been Ray's great object, no less than Morison's, to collect as many natural classes as possible; and these being separately investigated, a multiplicity of characters and steps was necessarily required to connect them: and hence the intricacy complained of in both these methods, which must always take place where the classes give rise to the connecting characters, not the characters to the classes. The characters of the orders, or secondary divisions, in Ray's method, are no less multifarious than those of the classes. They respect the place of growth of plants; their qualities; the figure of the stem; the number, situation, substance, and division, of the leaves; the situation and disposition of the flowers and calyx; the number and regularity of the petals; with the number and figure of the fruit. In his improved method, Ray has adopted Tournefort's characters of the genera, wherever his plan would permit. His general History of Plants contains 18,655 species, and varieties. The third volume, which was not published till 1704, and was designed as a supplement to the two former, contains the plants discovered by Tournefort in the Levant, and by Camelli at Luzon one of the Philippine islands. Ray's method was followed by Sir Hans Sloane, in his Natural History of Jamaica; by Petiver, in his British Herbal; by Dillenius, in his Synopsis of British plants; and by Martin, in his Catalogue of plants that grow in the neighbourhood of Cambridge.\n\nTo Ray's original method succeeded that of Christoph Knaut, a German; which acknowledges the same Knaut's principle, and is manifestly founded upon it. In his arrangement, enumeration of the plants that grow round Hal in Saxony, published in 1687, he divides vegetables into 17 classes, which have for their basis the size and duration of plants, the presence or absence of the petals, the disposition of the flowers, the substance of the fruit, the number of capsules or seeds, the number and figure of the petals, and the presence, absence, or figure of the calyx. His classes are, 1. Herbs berry-bearing. 2. Monopetalous, or with one flower-leaf. 3. Tetrapetalous and regular, with four petals. 4. Tetrapetalous and irregular. 5. Pentapetalous, or with five petals. 6. Hexapetalous, or six petals. 7. Polypetalous, or many petals. 8. Multicapular, or many capsules. 9. Naked seeds. 10. Solid, or not downy. 11. Downy seeds. 12. Without petals. 13. Staminate, without petals or calyx. 14. Imperceptible. 15. Imperfect. 16. Trees. 17. Shrubs.\n\nThe sections or subdivisions of the classes in Knaut's method are 62 in number; and arise from the figure of the stem and petals, the number of capsules and cells, their figure, the number of seeds and leaves, and situation of the flowers.\n\nIn 1696, a new method, proposed by Dr Herman Herman's professor of botany at Leyden was published by Zum-bach, who arranged according to it the plants contained in the public garden of Leyden. Rudbeckius the Younger, in a dissertation published the same year, on the\nthe fundamental knowledge of plants, adopted Herman's method, with a few inconsiderable variations. The classes of Dr Herman are 25 in number. They are founded on the size and duration of the plants; the presence or absence of the petals and calyx; the number of capsules, cells, and naked seeds; the substance of the leaves and fruit; the form and consistence of the roots; the situation and disposition of the flowers, leaves, and calyx; and figure of the fruit.\n\n1. Herbs having one naked seed and a simple flower.\n2. Having one naked seed and a compound flower.\n3. With two naked seeds, and stellate or star-shaped.\n4. Two naked seeds, and umbelliferous.\n5. Four naked seeds, and rough leaves.\n6. Four naked seeds, and verticillated or whorl-shaped.\n7. With many naked seeds.\n8. Having seed-vessels, bulbous and tricarpular.\n9. Having one seed-vessel.\n10. With two seed-vessels.\n11. With three seed-vessels.\n12. With four seed-vessels.\n13. With five seed-vessels.\n14. Podded, which are always tetrapetalous.\n15. Leguminous and papilionaceous.\n16. With many capsules.\n17. Having fleshy fruit, berry-bearing.\n18. With fleshy fruit, apple-bearing.\n19. Without petals, but having a calyx.\n20. Without petals, chaffy or stamious.\n21. Without petals, calyx, chaff, or stamens.\n22. Trees, imperfect fructification, bearing catkins.\n23. Trees with a fleshy fruit umbilicated.\n24. Trees with a fleshy fruit not umbilicated.\n25. Trees with a dry fruit.\n\nThe classes in Herman's method are subdivided into 82 sections or orders; which have for their basis the number of petals, seeds, capsules, and cells, the figure of the seeds and petals, and disposition of the flowers.\n\nTo the method of Dr Herman succeeded that of Dr Boerhaave, who succeeded to the botanical chair of Leyden in 1709. His method is that of Herman, blended with part of the systems of Tournefort and Ray; and contains the following classes.\n\n1. Herbs submarine, or sea plants.\n2. Imperfect land plants.\n3. Capillary plants, of the fern kind.\n4. Many naked seeds.\n5. Four naked seeds, and verticillated.\n6. Four naked seeds, and rough leaves.\n7. Four naked seeds, and four petals.\n8. Plants having one seed-vessel.\n9. Two seed-vessels.\n10. Three seed-vessels.\n11. Four seed vessels.\n12. Five seed-vessels.\n13. Many seed-vessels.\n14. Two naked seeds, and umbelliferous.\n15. Two naked seeds, and star-shaped.\n16. One naked seed, and a simple flower.\n17. One naked seed and compound flowers semitofolcous.\n18. One naked seed and compound flowers radiated.\n19. One naked seed and compound flowers corymbiferous.\n20. One naked seed and compound flowers flocculous.\n21. Berry-bearing herbs.\n22. Apple-bearing herbs.\n23. Without petals.\n24. One cotyledon, and having petals.\n25. One cotyledon, and without petals.\n26. Trees having one cotyledon.\n27. Many podded.\n28. Podded.\n29. Tetrapetalous and cruciform.\n30. Leguminous.\n31. Having no petals.\n32. Bearing catkins.\n33. Monopetalous flowers.\n34. Rosaceae flowers.\n\nThese 34 classes of Dr Boerhaave are subdivided into 104 sections, which have for their characters, the figure of the leaves, stem, calyx, petals, and seeds; the number of petals, seeds, and capsules; the substance of the leaves; the situation of the flowers, and their difference in point of sex. By this method, Dr Boerhaave arranged near 6000 plants, the produce of the botanical garden at Leyden, which he carefully superintended for the space of 20 years, and left to his successor Dr Adriaen Royen, in a much more flourishing state than he himself had received it. His Index or Catalogue of the Leyden plants was published in octavo in 1710; and afterwards, with great additions, in quarto, in 1720. This last edition contains descriptions of 6550 plants; of which number upwards of two-thirds had been introduced into the garden since the time of Herman, by his illustrious successor. Boerhaave's characters are derived from the habit or general appearance of plants combined with all the parts of fructification; so that, as Linnaeus very properly observes, he was the first who employed the calyx, flamina, and style, in determining the genus. About 17 new genera were established by this author; among others, the very splendid family of the protea and silver tree, which, although partly described by Morrison, had remained generally unknown till this period. His method was adopted by one Embling, a German, in a treatise entitled The fifth Principle of Botany, published in octavo at Wolfenbuttle, in 1743.\n\nHitherto all the botanists had been intent upon investigating the order of nature, rather than facilitating the arrangement of vegetables; therefore their methods were very intricate and perplexed; and their writings, however entertaining to the learned, could afford but very little instruction to the young botanist. In 1690, however, Augustus Quirinus Rivinus, a German, professor of botany at Leipzig, relinquishing the pursuit of natural affinities, and convinced of the insufficiency of characteristic marks drawn only from the fruit, attached himself to the flower, which, he was sensible, would furnish characters no less numerous, permanent, and conspicuous, than those drawn from the fruit. The calyx, petals, flamina, and style, or pointal, which constitute the flower, are sufficiently diversified in point of number, figure, proportion, and situation, to serve as the basis of a mode of arrangement; yet all are not equally proper for this purpose. Rivinus made use of the petals as the largest and most beautiful part, and that from which the flower itself is commonly characterized. His method consists in the following 18 classes, which have for their basis the perfection and disposition of the flowers, and regularity and number of the petals.\n\n1. Regular monopetalous, or having one petal.\n2. Dipetalous.\n3. Tripetalous.\n4. Tetrapetalous.\n5. Pentapetalous.\n6. Hexapetalous.\n7. Poly-petalous, or having many petals.\n8. Irregular monopetalous.\n9. Irregular dipetalous.\n10. Irregular tripetalous.\n11. Irregular tetrapetalous.\n12. Irregular pentapetalous.\n13. Irregular hexapetalous.\n14. Irregular poly-petalous.\n15. Compound flowers of regular and irregular florets.\n16. Compound flowers of regular and irregular florets only.\n17. Compound flowers of irregular florets.\n18. Incomplete, or imperfect plants.\n\nAs Rivinus set out with the professed design of imparting facility to botany, he judged very properly in divesting his method of all extraneous matter, and rendering it as simple and uniform as the nature of the science would admit. The distinction into herbs and trees had been adopted by every writer on plants since the time of Aristotle. Rendered in some measure favored by its antiquity, this distinction maintained a kind of\nof importance to which it was by no means essentially entitled. Rivinus was the first who in this matter dared to think for himself. He was early sensible of the inconveniences to which those had submitted who employed it as a primary division; and therefore resolved at once to get rid of a distinction that is frequently uncertain, always destructive to uniformity, and in its nature repugnant to the genuine spirit of system, because totally unconnected with the parts of fructification. In the uniformity of its orders or secondary divisions, which are 91 in number, and acknowledge the fruit for their principle, Rivinus's method equals, perhaps excels, all that went before or succeeded it. Only three clauses of his method were published by Rivinus himself. These are the 11th, 14th, and 15th, which were offered to the public at different times, illustrated with very splendid figures. The method was completed and published entire by Heucher, in a work entitled *Hortus Wirtenbergensis*, printed in quarto at W\u00fcrtenberg in 1711.\n\nFollowers of Rivinus.\n\nSeveral German authors have followed Rivinus's method, either wholly or in part, without offering any considerable amendment. The principal of these are, Koenig, in a work on vegetables, published at Basle in 1696; Welch, in his *Basile Botanica*, printed at Leipzig in octavo, in 1697; Gemeinhardt, in a catalogue of plants published in 1723; Kramer, in a work entitled *Tentamen Botanicum*, published at Dresden in 1728, and afterwards reprinted with additions at Vienna in 1744; and Hecker in a dissertation on botany published at Hal in Saxony, in 1734. To these may be added Hebenstreit, an ingenious botanist, who in a treatise on plants published at Leipzig in 1731, just before his famous African expedition, established generic characters, which had hitherto been wanting in Rivinus's method.\n\nThe writers who have attempted to improve upon Rivinus's method are Bernard Ruppius, Christopher Ludwig, and Christian Knaut. Ruppius, in his *Flora Jenensis*, published at Francfort in 1718, has arranged the 1200 plants there described by a method partly Rivinus's and partly his own. It consists of 17 clauses, and sets out with the same divisions and subdivisions as that of Rivinus's; with this difference, however, that, whereas in Rivinus's method all perfect flowers are divided into simple and compound, in Ruppius the division of regular and irregular flowers precedes that just mentioned, and simple and compound flowers are made subdivisions of the regular flowers only.\n\nChristopher Ludwig's method.\n\nChristopher Ludwig's method, which was published in 1737, and consists of 20 clauses, differs but little from that of Rivinus. The author accompanied Hebenstreit on his expedition to Africa, and seems to have made plants his favourite study. The improvement, however, which he has made on Rivinus's plan, consists only in rendering it more universal, having enriched it with a multitude of genera collected from the works of Tournefort, Ray, Boerhaave, Dillenius, and other eminent botanists, whose generic characters he has likewise adopted. His plan of arrangement has been followed by two succeeding writers: M. Wedel, in a botanical essay published in 1747; and three years after by M. Bochmer, in his catalogue of the plants which grow in the garden of Leipzig.\n\nThe method of Christian Knaut is much more properly his own, and departs in a much greater degree from that of Rivinus than either of the two former. The regularity and number of the petals furnished the classical divisions in Rivinus's method: in that of Knaut, Christian name takes place of regularity; so that it is very pro. Knaut's perly termed by Linnaeus, \"The system of Rivinus inverted.\" This method was published in 1716; and sets out with a division into flowers which have one petal, and such as have more than one. It consists of the following clauses. 1. Monopetalous uniform or regular. 2. Monopetalous disform or irregular. 3. Monopetalous compound uniform or regular. 4. Monopetalous compound disform or irregular. 5. Monopetalous compound uniform and disform together. 6. Dipetalous uniform or regular. 7. Dipetalous disform or irregular. 8. Tripetalous uniform or regular. 9. Tripetalous disform or irregular. 10. Tetrapetalous uniform or regular. 11. Tetrapetalous disform or irregular. 12. Pentapetalous uniform or regular. 13. Pentapetalous disform or irregular. 14. Hexapetalous uniform or regular. 15. Hexapetalous disform or irregular. 16. Polypetalous uniform or regular. 17. Polypetalous disform or irregular.\n\nThe sections or secondary divisions in Knaut's method are 121, and depend upon the internal divisions of the fruit; and upon this his opinions are somewhat singular. Every kind of fruit, whether pulpy or membranaceous, is termed by our author a capsule. Neither is the term restricted to fruits properly so called: it is extended also to those termed by botanists naked seeds, the existence of which Knaut absolutely denies. Agreeable to this opinion, capsules, he says, with respect to their consistence or substance, are of two sorts; pulpy, or membranaceous. The former correspond to the fruits of the apple, berry, and cherry kind; the latter to the capsules properly so called, and naked seeds of other botanists. Again, with respect to their cells or internal divisions, capsules are either simple or compound. Simple capsules have an undivided cavity or a single cell; compound capsules are internally divided into two or more cells. With other botanists, the umbelliferous flowers bear two, the lip flowers four, naked seeds; according to Knaut, the former produce two, the latter four, simple capsules. Ranunculus, adonis, anemony, herb-bennet, and some other plants, have their flowers succeeded by a number of naked seeds collected into an aggregate or head; each of these seeds passes with Knaut for a simple capsule; so that the whole is an aggregate of several capsules with an undivided cavity or single cell. In numbering the cells or internal divisions of the pulpy fruits, our author has adopted a very singular method. Some fruits of the apple kind enclose a capsule that is divided into five membranaceous cells. It might then be very reasonably expected to find such fruits arranged with compound capsules of five cells: but, instead of this, the author whimsically enough combines in their arrangement the idea both of a simple and compound capsule. The pulpy part is undivided; in other words, it is a simple capsule furnished with one cell; the compound capsule enclosed contains five cells, which added to that of the pulp make the number six; and thus these kinds of fruits are arranged with those having capsules of six cells. By the same kind of reasoning, the fruit of the dogwood, which is of the cherry kind, and contains a stone-\nstone with two cells or cavities, is placed by Knaut among compound capsules with three cells; the pulp falling for one division, and cavities of the stone or nut for the remaining two. This method of calculation is not the only singularity for which Knaut is remarkable. The essence of the flower is made by Ray, Tournefort, Rivinus, and most other botanists, to consist in the flaming and style. This position Knaut absolutely denies; and has established for a principle, that the flower is essentially constituted by the petals only. With him, the flower cup, stamens, and style, are of little significance: their presence does not constitute a flower, if the petals are wanting; neither is their absence sufficient to destroy its existence, if the petals are present: from this it follows, 1. That there can be no flowers without petals; and, 2. That the regularity or irregularity of the flower can never depend on the flaming and style, which are only occasionally present, and not essential to its existence; both of which are evidently false to every botanical reader.\n\nSince the time of Rivinus, no leading method in botany has appeared except that of Tournefort and Linnaeus. Tournefort sets out with reviving the distinction of plants into herbs and trees, which had been exploded by Rivinus. His system is founded on the regularity and figure of the petals, together with the twofold situation of the receptacle of the flowers; his orders, on the pistillum or calyx. The classes are:\n\n1. Herbs with simple flowers monopetalous, and bell-shaped.\n2. Simple flowers monopetalous, tunnel and wheel-shaped.\n3. Simple flowers monopetalous, labiate or lipped.\n4. Simple flowers monopetalous, anomalous or irregular.\n5. Simple flowers polypetalous cruciform or cross-shaped.\n6. Simple flowers polypetalous, rosaceous or rose-like.\n7. Simple flowers polypetalous, umbellated.\n8. Simple flowers polypetalous, caryophyllaceous, or clove-form.\n9. Simple flowers polypetalous, lilaceous or lily-form.\n10. Simple flowers polypetalous, papilionaceous, or butterfly-form.\n11. Simple flowers polypetalous, anomalous or irregular.\n12. Compound flowers, flocculous, tubular or whole florets.\n13. Compound flowers, fimbriate, flat or half florets.\n14. Compound flowers radiated, like the spokes of a wheel.\n15. Apetalous, having no petals.\n16. No flower, but bearing seed.\n17. No flower nor seed, in the vulgar estimation.\n18. Trees with no petals, but bare stamens.\n19. Trees with no petals bearing catkins.\n20. Trees monopetalous.\n21. Trees rosaceous.\n22. Trees papilionaceous.\n\nThe secondary divisions in Tournefort's method, which are 122 in number, have obtained the name of sections. Their general distinctions are founded principally upon the fruit, as those of the classes are upon the flower.\n\nTournefort hath been followed by a vast number of botanical writers, of whom the most considerable are, Dr William Sherard, an eminent botanist of the last and present centuries. In 1689, he published the first sketch of Tournefort's method, under the title of Schola Botanica; or a catalogue of the plants demonstrated by Dr Tournefort, in the royal garden at Paris. It was not till five years after, that the Elementa Botanica, a work which contains the rudiments and illustration of his method, was published by Tournefort himself.\n\nFather Plumier, termed by way of eminence the Tournefort of America, published in 1703, at Paris, a description of American plants, which he has arranged according to the system of Tournefort. In this work he accurately characterized 96 new genera. Falugi, an Italian, has described, in pretty elegant Latin verse, all the genera of Tournefort, in a work entitled Proprietarum Botanicarum, published at Florence, 1700, 1705.\n\nSeveral celebrated French academicians, particularly Marchant, Dodart, Niffle, Joffre, and Vaillant, have also occasionally paid their tribute of acknowledgement to this author, from the year 1700 to 1740. The other authors of note who have followed Tournefort's method, are, M. Petit, an ingenious French botanist; Johren, a German, author of a treatise published at Colberg in 1710, entitled Vade mecum Botanicum, seu Odeum Botanicum; Fucaille, in his description of the plants of Chili and Peru, published at Paris in quarto, 1714; Christopher Valentin, a German author of a book entitled Tournefortius Contractus, published at Frankfort, in folio, 1715; Ripa, an Italian, in a work entitled Historia Universalis Plantarum Conferendi Propositi, published in quarto, at Padua, in 1718; Michael Valentin, a German, in his Vivarium Reformatum, published in folio, at Frankfort, in 1719; the celebrated Dillenius, professor of botany at Oxford, and author of several much esteemed publications on botany, particularly the Hortus Elthamensis, and History of Mosses, in his Flora Giftenis, printed at Frankfort in 1719; Pontedera, an Italian, author of the delineation of a method which combines those of Tournefort and Rivinus, published at Padua, in his botanical dissertations, in 1720; Monti, an Italian, in a work published at Bologna in 1724, under the title of Indices Plantarum Varii; Lindem, a German, in his Tournefortius Allaticus, first published in 1728; Signor Michelini, author of several curious discoveries respecting mosses and mushrooms, in his Nova Genera Plantarum, published in folio at Florence in 1729; Elvebenes, a Swede, in a work published in the Swedish language at Upsal in 1730; Fabricius, a German, author of a work entitled Primitiae Florae Butiaceae, seu sex Decades Plantarum Rariorum, published in 1743; Sabatini, an Italian, in his catalogue of the plants that grow in the neighbourhood of Rome, printed at Rome in 1745; and the ingenious Dr Charles Alston, late professor of botany at Edinburgh, in his Tyrocinium Botanicum, published at Edinburgh in 1753.\n\nOf all this numerous list of writers, Father Plumier Plumier's and Pontedera alone have ventured to quit the track method pointed out by Tournefort. The former, in his arrangement of American plants, has relinquished the distinction into herbs and trees; but the latter has attempted more considerable variations. His classes are:\n\n1. Uncertain.\n2. Having no flowers.\n3. Without buds, imperfect plants.\n4. Anomalous or irregular.\n5. Labiate.\n6. Bell-shaped.\n7. Saucer-shaped.\n8. Wheel-shaped.\n9. Tunnel-shaped.\n10. Flocculous.\n11. Semiflocculous.\n12. Radiated.\n13. Irregular.\n14. Papilionaceous.\n15. Liliaceous.\n16. Caryophyllaceous.\n17. Cruciform or cross-shaped.\n18. Umbellated.\n19. Staminate, or with naked stamens.\n20. Bearing buds apetalous, or without petals.\n21. Bearing buds irregular.\n22. Bearing buds bell-shaped.\n23. Bearing\ning buds wheel-shaped. 24. Bearing buds tunnel-shaped. 25. Bearing buds papilionaceous. 26. Bearing buds rosaceous.\n\nBesides all these methods, there have been invented two others, founded upon the calyx. The first of these was the invention of Peter Magnol, a celebrated professor of botany at Montpellier, and published in 1720, five years after the author's death. The other was delineated by Linnaeus, and published in his *Classe Planatarum* in 1738, three years after the publication of the sexual system. Magnol distinguishes two kinds of calyx; one external, which envelopes and sustains the flower, and is the flower-cup properly so called; the other internal, which is the feed-vessel or fruit. According to this idea, all plants, whether herbaceous or woody, are furnished with either the external calyx only, or with both. His classes are, 1. Herbs with the calyx external, including a flower unknown. 2. Calyx external, including a flower staminous. 3. Calyx external, including a flower monopetalous. 4. Calyx external, including a flower polypetalous. 5. Calyx external, including a flower compound. 6. Calyx external, supporting a flower monopetalous. 7. Calyx external, supporting a flower polypetalous. 8. Calyx internal only, which is the corolla. 9. Calyx external and internal, flower monopetalous. 10. Calyx external and internal, flower with two and three petals. 11. Calyx external and internal, tetrapetalous. 12. Calyx external and internal, polypetalous. 13. Trees with the calyx external only. 14. Calyx internal only. 15. Calyx external and internal both.\n\nThe characters of the orders, or secondary divisions, in Magnol's method, are derived chiefly from the figure of the calyx, petals, and seeds; from the disposition of the flowers; from the number of petals, and substance of the fruit. Fifty-five sections or orders arise from the combination of these characters with those of the classes; and these are again subdivided into genera, which possess this singularity, that, in place of distinctive characters hitherto employed, they exhibit complete descriptions of all the parts of fructification of one or two species of each genus. From this improvement Linnaeus manifestly borrowed the hint of his generic characters.\n\nSir John Hill, in his Vegetable System, endeavours to class plants according to their internal structure*. \"Perhaps (says he), upon the foundation of a true anatomy of plants a natural method may be established; for it is certain, the forms of all the external parts of vegetables depend on the disposition of the internal; and all their differences are founded there. On the different inner structure of the vegetable body, under certain courses of its vessels, evidently depend the differences which characterize the seven first families, to the distinctions of which all classes are subordinate; and as these original distinctions are truly natural, we may here begin very safely.\n\n\"The seven families are these, 1. The mushrooms. 2. The algae, or foliaceous sea and land plants. 3. The mosses. 4. The ferns. 5. The griffes. 6. The palms. 7. The common race of plants. Their distinctions one from another are these:\n\n1. The mushrooms are fleshy; and are destitute of leaves and visible flowers. 2. The algae are merely foliaceous, the entire plant consisting of a leafy matter without other visible parts. 3. The mosses have processes of the inner rind for leaves. 4. The ferns consist of a single leaf raised on a stalk; and bear their flowers upon its back. 5. The griffes have jointed stalks and undivided leaves, and hulls to hold the seeds. 6. The palms have a simple trunk, with leaves only on the top, and have the flowers and fruit in divided ears.\"\n\nLastly, The seventh class, which he calls the common race of plants, are such as have their roots, leaves, stalks, flowers and fruits, distinct and obvious; and have not the characters of any of the other six families.\n\nTo this natural method his artificial one, consisting of 43 classes, and which takes up the whole of his voluminous work, is designed only as an index; but as this is universally allowed to be inferior to Linnaeus's, though he intends to improve that system, we think it needless to take any further notice of it.\n\nBesides the sexual system of Linnaeus, which is now almost universally followed, he formed another, which arrangement by like that of Magnol, had the calyx for its basis, but the calyx greatly superior both in the idea and execution, being indeed singularly serviceable to the novice in botany, by familiarizing to him various appearances of an organ so important in its nature, and so diversified in its form, as the calyx is. The classes are, 1. Spatheaceous, like a sheath or hose. 2. Glumose or chaffy. 3. Amentaceous, or catkins. 4. Umbellated. 5. Common calyx or flower-cup. 6. Double calyx. 7. Flowering; the petals and stamina inserted into the flower-cup. 8. Crowned, or crown-shaped, with a radius. 9. Irregular. 10. Diffuse, or different shapes. 11. Caducous, which fall off or shed their leaves. 12. Not caducous, uniform and monopetalous. 13. Not caducous, uniform and polypetalous. 14. Not caducous, diffuse and monopetalous. 15. Not caducous, diffuse and polypetalous. 16. Incomplete calyx. 17. Apetalous, or a bare calyx without petals. 18. Naked, or neither petals nor calyx.\n\nSect. IV. Of the Sexes of Plants.\n\nAs many philosophers and botanists deny that such a thing as the distinction of sexes takes place in vegetables, it will be necessary to give a statement of the arguments employed by both parties on this subject. We shall begin with the arguments in favour of the sexes.\n\nI. Linnaeus is at great pains in tracing the notion Sexual of sexes in plants to the remotest periods of antiquity. He informs us, that Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and ancient other ancient philosophers, not only attributed the distinction of sexes to plants, but maintained that they were capable of perceiving pleasure and pain.\n\nHippocrates and Theophrastus are next introduced as distinguishing the conva, the abies, the filix, &c., into male and female. The latter of these writers affirms that the fruit of the female palm will not germinate, unless the pollen of the male be shaken over the spathe of the female previous to the ripening of the seed.\n\nDioscorides takes notice of a male and female mandragora, mercurialis, ciftus, &c.\n\nPliny\nPliny does not confine his views of sex to animals, but exclaims, that every thing this earth produces is characterized by the distinction of sex.\n\nFrom the days of Pliny to those of Casalpinus, who lived in the 16th century, the analogy between the vegetable and animal seems to have been entirely neglected. Casalpinus tells us, that the males of the oxycedrus, taxus, mercurialis, urtica, and cannabis, are barren; and that the females of these plants only bear fruit.\n\nAfter Casalpinus, we find Dr Grew and Sir Thomas Millington engaged in a conversation concerning the utility of the stamens and styli of plants. The result of this conversation was the mutual agreement of these two eminent naturalists, that the stamens and styli of vegetables were analogous to the organs of generation in animals, and that they were adapted by nature to answer the same purposes. Dr Grew, in his anatomy of plants, after enumerating the analogies between plants and animals, concludes, that the pollen probably emits certain vivific effluvia, which may serve for the impregnation of the seeds.\n\nMr Ray gave a further sanction to the doctrine of sexes, by concurring with Grew, and adding some further illustrations from analogy.\n\nIn the year 1695, Camerarius attempted to prove the sexes of plants. But, as he trusted solely to the palm-tree, and withal seemed to be doubtful as to the authenticity of the fact, he cannot be considered as having done anything in confirmation of the sexual hypothesis.\n\nMr Morland, in the year 1703, adopted the same hypothesis; but gave it a new modification, by supposing that the pollen contained the seminal plant in miniature, and consequently that it behoved one pollen at least to be conveyed into every separate seed before it could be properly impregnated. Analogy and the structure of the parts are the only arguments he employs.\n\nSome years after this, Mr Geoffroy wrote a treatise on the sexes of plants: but as he advanced nothing new, we shall take no farther notice of him.\n\nVaillant, in the year 1717, judiciously considering that the canal in the stylus of most plants was too narrow to admit the pollen itself, republished Dr Grew's theory of impregnation by means of a subtile seminal aura.\n\nThese are the sentiments of the principal botanists with regard to the generation of plants, till the celebrated Linnaeus made his appearance as a botanical writer, who has extended the idea so far as to compose a complete system upon it.\n\nAlthough Linnaeus can have no claim to the supposed discovery of the sexual hypothesis, his being precisely the same with that of Dr Grew; yet, as he is the chief supporter and improver of this doctrine, we shall give a succinct narration of the arguments he makes use of in order to prove that vegetables propagate their species by a regular commerce of sexes.\n\nIn a treatise entitled, Spongia Plantarum, published as an inaugural dissertation by Wahlbom, in the first volume of the Amoenitates Academicae, all the arguments made use of by Linnaeus in his Fundamenta Botanica, and other works, are collected and arranged in one view. But as Wahlbom honestly attributes all the merit of this dissertation to his great master, we shall here drop his name altogether, and give the arguments as the property of Linnaeus, by whom they were originally employed.\n\nLinnaeus, then, first attempts to show, that vegetables are endowed with a certain degree of life; and, secondly, that they propagate their species in a manner similar to that of animals.\n\n\"That vegetables are really living beings (says he), Vegetables must be obvious at first sight; because they possess all perfect life, the properties contained in that accurate definition of life laid down by the great Dr Harvey, namely, Vita eft spontanea propulsio humorum. But universal experience teaches, that vegetables propel humours or juices; hence it is plain that vegetables must be endowed with a certain degree of life.\"\n\nNot trifling solely to a syllogism founded on a definition, Linnaeus proceeds to support the life of vegetables by arguments drawn from the following particulars in their economy; the first of which he entitles,\n\n\"1. Nutritio.\u2014The very idea of nutrition implies a propulsion of humours, and of course the idea of life. But vegetables derive their nourishment from the earth, air, &c. and consequently must be considered as living creatures.\n\n\"2. Aetas.\u2014Every animal must not only begin to exist, and have that existence dissolved by death, but must likewise pass through a number of intermediate changes in its appearance and affections. Infancy, youth, manhood, old age, are characterized by imbecility, beauty, fertility, dotage. Are not all these vicissitudes conspicuous in the vegetable world? Weak and tender in infancy; beautiful and florid in youth; grave, robust, and fruitful, in manhood; and when old age approaches, the head droops, the springs of life dry up, and, in fine, the poor tottering vegetable returns to that dust from whence it sprung.\n\n\"3. Motus.\u2014No inanimate body is capable of self-motion. Whatever moves spontaneously, is endowed with a living principle: for motion depends on the spontaneous propulsion of humours; and wherever there is a spontaneous propulsion of humours, there also is life. That vegetables are capable of motion, is evident from the following facts: Plants, when confined within doors, always bend towards the light, and some of them even attempt to make their escape by the windows. The flowers of many plants, especially those of the syngenesia clasps, pursue the sun from east to west, rejoicing in his beams. Who then can deny that vegetables are possessed of living and self-moving powers?\n\n\"4. Morbus.\u2014The term diffece means nothing more than a certain corruption of life. It is well known, that vegetables are subject to diseases as well as animals: when over-heated, they turn thirsty, languish, and fall to the ground; when too cold, they are tormented with the chillblain, and not unfrequently expire; they are sometimes afflicted with cancers; and every plant is infested with lice peculiar to its species.\n\n\"5. Mortuus.\u2014Death is opposed to life, the former being only a privation of the latter. Experience shows that every living creature must die. But as vegetables are daily cut off by internal diseases and external injuries; as they are subject to death from the attacks of hunger,\"\nhunger, thirst, heat, cold, &c. with what propriety could vegetables be thus said to die, unless we allow that they previously lived?\n\n\"6. Anatomia.\u2014Under this article we are referred to Malpighius and Grew for the organic fibres, membranes, canals, vehicles, &c. of plants, as additional proofs of their living powers.\n\n\"7. Organization.\u2014Vegetables not only propel humours, but also prepare and secrete a number of different juices for the fruit, the nectar, &c., analogous to the various secretions in animal bodies.\"\n\nFrom these facts and observations, Linnaeus concludes, that plants are unquestionably endowed with life as well as animals; and then proceeds in the following manner to show how these animated vegetables propagate their species.\n\nAfter discussing the long-explored doctrine of equivoval generation, he lays hold of another maxim of Dr. Harvey, viz. Omne vivum ex ovo.\u2014\"It being fully evident (says he), from the foregoing chain of reasoning, that vegetables are endowed with life, it necessarily follows, agreeable to this maxim of Harvey's, that every vegetable must in like manner derive its existence from an egg. But as vegetables proceed from eggs, and as it is the distinguishing property of an egg to give birth to a being similar to that which produced it, the seeds must of course be the eggs of vegetables.\n\n\"Granting then that the seeds of vegetables are intended by nature to answer the same end as the eggs of animals, and considering at the same time that no egg can be fecundated without receiving an impregnation from the male, it follows, that the seed or eggs of vegetables cannot be fecundated by any other means. Hence also the necessity of vegetables being provided with organs of generation. But where are these organs situated? The answer is easy:\u2014We have already found impregnated seeds within the flowers of plants; and it is natural to expect that the genitalia should not be at a greater distance. Now, as copulation always precedes birth, and every flower precedes the fruit, the generating faculty must be ascribed to the flower, and the birth to the fruit. Again, as the anthera and stigma are the only essential parts of flowers, these parts must necessarily be the organs of generation.\"\n\nBeing thus far advanced, Linnaeus affirms, that the anthera are the testes, and that the pollen performs the office of the male semen. These affirmations he attempts to establish by the following arguments; the first of which he terms\n\n\"1. Precedentia.\u2014The anthera, or vegetable testes, always precede the fruit; and as soon as the anthera come to maturity, which constantly happens before the maturity of the fruit, they continue to throw out their pollen as long as the flower lasts; but decay and fall off whenever the fruit comes to perfection.\n\n\"2. Situs.\u2014The anthera of all plants are uniformly situated in such a manner that the pollen may with the greatest facility fall upon the stigma or female organ.\n\n\"3. Tempus.\u2014The anthera and stigma always flourish at the same time, whether the flowers be of the hermaphrodite or dioecious kind.\n\n\"4. Loculamenta.\u2014When the anthera are dissected, they discover as great a variety of structure as the pericarpia or seed-capsules; for some of them have one cell, as the mercury; some two, as the hellebore, &c.\n\n\"5. Castration.\u2014If all the anthera be cut off from a hermaphrodite plant, just before the flowers begin to expand, taking care at the same time that no plant of the same species grow near it, the fruit will either prove entirely abortive, or produce barren seeds.\n\n\"6. Figura.\u2014When the pollen of different plants is examined by the microscope, it exhibits as great a variety of figures as is discoverable in the seeds themselves.\n\n\"The accumulated force of these arguments (concludes Linnaeus) amounts to a full demonstration that the anthera are the testes, and that the pollen is the semen or genitura of vegetables.\n\n\"The male organ being thus investigated, we hope (says Linnaeus) that none will hesitate to pronounce the stigma to be the female organ, especially when the following observations are attended to.\n\n\"The pistillum is composed of the germen, stylus, and stigma. The germen, being only a kind of rudiment of the future fetus or seed, ceases to exist as soon as the flower comes to maturity. Neither is the stylus an essential part, as many flowers have no stylus. But no fruit ever comes to maturity without the assistance of the stigma. It follows, that the stigma must be the female organ adapted by nature for the reception of the pollen or impregnating substance. This will appear still clearer from the following chain of reasoning.\n\n\"1. Situs.\u2014The stigmata are always situated so that the pollen may with most ease fall upon them. Besides, it is remarkable, that in most plants (though not in all) the number of the stigmata exactly corresponds with the loculae or cells of the pericarpium.\n\n\"2. Tempus.\u2014Here the observation, that the stigmata and anthera constantly flourish at the same time, is repeated.\n\n\"3. Decidencia.\u2014The stigmata of most plants, like the anthera, decay and fall off as soon as they have discharged their proper function; which evidently shows, that their office is not to ripen the fruit, but solely to answer the important purpose of impregnation.\n\n\"4. Adjectio.\u2014The argument here is precisely the same with the castration of the anthera; and the result is likewise the same, namely the destruction of the fruit.\n\n\"These arguments (concludes Linnaeus) are sufficient to demonstrate, that the stigma is the female organ of generation, or that organ which is fitted for the reception and conveyance of the semen to the vegetable eggs. Hence plants may be said to be in actu venerei, when the anthera or telesculi spread their pollen over the stigma or female vulva.\"\n\nTo show how the coitus of vegetables is effected, is our author's next object of investigation. He affirms, that the pollen is conveyed, by means of the wind or insects, to the moist stigma, where it remains until it discharges a subtile fluid, which being absorbed by the vessels of the stigma, is carried to the seeds or ova, and impregnates them. His proofs are taken from the following particulars.\n\n\"1. Oculus.\u2014When the flowers are in full blow, and the pollen flying about, every one may then see the pollen adhering to the stigma. This he illustrates by mentioning...\"\nmentioning as examples the viola tricolor, iris, campa-\nnula, &c.\n\n\"2. Proprio.\u2014The stamens and pistillae, in most\nplants, are of equal heights, so that the pollen, by the in-\ntervention of the wind may, with the greater facility,\nfall upon the stigma.\n\n\"3. Locus.\u2014The stamens of most plants surround\nthe pistillum, to give the pollen an opportunity of fall-\ning upon the stigma at every breeze of wind. Even in\nthe monocotyledons, the male flowers stand generally a-\nbove the female ones, to afford an easier conveyance of\nthe pollen to the stigma.\n\n\"4. Tempus.\u2014It is remarkable that the stamens and\npistillae constantly appear at the same time, even in plants\nbelonging to the monocotyledons.\n\n\"5. Pluviae.\u2014The flowers of most plants expand by\nthe heat of the sun, and shut themselves up in the evening\nor in rainy weather. The final cause of this must\nbe to keep the moisture from the pollen, lest it should\nbe thereby coagulated, and of course prevented from\nbeing blown upon the stigma.\n\n\"6. Palincoles.\u2014That the cultivators of palm-trees\nwere in use to pull off the spathe from the males, and\nsuspend them over the spathe of the females, is attested\nby Theophrastus, Pliny, Prosper Alpinus, Kempfer,\nand many others. If this operation happened to be\nneglected, the dates were four and deflature of nuts.\nKempfer adds this singular circumstance, that the male\nspadix, after being thoroughly dried and kept till next\nseason, still retained its impregnating virtue.\n\n\"7. Flores nutant\u00e6.\u2014As the pollen is specifically\nheavier than air, such flowers as have their pistillum\nlonger than the stamens, hang down, or incline to one\nside, e.g., the fritillaria, campanula, &c. An easy ad-\nmission of the pollen to the stigma is the final cause of\nthis appearance.\n\n\"8. Submersi.\u2014Many plants that grow below wa-\nter, emerge when their flowers begin to blow, and swim\nupon the surface till they receive their impregnation,\nand then sink down.\n\n\"9. Omnium florum genuina consideratio.\"\u2014Here a\nnumber of particulars are recited. We shall confine\nourselves to those that are most striking and applicable\nto the subject.\n\n\"When the flowers of the male hemp are pulled off\nbefore those of the female are fully expanded, the fe-\nmales do not produce fertile seeds. But as a male flower\nis sometimes found upon a female plant, this may be the\nreason why fertile seeds are sometimes produced even\nafter this precaution has been observed.\n\n\"The tulip affords another experiment of the same\npurpose. Cut off all the anthers of a red tulip before\nthe pollen is emitted; then take the ripe anther of a\nwhite tulip, and throw the pollen of the white one upon\nthe stigma of the red; the seeds of the red tulip being\nthus impregnated by one of a different complexion, will\nnext season produce some red, some white, but most\nvariegated flowers.\"\n\nIn the year 1744, Linnaeus published a description of\na new genus which he called peloria, on the supposition\nof its being a hybrid or mule plant, i.e., a plant pro-\nduced by an unnatural commixture of two different\ngenera. The root, leaves, caulis, &c., of this plant are\nexceedingly similar to those of the antirrhinum lindera;\nbut the flower and other parts of the fructification are\ntotally different. On account of its similarity to the li-\nnaria in every part but the flower, Linnaeus imagined it\nto have been produced by a fortuitous commixture of ne-\nlinaria with some other plant, although he has never yet been able to point out the father. This doctrine\nof the production of mule plants has since been greatly\nprized, and carefully propagated, by Linnaeus and the\nother supporters of the sexual hypothesis. In the third\nvolume of the \"Amoenitates Academicae,\" there is a com-\nplete dissertation, entitled \"Plante Hybride,\" wherein the\ndoctrine of vegetable mules is much improved and ex-\ntended. This dissertation contains a list of 47 mules,\nwith their supposed fathers and mothers. For exam-\nple,\n\nThe Veronica spuria is said to be a mule plant begot\nby the Verbena officinalis upon the Veronica mar-\nitimana.\n\nThe Delphinium hybridum, a mule begot by the Aconi-\ntum napellus upon the Delphinium elatum.\n\nThe Arctotis calendula, a mule begot by the Calendula\npluvialis upon the Arctotis tritis.\n\nThe Aesculus nigra, a mule begot by the Cynanchum\nacutum upon the Aesculus vinctocicum, &c.\n\nFrom the examples given in this dissertation, Lin-\nnaeus draws this conclusion, That only two species of\neach genus existed ab origine; and that all the variety\nof species which now appear have been produced by\nunnatural embraces betwixt species of different genera.\n\nUnder this head Linnaeus likewise quotes from Ray\nthe story of Richard Baal gardener at Brentford. This\nBaal sold a large quantity of the seeds of the brassica\nflorida to several gardeners in the suburbs of London.\nThese gardeners, after sowing their seeds in the usual\nmanner, were surprised to find them turn out to be\nplants of a different species from that which Baal made\nthem believe they had purchased; for, instead of the\nbrassica florida, the plants turned out to be the brassica\nlongifolia. The gardeners, upon making the discovery,\ncommenced a prosecution of fraud against Baal in West-\nminster-hall. The court found Baal guilty of fraud,\nand decreed him not only to restore the price of the\nseeds, but likewise to pay the gardeners for their lost\ntime, and the use of their ground. \"Had these judges\n(fays Linnaeus) been acquainted with the sexual hy-\npothesis, they would not have found Baal guilty of any\ncrime, but would have ascribed the accident to the for-\ntuitous impregnation of the brassica florida by the pollen\nof the brassica longifolia.\"\n\nLinnaeus next proceeds to celebrate the utility of in-\nsects, because they convey the pollen of the male to the\nstigma of the female. \"In this way (says he), it is\nreasonable to think that many dioecious plants are im-\npregnated. Nay, even the hermaphrodites themselves\nare greatly obliged to the different tribes of insects,\nwhich, by fluttering and treading in the cotilla, are\nconstantly scattering the pollen about the stigma.\n\n\"Upon the whole then, (concludes Linnaeus), the\ncoitus of vegetables is evident to a demonstration. This\ncoitus is nothing more than the conveyance of the pol-\nlen to the stigma, to which it adheres till it bursts, and\ndischarges a subtile elastic fluid. This fluid or aura is\nabsorbed by the vessels of the stylus, and carried directly\nto the ovarium or germen, where the mysterious work\nof impregnation is fully completed.\"\n\nThese are the arguments employed by Linnaeus and\nother\nother advocates for the sexual commerce of vegetables.\n\nLet us next attend to those employed by the opposers of this hypothesis.\n\nIt is admitted by Pontedera, Dr Alston, &c., that some of the ancients applied the terms male and female to several plants; but then they deny that these terms conveyed the same ideas to the ancients that they do to the moderns. Male and female, when applied to plants, were to the ancients mere terms of distinction, serving only as trivial names to distinguish one species or variety from another. The ancients were ignorant of the very characters which constitute the difference between what is called a male and female plant among the moderns. Theophrastus, Dioscorides, Pliny, and, in a word, the whole ancient botanical writers, confound the very notion of the modern sexes: they call the real female, or seed-bearing plant, the male; and the male, or barren plant, the female. Nay, they have even applied the terms male and female to many plants which bear nothing but hermaphrodite flowers.\n\nSuch is the nature of this controversy, that it cannot be determined with any degree of certainty, but by experiments made upon dioecious plants. If a female plant can produce fertile seeds without having any communication with the pollen of the male, the use of this pollen with respect to the impregnation of seeds must of necessity be entirely superseded.\n\nNow, both Camerarius and Dr Alston tried these experiments with the same success. These two eminent botanists took female plants of the mercury, spinach, and hemp; transplanted them at a great distance from any males of the same genus, and besides had them enclosed by double rows of hedges. The result was, that each of these plants produced great quantities of fertile seeds. Tournefort made the same trial upon the lupulus, Miller upon the bryony, and Geoffroy upon the mays; and all of them declared that the seeds of these plants were as fertile as if they had been surrounded by a thousand males.\n\nLinnaeus, in his first argument for the coitus of plants, refers every man to the evidence of his senses.\n\n\"Do we not see (says he) the stigma of almost every hermaphrodite flower covered over with the pollen or impregnating substance? Do not we see the pietaria, the urtica, &c., by violent explosions, discharging their pollen in the open air, that it may be carried in that vehicle to the figmata of their respective females?\u2014All this is admitted by the opposers of the sexes; but then they deny that these explosions, &c., are intended to create any intercourse between the male and the female; and further allege, that this ejection of the pollen is intended by nature to throw off something excrementitious, or at least something which, if retained, would prove noxious to the fructification.\n\nLinnaeus takes his second argument from the proportion which the stamens bear to the style, alleging that they are generally of the same height.\u2014This observation (say the anti-sexualists) is not only contrary to experience, but, allowing it to be universal, no conclusion can be drawn from it either for or against the sexual hypothesis.\n\nThe third argument is taken from the locus or situation of the stamens with respect to the style: \"and as the male flowers in the monocotyledonous plants stand always above the female flowers, it must be concluded (says Linnaeus), that the intention of nature, in this disposition of the parts, is to allow a free and easy access of the pollen to the stigma.\"\u2014But the stamens cannot be said to surround the pistilium in the monandra and diandra classes; and the position of the male flowers in the monocotyledonous class is a mere chimera; for in the rizinus, one of the examples which Linnaeus mentions in confirmation of his doctrine, the female flowers stand uniformly some inches above the males.\n\nThat the stamens and pistil generally come to perfection at the same time, and that this happens even in the dioecious plants, is Linnaeus's fourth argument. But, as it is acknowledged by Linnaeus himself, that there are many exceptions with respect to this fact, the opposers of the sexual hypothesis allege that it carries the bell after its own bobom.\n\nThe fifth argument is founded on the circumstance of some flowers shutting up their petals in rainy or moist evenings.\u2014But many flowers do not shut themselves up, either in the night or moist weather, as the passion-flower, &c.: the lychnis noctitorea, mirabilis peruviana, &c., open their flowers in the night, and shut them at the approach of the sun. Hence this is another final cause (say the anti-sexualists) perverted to support a favourite hypothesis.\n\nWe come now to the culture of the palm tree, which is the fifth and most plausible argument employed by the sexualists. Of this, the most authentic account we have is the following by Dr Hallequill, in one of his letters to Linnaeus, dated Alexandria May 18, 1750.\n\n\"The first thing I did after my arrival was to see the date tree, the ornament and a great part of the riches of this country. It had already bloomed; but I had, nevertheless, the pleasure of seeing how the Arabs assist its fecundation, and by that means secure to themselves a plentiful harvest of a vegetable, which was so important to them, and known to them many centuries before any botanist dreamed of the difference of sexes in vegetables. The gardener informed me of this before I had time to enquire; and would show me as a very curious thing, the male and female of the date or palm trees: nor could he conceive how I, a Frank, lately arrived, could know it before; for (says he) all who have yet come from Europe to see this country, have regarded this relation either as a fable or miracle. The Arab seeing me inclined to be further informed, accompanied me and my French interpreter to a palm tree, which was very full of young fruit, and had by him been wedded or fecundated with the male when both were in blossom. This the Arabs do in the following manner: when the spadix has female flowers, that come out of its spathe, they search on a tree that has male flowers, which they know by experience, for a spadix which has not yet burst out of its spathe: this they open, take out the spadix, and cut it lengthwise in several pieces, but take care not to hurt the flowers. A piece of this spadix with male flowers they put lengthwise between the small branches of the spadix which hath female flowers, and then lay the leaf of a palm over the branches. In this situation I yet saw the greatest part of the spadices which bore their young fruit; but the male flowers which were put between were withered. The Arab besides gave me the following anecdotes: First, Unless they in this manner, wed and fecundate the date tree, it bears no fruit. Secondly,\ncondly, They always take the precaution to preserve some unopened spathe with male flowers from one year to another, to be applied for this purpose, in case the male flowers should miscarry or suffer damage. Thirdly, If they permit the spatix of the male flowers to burst or come out, it becomes useless for fecundation: it must have its maidenhead (these were the words of the Arab), which is lost in the same moment the blossoms burst out of their case. Therefore the person who cultivates date trees must be careful to hit the right time of afflicting their fecundation, which is almost the only article in their cultivation. Fourthly, On opening the spathe, he finds all the male flowers full of a liquid which resembles the finest dew; it is of a sweet and pleasant taste, resembling much the taste of fresh dates, but much more refined and aromatic; this was likewise confirmed by my interpreter, who hath lived 32 years in Egypt, and therefore had opportunities enough of tasting both the nectar of the blossoms and the fresh dates.\"\n\nNow, though this account seems fully to confirm the fact, viz. that such a practice obtains among the Arabs, and that they assert its efficacy in fecundating the trees, it is certain (say the opponents of this doctrine), that no intelligent person, who is not already wedded to an hypothesis, will attempt to find an argument upon the assertions of a people so full of ridiculous superstitions. Before Dr Hafelquist, or any other person, can draw any argument from the above mentioned account, he ought to see the experiment several times repeated, with his own eyes, and not take it upon the word of a person who, besides their superstition, may very probably find it their interest to impose upon travellers.\n\nMr Milne, author of the Botanical Dictionary, however, relates an experiment, near akin to the above mentioned, which merits some attention: \"In the garden of M. de la Serre, of the Rue S. Jacques at Paris, was a female turpentine tree, which flowered every year, without furnishing any fruit capable of vegetation. This was a sensible mortification to the owner, who greatly desired to have the tree increased. Messieurs Duhamel and Jeuffen very properly judged that they might procure him that pleasure by the affixture of a male pitchtree tree. They sent him one very much loaded with flowers. It was planted in the garden of M. de la Serre, very near the female turpentine tree, which the same year produced a great quantity of fruits, that were well conditioned, and rose with facility. The male plant was then removed; the consequence of which was, that the turpentine tree of M. de la Serre in none of the succeeding years bore any fruit that, upon examination, was found to germinate.\"\n\nUpon this experiment it is observed by the antifertilists, that, though it were a thousand times repeated, it never could be decisive. The nature of the controversy, say they, is such, that one experiment is more decisive in favour of their opinion, that 10,000 can be against them. The reason is plain: If there is such a thing as a sexual intercourse in vegetables, it is wonderful that any seeds should be perfected without that intercourse, as that a virgin should have a child; the last is not in the least more extraordinary than the first. One experiment, therefore, which shows that seeds may be perfected without such sexual intercourse, is either to be resolved into a miracle, or must prove absolutely decisive against the sexual system; while numberless experiments such as that above mentioned could prove nothing, because we know not what effect vegetables may have by growing in each other's neighbourhood, independent of any sexual intercourse.\n\nIn Milne's Botanical Dictionary, under the article Sexus Plantarum, the author quotes Dr Alton's experiments partially. The facts recorded by Dr Alton are as follow: 1. Three sets of spinach, planted at a great distance from each other, proved all of them fertile, and ripened plenty of seeds, which were found to answer as well as other spinach seed. 2. A plant of hemp growing by itself, being taken care of, produced about 30 good seeds, though in a situation very much exposed, and plucked up too soon, on account of bad weather, in the autumn. 3. This experiment, which is the most remarkable of the three, we shall give in the Doctor's own words. \"In the spring of 1741, I carried two young seedling plants of the French mercury, long before there was any in, from this city physic garden, the only place where it was then to be found in this country, to the king's garden at the Abbey; which are more than 700 yards distant from one another, with many high housetops, trees, hedges, and part of a high hill between them; and planted one of them in one enclosure, where it was shaded from the sun the greatest part of the day; and the other in another 25 yards distant, exposed to the south and west. Both plants ripened fertile seeds; and the last fed them so plentifully, that it proved a troublesome weed for several years, though none of the species was to be found in that garden for more than 20 years preceding.\"\n\nOf this experiment Mr Milne hath not taken any notice; but upon the other two, has the following remark: \"The result of these, and such like experiments, can be accounted for, on the principle of the sexes, in no other way than on the supposition that some male flowers have been intermixed with the female, and operated the fecundation in question. This appears the more probable, as only a part of the seeds in the above experiments attained to perfect maturity, so as to be capable of vegetation.\n\nThe seventh argument of Linnaeus is taken from the flores nutantes.\u2014The pistils of these flowers, according to Linnaeus, are always longer than the stamens; and nature has assigned them this pendulous posture, that the pollen, which is specifically heavier than air, may the more conveniently fall upon the stigma. But the pistils of the campanula, lilium, and many other flores nutantes, are not longer than the stamens. Besides, granting this were uniformly the case; yet, as the pollen is heavier than air, this posture must of necessity either make the pollen miss the pistillum altogether, or, at any rate, it can only fall upon the back part of the pistil in place of the stigma; and, of course, such a direction would rather tend to frustrate than promote the impregnation of the seed.\n\nThe eighth argument is taken from the plantae submersae, which are said to emerge as soon as their flowers begin to blow, lest the pollen should be coagulated or washed off by the water. But many submarine and aquatic plants fructify entirely below water; and, supposing they did not, the same argument would equally prove\nprove it to be the intention of nature, that the pollen should be blown away by the winds, as that it should be subservient to the impregnation of the seed.\n\nThe ninth and last argument is entitled *Omnium florum genuina consideratio*; which (say the antifexualists) is nothing more than a collection of vague observations upon the structure and economy of particular plants, some of them true, others false, but all of them evidently thrust in as supports to a favourite hypothesis.\n\nThus the dispute rested some years ago; but of late there has appeared a translation of one of Linn\u00e6us's works upon the subject, which, though published in 1759, was but little known in this country. A treatise on the Sexual System had also been published by the Abb\u00e9 Spalanzani, in which he not only opposed the Linn\u00e6an doctrine, but treated it with ridicule, though without taking any notice of this last publication, which he seems to have been ignorant of. In this he mentions an experiment with hemp similar to some of those already related; but which was also tried by Linn\u00e6us, and in his hands turned out the very reverse of what it did with Spalanzani. In the treatise alluded to, Linn\u00e6us mentions Sir Thomas Millington as the first among the moderns who thought of the distinction of sexes in plants. He was Savilian professor at Oxford; and Dr Grew, in his Anatomy of Plants, relates, that in a conversation on the nature of the anthers of flowers, Sir Thomas hinted, that those parts might probably be analogous to the male organs of animals, and serve for the impregnation of the fruit. Grew improved on the idea, and pursued it. That the subject, however, may be properly understood, our author is of opinion, that we should first accurately understand the nature of vegetable bodies; and in order to do this, we ought first to consider the operations of nature in the human frame, and from thence continue our researches through the various tribes of inferior animals, till at last we arrive at the vegetable creation. In like manner, to illustrate the generation of plants, we must likewise take our first lights from the animal kingdom, and pursue the same chain till we come to vegetables. This subject, indeed, he owns to be obscure, that no naturalist hitherto been able to say anything satisfactory concerning it; he only mentions some remarkable facts concerning the production of mule animals from the copulation of two individuals of different species. In the horse kind we see two different kinds of mules produced. \"From the mare and male ass (says he proceeds the mule properly so called, which in its nature, that is, in its medullary substance and nervous system, agrees with its mother; but in its cortical substance and outward form, in its mane and tail, resembles the ass. Between the female ass and the horse, the other kind of mule is engendered, whose nature or medullary substance resembles that of the ass; but its cortical structure that of the horse. If the he-goat of Angora copulates with the common he-goat, the kid, by that means procured, inherits the external structure and valuable coat of its father; while, on the other hand, if the common he-goat impregnates the goat of Angora, the kid produced has the same external form, and bears the same worthless hair with its father. Hence it seems probable, that the medullary substance, with what Malpighi calls the keel (*carina*), and the nervous system, are latent in the egg of the mother; the cortical substance, or vascular system, being derived from the father.\"\n\nThese cortical and medullary substances are previously explained by our author to be those of which both animal and vegetable bodies are composed. By the medullary substance in animal bodies, he means the spinal marrow arising from the organized brain, and sending off the nerves; by the cortical substance the vessels with the heart attached to them, by which the medullary part is nourished. In vegetables, the cortical part nourishes the plant, not only by its roots, but with its whole surface. For a small branch torn from the parent stem, and placed in water, imbibes nourishment at its pores. Thus the Fuci, and other marine vegetables, are nourished without a root, solely by the pores dispersed through their whole substance. The bark of trees every year deposits its gelatinous internal layer, which is added to the wood, and affinates itself to it. The medullary, which is the other essential part of vegetables, is multiplied and extended without end; and whenever it is entirely lost, the death of the plant necessarily follows. In examining this substance, we must be careful, in two cases, that we be not misled; first, by the straws of grasses, and by other hollow stems, where the medulla lines the inside of the bark; and secondly, by large trees, whose trunks become perfectly solid throughout, except in the very summits of the branches. The wood performs the office of bones, when there is no longer any occasion for the medulla in that part; and trees, although become hollow, continue nevertheless to grow so long as this substance remains in the extreme branches. It is by no means necessary that the medulla should have any connexion with the root, as it is only nourished by the cortical substance of the plant, and is therefore increased at its upper extremity without end if it meets with no resistance. In those animals whose spinal marrow is surrounded by a bony covering, as in the larger and more perfect kinds, this substance never comes out of its confinement; and the harder its case, the more absolutely is its increase prevented; but in the smaller tribes of worms, where this covering is less rigid, a perpetual and unlimited increase of the animal takes place.\n\n\"The most important parts of the flower, and which are absolutely essential to it, (our author proceeds to observe *) are the stamens and pistils. So essential are they, that among the many thousands of flowers with which we are acquainted, no one can be found not furnished with both these organs. The stamens derive their origin from the substance of the p. 28. fig. wood, which was originally formed from the inner bark, and they may therefore be said to spring from the cortical substance of the vegetable. This is perfectly evident in the asparagus (*Asparagus*), whose twelve stamens proceed from twelve fibres in the inner bark. Double flowers illustrate the same fact: in them, the stamens being weakened and dissolved by excess of nourishment, the woody substance reassumes the softness of the inner bark, of which it was originally formed. All stamens consist of vessels containing the pollen, or impregnating powder, which they discharge in due time, not without the strictest observance of certain natural laws. The form of these vessels, like that of the...\nthe capsules of the fruit, is accurately defined, as well as their cells, their particular manner of bursting, and the pollen which they contain; this pollen, likewise, is no less certain and uniform in its figure, size, and colour, than the seeds themselves.\n\n\"The pistillum is the only part which originates from the medullary substance, and is therefore invariably situated in the centre of the flower. It always contains the rudiments of the seed, which, in process of time, ripen into fruit. The rudiments of the fruit are called the germen, or seed-bud; this has constantly another organ connected with it, named the stigma, which is in its highest degree of vigour and perfection during the time of flowering.\n\n\"Another circumstance worthy of attention is, that the root, which the first year of its growth is large and filled with medullary pulp, the following season becomes hollow, in producing the stem, flowers, and seed; all this pulp being conveyed to the flower, and seeming to be only destined to the formation of seed, so many new and distinct animations being formed from it as there are rudiments of new plants. This is particularly observable in the turnip.\n\n\"Thus vegetables, like insects, are subject to a metamorphosis; with this difference only, that their flowers are fixed to one spot, instead of being able, like insects, to fly from place to place; and that their nourishment is not given them by means of peculiar organs for the formation of chyle. We have seen, that the outer bark becomes calyx, the internal bark corolla, the wood stamens, and the medulla pistillum; the fructification exhibiting the internal parts of a plant naked and unfolded. We have likewise seen, that the fructification puts an end to vegetation in the part from whence it arises, stopping the progress of the medulla, which would otherwise have extended itself without end by the branches, and occasioning the division of that medulla into a number of seeds, each endowed with a separate living principle. But as the medulla exists naked in the germen, it cannot support itself, or make any farther progress, without the affluence of the cortical substance which it has left; it must therefore receive this affluence by some means or other, and in fact does receive it from the stamens and their pollen, which owe their origin to the woody matter derived from the inner bark, and originally generated by the outer bark. But if it happens that the cortical substance is able to invest the medullary rudiments of the seed in the flower itself, the plant becomes viviparous, as in felsucca, aura, and poa vivipara, in which nearly the same thing takes place as in the medulla of other plants, which remains in the branches, and is variously distributed, being at once both clothed and nourished by the bark, and enabled to form new branches, just as it happens in the compound animals, or fentaria.\n\n\"The organs common in general to all plants are,\n\n1. The root, with its capillary vessels, extracting nourishment from the ground.\n2. The leaves, which may be called the limbs, and which, like the feet and wings of animals, are organs of motion; for being themselves shaken by the external air, they shake and exercise the plant.\n3. The trunk containing the medullary substance, which is nourished by the bark, and for the most part multiplied into several compound plants.\n\n4. The fructification, which is the true body of the plant, set at liberty by a metamorphosis, and consists only of the organs of generation; it is often defended by a calyx, and furnished with petals, by means of which it in a manner flutters in the air.\n\n\"Many flowers have no calyx, as several of the lily tribe, the hippocastanum, &c.; many want the corolla, as grasses, and the plants called apetalous; but there are none destitute of stamens and pistillae, those important organs destined to the formation of fruit. We therefore infer from experience, that the stamens are the male organs of generation, and the pistillae the female; and as many flowers are furnished with both at once, it follows that such flowers are hermaphrodites. Nor is this so wonderful, as that there should be any plants in which the different sexes are in distinct individuals; for plants being immovably fixed to one spot, cannot, like animals, travel in search of a mate. There exists, however, in some plants, a real difference of sex. From seeds of the same mother, some individuals shall be produced, whose flowers exhibit stamens without pistillae, and may therefore be properly called males; while the rest, being furnished with pistillae without stamens, are therefore denominated females: and so uniformly does this take place, that no vegetable was ever found to produce female flowers, without flowers furnished with stamens being produced, either on the same individual, or on another plant of the same species, and vice versa.\n\n\"As all seed-vessels are destined to produce seeds, so are the stamens to bear the pollen, or fecundating powder. All seeds contain within their membranes a certain medullary substance, which swells when dipped into warm water. All pollen, likewise, contains in its membrane an elastic substance, which, although very subtle and almost invisible, by means of warm water often explodes with great vehemence. While plants are in flower, the pollen falls from the antherae, and is dispersed abroad, as seeds are dislodged from their situation when the fruit is ripe. At the same time that the pollen is scattered, the pistillum presents its stigma, which is then in its highest vigour, and, for a portion of the day at least, is moistened with a fine dew. The stamens either surround this stigma, or, if the flowers are of the drooping kind, they are bent towards one side, so that the pollen can easily find access to the stigma; where it not only adheres by means of the dew of that part, but the moisture occasions its bursting, by which means its contents are discharged. What issued from it, being mixed with the fluid of the stigma, is conveyed to the rudiments of the seed. Many evident instances of this present themselves to our notice; but I have nowhere seen it more manifest than in the Jacobean lily (amaryllis formosissima), the pistillum of which, when sufficient heat is given the plant to make it flower in perfection, is bent downwards, and from its stigma issues a drop of limpid fluid, so large that one would think it in danger of falling to the ground. It is, however, gradually re-absorbed into the style about three or four o'clock, and becomes invisible till about ten the next morning, when it appears again; by noon it attains its largest dimensions; and in the afternoon, by a gentle and scarcely perceptible decrease, it returns to its source. If we shake the antherae over the stigma, so that the pollen may fall\nfall on this limpid drop, we see the fluid soon after become turbid, and assume a yellow colour; and we perceive little rivulets, or opake streaks, running from the stigma towards the rudiments of the seed. Some time afterwards, when the drop has totally disappeared, the pollen may be observed adhering to the stigma, but of an irregular figure, having lost its original form. No one, therefore, can affront to what Morland and others have asserted, that the pollen passes into the stigma, pervades the style, and enters the tender rudiments of the seed, as Leeuwenhoek supposed his worms to enter the ova. A most evident proof of the fallacy of this opinion may be obtained from any species of mirabilis (marvel of Peru), whose pollen is so very large, that it almost exceeds the style itself in thickness, and, falling on the stigma, adheres firmly to it; that organ sucking and exhausting the pollen, as a cuttle-fish devours every thing that comes within its grasp. One evening in the month of August I removed all the stamens from three flowers of the mirabilis longiflora, at the same time destroying all the rest of the flowers which were expanded; I sprinkled these three flowers with the pollen of mirabilis jalappa: the seed-buds swelled, but did not ripen. Another evening I performed a similar experiment, only sprinkling the flowers with the pollen of the same species; all these flowers produced ripe seeds.\n\n\"Some writers have believed, that the stamens are parts of the fructification, which serve only to discharge an impure or excrementitious matter, and by no means formed for so important a work as generation. But it is very evident, that these authors have not sufficiently examined the subject; for as, in many vegetables, some flowers are furnished with stamens only, and others only with pistils, it is altogether impossible, that stamens situated at so very great a distance from the fruit as on a different branch, or perhaps on a separate plant, should serve to convey any impurities from the embryo.\n\n\"No physiologist could demonstrate, a priori, the necessity of the masculine fluid to the rendering the eggs of animals prolific; but experience has established it beyond a doubt. We therefore judge a posteriori principally of the same effect in plants.\n\n\"In the month of January 1760 the antholyza cucanaria flowered in a pot in my parlour; but produced no fruit, the air of the room not being sufficiently agitated to waft the pollen to the stigma. One day, about noon, seeing the stigma very moist, I plucked off one of the anthers, by means of a fine pair of forceps, and gently rubbed it on one of the expanded stigmata. The spike of flowers remained eight or ten days longer; when I observed, in gathering the branch for my herbarium, that the fruit of that flower only on which the experiment had been made had swelled to the size of a bean. I then dissected this fruit, and discovered that one of the three cells contained seeds in considerable number, the other two being entirely withered.\n\n\"In the month of April I sowed the seeds of hemp (cannabis) in two different pots. The young plants came up so plentifully, that each pot contained 30 or 40. I placed each by the light of a window, but in different and remote apartments. The hemp grew extremely well in both pots. In one of them I permitted the male and female plants to remain together, to flower and bear fruit, which ripened in July; and being macerated in water and committed to the earth, sprung up in twelve days. From the other, however, I removed all the male plants as soon as they were old enough for me to distinguish them from the females. The remaining females grew very well, and presented their long pistils in great abundance, these flowers continuing a very long time, as if in expectation of their mates; while the plants in the other pot had already ripened their fruit, their pistils having, quite in a different manner, faded as soon as the males had discharged all their pollen. It was certainly a beautiful and truly admirable spectacle, to see the unimpregnated females preserve their pistils so long green and flourishing, not permitting them to begin to fade till they had been for a considerable time exposed, in vain, to the accels of the male pollen. Afterwards, when these virgin plants began to decay through age, I examined all their calyxes in the presence of several botanists, and found them large and flourishing, although every one of the seed-buds was brown, compricated, membranaceous, and dry, not exhibiting any appearance of cotyledons or pulp. Hence I am perfectly convinced, that the circumstance which authors have recorded, of the female hemp having produced seeds, although deprived of the male, could only have happened by means of pollen brought by the wind from some distant place. No experiment can be more easily performed than the above; none more satisfactory in demonstrating the generation of plants.\n\n\"The clusia tenella was in like manner kept growing in my window through the months of June and July. The male plant was in one pot, the female in another. The latter abounded with fruit, not one of its flowers proving abortive. I removed the two pots into different windows of the same apartment: still all the female flowers continued to become fruitful. At length I took away the male entirely, leaving the female alone, and cutting off all the flowers which it had already borne. Every day new ones appeared from the axilla of every leaf; each remained eight or ten days; after which their footstalks turning yellow, they fell barren to the ground. A botanical friend, who had amused himself with observing this phenomenon with me, persuaded me to bring from the stove in the garden a single male flower, which he placed over one of the female ones, then in perfection, tying a piece of red silk round its pistillum. The next day the male flower was taken away, and this single seed-bud remained and bore fruit. Afterwards I took another male flower out of the same stove, and with a pair of slender forceps pinched off one of its anthers, which I afterwards gently scratched with a feather, so that a very small portion of its pollen was discharged upon one of the three stigmata of a female flower, the two other stigmata being covered with paper. This fruit likewise attained its due size; and on being cut transversely, exhibited one cell filled with a large seed, and the other two empty. The rest of the flowers, being unimpregnated, faded and fell off. This experiment may be performed with as little trouble as the former.\n\n\"The daurica cannabina came up in my garden from seed ten years ago, and has every year been plentifully increased by means of its perennial root. Flowers in\ngreat number have been produced by it; but being all female, they proved abortive. Being desirous of procuring male plants, I obtained more seeds from Paris. Some more plants were raised; but these likewise, to my great mortification, all proved females, and bore flowers but no fruit. In the year 1757, I received another parcel of seeds. From these I obtained a few male plants, which flowered in 1758. These were planted at a great distance from the females; and when their flowers were just ready to emit their pollen, holding a paper under them, I gently shook the spike or panicle with my finger, till the paper was almost covered with the yellow powder. I carried this to the females, which were flowering in another part of the garden, and placed it over them. The cold nights of the year in which this experiment was made, destroyed these datifac\u00e9es, with many other plants, much earlier than usual. Nevertheless, when I examined the flowers of those plants which I had sprinkled with the fertilizing powder, I found the seeds of their due magnitude; while in the more remote datifac\u00e9es, which had not been impregnated with pollen, no traces of seeds were visible.\n\nSeveral species of *momordica*, cultivated with us, like other Indian vegetables, in close stoves, have frequently borne female flowers; which, although at first very vigorous, after a short time have constantly faded and turned yellow, without perfecting any seed, till I instructed the gardener, as soon as he observed a female flower, to gather a male one and place it above the female. By this contrivance we are so certain of obtaining fruit, that we dare pledge ourselves to make any female flowers fertile that shall be fixed on.\n\n\"The *jatropha urens* has flowered every year in my hot-house; but the female flowers coming before the males, in a week's time dropped their petals, and faded before the latter were opened; from which cause no fruit has been produced, but the germs themselves have fallen off. We have therefore never had any fruit of the *jatropha* till the year 1752, when the male flowers were in vigour on a tall tree at the same time that the females began to appear on a small *jatropha* which was growing in a garden pot. I placed this pot under the other tree, by which means the female flowers bore seeds, which grew on being sown. I have frequently since amused myself with taking the male flowers from one plant, and scattering them over the female flowers of another, and have always found the seeds of the latter impregnated by it.\n\n\"Two years ago I placed a piece of paper under some of these male flowers, and afterwards folded up the pollen which had fallen upon it, preserving it so folded up, if I remember right, four or six weeks, at the end of which time another branch of the same *jatropha* was in flower. I then took the pollen, which I had so long preserved in paper, and sowed it over three female flowers, the only ones at that time expanded. These three females proved fruitful, while all the rest which grew in the same bunch fell off abortive.\n\n\"The interior petals of the *ornithogalum*, commonly, but improperly, called *canadensis*, cohere so closely together, that they only just admit the air to the germ, and will scarcely permit the pollen of another flower to pass; this plant produced every day new flowers and fruit, the fructification never failing in any instance; I therefore, with the utmost care, extracted the anther\u00e6 from one of the flowers with a hooked needle; and, as I hoped, this single flower proved barren. This experiment was repeated about a week after with the same success.\n\n\"I removed all the anther\u00e6 out of a flower of *chelidonium corniculatum* (scarlet horned poppy), which was growing in a remote part of the garden, upon the first opening of its petals, and stripped off all the rest of the flowers; another day I treated another flower of the same plant in a similar manner, but sprinkled the pistillum of this with the pollen borrowed from another plant of the same species; the result was, that the first flower produced no fruit, but the second afforded very perfect seed. My design in this experiment was to prove, that the mere removal of the anther\u00e6 from a flower is not in itself sufficient to render the germ abortive.\n\n\"Having the *nicotiana fruticosa* growing in a garden-pot, and producing plenty of flowers and seed, I extracted the anther\u00e6 from a newly-expanded flower before they had burst, at the same time cutting away all the other flowers; this germ produced no fruit, nor did it even swell.\n\n\"I removed an urn, in which the *aspodelas filifolius* was growing, to one corner of the garden, and from one of the flowers which had lately opened I extracted its anther\u00e6; this caused the impregnation to fail. Another day I treated another flower in the same manner; but bringing a flower from a plant in a different part of the garden, with which I sprinkled the pistillum of the mutilated one, its germ became by that means fruitful.\n\n\"Ixia chinensis, flowering in my stove, the windows of which were shut, all its flowers proved abortive. I therefore took some of its anther\u00e6 in a pair of pincers, and with them sprinkled the stigma of two flowers, and the next day one stigma only of a third flower; the seed-buds of these flowers remained, grew to a large size, and bore seed; the fruit of the third, however, contained ripe seed only in one of its cells.\n\n\"To relate more experiments would only be to fatigue the reader unnecessarily. All nature proclaims the truth I have endeavoured to inculcate, and every flower bears witness to it. Any person may make the experiment for himself, with any plant he pleases, only taking care to place the pot in which it is growing in the window of a room sufficiently out of the reach of other flowers; and I will venture to promise him that he will obtain no perfect fruit, unless the pollen has access to the pistillum.\"\n\nSect. V. Of the Natural Method of Classification.\n\nBesides all the abovementioned methods of clasping and distributing plants into their different orders, genera, &c., which are deduced from the fructification, and are therefore called artificial, Linn\u00e6us and most other botanists are of opinion that there is a natural method, or nature's system, which we should diligently endeavour to find out. That this system, say they, is no chimera, as some imagine, will appear particularly from hence, that all plants, of what order soever, show an affinity to some others; and thus, as formerly observed,\nserved, not only the virtues of a great number of species may be ascertained, but we may know with certainty how to find a proper succedaneum for plants which cannot easily be had.\u2014Linnaeus divides vegetables into the 58 natural methods following,\n\n1. Palmae. These are perennial, and mostly of the shrub and tree kind. The stem is in height from 2 to 100 feet and upwards. The roots form a mass of fibres which are commonly simple and without any ramifications. The stem is generally simple, without branches, cylindrical, and composed of strong longitudinal fibres. The leaves, which are a composition of a leaf and a branch, by Linnaeus called frondes, are of different forms; being sometimes shaped like an umbrella or fan; sometimes singly or doubly winged; the small or partial leaves, which are often three feet in length, being ranged alternately. The branches, or principal leaves, are six, eight, ten, or twelve feet long; the length varying according to the age and size of the plant. They are covered at first with a thick brown dust, like those of the ferns. The base of the leaves frequently embraces the greater part of the stem. The flowers are male and female upon the same or different roots. The flowers are all disposed in a panicle or diffused spike, except in the hydrocharis, Arctotites, and Vallinaria; in which they proceed singly from the wings or angles of the leaves. The common calyx, in this order, is that termed a spathe or sheath, and has either one or two valves. The spadix, or head of flowers protruded from the sheath, is generally branched. Each flower is generally furnished with a perianthium or proper flower-cup, consisting of three leaves or divisions that are small and permanent. The petals are three in number, of a substance like leather, and permanent like the leaves of the calyx. The stamens are from 2 to 20 and upwards, cohering slightly at their base. The seed-buds are from one to three in number, placed in the middle of the flower, and supporting a like number of styles, which are very short. The seed-vessel is generally a pulpy fruit of the berry or cherry kind, containing one cell filled with fibrous flesh, and covered with a skin which is of a substance like leather. The seeds are in number from one to three in each pulpy fruit, of a hard bony substance, round or oval, and attached by their base to the bottom of the fruit.\u2014These plants, particularly the seeds, are astringent, and of efficacy in dysenteries.\n\n2. Piperita. These plants are mostly herbaceous and perennial. The stalks of pothos creep along rocks and trees, into which they strike root at certain distances. The greatest height which any of them is known to attain is 15 feet; the greater part do not exceed three or four. The fleshy roots of many of these plants are extremely acid when fresh. They lose this pungent quality, however, by being dried, and become of a soapy nature. The smell of many of them is extremely fetid, frequently resembling that of human excrements. The flowers, however, of an Ethiopian dracunculus or arum, and the cover in which they are involved, are said to emit a very fragrant odour. With regard to their virtues, these plants are commonly astringent.\n\n3. Calamaris. In this class the base of the leaf, which embraces the stalk like a glove, has no longitudinal aperture, but is perfectly entire. The stalk is generally triangular, and without knots or joints. The roots of some are long and knotty; in others they are composed of fleshy fibres which pierce deep into the ground; and in others, of a bulb. The flowers are either hermaphrodite, or male and female upon the same root. The mode of inflorescence in this order is generally a spike; sometimes a capitulum or head. The calyx is either a gluma or an amentum. The corolla is wanting. The filaments of the stamens are three in number, short, slender like a hair, and sometimes bristly. The antherae are generally long, slender, and erect. The seed-bud is very small, blunt, and sometimes three-cornered. The style is thread-shaped, and of the length of the scaly calyx. The stigmae are generally three in number; slender, hairy, and sometimes permanent. The virtues, uses, and sensible qualities, of this order of plants are the same with those of the following.\n\n4. Graminae. Most of these plants are annual or perennial herbs; some of them creep upon the ground, others are erect. The roots, in the greatest number, are creeping, and emit fibres from each knot or joint; in others they are simply branching and fibrous. The stems and branches are round. The leaves are simple, alternate, entire, very long, and commonly narrow. They form below a sort of sheath, which embraces or surrounds the stem, and is generally cleft or divided on one side through its whole length. The flowers are either hermaphrodite, male and female on the same root, or hermaphrodite and male on the same root. They proceed either singly from the sheath of the leaves, or are formed into a panicle or loose spike. The calyx and corolla in this order are not sufficiently ascertained; in some a single scale or husk, in others two, supply the place of both covers; some grasses have four husky scales, two of which serve for the calyx, and the other two for the corolla; some have five; others six, four of which constitute the calyx, and the other two are termed improperly enough the bulky petals. The corolla is sometimes composed of one petal with two divisions; and in general the husks of the calyx are always placed opposite to those of the corolla. The stamens are generally three in number, and placed irregularly with regard to the situation of the calyx and corolla. The antherae are long, furnished with two cells, and slightly attached to the filaments. The seed-bud is placed upon the same receptacle as the calyx, corolla, and stamens. The style is generally double, and crowned with a hairy stigma or summit. The seed-vessel is wanting. The seeds are single, oval, and attached below to the bottom of the flower.\u2014The roots of the grasses are opening; such as have an aromatic smell are stomachic; their seeds are mealy, mucilaginous, and nourishing. All the parts of these plants are wholesome.\n\n5. Tripetaloidae (from tres, three; and petalum, a petal). These plants have no very striking characters, and are nearly allied to the grasses. All the genera of this order have not the circumstance expressed in the title.\n\n6. Enate. This order, which is very nearly allied to the grasses and liliaceous plants, furnishes a very beautiful\nbeautiful collection of perennial herbs, which are of different heights, from one inch to 15 feet. The roots are tuberous or fleshy, and garnished with fibres; the stalks are simple, and commonly flat or compressed on the sides. The leaves are simple, alternate, entire, sword-shaped, and, like the liliaceous plants, form at their origin a sheath or glove, which in the greatest number is cleft or divided through the whole length, except at the base, where it is entire, and embraces the stalk like a ring. The flowers are hermaphrodite, and generally proceed from the summit of the stalks either singly, in an umbel, a spike, or in a panicle. In pteridaria they proceed from the wings or angles of the leaves either singly or in an umbel. Most of these plants want the perianthium or flower-cup; the flowers burst from a common cover or sheath, termed by Linnaeus spathe, which in this order is frequently permanent. The petals are in number from one to six. The stamens are generally three. The seed-bud is placed sometimes above the flower, sometimes below it. The style is generally single, and crowned with a triple stigma. The seed-vessel is a dry capsule, generally of an oblong shape, and opens at three valves, discovering the same number of cells, each including a quantity of roundish seeds.\u2014These plants resemble the liliaceous in their powers and sensible qualities; very few of them, however, are used in medicine.\n\n7. Orchidea. The roots of many of these plants are composed of one or more fleshy tubercles or knobs, attached to the lower part of the stem, and sending forth fibres from the top. Those of orchis bear an obvious resemblance to the scrotum in animals; from which circumstance the genus has derived its name. The leaves are of moderate size, inscribed with a number of longitudinal nerves or ribs, and without any footstalk. At their origin they form round the stalk a kind of sheath, which is long, entire, cylindrical, but not furnished, like the grasses and some other plants, with a crown at top. The flowers are hermaphrodite, and placed at the summit of the stalk either in a spike or in a panicle. The calyx is that part termed by Linnaeus a spathe or sheath, that bursting open protrudes a head or cluster of flowers, termed the spadix, which have no perianthium or flower-cup. The petals are five in number, and very irregular. The nectarium in this order is remarkably conspicuous; yet so different in the different genera, that Linnaeus has employed it for his principal character or mark of distinction, instead of the root, which had chiefly engaged the attention of former botanists. It has the appearance of a fifth petal. The filaments are always two in number, and placed upon the pistillum or female organ. The anthers are erect, and generally covered by the upper lip of the nectarium. The seed-bud is either oblong or pillar-shaped, twisted like a screw, and universally placed below the receptacle of the flower. The style is single, very short, and forms one substance with the inner margin of the nectarium. The seed-vessel is generally a capsule with one cavity or cell, and three valves or openings, which are keel-shaped, and open on the angular sides, being joined both at the bottom and top. The seeds are numerous; very small, like saw-dust; and attached, without footstalks, to a slender receptacle or rib, which extends itself lengthwise in the middle of each enclosure or valve. The plants of this order are reckoned strong aphrodisiacs.\n\n8. Scitaminae. This class consists of beautiful exotic plants, all natives of very warm countries. Some of them furnish exquisite fruits; but though the plants rise very high, they are perennial only by their roots. Those which have only one filament, have in all their parts an aromatic odour, and an acid or poignant taste; qualities, however, possessed in a much greater degree by the roots, which are hot and resinous.\n\n9. Spathaceae, so called because their flowers are protruded from a spathe or sheath. They are nearly allied in habit and structure to the liliaceous plants, from which they are chiefly distinguished by the spathe out of which their flowers are protruded.\n\n10. Coronariae. These plants are herbaceous, perennial, and from one inch to 15 feet high. The roots are either bulbous, fibrous, or composed of small fleshy knots, which are jointed at top. The bulbs either consist of scales laid over each other like tiles, or are folioid. The stem of the liliaceous bulbous plants is properly wanting; what supplies its place being nothing else than the base of the leaves, which, wrapping or enfolding each other, form at bottom a roundish fleshy bulb hitherto distinguished, though perhaps improperly, by the name of root. In the others the stem is simple, that is, has few branches, and is either furnished with leaves, or rises naked. The branches are alternate and cylindrical. The leaves are simple, alternate, and entire. Those next the root, termed radical leaves, generally form at their origin a sheath, which in a great number is entire; that is, goes all round; whilst in others, it is cleft or divided longitudinally on one side. The flowers are universally hermaphrodite, except in white heliophore, which has both male and hermaphrodite flowers mixed together on the same root. The flowers are sometimes single, and terminate the stem; sometimes they form an umbel, sometimes a spike, and sometimes a panicle. The calyx or flower cup, in this order, according to Linnaeus, is generally wanting. In strict propriety, however, the single cover that is present in most of these plants, though beautifully coloured, ought to be denominated a calyx; as its divisions, generally five in number, are placed opposite to the stamens. The petals, or, to speak more properly, the coloured leaves of the flower, are in number from one to six. Plants which have a single petal, have the limb or upper part split into five divisions or segments. The petals in some species are rolled or turned back. The nectarium is various; in the lily it is a longitudinal line which runs through each petal, and reaches from the base to the middle. In crown imperial, it is a small hollow or pore, formed at the base of each petal; in asphodel it consists of five very small valves, which, approaching, form a globe, and are inserted into the base of the petal; in hyacinth, it is composed of three melliferous pores, situated on the top of the seed-bud. In pineapple, it is a small scale lying within the substance of each petal above the base; and in albuca, or bastard star of Bethlehem, it consists of two sharp-pointed bodies proceeding from the furrows of the seed-bud, and covered by the broader base of the three fertile filaments. In some species of lily the nectarium is hairy; in others it is naked. The stamens are five in number; erect,\ncrest, and inserted into the common receptacle, if the flower consists of many petals; into the tube, or divisions of the corolla, if it consists of one. The antherae are long, commonly divided below, and slightly attached by their sides to the filaments on which they turn like a vane or the needle of a compass. The seed-bud is single, and placed either within the flower-cup or below it. The style is single, thread-shaped, and generally of the length of the petals. The stigma is generally single, of a conic form, and flabby or hairy at the extremity. The seed-vessel is generally a capsule, divided externally into three valves, internally into three cells.\u2014With respect to the powers of the plants of this order, it may be affirmed in general, that such as have little taste or smell, as the roots of tulip, and star of Bethlehem, are perfectly innocent; whilst those which have a heavy nauseous smell, as squill, hyacinth, crown imperial, and spider-wort, are at least suspicious, and frequently prove noxious.\n\n11. Sarmentoide\u00e6 (from sarmentum, a long shoot, like that of a vine.) This order consists of plants which have climbing stems and branches, that, like the vine, attach themselves to the bodies in their neighbourhood for the purpose of support. These plants are far from being a true natural assemblage; in fact they scarce agree in a single circumstance, except that expressed in the title, which is far from being peculiar to this order.\n\n12. Hysterace\u00e6. This order consists of plants which are used for the table, and enter into the economy of domestic affairs: it contains trees, shrubs, perennial, and annual herbs. Some of the woody vegetables retain their green leaves during the winter. The roots are very long, and frequently spindle-shaped; from the knots on the stems and branches of such plants as creep on the ground, or float on the water, proceed fibrous and branching roots. The stems and young branches are cylindric; and in the greatest part of the aquatic plants of this order, the stalks are hollow within. The buds are of a conic form, and naked; that is, not accompanied with scales. The leaves are generally simple, entire, alternate, and attached to the branches by a cylindric foot-stalk, which is sometimes very long, but commonly very short. Some plants of this kind have two stipulae or scales which are attached to the branches near the origin of the foot-stalk of each leaf. In many others, instead of stipulae, each leaf bears on its foot-stalk a membranaceous sheath, which is cylindric, frequently fringed on the margin, and pierced or penetrated by the stem. The flowers are either hermaphrodite; male and female upon the same root; male and female upon different roots; hermaphrodite and male on the same root; or hermaphrodite and female on the same root; or hermaphrodite and male on different roots.\n\n13. Succulent\u00e6. This order consists of flat, fleshy, and juicy plants, most of them evergreens. They are astringent, refreshing, and very wholesome.\n\n14. Gruinales (from grus a crane.) These consist of geranium, vulgarly called crane's-bill, and a few other genera which Linnaeus considers as allied to it in their habit and external structure. This order furnishes both herbaceous and woody plants. The roots are sometimes fibrous, sometimes tuberous. In some species of wood-fern they are jointed. The stems are cylindric; the young branches, in some, nearly square. The buds are of a conic form, and covered with scales. The leaves are either simple or compound. The flowers are hermaphrodite; they proceed from the wings of the leaves either singly or in clusters. The calyx or flower-cup consists of five distinct leaves, or of one leaf divided almost to the bottom into five parts. It generally accompanies the seed-bud to its maturity. The petals are five in number, spreading, and frequently funnel-shaped. The stamens are generally ten in number, awl-shaped, erect, and of the length of the petals. The stamens are generally oblong; and frequently attached to the filaments by the middle, so as to lie, and sometimes to veer about, upon them. The seed-bud is either oblong or five-cornered. The number of styles is either one or five. In tribuluses, the style is wanting. The seed-vessel is generally a five-cornered capsule, with one, three, five, or ten cells. The seeds are generally equal in number to the internal divisions or the cells of the seed-vessel; one seed being placed in each cell.\n\n15. Inundatae. The plants of this order are aquatic, of low stature, herbaceous, and mostly perennial. The roots are fibrous. The stem is generally wanting. In its place is an assemblage of leaves, which wrapping or enfolding each other mutually form a sheath; and from the middle of this sheath is produced the foot-stalk of the flower. The leaves are sometimes alternate, sometimes placed in whorls round the stem. In a great many genera the foot-stalk is extended at its origin into a membranaceous substance, which forms a sheath that is cleft through the whole length, on the side opposite to the leaf. The flowers are hermaphrodite, or male and female on the same root. The flower-cup is either wanting, or consists of three, four, or five divisions or leaves, which accompany the seed-bud to its maturity. The petals are generally wanting. The stamens are in number from 1 to 16 and upwards. The filaments in some genera are so short, that they seem wanting. The antherae are short, and generally marked with four longitudinal furrows. The seed-buds are in number from one to four, the style is frequently wanting. The seed-vessel is universally wanting, except in elatine, which has a dry capsule, with four external openings, and the same number of cells. The seeds are generally four in number.\n\n16. Calyciflor\u00e6 (from calyx the flower-cup, and flora the flower), consisting of such plants as have the stamens (the flower) inserted into the calyx. All the plants of this order are of the shrub and tree kind. Some of them rise to the height of 12 or 14 feet; others not above two or three. The roots are branching, fibrous, and woody. The stems are cylindric. The branches, when young, are cornered; the buds of a conic form, and without scales. The leaves are simple, alternate, and attached to the branches by a very short foot-stalk. The flowers are either male or female upon distinct roots, or hermaphrodite and male on the same root. The calyx is a perianthium composed of one leaf divided into two, three, or four segments. It is commonly placed upon the germen or seed-bud, which accompanies it to maturity. The corolla is universally wanting, except in tropheis, the male plants of which, according to Linnaeus, have four obtuse and spreading petals. The stamens are generally four in number, flender\nflender like a hair, short, placed at a considerable distance from the style, and inserted into the tube of the calyx. The pistillum is composed of a roundish germen, crowned with the calyx; a single thread-shaped style; and a cylindric stigma. The seed-vessel is either an obtuse oval fruit of the cherry kind, or a globular berry with one cell, containing a roundish seed. The plants of this order are astringent.\n\n17. Calycanthemus, (from calyx the flower-cup, and anthos the flower); consisting of plants, which, among other characters, have the corolla and stamens inserted in the calyx. This order furnishes trees, shrubs, and annual, biennial, and perennial herbs. The herbaceous annuals are by much the most numerous. The roots are branching and fibrous; the stems and branches cylindric, square, or four-cornered while young. The buds are of a conic form, and without scales. The leaves are generally either alternate, simple, and attached to the branches by a short foot-stalk, or opposite at the bottom of the stem; and in some, alternate towards the top. They are universally fertile; that is, attached to the branches, without any foot-stalk. The calyx is universally a perianthium, and generally monophyllous, or composed of one leaf. The corolla consists of four, five, and six petals, which are attached to the tube of the calyx, and are sometimes placed alternate, sometimes opposite to the divisions of the limb. The stamens, which are in number from 4 to 20 and upwards, are attached to the tube of the calyx either on its margin or lower down. When the number of stamens is double the divisions of the calyx, the stamens which stand opposite these divisions are a little longer than the rest. The anthers are generally of a hemispherical figure; frequently cleft or slit below; and by that aperture attached slightly to the filaments, on which they often veer about like a vane or needle. They are surrounded longitudinally, and open on the sides into two loculi or cells. The pollen, or male dust, consists of a number of minute particles, of an oval figure, yellow and transparent. The germen, or seed-bud, is placed either above or under the receptacle of the flower. The style is single, thread-shaped, and of the length of the stamens. The stigma is generally single and undivided. The seed-vessel is a capsule, which is generally divided internally into four loculi or cells. The seeds are numerous, minute, and frequently three-cornered. The plants of this order are reckoned astringent.\n\n18. Bicornes, (from bis twice, and cornu a horn), plants whose antherae have the appearance of two horns. This appearance, however, is not very conspicuous, unless in a few genera. The plants of this order are all of the shrub and tree kind. The roots are branching and fibrous. The stems and branches are cylindric. The buds conic, sometimes covered with scales, and sometimes naked. The leaves are generally alternate. In most plants of this order they are either sefife, or supported by a very short foot-stalk, which is semi-cylindric, and flat above. The flowers are universally hermaphrodite, except in one genus, the India date-plum, where hermaphrodite and male flowers are produced in the same species upon distinct roots. They proceed either solitary, or in a corymbus from the angles formed by the leaves and branches; or hang down in spikes and clusters at the end of the branches; each flower having a small scale or floral leaf placed under it. In most plants of this order the calyx is placed around or below the germen. The calyx is universally a perianthium, and generally monophyllous or of one piece, deeply divided into four or five segments, which are permanent, that is, accompany the germen to its maturity. The segments are often acute, and sometimes coloured. The corolla is generally monocotalous, and bell or funnel shaped; the figure, however, is not very constant, even in plants of the same genus. The limb, or upper part of the petal, is generally divided into four or five segments, which are sometimes rolled back, sometimes bent inwards. The limb too is sometimes slightly cut, sometimes divided almost to the bottom. The tube, or lower part of the petal, is cylindric, and generally of the same length with the calyx. The number of stamens is from 4 to 20. These are generally erect, and attached to the lower part of the tube of the corolla. The antherae are bifid or forked below, and, being slightly attached to the filaments, are frequently inverted in such a manner as to exhibit the appearance of two horns at top. The germen or seed-bud, is generally roundish, and seated above the receptacle. The style is single, thread-shaped, of the same length with the corolla, and in a few genera permanent. The seed-vessel is either a capsule with five cells, a roundish berry, or an oblong four-cornered nut with two cells. \u2014The plants of this order are astringent.\n\n19. Hesperides, (from the Hesperides, whose orchards are said to have produced golden apples). The plants of this order are of the shrub and tree kind, and mostly evergreen. The bark of the stalks is slender, and comes off in thin plates. The leaves are generally opposite, and covered with small transparent points. In some, the leaves are placed opposite at the bottom of the stalks, and alternate above. The buds are of a conic form, the flowers generally hermaphrodite; they proceed from the wings of the leaves either singly, or in clusters like ivy-berries. The calyx is placed above the seed-bud, and accompanies it to its maturity. The petals are three, four, or five in number, and stand upon the brims of the tube of the calyx. The seed-bud is large, oblong, and placed below the receptacle of the flower. The style is single, awl-shaped, of the length of the stamens, and terminated with a single stigma. The seed-vessel in some genera is a berry furnished with one or three cells; a capsule with four cells, or of the nature of a cherry, containing a stone. The seeds are generally numerous, small, and oblong. The leaves and fruits are astringent, the berries elculent.\n\n20. Rotaceae, (from rota, a wheel), consisting of plants with one wheel-shaped petal without a tube. These resemble in quality those of the order of Precia, to which they are in all respects very nearly allied; but very few of them can be said in strict propriety to possess the character specified in the title.\n\n21. Precia, (from precius early). These consist of primrose, an early flowering plant, and some others which agree with it in habit and structure, though not always in the character or circumstance expressed in the title. These plants, which possess no striking uniform characters, are, in general, innocent in their quality; yet the root of sow-bread is dangerous, if taken internally.\n\n22. Caryophyllaceae. All the plants of this order are herbaceous, and mostly annual. Some of the creeping kinds\nkinds do not rise above an inch, and the tallest exceed not seven or eight feet. The roots are branching, fibrous, and of moderate length. The stems are cylindrical. The branches proceed from the wings or angles of the leaves, and are generally opposite, and as it were jointed at each knot. In some species of cerasiflora the branches are square. The leaves are generally placed opposite in pairs, so as to resemble a cross; and are slightly united at the bottom by their foot-stalks, which form a sort of globose round the stem. The hairs are simple, like silk. The flowers are hermaphrodite; but some have male and female flowers upon distinct roots. They either stand single on their foot-stalks, and proceed from the wings or angles of the leaves and branches, or are disposed in a spike, corymbus, umbel, or panicle. The calyx is permanent, and composed either of one piece with five indentments, or of four or five distinct leaves. The corolla generally consists of five petals, which have claws of the length of the calyx; and a spreading limb, sometimes entire, but oftener cleft or divided in two. The stamens are in number from 3 to 15, and of moderate length. When their number is double the divisions of the calyx, they are attached alternately to the claws of the petals, those so attached being shorter than the rest; the remaining stamens are inserted into the common receptacle, and stand opposite to the segments of the calyx. In some genera of this order the number of stamens is found to vary, even in the different flowers of the same plant.\n\nThe anthers are short, hemispherical, marked with four longitudinal furrows, frequently divided or cleft below, most commonly erect; sometimes, however, incumbent, that is, fastened to the filaments by the sides. The point is composed of a single seed-bud, which is generally roundish, sometimes cornered. The styles are thread-shaped, of the length of the stamens, and crowned with a simple stigma, which is sleek or smooth externally, and slightly hollowed or vaulted within. The seed-vessel is a dry capsule, of an oval form, of the length of the calyx, and consists of one or three cells. The plants of this order are innocent in their quality; they abound in a watery sort of phlegm, and have bitter juice. With respect to their virtues, they are reckoned astringent, attenuating, and detergent.\n\n23. Tribilatae, (from tres three, and bilum an external mark on the seed); consisting of plants with three seeds, which are marked distinctly with an external cicatrix or scar, where they are fastened within to the fruit.\n\n24. Corydaliae, (from \u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 a helmet); consisting of plants which have irregular flowers, somewhat resembling a helmet or hood. These plants are mostly herbaceous and perennial. The roots are tuberous or knobby. The stems are generally branching. The leaves are alternate, sometimes simple, but most commonly winged. The foot-stalk of the leaves is straight or narrow, except in epimedium, where it is large, and has a membranous edge or border. The flowers are universally hermaphrodite. They proceed either singly from the wings and angles of the leaves, or are collected in clusters at the end of the branches. The calyx consists of two, four, five, or six leaves, which are frequently coloured, and commonly fall off immediately before, or very soon after, the expansion of the petals. The corolla is generally irregular; of one, or many pieces; gaping; and furnished with a nectarium, which is very different in the different genera. The stamens are in number from two to six, and of a proportionate length, except in honey-flower, which has two shorter than the rest. The filaments are distinct, except in two genera, fumitory and monniera, which have two sets of strings or filaments united in a cylinder. The anthers are universally distinct, except in impatiens, where they are formed into a cylinder divided at the base. The seed-bud is generally roundish, but sometimes angular or cornered. The style is commonly single, extremely short, slender, or thread-shaped, and crowned with a simple stigma. The seed-vessel is either a hollow blown-up berry, a capsule of one cell, a longish, or a roundish pod. The seeds are generally numerous and round.\n\n25. Putamin\u00e6, (from putamen a shell); consisting of a few genera of plants allied in habit, whose fleshy seed-vessel or fruit is frequently covered with a hard woody shell. Most of these plants are acid and penetrating; and yield, by burning, a great quantity of fixed alkali. With respect to their virtues, they are powerful aperients. The Indians pretend that the fruit of a species of caper-bush, which they call baducca, extinguishes the flames of love.\n\n26. Multiflorae, (from multus many, and fligua a pod); consisting of plants which have more seed-vessels than one. From the etymology of the term, one would naturally imagine that the seed-vessels in question were of that kind called by Linneus fligua, or pod; but the fact is, that not a single plant of this order bears pods; the greater part having many dry capsules, and the remainder being furnished properly with no seed-vessel, but bearing numerous distinct seeds. Plants of this order are mostly perennial herbs: the stems of some are erect; others creep upon the ground, and produce roots near the origin of each leaf; lastly, others climb, and attach themselves to the bodies in their neighbourhood, either by the foot-stalk of the leaves, or by tendrils and clasps which terminate the foot-stalk. The greatest height of those which rise erect, seldom exceeds eight feet. Those which climb, rarely exceed 15 or 20 feet. The roots are generally fleshy. In some they are hand-shaped; in others finger-shaped, or cylindric. In some species of heliobore and ranunculus they are divided into spherical knobs. Lastly, in some plants of this order, the roots are fibrous. The stems and young branches are cylindric. The leaves, which are of different forms, being sometimes simple and entire, sometimes hand-shaped or winged, are generally alternate. The foot-stalk, which is sometimes cylindric, sometimes angular, is membranous, and very large at its origin, surrounding a great part of the stem from which it proceeds. The flowers are hermaphrodite. They proceed either singly from the wings of the leaves or termination of the branches, or terminate the branches in a spike, panicle, or head. The calyx in some is wanting; in others it is generally composed of five pieces, which fall off with the petals. The petals are in number from 4 to 15; generally equal, and sometimes disposed in two or three series; five is the prevailing number. The stamens are in number from 5 to 300, distinct, and attached generally in several rows or series to the receptacle. The seed-buds are generally numerous; the style is frequently wanting.\nsome the seed-vessel is wanting; in others it is composed of several dry capsules, each containing a single cell. The seeds are numerous, and frequently angular. Most of these plants are acid, and many of them poisonous. In general, plants that have a great number of stamens are noxious in their quality. When burnt, these plants furnish a fixed alkali; by distillation there is drawn from them a kind of nitrous and aluminoous substance. With respect to their virtues, they are caustic and purgative.\n\n27. *Rheedeae*, consisting of poppy, and a few genera which resemble it in habit and structure. These plants, upon being cut, emit plentifully a juice, which is white in poppy, and yellow in the others. With respect to their virtues, they seem to operate principally upon the nerves. Their juice is soporific and narcotic, their seeds less so, their roots aperient. Applied externally, they are slightly corrosive.\n\n28. *Lurideae*, consisting of plants whose pale and ominous appearance seems to indicate something baleful and noxious in their natural quality. Most of these plants are herbaceous and perennial. Many of them are of the masked tribe of flowers; others resemble these in their general appearance, but differ from them essentially in the equality of their stamens. The roots are generally branched, sometimes tuberous. The stems and branches are cylindric. The leaves are generally simple, and placed alternate. The flowers are hermaphrodite. They proceed either singly or in clusters from the angle formed by the leaves and branches. In some species of lycium, they terminate the branches. The calyx is generally of one piece deeply divided into five parts. The corolla consists of one petal, which is either bell, funnel, or wheel-shaped. The stamens are four or five in number; and those either of equal lengths, as in the greater, or unequal. The seed-bud is placed above the receptacle of the flower. The style is single; and is terminated by a summit which is hemispherical, and frequently channelled or furrowed. The seed-vessel, in such as have equal stamens, is a berry; in the rest, it is generally a capsule. The seeds are numerous, and frequently kidney-shaped.\u2014These plants in general are poisonous. They have an insipid taste, and a nauseous disagreeable smell.\n\n29. *Campanaceae* (from *campana*, a bell); plants with bell-shaped flowers. The plants of this order are herbaceous and perennial. The roots are either spindle-shaped, or branching and fibrous. The stems are round. The branches are generally alternate. The leaves are simple, alternate, and commonly attached to the branches by a semi-cylindric foot-stalk, which is furrowed above. The indentments are terminated by a small white tubercle or knob, which renders them conspicuous. The flowers are hermaphrodite; and proceed either solitary from the wings of the leaves, or are collected into a spike and head at the end of the flower-stalk. The calyx is universally a perianthium situated upon or round the germen, and generally composed of one leaf deeply divided into five segments. The corolla is monopetalous, and of the bell, funnel, or wheel-shape. The tube, in flowers of the bell and wheel-shape, is very short; in those of the funnel-shape, very long. In Greek valerian, the tube is flut with five valves, which are placed on its apex or top. The limb or upper part of the corolla is deeply divided into five segments, which spread, and are alternate with the divisions of the calyx. The corolla is generally permanent. The stamens are five in number, attached to the base of the tube of the corolla, alternate with its divisions, and opposite to those of the calyx. The filaments are distinct; very large at their origin; and frequently approach so as to form a sort of vault, which covers the summit of the germen. They are slender and awl-shaped above. The antherae are very long; oval; marked with four longitudinal furrows, either distinct, or united in a cylinder. The pollen is composed of very small, spherical, white, shining, and transparent particles. The germen is roundish, and situated either wholly or in part under the flower. The style is generally single, and of the length of the stamens or corolla. The stigma is commonly single, but deeply divided. The seed-vessel is a roundish capsule, generally divided into three cells, and furnished externally with the same number of valves. The seeds are small, numerous, attached to a receptacle in the centre of the fruit, generally rounded, and sometimes cornered.\u2014This order furnishes many excellent medicines. The plants abound with a white milky juice, which, upon the stalk being cut, flows out in great quantities.\n\n30. *Conoviae*, (from *con* together, and *torquere* to twist); consisting of plants which have a single petal that is twisted or bent towards one side. This order furnishes trees, shrubs, and fat succulent plants, some of which retain their leaves during the winter. The herbaceous vegetables in this order are generally perennial. The roots are sometimes branching, but commonly fleshy, succulent, and garnished with fibres or strings like those of turnip. The stems are round and in some genera pulpy and succulent. The branches are sometimes placed alternate, and sometimes opposite. The buds are of a conic form, and naked or without scales. The leaves are sometimes alternate, sometimes placed opposite in pairs, and not seldom surround the item in whorls. They are attached to the branches by a cylindric foot-stalk, which is short, and frequently united to the foot-stalk of the opposite leaf. The defensive and offensive weapons in this order are a downy fort of pubescence, and simple, or forked prickles, which, in some genera, issue from the wings of the leaves. The flowers are hermaphrodite; and stand either singly upon their footstalks, or are collected into umbels and clutters. These bunches or collections of flowers sometimes terminate the branches, sometimes proceed from the angles of the branches, and sometimes stand at the side of the wings without issuing from them. The flower-cup is composed of one leaf divided almost to the base in five unequal segments, which embrace each other, and are permanent, or accompany the seed-bud to its maturity. The corolla consists of one petal, which in the different genera is bell, salver, funnel, or wheel-shaped. The limb, or upper spreading part of the petal, is generally divided into five equal parts, which are slightly bent or twisted to the left, and embrace or enfold each other like the petals of the mallow tribe. The tube is generally long and cylindrical; sometimes club-shaped, and often wanting. In several flowers of this order the petal is accompanied with that species of superfluity termed a neclarium. In the different genera, however, it assumes very different appearances. The stamens are five in number, short, equal\nequal, attached at the same height to the tube of the petal, alternate with its divisions, and opposite to those of the calyx. The antherae are generally erect, and frequently approach so as to form a compact body in the middle of the flower. The feed-bud is either single or double. In some the style is wanting. The stigma is frequently double. The seed-vessel in some genera is a pulpy fruit, of the berry and cherry kind; but most frequently that species termed by Linnaeus *conspicuum*, and *folliculus*, which has one valve or external enclosure, opens lengthways on one side, and has not the seeds fastened to it. Two of these dry fruits, with a single cell, compose the seed-vessel of most plants of this order. The seeds are generally numerous, and in several genera crowned with a long pappus or downy wing like that of the compound flowers, by means of which they easily disperse and sow themselves.\n\nThe plants of this order being cut, emit a juice which is generally milky, and sometimes of a greenish white. From the circumstance of their abounding in this milky juice, the greater part are deemed poisonous; repeated observations having established this aphorism, That milky plants, except those of the plain compound flowers, are generally of a baneful destructive nature, and ought at least to be administered with caution. With respect to their sensible qualities, they are bitter; particularly the seed roots and bark, in which resides their principal virtue.\n\n31. *Vepreulae*, (from *vupres*, a briar or bramble), consisting of plants resembling the daphne, dirca, gonia, &c., but which, however, do not constitute a true natural assemblage.\n\n32. *Papilionaceae*, plants that have papilionaceous flowers, i.e., somewhat resembling a butterfly in shape; of which number are all the leguminous plants. The plants of this order are of very different duration; some of them being herbaceous, and those either annual or perennial; others woody vegetables of the shrub and tree kind, a few of which rise to the height of 70 feet and upwards. The herbaceous plants of this order generally climb; for, being weak, and as it were helpless of themselves, they are provided by nature with tendrils, and even sharp-pointed hooks, at their extremities, to fasten upon the neighbouring trees or rocks; or the stalks are endowed with a faculty of twining themselves, for the purpose of support, around the bodies in their neighbourhood. The pea, vetch, and kidney-bean, afford familiar examples of this appearance. The shrubs and trees of this order are mostly armed with strong spines. The roots are very long, and furnished with fibres; but some genera have fleety knobs or tubercles placed at proper intervals along the fibres. The stems are cylindric, as likewise the young branches, which are placed alternately; those which climb, twist themselves from right to left, in a direction opposite to the apparent motion of the sun. The bark of the large trees is extremely thick and wrinkled, so as to resemble a net with long meshes; the wood is very hard in the middle, and commonly coloured or veined. The buds are hemispherical, without scales, and proceed from the branches horizontally a little above the angle which they form with the leaves. The leaves are alternate, and of different forms, being either simple, finger-shaped, or winged. This last form is very common; the lobes or lesser leaves are entire, and sometimes placed in pairs, but most commonly the winged leaf is terminated by an odd lobe. The winged or pinnated leaves of this order have a daily or periodical motion, depending upon the progress of the sun in his diurnal course. The common footstalk of the winged and compound leaves is marked on the upper surface with a cavity or furrow which runs through its whole length. The flowers are hermaphrodite; and proceed either from the wings of the leaves, or from the extremity of the branches. The calyx is a perianthium of one leaf, bell-shaped, bunching out at the bottom, and cut on its brim or margin into five irregular divisions or teeth; the lowermost of which, being the odd one, is longer than the rest; the other four (and in pairs, of which the uppermost is shortest, and stands farthest asunder. The bottom of the calyx is moistened with a sweet liquor like honey, to may be deemed the nectarium of these plants. The petals are four or five in number, very irregular, and from their figure and position bear an obvious resemblance to a butterfly expanding its wings for flight. These petals have been characterized by distinct names: the upper one, which is commonly the largest, is termed the standard, (ovexillum); the two side petals, the wings, (ala); and the lowermost, which is generally united at top, and divided at bottom, the keel, (carina). The filaments are generally ten: these are either totally distinct, or united by the filaments into one or two bundles involving the feed-bud. In the latter case, where there are two sets of united filaments, one of the sets is composed of nine stamens, which are united into a crooked cylinder, that is cleft on one side through its whole length; along this cleft lies the tenth filament or stamen, which constitutes the second set, and is often closely attached to the second bundle, that it cannot be separated without some difficulty. The antherae are small, round, marked with four longitudinal furrows, and slightly attached to the filaments. In luxure, the antherae are alternately round and oblong. The feed-bud is single, placed upon the receptacle of the flower, oblong, cylindrical, slightly compressed, of the length of the cylinder of the united filaments by which it is involved, and sometimes elevated by a slender footstalk which issues from the centre of the calyx. The style is single, slender, and generally crooked or bent. The stigma is commonly covered with a beautiful down, and placed immediately under the antherae. The seed-vessel is that of pod termed a legumen, which is of an oblong figure, more or less compressed, with two valves, and one, two, or more cavities. These cavities are often separated, when ripe, by a sort of joints. The seeds are generally few in number, round, smooth and fleety. Jointed pods have generally a single feed in each articulation. The seeds are all fastened along one future, and not alternately to both, as in the other species of pod termed *filigera*.\u2014The plants of this family are, in general, mucilaginous. From the inner bark of most of them flows, either naturally or by incision, a clammy liquor, which dries and hardens like gum; the juice of others is sweet like sugar; some taste bitter, and are purgative, emetic, or even mortal. A species of eastern astragalus, with goats-rue leaves, is said to be remarkably caustic, and to burn the tongue excessively when chewed. In general, however, these plants are soft and clammy. With respect to their virtues, the plants of this order are highly emollient; some of them are vulnerary.\nvulnerary and astringent; and the root of anemone, or red-harrow, is diuretic.\n\n33. Lomentaceae, (from lomentum, a colour used by painters). Many of these plants furnish beautiful tinctures, and some of them are much used in dyeing. They very much resemble the last order, differing only in the following particulars. 1. In all plants of this order, except milkwort, the stamens are distinct. The flower is not shaped like a butterfly, but is less irregular, and frequently consists but of one petal. The leaves are sometimes simple, but most commonly winged. The seeds are commonly marked with a circular furrow on both sides. Like those of the leguminous tribe, the plants of this order are generally mucilaginous. From the inner bark of the greater number exudes, either naturally or by incision, a mucilaginous liquor, which sometimes dries upon the plant, and becomes a gummy substance.\n\n34. Cucurbitaceae, (from cucurbita, a gourd); consisting of plants which resemble the gourd in external figure, habit, virtues, and sensible qualities.\u2014The plants of this order, which generally climb, and have long diffused branches, are mostly herbaceous and perennial. The roots in the perennial plants of this order are shaped like those of the turnip; in the annuals they are branching and fibrous. The stems are cylindrical and succulent. The young branches have generally five corners. In some species of passion-flower they are square. The leaves are alternate, angular, and sometimes hand-shaped. They are attached to the branches by a footstalk, which is pretty long and cylindrical, without any furrow. From the wing or angle of each of the upper leaves proceeds a tendril, which is either simple or branching, and twists itself spirally round the different bodies in its neighbourhood, for the purpose of supporting and training of the branches. The lower leaves have no tendril. The flowers are either hermaphrodite or male and female. In this last, the male flowers are generally separated from the female upon the same root; and that either in the same wing or angle of the leaves, or in different angles. The flower-cup, in the female flowers, is placed upon the seed-bud; and generally consists of one bell-shaped leaf, that is deeply divided into five unequal segments, and unlike the other plants which have the calyx seated upon the fruit, falls off with the petals and the other parts of the flower. The corolla consists of one petal, with five equal divisions, which adhere to the tube of the calyx, as if glued to it. A species of passion-flower, termed by Linnaeus paflora tuberosa, wants the petals. The stamens are in number from one to five, short, and generally inserted into the calyx. The filaments are distinct; the anthers of many genera are united in a cylinder. In the passion-flower they are slightly attached to the filaments, on which they turn like a vane or the needle of a compass. The seed-bud is single, and placed below the receptacle of the flower. The style is generally single, cylindrical, of the length of the calyx, and crowned with a triple stigma. The seed-vessel is generally pulpy, of the apple or berry kind, and consists of one, two, or three cells. The seeds are numerous, generally flat or compressed, and sometimes covered with that kind of proper coat called by Linnaeus arillus.\u2014The fruit of these plants is generally purgative and refreshing; that of some of them proves a very violent emetic when used too freely.\n\n35. Senticosae, (from sentis, a brier or bramble); consisting of the rose, bramble, and other plants which resemble them in root and external structure. These plants are nearly allied in form, habit, and structure, to those of the natural order Pomaceae that they ought never to have been separated from it. The leaves have a pungent taste; the fruits are acid and cooling. With respect to their virtues, the leaves are vulnerary and astringent, the roots are diuretic. The acid fruits, as strawberry and raspberry, are used with success in putrid and bilious fevers, as likewise in contagious and epidemic dysenteries, which prevail in summer and autumn, and are occasioned by a sudden transition from a hot to a cold air, or by the acrid humour which flows into the intestines.\n\n36. Pomaceae, (from pomum an apple); consisting of those which have a pulpy eculent fruit, of the apple, berry, or cherry kind. The plants of this order, which furnish many of our most esteemed fruits, are mostly of the shrub and tree kinds. The roots are branched, fibrous, and in the greater part very long. The stems and branches are cylindric. These last are placed alternate; and, when young, are, in some genera angular. The bark is thick and wrinkled. The buds are of a conic form, placed in the angles of the leaves, and covered with scales which lie over each other like tiles. The leaves, which differ in form, being in some genera simple, in others winged, are, in the great number, placed alternate. The footstalk of the leaves is furrowed above, and frequently accompanied by a number of knobs like glands. Most of these plants are furnished with two stipules at the origin of the young footstalks of the leaves. These, in some genera are pretty large; in others, they are so small as scarce to be perceived; and in cocoa-plumb, in particular, they by their minute size resemble hairs. The flowers are universally hermaphrodite, except in spirea aruncus, in which male and female flowers are produced on distinct plants. In the greater number of genera they are produced in clusters or heads at the end of the branches. The calyx is of one piece, with five segments or divisions, which are permanent, and placed above the seed-bud in some; in the rest, they either fall off with the flower, or wither upon the stalk. The petals are five in number, and are inserted into the tube of the calyx. The stamens are generally 20 and upwards, and attached like the petals to the margin of the tube of the calyx. The anthers are short, and slightly attached to the filaments. The seed-bud is single; and in those genera which have the calyx permanent, it is placed below the receptacle of the flower. The seed-vessel is a pulpy fruit of the apple, berry, or cherry kind. Those of the apple kind are divided internally into a number of cavities or cells. The seeds are numerous.\u2014The pulpy fruits of this order are acid, eculent, and of great efficacy in putrid and bilious fevers.\n\n37. Columniferae, (from columna a pillar, and fero to bear); consisting of plants whose stamens and pistil have the appearance of a column or pillar in the centre of the flower. This order furnishes a choice collection of herbs both annual and perennial, shrubs and trees. These are very different in size and height, from the creeping\ncreeping mallows, and low shrubby tea-tree, to the fleathy limes, and the more lofty silk-cotton trees, which by some modern writers are affirmed to be so large as not to be fathomed by 16 men, and so tall that an arrow cannot reach their top. The shrubs and trees of this order are deciduous, pretty thick, of a beautiful appearance, with an erect stem, which is formed by its branches and foliage into a round head. The roots are extremely long, branch but little, and either run perpendicularly downwards, or extend themselves horizontally below the surface. The stems are cylindric. The young branches, though commonly of the same figure, are sometimes angular. The bark is thick and pliant. The wood, in general, is very soft and light. The buds are of a conic form, naked, or without scales; and situated either at the extremity of the branches, or in the angle formed by the branch and leaf. The leaves are alternate, simple, divided into several lobes, and frequently hand or finger-shaped. The ribs or nerves on the back of the leaf, in some genera of this order, are provided near their origin with a number of hollow furrows or glands, which, being filled with a clammy honey-like liquor, have been considered as so many vessels of secretion. The footstalk of the leaves is cylindric, swollen at its origin, and appears jointed at its junction with the branch. The flowers are universally hermaphrodite, except in biggeleria, and a species of Virginian marshmallow, called by Linnaeus napae dioica; the former of which bears male and female, the latter male and hermaphrodite, flowers on different roots. In many plants of this order, the flowers generally open about nine in the morning, and remain expanded till one in the afternoon. The flowers either terminate the branches, proceed from the angles of the leaves, or are disposed either singly or in a corymbus along the branches or stem. In most of these genera the calyx is single, but in others frequently double. In these last the inner calyx is always of one piece, generally divided into five segments; the outer consists either of one leaf, of three distinct leaves, or of many. The calyx, when single, is sometimes composed of one leaf which is permanent, or of several distinct leaves which are generally coloured, and fall off with the petals. In plants that have a double calyx, both flower-cups are generally permanent. The petals in this order are from four to nine; five is the prevailing number. The stamens, which are in number from 5 to 20 and upwards, are generally inserted into the common receptacle of the calyx, or into the pistillum or seed-bud. The filaments are either distinct, or united in a cylinder, which, proceeding from the receptacle of the calyx, surrounds the seed-bud, and attaches itself to the base of the petals, with which it slightly unites. The antherae are frequently roundish, and placed erect on the filament; most commonly, however, they are oblong or kidney-shaped, and slightly attached by the middle, or sides, to the filaments, on which they turn like a vane or needle. This last is, particularly, the characteristic of all the mallow tribe. The seed-bud is generally roundish or conic; and sometimes, as in the tea tree, angular. The seed-vessel is generally a capsule; sometimes a pulpy fruit of the berry or cherry kind. In some, it is a woody or membranous capsule, divided into as many cells internally as there were partitions in the seed-bud. The seeds are generally solitary, sometimes angular, and sometimes kidney-shaped.\u2014These plants are mucilaginous and lubricating.\n\n38. Tricocceae (from \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 three, and \u03ba\u03cc\u03ba\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 a grain); consisting of plants with a single three-cornered capsule, having three cells or internal divisions, each containing a single seed. The single seed-vessel of these plants is of a singular form, and resembles three capsules, which adhere to one common footstalk as a centre, but are divided externally into three pretty deep partitions. This family is not completely natural. It must be observed, however, that the character expressed in the title is a striking one; and that though the plants which possess it are not connected by such numerous relations as to form a true natural assemblage, yet they are by that circumstance distinguished from all other plants with as great, nay greater facility, than by any artificial character yet known. But all the genera of this order have not the striking character just mentioned.\n\n39. Siliqueae, (from silique a pod); consisting of plants which have a pod for their seed-vessel. This order chiefly furnishes biennial and perennial herbs of an irregular figure. The roots are long, branched, crooked, and fibrous. In some they are succulent and fleathy, in others jointed. The stems and young branches are cylindric. The leaves, which differ in point of form, being sometimes simple, sometimes winged, are generally placed alternate. The flowers are hermaphrodite, and in the greater number disposed in a spike at the extremity of the branches. The flower-cup is composed of four leaves, which are oblong, hollow, blunt, bunched at the base, and fall with the flower. These leaves are sometimes erect, and sometimes spread horizontally. The petals, which are four in number, spread at top, and are disposed like a cross; the claws or lower part of the petals are erect, flat, awl-shaped, and somewhat longer than the calyx. The upper part widens outwards. The stamens are six in number; two of which are of the length of the calyx, and the remaining four somewhat longer, but shorter than the petals. The antherae are of an oblong figure, pointed, thicker at the base, and erect. Betwixt the stamens, in plants of this order, are generally lodged one, two, or four, round greenish knots, which in some genera are so small as to elude the sight. These glands, called by Linnaeus glandula nectarifera, and used very improperly by that author as an essential character in discriminating the genera, seem to be prominences of the receptacle of the flower, occasioned by the stamens being deeply lodged in its substance. The seed-bud is single, and stands upon the receptacle of the flower. The style, which is either cylindric or flat like a scale, is of the length of the four longer stamens in some genera; in others it is very short, or even wanting. It accompanies the seed-bud to its maturity. The stigma is blunt, and sometimes deeply divided into two parts. The seed-vessel is either a long pod, or a short and round one. Either fort has two valves or external openings, and in a great many genera the same number of internal cavities or cells, the partition of which projects at the top beyond the valves. The seeds are roundish, small, and attached alternately by a slender thread to both futures or joinings of the valves. These plants have a watery, sharp, lixivial taste; and are charged with a fixed alkaline salt,\nsalt, which is drawn from them by burning, and being distilled without any addition produces a volatile alkali. Most of them have a flinting smell. With respect to their virtues, they are diuretic, attenuating, detergent, and antiflatusive. These qualities, however, are most eminently possessed by the live plants; when dried, they either entirely disappear, or are greatly diminished. Applied externally, these plants are useful in diseases of the skin, as the itch, leprosy, &c.\n\n40. Perforate, (from persona, a mask); consisting of a number of plants whose flowers are furnished with an irregular, gaping, or grinning petal, in figure somewhat resembling the snout of an animal. This order furnishes both herbaceous and woody vegetables of the shrub and tree kind. The roots are generally fibrous and branched. The stems and branches are cylindric when young, except in some species of figwort, in which they are square. The leaves are simple, generally placed opposite in pairs at the bottom of the branches, but in many genera stand alternate towards the top. The flowers are universally hermaphrodite; they proceed either singly or in clusters from the wings of the leaves, or terminate the branches in a spike, panicle, or head. The calyx is of one leaf, which is cut into two, three, four, or five segments, or divisions, that are permanent. The corolla is composed of one irregular petal, with two lips, resembling, as was already observed, the head or snout of an animal. In some plants the stamens are two or four in number, and of an equal length; in others they are universally four in number, two of which are long and two short. The seed-bud is single, and placed above the receptacle of the flower. The style is single; thread-shaped; bent in the direction of the stamens; and crowned with a stigma, which is generally blunt, and sometimes divided into two. The seed-vessel is a capsule, generally divided internally into two cavities or cells, and externally into the same number of valves or enclosures. The seeds are numerous, and affixed to a receptacle in the middle of the capsule.\u2014These plants possess nearly the same qualities with the lip flowers, though in a less degree. With respect to their virtues, many of them are aperient, anodyne, purgative, and even emetic. The internal use of many of them is extremely pernicious; applied externally, they are anodyne, and powerful reolvents.\n\n41. Asperifolia, rough-leaved plants. The greatest part of these are herbaceous and perennial. The roots are branching and fibrous; the stems and branches rounded; the buds of a conic form, naked or without scales. The leaves are simple, alternate, commonly very rough to the touch, and in most of the herbaceous plants sessile, or attached to the stem and branches without any footstalk. In the few trees, however, of this order, the leaves have a footstalk, the lower part of which, after the fall of the leaves, remains like a spine or thorn. The hairs are simple, and generally very rough to the touch. The flowers are in some genera solitary; but commonly collected into a spike or corymbus. They do not proceed from the angle formed by the stem or branch with the leaf, as in many plants; but from the side of the leaf, or from that part of the stem which is opposite to the leaf. They are almost universally hermaphrodite; in a few species of cordia, male and female flowers are produced upon different roots. The calyx is composed of one leaf, which is divided from three to ten equal or unequal parts. Those with four naked seeds have the calyx deeply divided into five parts which are permanent. The corolla is monopetalous, or composed of one petal, which in different plants is bell, funnel, salver, and wheel-shaped. The divisions of the limb or upper part of the petal are generally five, alternate with those of the calyx; equal and regular, except in ebium. The stamens are five in number, alternate with the divisions of the corolla. They are equal, attached to the tube of the corolla a little above its origin, and of the same height. The antherae are in some genera connivent; that is, approach and form a compact body above the filaments. The pistillum is generally composed of a slender style of the same length with the stamens, and crowned with a simple stigma. It proceeds from a germen or seed-bud, which in some plants is undivided, but generally split into four. The seeds are generally four in number, and lodged in the bottom of the calyx. Most of the rough-leaved plants are used in medicine; the flowers are esteemed cordial; the leaves and roots vulnerary and astringent; and the hard bony seeds are reckoned powerful promoters of urine. Externally, these plants are used for burnings and poisonous bites; they extirpate warts, and relieve disorders of the loins.\n\n42. Verticillate, consisting of herbaceous vegetables, having four naked seeds, and the flowers placed in whorls round the stalk. The roots are branched and fibrous. The stems are round when old, but square when young; as are likewise the young branches, which stand opposite. The leaves are opposite, and in the greater number covered with transparent points, those which are placed next the flower generally differ from the stem leaves. In the greater number of plants of this kind, the leaves are supported upon a long cylindrical footstalk that is furrowed above. The flowers are universally hermaphrodite, except in a species of thyme mentioned by Mr Adanson, which appears to have male or barren flowers on one root, and female or fertile flowers on the other. They are disposed round the stem in whorls or small heads with short footstalks. The calyx is of one piece, that is generally cut into five unequal divisions, whose disposition sometimes represents two lips; the uppermost of which has commonly a less number of divisions; it accompanies the seeds, which it nourishes in its bosom, to their maturity. The petal is of the gaping or lip kind, and in the different genera is more or less irregular or unequal, either in its tube, or in the divisions of the lips; the number of which varies from two to five. These divisions frequently form two lips; of which the uppermost, termed the crest and the helmet, is sometimes entire, sometimes more or less deeply cut into two; the lowermost, termed the beard, generally into three. The stamens are two or four in number. In the greater part there are four stamens of unequal length, two of them being long and two short. These four unequal stamens are frequently dissimilar, and approach by pairs; they are inclined towards the back of the petal, and parallel; the two innermost being shortest, and attached somewhat lower than the two others to the tube of the flower. The seed-bud, which consists of four distinct ovaries, is placed upon the seat of the flower, and elevates\nvates from their centre a common style, which is slender, bent in the same manner as the filaments, which it somewhat exceeds in length, and terminated by a double stigma or summit, the divisions of which are unequal, and turned backwards. The seed-vessel in this order is wanting. The seeds are four in number, and lodged in the bottom of the calyx as in a matrix or seed-vessel. Each seed has two covers; the one external, of a cartilaginous or leathery substance; the other internal, membranaceous, of a very fine texture, and placed immediately above the radicle or embryo plant. The plants of this order are fragrant, warm, penetrating, and accounted cordial and cephalic. Their chief virtue resides in the leaves.\n\n43. Damosae, (from dumus, a bush); consisting of a number of thorny plants, which are thick set with irregular branches, and bushy. The plants of this order are all of the shrub and tree kind, thick and bushy, rising from 6 to 25, 30, and even 40 feet high. Many of them too, as bastard alaternus, holly, iron wood, New Jersey tea, star apple, viburnum, winter berry, and some others, retain their beautiful leaves during the whole year. The roots are branched and fibrous. The stems are cylindric; the young branches sometimes angular. The buds are naked, that is, without scales, in the evergreen shrubs of this order; covered with scales in most of the others. The leaves, which in some genera are simple, in others compound, are placed alternate in some, and opposite in others. The flowers are mostly hermaphrodite. They proceed from the wings of the leaves either singly or in clusters; or they terminate the stem in that fort of flowering head called a corymbus. The calyx is generally very small, placed below or around the seed-bud; and consists of one leaf, with four, five, or six divisions, which are permanent. The rhamnus has no calyx. The petals are in number from one to five. The stamens are either four, five, six, or ten. The seed-bud is generally roundish, and placed within the flower. The style is commonly single, and sometimes wanting. The stigma is either single or triple. The seed-vessel is generally a berry, sometimes a dry capsule; the seeds are generally single and egg-shaped. The berries, bark, and flowers of many of these plants are purgative, and act particularly on the lymph and bile.\n\n44. Separieae, (from sepere a hedge); consisting of a beautiful collection of woody plants, some of which, from their size, elegance, and other circumstances, are very proper furniture for hedges. This order furnishes woody plants both of the shrub and tree kind, most of which do not drop their leaves till nearly the time when the new leaves begin to appear.\n\n45. Umbellatae, (from umbella an umbel); consisting of plants whose flowers grow in umbels, with five petals that are often unequal, and two naked seeds, that are joined at top and separated below. These plants are herbaceous, and chiefly perennial. The roots are either tuberous or spindle shaped, and sometimes forked. The stems are cylindric, full of pitch, and frequently hollow. The branches are alternate. The leaves, which like the branches are put on alternately, are very different in point of form; being simple and entire in some; target-shaped, in a species of navel-wort; finger or hand-shaped, in some others; and winged or pinnated with numerous minute divisions, as in the greater number. They are supported by a footstalk, which is very broad and membranous at its origin, and commonly embraces the whole contour of the stem and branches. The flowers are in general hermaphrodite. There are, however, some that have male or barren flowers in the same umbel. This is particularly the case with those umbelliferous plants which have the petals in the flowers of the circumference large and unequal. In these plants the flowers in the circumference only prove fertile; those in the centre, or disk, proving abortive. Oenanthe and imperatoria, on the contrary, have the flowers in the circumference abortive. In gineng, hermaphrodite and male flowers are produced upon distinct plants. The flowers are disposed in an umbel, which is either simple or compound. The common calyx in this order is that termed very improperly by Linnaeus involucrum, or the flower-cover; which in the greater number consists of one or more leaves placed under the partial or universal umbel, or both, for the purpose of support. The presence or absence of one or both of these covers affords excellent marks in discriminating the genera of this very familiar order of plants. The proper calyx of each flower, in the aggregate, consists of five minute indentments placed upon the seed-bud, which it envelopes, and accompanies to its maturity. The petals are five in number, and disposed upon the sides of the flower-cup in form of a rose. In the florets of the centre, the petals are generally pretty equal and small; in those of the circumference, they are frequently unequal and larger; in the greater number, they are heart-shaped, and cut almost to the middle in two. The stamens are five in number, placed opposite to the divisions of the flower-cup, and alternate with the petals. The seed-bud is universally placed under the leaf of the flower, and supports two styles which are turned backwards, and crowned with simple summits which do not differ in appearance from the styles. The seed-vessel in this order is wanting. The seeds are two in number, which, when ripe, separate below, but remain closely attached at top. The plants of this order, which grow in dry places, are sudorific, stomachic, and warming. Their virtue resides chiefly in the seeds and leaves. Those which grow in marshy places are generally poisonous; but, notwithstanding the extremely warm and even caustic quality of most of these plants, many of them are employed in the kitchen, and in the economy of domestic affairs.\n\n46. Hederaeae, (from hedera, ivy); consisting of ivy and a few other genera that seem nearly allied to it. This order furnishes both herbaceous and thorny plants; most of which, particularly ivy and vine, have creeping branches, which attach themselves by roots or tendrils to the bodies in their neighbourhood. The roots are long, with few branches. The stems and young branches are cylindric. In some species of vine they are square. The leaves are alternate; sometimes simple, sometimes winged, in which the surface of the leaves is covered with points. The footstalk of the leaves is cylindrical, and without any furrow. The buds are of a conic form, and without any scales. The flowers are either hermaphrodite, male and female upon different roots, or hermaphrodite and male upon different roots. In some they terminate the branches in an umbel; in others they proceed in clusters from the side\nfide opposite to the leaves; and in some, they are produced along the branches. The calyx consists of one leaf divided in five parts, which are small and generally permanent. The stamens are in number five; awl-shaped, erect, and generally of the length of the petals. Cissus has only four stamens, which are inserted into the nectarium, a sort of border surrounding the feed-bud. The anthers are roundish, and sometimes, as in ivy, attached to the filaments by the sides. The feed-bud is sometimes round, sometimes shaped like a top or pear, and ends in one, two, or five awl-shaped styles, which are crowned with a simple stigma. The flowers of the vine have no style. The feed-vessel is of the berry kind, with one, two, or five styles. The seeds are from one to five in number; placed either in distinct cells, or dispersed through the pulp without any partition.\n\n47. Stellatae, (from stella, a star); consisting of plants with two naked seeds, and leaves disposed round the stem in form of a radiant star. This order contains herbs, shrubs, and trees. The herbs, which are most numerous, are chiefly annual, and creep along the surface of the ground. The shrubs and trees are mostly evergreens, which rise erect, and are of an agreeable conic form.\u2014The plants are opening; some of their seeds, particularly those of coffee, are bitter and cordial; some of them are used in dyeing; and others in medicine.\n\n48. Aggregate, (from aggregate, to assemble or collect); comprehending those plants which have aggregate flowers, consisting of a number of florets or small flowers, each of which have a proper and common calyx.\n\n49. Compositae, consisting of plants with compound flowers. In this order Linnaeus has constructed his first or primary divisions from the different sexes of the florets, which he terms polygamy; the subaltern divisions are constructed from the figure of the petals, the disposition of the flowers, the pappus or crown of the seed, the common receptacle, and other circumstances which characterize the subaltern divisions in other authors.\n\n50. Amentaceae (from amentum a catkin), plants bearing catkins; as salix, populus, plantanus, &c.\n\n51. Coniferae, (from conus a cone, and fero to bear); consisting of plants, whose female flowers, placed at a distance from the male, either on the same or distinct roots, are formed into a cone. In this character, the only one expressed in the title, the plants in question seem to be nearly allied to the family of mosses: from which, however, they are easily distinguished by their habit, as well as by the structure of the small flowers, in which the stamens are united below into a cylinder, and distinct at top. The plants of this order are mostly of the shrub and tree kind, and retain their leaves all the year. The form of these plants is generally conic, and extremely beautiful, from the disposition of the branches, which cover the stems even to the roots, extending themselves horizontally and circularly like so many rays. The height of some genera of this order does not exceed half a foot, that of others approaches to a hundred. The roots are short, branching, not very fibrous, and extend horizontally. The stems and branches are cylindric. The bark is thin, and split into slender scales. The wood, except that of the yew tree, possesses little hardness. The buds are of a conic form, and naked, or without scales. The leaves are entire, small, and thick, frequently triangular, and generally pointed. Juniper has a prickly and thorny leaf. With respect to situation, they admit of great variety, being either alternate, opposite, placed in whorls round the stem, or collected into small bundles which proceed from a single point. They are placed on the branches without any sensible footstalk. The flowers in this order are universally male and female. In some genera, the male flowers are collected into a spike or cone at the end of the branches; in others, they proceed singly from the wings of the leaves, or termination of the branches. The female flowers are generally collected into a cone; but in yew tree and thorny horse-tail they are single, and terminate the branches. The calyx of the male flowers is a catkin; of the female, a cone. The petals of this order are wanting; except in the female flowers of juniper, which have three sharp, rigid, and permanent petals. The stamens are in number from 3 to 20 and upwards; united by their filaments into a cylinder or pillar, which rises out of the centre of the calyx. The anthers are erect, distinct, of a roundish form, and divided into internal partitions or cells, which, in the different genera, are in number from two to ten. The feed-buds are generally numerous, and placed between the scales of the cone, which serve for a calyx. From each feed-bud arises a very short cylindric style, crowned with a simple stigma, of a conic form. These plants have probably no feed-vessel or fruit; the seeds being naked, and involved only by the scales of the calyx. In some genera these scales are of a bony nature, and almost united; in others, they are of a substance like leather; in juniper, they are united, and become fleshy and succulent like a berry. The seeds in this order, being nourished, as in a feed-vessel, by the scales of the cone, or common calyx, differ in nothing from the germina or feed-buds.\u2014Most of the cone-bearing plants are resinous, or gummy; and the gums proceeding from them have a bitter taste, but generally a very agreeable smell.\n\n52. Coadunatae, (from coadunare, to join or gather together); so termed from the general appearance of the feed-vessels, which are numerous, and being slightly attached below, form all together a single fruit in the shape of a sphere or cone; the parts of which, however, are easily separated from one another. This order, which consists of exotic plants, furnishes a beautiful and choice collection of shrubs and trees, both evergreen and deciduous. The trees are often 60 feet high, and garnished from the bottom to the top with spreading branches and leaves of a bright green colour, which assume a very agreeable conic form. The roots are branching and fibrous. The stems are cylindric, and the wood very hard. The buds are conic, flat, and generally without scales. The leaves are universally simple and alternate. The footstalk is cylindric, without furrows, frequently swollen at its origin, and appears jointed at its insertion into the branch. The flowers are hermaphrodite, and are generally produced either along or at the end of the branches. The calyx generally consists of three oblong plain leaves, like petals, which fall off with the flower. The petals are in number from 6 to 18, oblong, concave, and frequently disposed in two or three series or rows, the outermost of which are largest. The stamens are numerous, short, and inserted into the common\ncommon receptacle in some, and into the feed-bud in others. The filaments are very short and slender, some genera having scarce any at all. The antherae are numerous, slender, and placed round the feed-bud. The pistillar generally consists of a number of feed-buds disposed in the form of a cone, and seated upon a receptacle which rises like a small pillar above the receptacle of the calyx. From each feed-bud generally arises a cylindric style, which is very short. The stigma is commonly blunt. The seed-vessel is commonly a berry; but in magnolia it is an oval cone, consisting of a number of roundish capsules laid over each other like tiles. The fruits or seed-vessels, whether of the berry, capsule, or cherry kind, are equal in number to the feed-buds, and generally slightly attached below. The seeds are numerous, hard, roundish, and sometimes cornered. The plants of this order have a strong, agreeable, and aromatic smell; the fruits and seeds have a pungent taste like pepper: the bark and wood are bitter.\n\n53. Scabridae (from scaber, rough, rugged or bristly), consisting of plants with rough leaves. There seems to be some impropriety in characterizing these plants by a name expressive of the roughness of their leaves, as that circumstance had previously furnished the classific character of the Alperifoliaceae. The degree of roughness, however, is much greater in the plants which make the subject of the present article.\u2014The plants of this order are in general of an astringent nature: their taste is bitter and styptic.\n\n54. Miscellaneae, miscellaneous plants. This order consists of such genera as are not connected together by very numerous relations. They are, datifica, poterium, refeda, languiflora, lemma, piftia, coriaria, empetrium, achyranthus, amaranthus, celeocea, gomphrena, iresine, phytolacca, nymphea, faracenia, cedrela, swietenia, corrigolla, limeum, telephium.\n\n55. Filices, ferns; consisting of plants which bear their flower and fruit on the back of the leaf or stalk. These plants, in figure, approach the more perfect vegetables; being furnished, like them, with roots and leaves. The roots creep, and extend themselves horizontally under the earth, throwing out a number of very slender fibres on all sides. The stem is not to be distinguished from the common footstalk, or rather middle rib of the leaves: so that in strict propriety the greater number of ferns may be said to be acuales: that is, to want the stem altogether. In some of them, however, the middle rib, or stalk proceeding from the root, overtops the leaves, and forms a stem upon which the flowers are supported. The leaves proceed either singly, or in greater number, from the extremities of the branches of the main root. They are winged or hand-shaped in all the genera except in adders-tongue, pepper-grass, and some species of spleenwort. The flowers, whatever be their nature, are, in the greater number of genera, fattened, and as it were glued, to the back of the leaves; in others, they are supported upon a stem which rises above the leaves; but in some, are supported on a flower-stalk, as already mentioned. The stamens are placed apart from the feed-bud in a genus termed by Mr Adanson palma filix; in the other ferns, where we have been able to discover the stamens, they are found within the same covers with the feed-bud. Most of the ferns have a heavy disagreeable smell: as to their virtues, they are opening and attenuating.\n\n56. Musci, mosses. These plants resemble the pines, firs, and other evergreens of that class, in the form and disposition of their leaves, and manner of growth of the female flowers, which are generally formed into a cone. They frequently creep, and extend themselves like a carpet upon the ground, trees, and stones, being generally collected into bunches and tufts: the smallest are only one-third of an inch in height, and the largest do not exceed five or six. Few of the mosses are annual: small as they are, the greater number are perennial and evergreens. Their growth is remarkably slow, as may be judged by the time that the antherae take to ripen. This, reckoning from the first appearance of the antherae to the dispersion of its powder or male dust, is generally four or six months. Although preferred dry for several years, these plants have the singular property of refusing their original verdure upon being moistened. It would be worth while to determine whether they do not also refuse their vegetative quality. The roots of plants of this order are fibrous, slender, branched, and short. The stems are cylindric and weak, as are also the branches; they creep upon the ground, and strike root on every side. The leaves are very small and undivided. They differ with respect to situation; being either alternate, opposite, or placed by fours round the stalk. They have no perceptible footstalk nor middle rib, and are seated immediately upon the stems. The flowers are universally male and female: in some, the male flowers are produced upon the same plants with the female, and stand before them; in others, they are produced sometimes on the same, and sometimes on distinct plants. The male flowers consist entirely of anthers, and their covering; proceed either singly, or in clusters, from the extremity of the branches, or angles of the leaves; and are either seated immediately upon the branches, or supported by a long footstalk. The female flowers, which generally resemble capsules or cones, are all placed immediately upon the stem or branches, without any footstalk; and proceed singly either from the wings of the leaves, or summit of the branches; when produced upon the same plant with the male they are always placed under them. The female cones of the mosses greatly resemble those of the pines and evergreen trees of that class; the scales which form them are true leaves, each containing in its wing or angle a single seed. When the seeds are ripe, the cones probably open for their dispersion. When flat, they resemble buds, and have sometimes been ignorantly mistaken for such. The calyx, in this order, if it can be called such, is that appearance resembling a vail or monk's cowl, which in the male flower covers or is suspended over the tops of the stamina like an extinguisher, and is termed by Linnaeus calyptra. The petals are universally wanting. The mosses in general are almost tasteless, have few juices, and being once dried do not readily imbibe moisture from the air. Those which grow in water, being thrown into the fire, grow red, and are reduced to ashes without receiving or communicating any flame; on which account some superstitious people, the Siberians in particular, place water mofs in their chimneys as a preservative against fire. Most of the mosses are purgative; some violently so, and even emetic. They are all of wonderful efficacy in preserving...\nserving dry such bodies as are susceptible of moisture; and in retaining, for a long time, the humidity of young plants without exposing them to putrefaction. For this reason, such plants as are to be sent to any considerable distance, are generally wrapped up in them.\n\n57. Algae, flags; consisting of plants whose root, leaf, and stem, are all one. Under this description are comprehended all the sea weeds, and some other aquatic plants.\n\n58. Fungi, mushrooms. These plants are rarely branched, sometimes creeping, but most commonly erect. Such as are furnished with branches have them of a light spongy substance like cork. Mushrooms differ from the fuci, in that those which, like the fuci, have their seeds contained in capsules, are not branched, as that numerous clafs of sea weeds are. The greatest part of mushrooms have no root; some, instead of roots, have a number of fibres, which, by their incrustations, frequently form a net with unequal meshes, some of which produce plants similar to their parent vegetable. The flamina in these plants are still undetermined. The seeds are spread over the surface of the plant, or placed in open holes or cavities, resembling the open capsules of some of the fuci. In mushrooms which are branched, the seeds are frequently visible by the naked eye, and always to be distinctly observed by the affluence of a good microscope. These plants are very astringent, and some of them are used for stopping violent hemorrhages. As a vegetable food, they are at best suspicious: some of them are rank poison.\n\nDubit ordinis. Under this name Linnaeus classes all the other genera which cannot be reduced to any of the abovementioned orders, and which are near 120 in number.\n\nAlphabetical Explanation of Botanical Terms.\n\nA.\n\nAbrupt (abruptus), when a winged leaf ends without a little leaf.\nAcorn, the seed of the oak.\nAcostylodes, seeds without lobes, which produce no seminal leaves.\nAcute (acutus), tapering to a slender, but not thorny termination.\nAir-bag (folliculus), a distended seed-vessel opening on one side.\nAlternate (alternus), applied to branches, leaves, or flowers, springing out regularly one above another.\nAndrogynous, having some flowers on the same plant, bearing stamens, but no pistils; and other flowers bearing pistils, but no stamens.\nAngiopermia, seeds in a capsule.\nAngular (angulatus) having corners; opposed to cylindrical.\n\u2014\u2014 capsule, as in flower-de-luce.\nAnnual (annus), living only one year.\nAnomalous (anomalus), irregular.\nAnther (anthera), the top of the stamen fixed on the filament, and containing the pollen.\nApex, termination.\nApophysis, excrescence.\nApproaching, see Converging.\nArrow-shaped (fagittatus), leaf shaped like an arrow head, as forset.\nAscending, growing first horizontally, and then bent upwards.\nAttenuate (attenuatus), tapering.\nAwl-shaped (fubulatus), slender.\nAwn (arista) or beard, the sharp substance growing to the valves of corn or grass.\nAwnless (muticus), without awns.\nAxillary (axillaris) at the base of the leaves or branches.\n\nB.\n\nBark (cortex), the covering of the stems, roots, and branches of vegetables.\nBarren (malculi, abortivi), flowers or florets, which produce no perfect seeds; generally wanting pistils.\nBase, see Axillary.\nBattle-dore-shaped (spatulatum), rounded with a neck.\nBeaded (granulatus), consisting of many little knobs, connected by small strings.\nBeak or Bill (rostrum), a projecting appendage to some seeds.\nBearded (barbatus), beset with straight parallel hairs.\nBell-shaped (campanulatus), like the blossom of the convolvulus.\nBellying (ventricosus) distended.\nBeneath (inferus).

Europe, Egypt, Virginia.\n\n* L. feeds wrinkled; corolla or blossoms hardly longer than the calyxes or cups.\u2014The girls in the north of Europe, it is said, paint their faces with the juice of the root of this plant upon days of festivity. The bark of the root tinged wax and oil of a beautiful red, similar to that which is obtained from the root of the foreign alkanet that is kept in the shops. Sheep and goats eat it. Cows are not fond of it. Horses and swine refuse it.\n\n* L. feeds smooth; coroll scarcely longer than the officinale, calyx; leaves lanceolate or spear-shaped. This species is found wild in dry fields and hedges. Its seeds are roundish, hard, of a whitish colour, like little pearls; and from these circumstances, they were at one time supposed peculiarly serviceable in calculous disorders. Their taste is merely farinaceous.\n\n277. *Anchusa*, or Bugloss.\n\n13 species; viz. paniculata, capensis, officinalis, italica, angustifolia, undulata, tinctoria, hispida, virginica, lanata, sempervirens, parviflora, cespitosa.

S. Europe, Japan, Virginia.\n\nofficinale. * C. stamens shorter than the blossom; leaves broad, spear-shaped, fitting, cottony.\u2014Both the root and leaves of this plant have been suspected to possess narcotic properties, but some will not admit of the fact. It is discarded from the present practice; though some individuals are said to use a decoction of the roots inwardly, and cataplasm of them outwardly, in strumous and scrophulous cases. Its scent is very disagreeable, and very much resembles that of mice. Goats eat it. Cows, horses, sheep, and swine, refuse it. It furnishes food to the phalena domina.\n\n279. Pulmonaria, or Lungwort.\n\nSeven species; viz. * angustifolia, * officinalis, suffruticosa, paniculata, virginica, fibrica, * maritima. Europe, N. America.\n\nofficinalis. * R. root-leaves egg-heart-shaped, rough; upper leaves egg-shaped, acute.\u2014This plant when burnt, is said to afford a larger quantity of ashes than almost any other vegetable; often 1-7th of its weight. Sheep and goats eat it. Cows are not fond of it. Horses and swine refuse it. The chrysothem nemorum feeds upon it.\n\n280. Symphytum, or Comfrey.\n\nThree species; viz. officinale, * tuberosum, orientale. Ger. Fr. Spain, India.\n\nofficinale. * S. leaves egg-shaped, decurrent.\u2014The particles of the pollen are said to appear in the microscope like two globules united together. The leaves give a grateful flavour to cakes and panada, and the young stems and leaves are excellent when boiled. The roots are glutinous and mucilaginous, and a decoction of them is used by dyers to extract the colouring matter of gum lac. Cows and sheep eat it. Horses, goats, and swine, refuse it.\n\n281. Cerinthe, or Honeywort.\n\nThree species; viz. major, alpina, minor. Austria, S. Europe.\n\n282.

East Indies, Africa.\n\nofficinalis. * B. all the leaves alternate; cal. expanding.\u2014It appears by experiment that the juice of this plant affords a true nitre. It is seldom used inwardly, but as an ingredient in cool tankards for summer drinking, though the young and tender leaves are good in salads, or as a pot herb. It is said to afford nourishment to the phalena gamma. Horses are said to have eaten it.\n\n284. Asperugo, or Small Wild Bugloss.\n\nTwo species; viz. * procumbens and aegyptiaca.

Europe.\n\n* P. leaves toothed, wrinkled, scape many-flowered, veris, lumbus of the cor. concave.\u2014This is a low plant growing wild in woods and hedges, and producing pale yellow flowers in the spring. The leaves have an herbaceous taste. The roots are slightly bitter, with a kind of aromatic flavour, which some compare to that of aniseed; their expressed juice purified by settling is sometimes used as a sternutatory. The flowers have an agreeable flavour, but very weak; an infusion of them in wine, and a spirit distilled from them, are used in some places as cordial and nervine.\n\n294.

Europe, Cape, Ceylon, Mal. *M. leaves growing by threes; cor. segments entire at the edge, shaggy on the upper surface.\u2014An infusion of the leaves of this plant is said to be extremely bitter, and is prescribed in rheumatism and dropsies. A dram of them in powder, purges and vomits. It is sometimes given to destroy worms. In a scarcity of hops, this plant is used in the north of Europe to bitter the ale. Two ounces supply the place of a pound of hops. Some people smoke the dried leaves. The powdered roots are sometimes used in Lapland instead of bread, but they are unpalatable. Some people say that sheep will eat it, and that it cures them of the rot. But from the usual experiments, it appears that though goats eat it, sheep sometimes will and sometimes will not. Cows, horses, and swine, refuse it.\n\n300. **Dor\u00e9na**.\n\nOne species; viz. japonica.\n\n301. **Hottonia**, or *Water-violet*.\n\nFour species; viz. *palustris*, felsilitora, indica, serrata.

Europe, Japan, N. America. *L. leaves somewhat cordate, flowers solitary, stem creeping.\u2014This species called *Moneywort*, or *Herb Twopence*, grows spontaneously in moist watery places, and creeps on the ground with two little roundish leaves at each joint. Their taste is subastringent and very slightly acid; hence, they stand recommended by Boerhaave in the hot scurvy, and in uterine and other hemorrhages. But their effects are so inconsiderable, that common practice takes no notice of them.\n\n306. **Anagallis**, or *Pimpernel*.\n\nSix species; viz. *arvensis*, pumila, monelli, latifolia, linifolia, *tenella*. Europe, Jamaica.\n\n307. **Theophrasta**.\n\nTwo species; viz. americana, longifolia. America.\n\n308. **Spigelia**, or *Worm-grass*.\n\nTwo species; viz. anthelmia, marilandica. North America, W. Indies.\u2014This last species grows wild in the southern parts of North America. The roots are celebrated as an anthelmintic, particularly for the expulsion of lumbrici from the alimentary canal. Some order it in doses of ten or fifteen grains, and allege it is apt to occasion nervous affections if given in larger doses; while others order it in dram doses, alleging that the bad effects mentioned more readily happen from small, as the large ones often purge or puke; some prefer the form of infusion. An emetic is generally premised; and its purgative effect assisted by some suitable additions.\n\n309. **Ophiorrhiza**, or *Serpents-tongue*.\n\nThree species; viz. mungos, mitreola, subumbellata. E.

Europe, Asia, Africa, America.\n\n* C. leaves arrow-shaped, lopped at the base; fruit-stalk four-cornered, bearing 1 flower.\u2014The insipidated juice of this plant in doses of 20 or 30 grains, is said to be a powerful drastic purge. Scammony is the insipidated juice of a species of convolvulus, so much resembling this, that they are with difficulty distinguished. Though an acid purgative to the human race, it is eaten by hogs in large quantities without any detriment. Sheep, goats, and horses eat it. Cows refuse it.\n\nfoldanella. * C. leaves kidney-shaped; fruitstalks with 1 flower.\u2014It is said, that half an ounce of the juice, or a drachm of the powder of this plant, is an acid purge. The leaves applied externally, are said to diminish dropsical swellings of the feet. The different species furnish nourishment to the Sphinx convolvuli, and palena elpenor.\n\njalap. The root of the species termed jalapa, is brought to us in thin slices from Xalpa, a province of New Spain. Such pieces should be chosen as are most compact, hard, weighty, dark-coloured, and abound most with black circular striae. Slices of bryony root are said to be sometimes mixed with jalap. These may be easily distinguished by their white colour and less compact texture. This root has no smell, and very little taste upon the tongue; but when swallowed it affects the throat with a sense of heat, and occasions a plentiful discharge of saliva. Taken in substance in a dose of about half a drachm, (less or more, according to the circumstances of the patient) in plethoric or cold phlegmatic habits, it proves an effectual, and, in general, a safe purgative; performing its office mildly, seldom occasioning nausea or gripes, which too frequently accompany other strong cathartics. In hypochondriacal cases, and hot bilious temperaments, it gripes violently if the jalap be good; but rarely takes due effect as a purge. An extract made with water purges almost universally, but weakly; and, at the same time, has a considerable effect by urine: the root remaining after this procels gripes violently. The pure resin, prepared by spirit of wine, occasions most violent gripings and other distressing circumstances, but proves scarce at all cathartic. Triturated with sugar or with almonds, into the form of an emulsion, or dissolved in spirits and mixed with syrups, it purges plentifully in a small dose, without occasioning much disorder. The part of the jalap remaining after the separation of the resin, yields to water an extract, which has no effect as a cathartic, but operates powerfully by urine.\n\nFrederic Hoffman particularly cautions against giving this medicine to children, and affirms us that it will destroy appetite, weaken the body, and perhaps occasion death. In this point this celebrated practitioner was probably deceived. Children, whose yolks are lax, and their food soft and lubricating, bear these kinds of medicines, as Geoffrey observes, better than adults; and, accordingly, inoculators make much use of the tincture mixed with simple syrup. A compound powder of it is employed in dropsy as a hydragogue purge; and where stimulus is not contra-indicated, jalap is considered as a safe cathartic.\n\nThe species of the genus convolvulus, called scammony, is a climbing plant, which grows in Asiatic Turkey, and affords a gum resin. The best sorts of the gum resin come from Aleppo, in light spongy masses, easily friable, of a shining ash-colour verging to black; when powdered, of a light grey or whitish colour. An inferior sort is brought from Smyrna in more compact ponderous pieces, of a darker colour, and full of sand and other impurities. This juice is chiefly of the resinous kind. Rectified spirit of wine dissolves five ounces out of six; the remainder is a mucilaginous substance mixed with dross: proof spirit totally dissolves it, the impurities only being left. It has a faint and unpleasant smell, and a bitterish somewhat acrimonious taste. Scammony is an efficacious and a strong purgative. Its dose is from three to 12 grains.\n\n324. Cantua.

Cape, East and West Indies, America.\n\nThe species called *siphilitica* grows in moist places in Virginia, and bears our winters. It is perennial, has an erect stalk three or four feet high, blue flowers, a milky juice, and a rank smell. The root consists of white fibres about two inches long, resembles tobacco in the taste, which remains on the tongue, and is apt to excite vomiting. It is used by the North American Indians as a specific for the venereal disease. The form is that of decoction; the dose of which is ordered to be gradually increased till it bring on very considerable purging, then to be intermitted for a little, and again used in a more moderate degree till the cure be completed. The ulcers are also washed with the decoction, and the Indians are said to sprinkle them with the powder of the inner bark of the spruce tree. The same strictness of regimen is ordered as during a salivation or mercurial course. The benefit to be derived from this article has not, so far as we know, been confirmed either in Britain, or by the practitioners of Virginia; for there, as well as in this country, recourse is almost universally had to the use of mercury. Hence the London college have omitted it in their list of medical plants; though in some cases it would seem to deserve trial.\n\n343.

CINCHONA, or Jesuits-bark Tree.\n\nNine species; viz. officinalis, pubescens, macrocarpa, caribaea, corymbifera, lineata, floribunda, brachycarpa, augustiflora. Peru, West Indies, South Sea.\n\nThe *cinebona officinalis* (Peruvian or Jesuits-bark tree), is described as being in general about 15 feet high, and six inches thick. It somewhat resembles our cherry tree, grows promiscuously in forests, particularly in the hilly parts of Quito in Peru, and is spontaneously propagated from its own seeds. The bark has some odour, to most people not unpleasant, and very perceptible in the distilled water, in which floating globules, like essential oil, have been observed. Its taste is bitter and astringent, accompanied with a degree of pungency, and leaving a considerably lasting impression on the tongue. Two sorts are mentioned, viz. the coloured and the white. The coloured includes the pale, the red, the yellow, and the knotty; their barks being coloured, having the cinchona taste and smell, and the trees having very smooth leaves and purple flowers. The white includes four varieties, their barks being of a whitish colour, with very little taste or smell, and the trees having broad hairy leaves, very fragrant red flowers, with hairs on the inside. The proper red bark, and one of the white kind, have been found in the province of Santa Fe.\n\nDr Wright has described very accurately a species of cinchona, under the appellation of *cinebona jamaicensis*, from its being found chiefly in Jamaica. It is there called the *sea-side beech*, and grows from 20 to\n40 feet high. The white-furrowed thick outer bark is not used; the dark-brown inner bark has the common flavour, with a mixed kind of taste at first of the horseradish and ginger, becoming at last bitter and astringent. It seems to give out more extractive matter than the officinalis. Some of it was imported from St Lucia, in consequence of its having been successfully used in the army and navy; and Dr Kentish has treated of it at great length, under the name of St Lucia bark. When fresh, it is considerably cathartic and emetic, but is said to lose these properties on drying.\n\nThe pale and the red are chiefly used in Britain. The pale is brought to us in pieces of different sizes, either flat or quilled, and the powder is rather of a lighter colour than that of cinnamon. The red is generally in much larger thicker flatish pieces, but sometimes also in the form of quills, and its powder is reddish, like that of the Armenian bole. It is much more resinous, and possesses the sensible qualities of the cinchona, in a much higher degree than the other sorts; and the more nearly the other kinds resemble the red bark, the better they are now considered. The red bark is heavy, round, and dry; friable between the teeth; does not separate into fibres; and breaks, not shivery, but short, close, and smooth. It has three layers; the outer is thin, ragged, of a reddish-brown colour, but frequently covered with mossy matter; the middle is thicker, more compact, darker-coloured, very resinous, brittle, and yields little to the pettle. The inmost is more woody, fibrous, and of a brighter red.\n\nThe Peruvian bark yields its virtues both to cold and boiling water; but the decoction is thicker, gives out its taste more readily, and forms an ink with a chalybeate more suddenly, than the fresh cold infusion. This infusion, however, contains at least as much extractive matter, but more in a state of solution; and its colour, on standing some time with the chalybeate, becomes darker, while that of the decoction becomes more faint. When they are of a certain age, the addition of a chalybeate renders them green; and when this is the case, they are found to be in a state of fermentation, and effete. Mild or caustic alkalies, or lime, precipitate the extractive matter, which in the case of the caustic alkali is re-dissolved by a farther addition of the alkali. Lime-water precipitates less from a fresh infusion, than from a fresh decoction; and in the precipitation of this last some mild earth is perceptible. The infusion is by age reduced to the same state with the fresh decoction, and then they deposit nearly an equal quantity of mild earth and extractive matter; so that lime-water, as well as a chalybeate, may be used as a test of the relative strength and perishable nature of the different preparations, and of different barks. Accordingly, cold infusions are found, by experiments, to be less perishable than decoctions; infusions and decoctions of the red bark than those of the pale; those of the red bark, however, are found, by length of time, to separate more mild earth with the lime-water, and more extractive matter. Lime-water, as precipitating the extract, appears an equally improper and disagreeable menstruum.\n\nThe power of different menstrua, as acting upon Peruvian bark, is comparatively in the following order; the most powerful solvent being placed first.\n\n1. Dulcified spirit of vitriol,\n2. Cautley,\n3. French brandy,\n4. Soft water,\n5. Vinegar and water,\n6. Dulcified spirit of nitre,\n7. Mild volatile alkali,\n8. Rectified spirit of wine,\n9. Mild vegetable alkali,\n10. Lime-water.\n\nThe antiseptic powers of vinegar and bark united, are double the sum of those taken separately. The astringent power of the bark is increased by acid of vitriol; the bitter taste is destroyed by it. The officinal preparations of the bark are,\n\n1. The powder. Of this, the first parcel that passes the sieve, being the most resinous and brittle layer, is the strongest.\n2. The extract. The watery and spiritious extracts conjoined form the most proper preparations of this kind.\n3. Spiritious tincture. This is best made with proof spirit.\n4. The decoction. This preparation, though frequently employed, is inferior to a simple watery infusion.\n\nThe best form is that of powder; in which the constituent parts are in the most effectual proportion. The cold infusion, which can be made in a few minutes by agitation, the spiritious tincture, and the extract, are likewise proper in this respect. For covering the taste, different patients require different vehicles, liquorice, aromatics, acids, port wine, small beer, porter, butter milk, brandy, rum, currant-jelly, &c.\n\nAccording to some, the Peruvians learned the use of the bark, by observing certain animals affected with intermittents, instinctively led to it; while others say, that a Peruvian, having an ague, was cured by having drunk of a pool, in which felled trees had long soaked, as to give the taste of their bark to the water; and its use in gangrene is said to have originated from its curing one in an aguish patient. About the year 1640, the lady of the Spanish viceroy, the Comitissa del Cinchon, was cured by the bark, which has therefore been called cortex or pulvis comitissae, cinchona, chinachina or chinchina, kinakind or kinkina, quinquina or quinquina; and from the interest which the cardinal de Lugo and the Jesuits took in its distribution, it has been called cortex or pulvis Cardinalis de Lugo, Jesuiticus, Patrum, &c.\n\nAs it was first introduced into practice for the cure of intermittent fevers, so it seldom fails of success, when properly exhibited in these. Practitioners, however, have differed as to the best mode of exhibiting it; some prefer giving it just before the fit, some during the fit, others immediately after it. Some again order it in the quantity of an ounce between the fits, the dose being the more frequent and larger, according to the frequency of the fits; and this mode of exhibition, although it may sometimes lead to the employment of more bark than is necessary, is thought, upon the whole, preferable, from being the best suited to most stomachs. The requisite quantity is very different in different cases, and in many vernal intermittents it seems even hardly necessary.\n\nIt often pukes and purges, and sometimes oppresses the stomach. These, or any other irregular effects that may take place, are to be counteracted by remedies particularly appropriated to them. Thus, vomiting\ning is often restrained by exhibiting it in wine; loofe-\nnels, by combining it with opium; and oppression at\nstomach, by combining it with an aromatic. But, un-\nless for obviating particular occurrences, it is more\nsuccessful when exhibited in its simplest state, than\nwith any addition.\n\nIt is now given from the very commencement of the\ndisease, and is to be continued, not only till the pa-\nroxysms cease, but till the natural appetite, strength,\nand complexion, return. Its use is then to be gradu-\nally left off, and repeated at proper intervals to pre-\nvent against a relapse, to which there is a tendency,\nespecially when the wind blows from the east. An\nemetic is often advantageously employed before com-\nmencing the use of it, but other evacuants seem hurt-\nful.\n\nThe Peruvian bark seems not only suited to inter-\nmittent fevers, both latent and formed, but to that\nstate of the constitution on which all diseases, rigidly\nperiodical, seem to depend; as periodical pain, inflam-\nmation, hemorrhagy, spasm, cough, loss of external\nfever, &c. Bark is now used by some in all conti-\nnued fevers, taking care to keep the bowels clean, and\nto promote, when necessary, the evacuation of redun-\ndant bile. In confluent smallpox it promotes languid\neruption and suppuration, diminishes the fever through\nthe whole course of it, and prevents or corrects putre-\nfaction or gangrene. In gangrenous sore throats it is\nmuch used, as it is externally and internally in all\ncases of gangrene. In contagious dysentery, after\ndue evacuation, it has been used by the mouth, and\nby injection, with and without opium.\n\nIn all those hemorrhages called passive, which all\nhemorrhages are very apt to become, and likewise in\nall other increased discharges, it is much used; and, in\ncertain undefined cases of hemoptysis, some allege,\nthat it is remarkably effectual, when joined with an\nabsorbent. It is used for obviating the disposition to\nnervous and convulsive diseases; and some have great\nconfidence in it, joined with the acid of vitriol, in cases\nof phthisis, scrofula, ill-conditioned ulcers, rickets, fever,\nand in states of convalescence. In these cases,\nhowever, it ought, in general, to be joined with a\nmilk diet.\n\nIn dropsy, not depending on any particular local af-\nfection, it is often alternated or conjoined with diure-\ntics or other evacuants; and by its early exhibition af-\nter the water is drawn off, or even begins to be freely\ndischarged, a fresh accumulation is prevented, and a\nradical cure obtained. In obstinate venereal cases,\nparticularly those which appear under the form of pains\nin the bones, the Peruvian bark is often successfully\nsubjoined to mercury, or even given in conjunction\nwith it. On the whole this remedy is useful in such\na vast variety of cases, that its virtues cannot be suffi-\nciently explained, by considering it merely as an ordi-\nnary tonic or astringent; and hence many practitioners\nconsider it as possessing specific qualities peculiar to it-\nself, the nature of which is by no means well under-\nstood.\n\n347. Solena.\nOne species; viz. longiflora.\n\n348. Ucriana.\nOne species; viz. speciosa.\n\n349. Psychotria, or Ipecacuanha.\n39 species; viz. affatica, glabrate, axillaris, lauri-\nfolia, parviflora, hirsuta, f\u0153tens, citrifolia, nitida, mar-\nginata, tenuifolia, nervosa, carthagenensis, myrtiphyll-\num, laxa, paratrica, horizontalis, nutans, speciosa, involucrata, flexuosa, racemosa, violacea, brachiata,\ngrandis, patens, uliginosa, ferrea, herbacea, emetica,\ncorymbulata, palicorea, lutea, longiflora. E. and W.\nIndies, S. America, China.\n\nThe root of the Psychotria emetica, or common ipe-\ncacuan is brought from the Spanish W. Indies. It is\ndivided into two sorts, the Peruvian and Brazilian;\nbut the eye distinguishes three; ash-coloured or gray,\nbrown, and white. The ash-coloured or Peruvian\nipecacuan of the shops is a small wrinkled root, bent\nand contorted into a great variety of figures; brought\nover in short pieces full of wrinkles, and deep circular\nfigures, quite down to a small white woody fibre that runs\nin the middle of each piece. The cortical part is com-\npact, brittle, looks smooth and resinous upon breaking.\nIt has very little smell; the taste is bitterish and sub-\nacid, covering the tongue as it were with a kind of mu-\ncilage. The brown is small and somewhat more wrink-\nled than the foregoing; of a brown or blackish colour\nwithout and white within: this is brought from Brazil.\nThe white sort is woody and has no wrinkles, and no\nperceptible bitterness in taste. The first sort, the ash-\ncoloured or grey ipecacuan, is that usually preferred for\nmedicinal use. The brown has been sometimes observed,\neven in a small dose, to produce violent effects.\nThe white, though taken in a large one, has scarce any\neffect at all: Mr Geoffrey calls this sort bastard ipe-\ncacuan, and complains that it is an imposition upon the\npublic. Geoffrey, Newman, Dale, and Sir Hans\nSloane inform us, that the roots of a kind of Apocyn-\num (dog's-bane), are frequently brought over instead of it;\nand instances are given of ill consequences fol-\nlowing from the use of these roots. If the marks above\nlaid down, particularly of the ash-colour, brittleness,\ndeep wrinkles, and bitterish taste, be carefully attend-\ned to, all mistakes of this kind may be prevented.\n\nIpecacuan was first brought to Europe about the\nmiddle of the century before the last, and an account\nof it published about the same time by Piso; but it did\nnot come into general use till about the year 1686,\nwhen Helvetius, under the patronage of Lewis XIV., in-\ntroduced it into practice. This root is one of the mild-\nest and safest emetics with which we are acquainted;\nand has this peculiar advantage, that if it should not\noperate by vomit, it passes off by the other emunctories.\nIt was first introduced among us with the character of\nan almost infallible remedy in dysenteries and other in-\nveterate fluxes, as menorrhagia and leucorrhea, and\nalso in disorders proceeding from obstructions of long\nstanding: nor has it lost much of its reputation by\ntime. In dysenteries it almost always produces happy\neffects, and often very speedily performs a cure. In\nother fluxes of the belly, in beginning dysenteries, and\nsuch as are of a malignant kind, or where the patient\nbreathes a tainted air, it has not been equally successful:\nin these cases it is necessary to continue the use of this\nmedicine for several days, and to join with it opiates,\ndiaphoretics, and the like. This root given in substance\nis as effectual, if not more so, than any of the prepara-\ntions.\nrations of it; the pure resin acts as a strong irritating emetic, but is of little service in dysenteries; whilst an extract prepared with water is almost of equal service in these cases with the root itself, though it has little effect as an emetic. Geoffrey concludes from hence that the chief virtue of ipecacuan in dysenteries depends upon its gummy substance, which, lining the intestines with a soft mucilage when their own mucus has been abraded, occasions their ulcerations to heal, and defends them from the acrimony of the juices; and that the resinous part, in which the emetic quality resides, is required where the morbid matter is lodged in the glands of the stomach and intestines. Water assisted by a boiling heat takes up from all vegetables a considerable portion of resinous along with the gummy matter; if the ipecacuan remaining after the action of water be digested with pure spirit, it will not yield half so much resin as at first; so that the aqueous extract differs from the crude root only in degree, being proportionally less resinous, and having less effect both as an emetic, and in the cure of dysenteries. The virtues of ipecacuan in this disorder depend on its producing perspiration, the freedom of which here is of the utmost importance, and an increase of which, even in healthful persons, is generally observed to decrease the evacuation by stool. In dysenteries the skin is for the most part dry and tense, and perspiration obstructed; the common diaphoretic passes off without effect through the intestinal canal; but ipecacuan, if the patient after a puke or two be covered up warm, brings on a plentiful sweat. After the removal of the dysentery, it is necessary to continue the use of the medicine for some time longer, in order to prevent a relapse; for this purpose a few grains divided into several doses, so as not to occasion any sensible evacuation, may be exhibited every day; by this means the cure is effectually established. And indeed small doses given even from the beginning have been found to have better effects in the cure of this disease than larger ones. The only official preparation of this root is a tincture made in wine, which has the appellation of Vinum Ipecacuanthe both in the London and Edinburgh Pharmacopoeias. Ipecacuan, particularly in the state of powder, is now advantageously employed in almost every disease in which full vomiting is requisite; and when combined with opium, it furnishes us with the most useful and active sweating medicine that we possess. It is also often given with advantage in small doses, so as neither to operate by vomiting, purging, nor sweating. The full dose of the powder is a scruple or half a dram, and double that in case of watery infusion. The full dose is recommended in the paroxysm of spasmodic asthma, and a dose of three or four grains every morning in habitual asthmatic indisposition; a dose of one third or half a grain rubbed with sugar, and given every four hours or oftener is recommended in uterine haemorrhage, cough, pleurisy, haemoptysis, &c., and has often been found highly serviceable. Dr Irving found that by long boiling, the activity of the root is almost totally destroyed; but that its emetic property was most effectually counteracted by means of the acetous acid; inasmuch that 30 grains of the powder, taken in two ounces of vinegar, produced only some loose stools.\n\n350. CHIMARRHIS.\nOne species; viz. cymola. Martinico.\n\n351. DENTELLA.\nOne species; viz. repens. South sea isles.\n\n352. VIRECTA.\nOne species; viz. biflora. Cayenne, Surinam.\n\n353. COFFEA, or Coffee-tree.\nEight species; viz. lambucina, opulina, odorata, arabica, tiolera, guianensis, paniculata, occidentalis. Yemen in Arabia, West Indies, S. America.\n\nThe coffee arabica, though it originally came from Arabia, is now cultivated in the West Indies. Its fruit is employed rather as food than as a medicine. The medical effects expected from it are to assist digestion, promote the natural secretions, and prevent or remove a tendency to sleepiness. It has been recommended in spasmodic asthma; and in some cases it is found highly useful in alleviating severe headache. In the influenza, or epidemic complaint of spring 1803, the use of coffee as the chief article of food was found to be attended with the best effects, particularly in removing that extreme debility which was the most universal and remarkable symptom of the disease.\n\n354. CHIOCOCCA, or Snow-berry.\nTwo species; viz. racemosa and barbata. Jamaica, S. America.\n\n355. VANGUERIA.\nOne species; viz. edulis. Isle of Madagascar.\n\n356.

SCHWENKFIELDIA.\nThree species; viz. hirta, cinerea, aspera. West Indies.\n\n361. LONICERA, or Honeysuckle.\n20 species; viz. caprifolium, dioica, sempervirens, grata, impensa, * periclymenum, japonica, nigra, quadriflora, tatarica, * xylosteum, pyrenaica, alpigena, cerulea, orientalis, flexuosa, symphoricarpos, diervilla, bubalina, corymbosa. Eur. Cape, Japan, N. America.\n* L. heads egg-shaped, tiled, terminating; leaves periclymenum distinct, deciduous; blossom gaping.\u2014The beauty and num. fragrance of the flowers of this plant render it a pleasing ornament to our gardens, hedges and arbours. Cows, goats, and sheep, eat it; horses refuse it. Various insects feed upon it.\n* L. fruitstalks 2 flowered; berries distinct, leaves xylosteum very entire, pubescent.\u2014In the north of Europe this is a common plant; Linnaeus informs us it makes excellent garden hedges in a dry soil; that the clear parts between the joints of the shoots are used in Sweden as tubes for tobacco pipes, and that the wood being extremely hard makes teeth for rakes, &c.\n362. Triostium, or Fever-root, Tinker's Weed.\nThree species; viz. perfoliatum, angustifolium, triflorum.\n\n363. Morinda.\nThree species; viz. umbellata, citrifolia, royoc.\n\n364. B\u00e6brotrys.\nTwo species; viz. nemoralis and lanceolata.\n\n365. Simarouba.\nFour species; viz. farinosa, tetandra, glandulosa, rotundifolia, Arabia.\n\n366.

South of Europe.\n\n375. Bross\u00e6a.\nOne species; viz. cocinea. S. America.\n\n376. Verbascum, or Mullein.\n17 species; viz. * thapifus, * thapifoides, boerhaavii, haemorrhoidale, phomoides, * lychnitis, ferrugineum, * nigrum, pheniceum, * blattaria, gallium, finatum, pinnatidium, barnadesii, olbecchii, spinosum, myconi. S. of Europe, Madeira.\n\n* V. leaves decurrent, cottony on both sides; stem unbranched; summit globular.\u2014This plant externally used is said to be emollient. Dr Home advises a decoction of it, two ounces to a quart, in diarrhoeas of an old standing. It eases the pains of the intestines; it is used as an injection in tenesmus with advantage; and is often applied externally to the piles. It is said to intoxicate fish so that they may be taken with the hand. In Norway they give it to cows that are consumptive. The down serves for tinder. Neither cows, goats, sheep, horses, or swine will eat it.\n\n377. Datura, or Thorn-apple.\nSeven species; viz. ferox, stramonium, tatula, sativula, metel, laevis, arborea. Europe, Asia, Africa, America.\n\n* D. seed-vessel thorny, upright, egg-shaped; leaves egg-shaped, smooth.\u2014At night the leaves, particularly the upper ones, rise up and enclose the flowers. An ointment prepared from the leaves gives ease in external inflammations and hemorrhoids. The Edinburgh college directs an extract to be prepared by evaporating the expressed juice of the leaves. This has been given with great advantage in convulsive affections and epilepsies: out of 14 epileptic patients 8 were entirely cured by it at Stockholm. The dose from 2 to 16 grains a day. The seeds or leaves given internally bring on delirium, tremors, swelling, itching, eruption, and inflammation on the skin; these effects were produced by a dose of a drachm and a half in a girl nine years old. Cows, goats, sheep, and horses, refuse it.\n\n378. Hyoscymus, or Henbane.\nEight species; viz. * niger, reticulatus, albus, aureus, muticus, pulillus, thyloides, scoparia. S. Europe, Siberia, Peria.\n\nH. leaves embracing the stem, indented flowers sit nigering.\u2014The seeds, the leaves, and the roots taken internally are reputed poisonous; and well attested instances of their bad effects are recorded: madness, convulsion, and death are the general consequence. But Dr Smith says, he has often eaten the seeds with impunity. It is said that the leaves scattered about a house will drive away mice. The Edinburgh college order the expressed juice of the plant to be evaporated to an extract: and perhaps in this state it may be advantageously joined with opium, where the effects of that medicine are desirable, and coition is to be avoided. There is no doubt of its being an useful medicine under proper management. The dose is from half a scruple to half a drachm. Goats are not fond of it; horses, cows, sheep, and swine refuse it; sheep are, however, said sometimes to eat it when young: Chrysomela lyctocyami and the cimex hylocyami are found upon it.\n\n379. Nicotiana, or Tobacco.\nSeven species; N. tabacum, fruticosa, * rusticla, paniculata, urens glutinosa, pulilla. America, China.\n\nThe species called N. tabacum was first brought into Europe about the year 1560 from the island of Tobago in America; and is now sometimes cultivated for medicinal uses in our gardens, but in general imported from America in large quantities. The leaves are about two feet long, of a pale green colour while fresh, and when carefully dried of a lively yellowish cast. They have a strong disagreeable smell, like that of the narcotic plants, and a very acrid burning taste. Taken internally, they prove violently cathartic and emetic, occasioning almost intolerable cardialgic anxieties. By boiling water their virulence is abated and at length destroyed: an extract made by long coction is recommended by Stahl and other German physicians, as a safe and most effectual aperient, expectorant, detergent, &c. but this medicine, which is extremely precarious and uncertain in strength, has never come into effect among us. Of late, however, tobacco, under the form of a vinous or watery infusion, and taken in such small doses as to produce little effect from its action on the stomach, has been recommended by Dr Fowler. He found it to be a very useful and powerful diuretic, and published many cases of dropsy and dysury in which its employment was attended with the best effects. These good effects have been confirmed by the observation of other physicians.\n\nTobacco is sometimes used externally in unguents for destroying cutaneous insects, cleansing old ulcers, &c.\nBeaten into a mash with vinegar or brandy, it has sometimes proved serviceable in removing hard tumours of the hypochondries. Injections by the anus of the smoke or decoction have been used with advantage in cases of obstinate constipation threatening ileus, of incarcerated hernia, of ascariasis, of spasmodic asthma, and of persons apparently dead from drowning or other sudden causes. It has been used internally in form of syrup, confection, and infusion, in cases of worms, epilepsy, amenorrhea, asthma, &c.; but it is certainly too active to be thus ventured on.\n\nThe *N. rufula* is found wild on dunghills in several parts of England. It is said to be often substituted in the market for true tobacco, from which, however, it may be known by the leaves being much smaller and the flowers not reddish like those of the proper sort, but of a yellowish green colour.\n\n380. JABOROSA.\n\nTwo species; viz. integrifolia, runcinata. Mon. Viedo, Buen. Ayr.\n\n381. ATROPA, or Deadly Nightshade.\n\nSeven species; viz. mandragora, *belladonna*, physaloides, procumbens, folanacea, arboreiflora, fruticosa. Europe, Peru, Lima.\n\n*belladonna* A. stem herbaceous; leaves egg-shaped, entire.\u2014The whole of this plant is poisonous; and children, allured by the beautiful appearance of the berries, have too often experienced their fatal effects. Tumours of the breasts, even of the cancerous kind, are said to have been resolved by a topical application of the fresh leaves. Dr Graham says he found great benefit from a poultice made of the roots, boiled in milk, and applied to hard ill-conditioned tumours and ulcers, and relates a deplorable case in which this poultice effected a perfect cure. There is no doubt but their external application may be productive of good effects in several cases, but the following instance shows us that their application is dangerous when the skin is broken: A lady who had a small ulcer, a little below one of her eyes, which was supposed to be of a cancerous nature, put a small bit of the green leaf upon it. In the morning the uvea of that eye was affected, that the pupil would not contract even by the brightest light; whilst the other eye retained its usual powers. The leaf being removed, the eye was gradually restored to its former state. This could not be an accidental effect, for it was repeated three separate times, and the same circumstances attended each application. The juice of the ripe berries stains paper of a beautiful and durable purple.\n\n382. PHYSALIS, or Alkekengi Winter Cherry.\n\n17 species; viz. somnifera, arilatta, flexuosa, arboreiflora, curaflavica, tomentosa, viticola, pennylvanica, alkekengi, peruviana, angulata, pubescens, barbadensis, chenopodiiflora, minima, pruinosa, prostrata. Europe, E. and W. Indies, Carolina.\n\n383. SOLANUM, or Nightshade.\n\n83 species; viz. laurifolium, verbascifolium, surculatum, pubescens, bombense, pseudo-capricum, microcarpum, terminale, pauciflorum, diphyllum, fugax, germinatum, retrofractum, stellatum, *dulcamara*, triquetrum, scandens, lyratum, tegere, quercifolium, laeiniatum, radicans, hannoniflora, triflora, racemoflora, corymbose, quadrangularis, repandum, bonariense, macrocarpon, tuberiflorum, pimpinelliflorum, lycopericum, pseudo-lycopercum, peruvianum, montanum, rubrum, nodiflorum, *nigrum*, ethiopicum, melongena, subinerme, longiflorum, muricatum, infanum, torvum, volubile, ferox, campechienese, fuscatum, mammosum, hirtum, paniculatum, aculeatissimum, virginianum, aquini, xanthocarpum, coagulans, jamaicense, indicum, carolinense, finum, *lodomerum*, maritimum, graminiflorum, vesperilio, sanctum, hybricum, tomentosum, polygamum, bahamense, obcurum, giganteum, flexuolum, lanceaeiflorum, lanceolatum, elegansiflorum, polyacanthos, igneum, milleri, trilobatum, lycoideae. Eur., Asia, Africa, Am.\n\n* S. stem without prickles, rather thurb-like, zigzag: *dulcamara* upper leaves halberd-shaped: flowers in tuft-like bunches.\n\n\u2014Boerhaave says it is a medicine far superior to china and farfarailla as a sweetener and restorative. Linnaeus says, an infusion of the young twigs is an admirable medicine in acute rheumatisms, inflammations, fevers, and suppression of the lochia. Dr Hill says he has found it very efficacious in the asthma. Dr Hallenberg advises it in ichthiatric and rheumatic pains, jaundice, fever and lues venerea. He directs a pint of boiling water to be poured upon two drachms of the stalks sliced and dried after standing half an hour. It must be boiled 15 minutes. The dose is two cups full or more, morning and evening. The stalks may be gathered early in spring, or at the end of autumn. The root has the smell of the potato. Sheep and goats eat it; horses, cows, and swine refuse it.\n\n* S. stem without prickles, herbaceous; leaves egg-nigrom, shaped, toothed, angular, bunches nodding, pointing two ways.\u2014From one to three grams of the leaves infused in boiling water and taken at bed-time occasions a copious perspiration, increases the secretion by the kidneys, and generally purges more or less the following day. These properties judiciously applied render it capable of doing essential service in several diseases. But its effects on the nervous system are so uncertain, and sometimes so considerable, that it must ever be administered with the greatest caution. The leaves externally applied abate inflammation and affluence pain. The flowers smell like musk. Horses, cows, goats, sheep, and swine refuse it.\n\n384. CAPSICUM, or Guinea Pepper.\n\nSix species; viz. annum, baccatum, finiflora, grossum, fruticosa, cerasiforme, E. and W. Indies. The capsicum annum is cultivated in our gardens. It ripens its seeds in September and October. The taste of capsicum is extremely pungent and acrimonious, setting the mouth as it were on fire. It is chiefly employed for culinary purposes, and has long been used in that way; but of late it has been employed also in the practice of medicine. And there can be little doubt that it furnishes us with one of the purest and strongest stimulants which can be introduced into the human stomach, while at the same time it has nothing of the narcotic effect of ardent spirit. Dr Mackitrick Adair, who was perhaps the first who employed it as a medicine, directs its being given to the extent of six or eight grains under the form of pills, or under the form of tincture, by infusing half an ounce in a pound of rectified spirit, and giving this from one to three drachms, diluted,\ndiluted, for a dose. He found it useful in a variety of affections, particularly in that morbid disposition which he calls the cachexia africana, and which he considers as a most frequent and fatal predisposition to disease among the slaves. This pepper has also been successfully employed in a species of cynanche maligna (putrid sore throat), which proved fatal in the West Indies, resisting the use of Peruvian bark, wine, and the other remedies commonly employed. A variety of it called in the West Indies bird-pepper, is the basis of a powder brought us from thence under the name of cayenne pepper.\n\n385. STRYCHNOS, or Poison-nut.\nThree species; viz. nux-vomica, calubrina, potatorum. East Indies.\n\n386. IGNATIA, or St Ignatius's Beans.\nOne species; viz. amara. India.\n\n387. CESTRUM.\n11 species; viz. laurifolium, nocturnum, parqui, auriculatum, scandens, velpertinum, diurnum, venenatum, tomentosum, hirtum, latifolium. West Indies, Peru.\n\n388. LYCUM, or Box-thorn.\n11 species; viz. afrum, rigidum, ruthenicum, tetrandrum, barbarum, cinereum, europaeum, horridum, barbatum, boerhaaviaefolium, capulare. Eur. Afr., Africa, America.\n\n389. SERISSA.\nOne species; viz. fuscida.\n\n390. CRYPTOSTOMUM.\nOne species; viz. laurifolium. Guiana.\n\n391. ARDISIA, or Aderno.\nNine species; viz. tinifolia, coriacea, ferrulata, acuminate, humilis, folianacea, lateriflora, excella, parasitica. Madeira, Ceylon, W. Indies.\n\n392. JACQUINIA.\nFive species; viz. arborea, armillaris, venosa, ruficfolia, linearis. W. Indies, S. America.\n\n393. BASSOVIA.\nOne species; viz. sylvatica. Guiana.\n\n394. CHIRONIA.\n16 species; viz. trinervia, jaeminoidees, lychnoides, nudicaulis, campanulata, augularis, pulchella, chilenia, centaurium, inaperta, maritima, spicata, limoides, baccifera, fruticiferae, tetragona. Ceyl. Cape, N. America.\n\n* C. herbaceous: leaves, spear-shaped; cal. shorter than the tube of the blossom.\u2014This plant is extremely bitter. It is the basis of the famous Portland powder, which prevents fits of the gout, when taken in a large quantity and a long time together; but brings on hardness of the liver, palsy, and apoplexy. A tincture of the leaves, and the upper part of the root, is a good medicine in weak stomachs and cachectic habits. A decoction of the whole plant destroys lice, and cures the itch. Cows are not fond of it, and in sheep-pasture it is frequently left untouched.\n\n395. LITA.\nTwo species; viz. toleca, cerulea.\n\n396. CORIDIA, or Sebeffan Plum.\n18 species; viz. myxa, obliqua, monoca, spinefascia, sebeffana, aspera, dichotoma, gerananthus, flavescens, toquere, macrophylla, micranthus, elliptica, colococca, hirsuta, tetandra, patagonula, tetraphylla. Guiana.\n\n397. EHRETIA, or Bafe Cherry-tree.\nNine species; viz. tinifolia, alpina, levis, internodis, spinosa, beurreria, virgata, exsucea, buxifolia. W. Indies, S. America.\n\n398. VARONIA.\nNine species; viz. lincata, bullata, mirabiloides, martinicensis, globosa, curaflavica, angustifolia, alba, monoferma. W. Indies, S. America.\n\n399. LAUGERIA.\nFive species; viz. odorata, lucida, coriacea, resinafa, tomentosa. W. Indies, S. America.\n\n400. CHRYSOPHYLLUM, or Star-apple.\nSeven species; viz. cainito, monopyrenum, microcarpum, argenteum, rugosum, pyriforme, glabrum. W. Indies, S. America.\n\n401. BUMELIA.\n12 species; viz. nigra, pallida, tenax, retusa, foetidiflora, falliciola, manghillo, montana, nervosa, pentagona, rotundifolia, cuneata. W. Indies.\n\n402. TECTONA, or Indian Oak, or Teak-wood.\nOne species; viz. grandis. The teak-wood is extremely valuable for ship-building on account of its resisting the Indian seas the worms which so speedily destroy oak and all other sorts of timber. That which is used at Calcutta is chiefly or rather entirely imported from Rangoon, a port belonging to the Birman empire in the eastern peninsula of India. See Asia, No. 106.\n\n403. SIDEROXYLON, or Iron-wood.\nNine species; viz. mite, inerme, melanopheum, cyamum, fericeum, argenteum, tomentosum, lycoidees, decandrum. Morocco, Cape, N. America.\n\n404. SCHREBERA.\nOne species; viz. albens. C. of G. Hope.\n\n405. RHAMNUS, or Buck-thorn.\n32 species; viz. * catharticus, infectorius, lycoidees, erythroxylon, eleoidees, crenulatus, faxatilis, theezans, sarcophalus, ferreus, levigatus, tetragonius, polifolius, valentinus, cubensis, colubrinus, daruricus, alpinus, pumilus, * frangula, latifolius, glandulosus, ellipticus, prionoides, mystacinus, almiofilus, spherofermus, hybridos, alaternus, carpinifolius, capensis, circumcifius. Europe, E. and W. Indies, Africa, N. America.\n\n* R. thorns terminating: flowers 4-cleft; male and catkarti-female on different plants: leaves egg-shaped; itemcus, upright.\u2014A purgative syrup prepared from the berries of this plant is kept in the shops. About an ounce of it is a moderate dose; but it generally occasions so much sickness and griping that it is falling into disuse. The flesh of birds that feed upon the berries is said to be purgative. The juice of the unripe berries is of the colour of saffron, and is used for staining maps or paper. These are sold under the name of French berries. The juice of the ripe berries mixed with alum, is the sap-green of the painters; but if they are gathered late in the autumn the juice is purple. The bark affords a beautiful yellow dye. Goats, sheep, and horses eat it; cows refuse it.\n\n* R. without thorns: flowers hermaphrodite, with 1 frangula, pistil: leaves very entire.\u2014It is said, that from a quarter\nquarter to half an ounce of the inner bark of this plant boiled in small beer, is a sharp purge. In droppings or constipations of the bowels of cattle, it is a very certain purgative. The berries gathered before they are ripe, dye wool green. The bark dyes yellow, and with preparation of iron black. Charcoal prepared from the wood is preferred by the makers of gunpowder. The flowers are particularly grateful to bees; goats devour the leaves voraciously, and sheep will eat them. The papilio rhamni and argus live upon both the species.\n\n406. ZIZYPHUS.\nTen species; viz. lineatus, volubilis, palurus, lotus, naepca, jujuba, xylopyrus, cenoplia, vulgaris, ipina christi.\n\n407. VENTILAGO.\nOne species; viz. maderapatanca.\n\n408.

C. of G. Hope.\n\n410. CARPODETUS.\nOne species; viz. ferratus. South sea isles.\n\n411. COLLETIA.\nOne species; viz. horrida. Brazil, Peru.\n\n412. CEANOTHUS, or New Jersey Tea.\nFive species; viz. americanus, macrocarpus, afatius, africanus, capularis. N. America, Cape, Ceylon.\n\n413. SCOPOLIA.\nTwo species; viz. aculeata, inermis. South sea isles.\n\n414. RUYSSCHIA.\nTwo species; viz. clusiaefolia, furubea. W. Indies, Guiana.\n\n415. ARDUINA, or Cape Buckthorn.\nOne species; viz. bilpinola. C. of G. Hope.\n\n416. CAMAX.\nOne species; viz. fraxinea. Guiana.\n\n417. BUTTNERIA.\nSeven species; viz. scabra, tereticaulis, microphylla, ovata, cordata, herbacea, catalpaefolia. S. America.\n\n418. AYENIA.\nFour species; viz. pufilla, laevigata, tomentofa, magna. Jamaica, Cumana, Peru.\n\n419. GLUTA.\nOne species; viz. benghas. Java.\n\n420. POLYCARDIA.\nOne species; viz. madagascarenis. Madagascar.\n\n421. MYRSINE, or African Box-tree.\nTwo species; viz. africana, retusa. Azores, Africa.\n\n422. BLADHIA.\nFour species; viz. japonica, glabra, villofa, crispa. Japan.\n\n423. CELASTRUS, or Staff-tree.\n32 species; viz. lucidus, microphyllus, bullatus, laurinus, rostratus, undulatus, octogonus, filiformis, can-\n\ndens, paniculatus, procumbens, acuminatus, cassinoides, striatus, cerus, undatus, edulis, crenatus, dilatatus, myrtifolius, maytenus, tetragonos, articulatus, alatus, linearis, integrifolius, emarginatus, phyllacanthus, buxi-\nfolius, pyracanthus, rotundifolius, parvilorus, Amer. Cape, ille of Bourbon, Japan.\n\n424. EVONYMUS.\nSeven species; viz. tobira, japonicus, * europaeus, verruculos, latifolius, atro-purpureus, americanus.\n* E. flowers mostly 4-cleft; leaves fitting.\u2014The ber-europaeus\nries vomit and purge violently. They are fatal to sheep. Powdered, and sprinkled upon the hair, they destroy lice. If the wood is cut when the plant is in bloom, it is tough, and not easily broken; and in that state is used by watch-makers for cleaning watches, and to make tweezers and toothpicks. Goats and sheep eat it; horses refuse it; cows are so fond of the shoot in the spring as constantly to break down the banks of the fields wherever a plant of it stands.\n\n425. PILOCARPUS.\nOne species; viz. racemolus.\n\n426. DIOSMA, or African Spirea.\n30 species; viz. oppositiflora, obtulata, linearis, virgata, alba, hirtuta, rubra, pectinata, ericoides, hifida, ciliata, bifurca, bifida, capitata, villofa, cupreflina, imbricata, marginata, lanceolata, pubescens, latifolia, crenata, tetragona, uniflora, rugosa, ovata, barbigera, pulchella, betulina, orbicularis.

America.\n\n444. **PLECTRANIA.**\nOne species; viz. ventosa. C. of G. Hope.\n\n445. **RIBES**, or Currant and Gooseberry.\n16 species; viz. rubrum, petreum, procumbens, glandulosum, alpinum, fragrans, triflorum, nigrum, floridum, diacantha, faxatile, reclinatum, grossulum, uva crista, oxyacanthoides, cynobatis. Europe, N. America.\n\n446. **VIOLA**, or Violet.\n39 species; viz. palmata, pedata, pinata, sagittata, lanceolata, obliqua, cucullata, primulifolia, *hirta*, magellanica, palustris, *odorata*, *carnina*, montana, numularifolia, cenitha, canadensis, trilata, pubescens, mirabilis, biflora, uniflora, decumbens, *tricolor*, grandiflora, zoysii, calcarata, cornuta, capensis, arboreiflora, stipularis, parviflora, enneaphylla, fruticosa, calcicola, oppositiflora, hybanthus, ipecacuanha, diandra. Alps, Pyren. Cape, America. *V. leaves heart-shaped; suckers creeping.\u2014The flowers and seeds of this plant are said to be mild laxatives. The powdered root, in doses from 40 to 80 grains, vomits and purges. The petals give the colour to the syrup of violets, for which purpose they are cultivated in large quantities at Stratford-upon-Avon. This syrup is very useful in many chemical inquiries, to detect an acid or an alkali, the former changing the blue colour to a red, and the latter to a green. Slips of white paper stained with the juice of the petals, and kept from the air and light, answer the same purpose. *V. stem branched; leaves egg-shaped, toothed; cal. smooth, but half the size of the blossom.\u2014Some allege that it infallibly cures the scabby complaints in young children, called cryba laetica. Boil a handful of the fresh, or half a dozen of the dried leaves, in half a pint of milk, and give this milk morning and evening for some weeks.\n\n447. **IMPERIENS**, or Balsam balsamine.\n12 species; viz. bifida, chinensis, latifolia, capensis, oppositiflora, fasciculata, cornuta, balsamina, biflora, triflora, natans, *nolitangere*. Europe, N. America, E. Indies, China. *I. fruitstalks many-flowered, solitary; leaves egg-shaped; stem swollen at the joints.\u2014The whole of this plant is considerably acrid. Goats eat it. Horses, cows, and sheep refuse it. The Sphinx elpenor lives upon it.\n\n448. **GRONOVA.**\nOne species; viz. scandens. Jamaica, Vera Cruz.\n\n449. **LEEA.**\nThree species; viz. lambucina, aquata, cripla. Cape, East Indies.\n\n450. **ARGOPHYLLUM.**\nOne species; viz. nitidum. New Caledonia.\n\n451. **CORYNOCARPUS.**\nOne species; viz. lavigata. New Zealand.\n\n452. **HEDEA**, or Ivy.\nFour species; viz. helix, pendula, mutans, terebinthacea. Europe, N. Amer. Jamaica. *H. leaves some egg-shaped, others lobed.\u2014The roots helix, are used by leather-cutters to whet their knives upon. Its evergreen leaves adorn our walls, and cover the naked trunks of trees. Apricots and peaches covered with ivy during the month of February, have been observed to bear fruit plentifully. The leaves have a nauseous taste. Some say they are given in Germany as a specific in the atrophy of children. The common people apply them to ulcers. The berries have a little acidity. They purge and vomit. In warm climates a resinous juice exudes from the stalks. Horses and sheep eat it. Goats and cows refuse it. Sheep are fond of it, and in severe weather it is stripped off the trees as food.\n\n453. **VITIS**, or Vine.\n12 species; viz. vinifera, palmata, indica, flexuosa, labrusca, vulpina, heterophylla, laciniata, hederacea, heptaphylla, pinnata, arborea. Temperate parts of the world. *V. with leaves gashed, indented, naked.\u2014The leaves vinifera, of this species, which is the proper vine tree, were formerly celebrated as astringents, but have for a long time been entirely disregarded; their taste is herbaceous with only a slight degree of roughness. The trunk of the tree wounded in the spring produces a limpid watery juice; this, called the tear of the vine, has been accounted excellent for sore eyes, and by some recommended also in ardent and malignant fevers, and as a diuretic. The flowers have a pleasant smell, which water elevates from them in distillation; along with the water a small portion of an elegant essential oil is said to arise, perfuming in great perfection the fragrance of the flowers. The unripe fruit is of a very harsh, rough, four-tailed; its expressed juice, called verjuice, was in great esteem among the ancients, and still continues to be in some places as a cooling astringent medicine; a rob and a syrup were formerly prepared from it. The ripe fruit or grapes, of which there are many kinds, properly cured and dried, are the raisins of the shops. The juice by fermentation affords wine, vinegar, and tartar, of which mention will be made under their proper heads.\n\n454. **EUPAREA.**\nOne species; viz. amena. New Holland.\n\n455. **\u00c6GICERAS.**\nTwo species; viz. majus, minus.\n\n456. **LAGOECIA**, or Wild Cumin.\nOne species; viz. cuminumoides.

America.\n* U. stems trailing; leaves spear-egg-shaped; flowers minor.\nOn fruitstalks.\u2014The fruit of this plant seldom comes to maturity. It may, however, be easily obtained by planting the U. major in a pot, where the roots not having free room to extend themselves, the juices are more copiously propelled towards the pistil, which then expands into well-formed seed-vessels.\n\n481.

C. of G. Hope.\n\n495. Linconia.\n\nOne species; viz. alopecuroidea. C. of G. Hope.\n\n496. Herniaria, or Rupture-wort.\n\nSix species; viz. * glabra, * hirtuta, alpina, fruticosa, lenticulata, polygonoides. Germany, Spain, Italy, Chili.\n\n* H. Plant smooth.\u2014This plant is a little saltish, and astringent. It is said to increase the secretions by the kidneys, and that the juice takes away specks in the eye; but, to the virtue for which it has been most celebrated, that of curing ruptures, it has no title. Cows, sheep, and horses eat it. Goats and swine refuse it.\n\n497. Chenopodium, or Goosefoot, or Wild Orache.\n\n26 species; viz. * bonus henricus, mucronatum, triandrum, * urbicium, atriplicis, * rubrum, guineense, * murale, quinoa, serotinum, * album, * viride, * hybridum, botrys, ambrofioides, multifidum, anthelminticum, * glaucum, * vulvaria, * polyperperm, caudatum, laterale, scoparia, * maritimum, oppotifolium, arista- tum. Europe, China, America.\n\n* C. Leaves triangular, arrow-shaped, very entire; spikes compound, leaflets, axillary.\u2014This plant is said to be cultivated as spinach by the poor people at Bolton in Lincolnshire. The young shoots, peeled and boiled, may be eaten as asparagus, which they resemble in flavour. They are gently laxative. The leaves are often boiled in broth. The roots are given to sheep that have a cough. Goats and sheep are not fond of it. Cows, horses, and swine, refuse it.\n\n* C. Leaves diamond triangular, gnawed, entire behind, album, the uppermost oblong; bunches upright.\u2014Cows, goats, and sheep eat it. Horses refuse it. Swine are extremely fond of it. A black aphid feeds upon it, and sometimes destroys it.\n\n* C. Leaves awl-shaped, semi-cylindrical.\u2014It is an excellent pot-herb. The phalena lubricipeda feeds upon most of the species.\n\nC. with leaves oblong indented; branches naked, botryss, many-leaved. Called Jerusalem oak.\u2014It is cultivated in gardens. It has a strong, not disagreeable smell, and a warm, somewhat pungent taste. It is recommended as a carminative pectoral, and it has also been recommended as an emmenagogue. Infusions of the leaves and seed may be drank as tea; and in this form it has been recommended in cases of chronic catarrh. But the proper menstruum, both for the leaves and seed, is rectified spirit.\n\n* C. with entire, diamond-shaped, oval leaves, with vulvarian flowers incorporated at the bottom of the leaves. Stinking orach. It is a low plant, sprinkled all over with a kind of whitish clammy meal; it grows about dungs-hills, and waste places. The leaves have a strong fetid smell, with which the hand, by a light touch, becomes so impregnated, as not to be easily freed from it. Its smell has gained it the character of an excellent antihysteric; and this is the only use it is applied to.\u2014Tournefort recommends a spirituous tincture, others a decoction in water, and others a conserve of the leaves, as of wonderful efficacy in uterine disorders; but in the present practice it is little employed.\n\n498. Beta, or Beet.\n\nFour species; viz. vulgaris, patula, cicla, maritima. France, Portugal, Madeira.\u2014The beta vulgaris has of late attracted much notice on the continent, from the discovery of M. Achard of Berlin, that sugar may be extracted from it in large quantities with profit. See Sugar.\n\n499. Microtea.\n\nOne species; viz. debilis.\n\n500. Salsola, or Glasswort.\n\n25 species; viz. * kali, tragus, rolacea, soda, sativa, ipicata, altissima, trigyna, falla, nudiflora, haveliensis, hirtuta, laniflora, hylophilolia, polyclonos, prostrata, monandra, verniculata, arbulcula, aphylla, arborecens, * fruticosa, indica, fedoides, muricata. Europe, Egypt, Cape, Asia, Carnatic.\n\n501. Anabasis, or Berry-bearing Glasswort.\n\nFive species; viz. aphylla, cretica, foliola, spinosissima, tamaricifolia. Spain, Caspian sea, Egypt.\n\n502. Caessa.\n\nTwo species; viz. cretica, indica. Crete, Arabia.\n\n503. Gomphrena, or Globe Amaranth.\n\nTen species; viz. globosa, perennis, hispida, angustiflora, vermicularis, brasiliensis, serrata, interrupta, flavo, arborecens. India, S. Amer., New Gran.\n\n504. Bosea, or Golden-rod Tree.\n\nOne species; viz. yervamora. Canary isles.\n\n509. Ulmus, or Elm-tree.\n\nSeven species; viz. * campestris, suberosa, effusa, americana.\namericana, nemoralis, pumila, integifolia, N. Europe, N. America.\n\ncampestris. * U. leaves doubly ferrated, unequal at the base; flowers almost fitting, coronated together.\u2014A decoction of the inner bark, drank freely, has been known to carry off the water in drops. It cures the lepra icthygis of Sauvages. The bark dried and ground to powder has been mixed with meal in Norway, to make bread in times of scarcity. The flowers have a violet smell. The wood, being hard and tough, is used to make axle-trees, mill-wheels, heels of boots, chairs, and coffins. The tree is beautiful, and well adapted to make shady walks, as it does not destroy the grass; and its leaves are acceptable to cows, horses, goats, sheep, and swine; for this purpose, it should be grafted upon the U. glabra, and then the roots will not send out suckers, which the common elm is very apt to do, and give a great deal of trouble to keep the ground clear of them. It loves an open situation, and black or clayey soil. It bears to be transplanted. Papilio polyctorus and C. album, phalena lubricipeda, pavonia betularia et vellica, finex ulmi et frutatus, cicada ulmi, aphis ulmi, feed upon it. The latter generally curl the leaves so as to make them a secure shelter against the weather. Silk worms will devour the tender leaves with great avidity.\n\n506. Nama.\nOne species; viz. jamaicensis. Jamaica.\n\n507. Hydrolea.\nThree species; viz. spinosa, trigyna, zeylanica. E. and W. Indies, America.\n\n508. Rochefortia.\nTwo species; viz. cuneata, ovata. Arabia.\n\n509. Heuchera, or Virginian Sainicle.\nOne species; viz. americana. Virginia.\n\n510. Velegia.\nOne species; viz. rigida. Spain.\n\n511. Swertia, or Marjoram-Gentian.\nSix species; viz. * perennis, disformis, decumbens, corniculata, dichotoma, tetrapetala. Siberia, Austria, Virginia, Canada.\n\n512. Gentiana, or Gentian.\n56 species; viz. * lutea, purpurea, pannonica, punctata, campanulata, septemfida, asclepiadea, montana, cruciata, macrophylla, adscendens, * pneumonanthe, triflora, frigida, algida, faxola, saponaria, ochroleuca, villofa, linearis, quinqueflora, aurea, glauca, exaltata, acaulis, altaica, pyrenaica, verna, utriculosa, bavarica, imbricata, prostrata, * nivalis, pumila, aquatica, scilloides, uniflora, germanica, * amarella, obtusifolia, uliginosa, pratensis, * campestris, auriculata, tenella, glacialis, dichotoma, nana, carinthiaca, fulcata, rotata, ciliata, crinita, barbata, detonfa, ferrata.\u2014The gentiana lutea, is said to be found wild in some parts of England; but the dried roots are most commonly brought from Germany. They are much used in medicine. They should be chosen fresh, and of a yellow or bright colour within. This root is a strong bitter, and as such, very frequently made use of in practice: in taste it is less exceptionable than most other bitters. Infusions of it, flavoured with orange-peel, are sufficiently grateful. It is the capital ingredient in the bitter wine, tincture, and infusion of the druggists. An extract from it is likewise prepared. This useful bitter is not used as a powder, as it loses considerably by the drying, which is requisite for giving it that form. As a very trifling quantity of it gives taste to a large quantity of water, it is said to be sometimes fraudulently used in malt liquors, to save the more expensive ingredient of hops.\n\n513. Dichondra.\nTwo species; viz. repens, sericea. Jamaica, South sea isles.\n\n514. Vahlia.\nOne species; viz. capensis. C. of G. Hope.\n\n515. Rumalda.\nOne species; viz. trifolia. Japan.\n\n516. Phyllis, or Bafe Hares-ear.\nOne species; viz. nobla. Canary isles.\n\n517. Cussonia.\nTwo species; viz. thyrsiflora, spicata. C. of G. Hope.\n\n518. Eryngium, or Sea-holly.\n11 species; viz. fetidum, aquaticum, planum, pulverulentum, tricuspidatum, * maritimum, * campestris, amethystinum, triquetrum, alpinum, bourgatii. Europe, N. America, W. Indies.\n* L. root leaves roundish, plaited, thorny; flowering maritimum heads on fruitstalks; chaff 3-pointed.\u2014The leaves are sweetish, with a light aromatic warmth and pungency. The roots are supposed to have the same aphrodisiac virtues as the orchis tribe. They are kept in the shops, candied.\n\n519. Hydrocotyle, or Water Navel-wort.\n18 species; viz. * vulgaris, umbellata, bonariensis, americana, hirtula, moschata, asiatica, erecta, villosa, glabrata, spananthe, ranunculoides, saniculasefolia, folandra, tridentata, chinensis, linifolia, virgata. Eur. N. America, India.\n\n520. Azorella.\nTwo species; viz. filamentosa, cepistosa.\n\n521. Sanicula, or Sanicle.\nThree species; viz. * europaea, canadensis, marilandica. Europe, N. America.\n\n522. Astrantia, or Black Master-wort.\nFive species; viz. epipactis, major, carniolica, minor, ciliaris. Alps of Europe.\n\n523. Bupleurum, or Hares-ear.\n23 species; viz. * rotundifolium,stellatum, petraeum, graminifolium, angulofolium, pyrenaicum, longifolium, falcatum, caricifolium, odontites, femicompositum, ranunculoides, rigidum, * tenuifolium, balansae, gerardi, junceum, nudum, fruticosum, coriaceum, frutescens, spinosum, difforme. Germany, Switzerland, S. Europe.\n\n425. Echinophora, or Prickly Parsnip.\nTwo species; viz. * spinosa, tenuifolia. Apulia, Med. sea shores.\n\n426. Hasselquistia.\nTwo species; viz. egyptica, cordata. Egypt, Levant.\n527. Torrylum, or Hart-wort of Crete.\n\nSix species; viz. syriacum, officinale, peregrinum, apulum, maximum, sifolium. Austria, Italy, Crete, Syria.\n\n528. Caucalis, or Bafe Parfley.\n\n13 species; viz. grandiflora, daucoides, latifolia, mauritanica, pumila, orientalis, africana, leptophylla, platycarpos, arvensis, anthr\u00edculos, japonica, nodosa. S. Europe, Egypt, India.\n\n529. Artedia.\n\nOne species; viz. aquamata, Levant.\n\n530. Daucus, or Carrot.\n\nSix species; viz. * carota, mauritanicus, lucidus, visnaga, gingidium, nuricatus. Europe, Barb. Carolina.\u2014For the culture and properties of the carrot, see Agriculture, No. 40, 341\u2014353.\n\n531. Ammi, or Bishop's-weed.\n\nFour species; viz. majus, coticum, glaucifolium, daucifolium. Austria, S. Europe, Egypt.\n\n532. Bunium, or Pig or Earth nut.\n\nThree species; viz. * bulbocastanum, majus, aromaticum. Germany, France.\n\n533. Conium, or Hemlock.\n\nFour species; viz. * maculatum, rugosum, rigens, africamum. Europe, Cape.\n\n* C. feeds without prickles; stem greatly branched, smooth, spotted.\u2014The whole plant is poisonous, and many instances are recorded of its deleterious effects; but modern experience has proved it to be less virulent than was formerly imagined, and though it may not cure cancers, it is certainly a very useful medicine when properly prepared. The powder of the dried leaves is now only prescribed. Let the leaves be gathered about the end of June when the plant is in flower. Pick off the leaves and throw away the leafstalks. Dry these selected little leaves in a hot sun on a tin dripping-pan or pewter dish, before a fire. Preserve them in bags made of strong brown paper; or powder them, and keep the powder in glass phials, in a drawer, or something that will exclude the light; for the light soon dissipates the beautiful green colour, and with its colour the medicine loses its efficacy. From 15 to 25 grains of this powder may be taken, twice or thrice a-day. It has been found particularly useful in chronic rheumatisms, and also in many of those diseases which are usually supposed to arise from acrimony. This plant is recommended as well worth the medical practitioner's attention.\n\n534. Selinum, or Milk Parfley.\n\nNine species; viz. fylvestre, * palustre, austriacum, fibricum, carvifolia, chabadi, seguieri, monnierii, decipiens. Europe.\n\n535. Athamanta, or Bafe Spignel.\n\n11 species; viz. * libanotis, cervaria, fibrica, condensa, incana, oreofolinum, ficula, mathioli, cretensis, amnia, chinensis. Europe.\u2014The seeds of the A. Cretensis or Candy Carrot, are brought from the Levant. It is an umbelliferous plant which grows in the island of Candy and the south of Europe. The seeds have a warm biting taste, and an aromatic smell. They are said to be diuretic, but are not at present regarded in medical practice.\n\nVol. IV. Part I.\n\n536. Peucedanum.\n\n11 species; viz. officinale, alpestre, capillaceum, tenuifolium, fibricum, japonicum, * filius, alaticum, aureum, nodosum, geniculatum. Alps, Canaries, Japan.\n\n* P. leaves five times divided into three; thread-strap-officinale-shaped.\u2014The roots have a strong fetid smell, and an acrid, bitterish, unctuous taste. Wounded in the spring, they yield a considerable quantity of yellow juice, which dries into a gummy resin, and retains the strong scent of the root. Its virtues have not yet been ascertained with precision.\n\n537. Crithmum, or Samphire.\n\nTwo species; viz. * maritimum, latifolium. See shores, Europe, Canary.\n\n* C. leaves spear-shaped, fleshy.\u2014Poor people on the maritimum sea coast eat it as a pot-herb, and gather it for sale, it being much used as a pickle. Sheep and cows eagerly feed, and are said to grow fat upon it.\n\n538. Cachrys.\n\nSeven species; viz. odontalgica, libanotis, morifoni, ficula, taurica, cretica, panacisfolia. Spain, Sicily.\n\n539. Ferula, or Fennel-giant.\n\n12 species; viz. communis, fibrica, glauca, rabeinis, tingitana, ferulago, orientalis, meoides, nodiflora, canadensis, affactida, persica. Europe, Persia, N. America.\n\nThe large umbelliferous plant, with obtuse leaflets, alternately indented, called ferula affactida, is a native of Persia, and produces a valuable concrete juice. This juice exudes from wounds made in the root of the plant, liquid and white like milk. On being exposed to the air it turns of a brownish colour, and gradually acquires different degrees of consistency. It is brought to us in large irregular masses, composed of various little shining lumps or grains, which are partly of a whitish colour, partly reddish, and partly of a violet hue. These masses are accounted the best, which are clear, of a pale reddish colour and variegated, with a great number of elegant white tears. This drug has a strong fetid smell, somewhat like that of garlic. It loses, with age, of its smell and strength, a circumstance to be attended to in the use of it. It consists of about one-third part of pure resin, and two-thirds of gummy matter; the former soluble in rectified spirit, the latter in water. Proof spirit dissolves almost the whole into a turbid liquor; the tincture in rectified spirit is transparent.\n\nAffactida is the strongest of the fetid gums, and of frequent use in hysterical and different kinds of nervous complaints. It is likewise of considerable efficacy in flatulent colics, and for promoting all the fluid secretions in either sex. The ancients attributed to this medicine many other virtues, which are not at present expected from it. This gummy resin is an ingredient in the gum pills of the druggists, fetid tincture, tincture of foot, and fetid volatile spirit.\n\n540. Laserpitium, or Laser-wort.\n\n23 species; viz. latifolium, libanotis, caprifilo, trilobum, aquilegifolium, gallicum, angustifolium, formosum, angustifolium, aureum, prutenicum, dauricum, filatolium, aciphylla, peucedanoides, flex, archange-\n\nT\nlica, chironium, lucidum, ferulaeum, hirsutum, scabrum, simplex. Europe, New Zealand.\n\n541. Heraclium, or Cow-parsnip.\n\n10 species; viz. * sphondylium, flavefascens, angustifolium, elegans, fibricum, panacea, tuberofum, austriacum, alpinum, pumilum, Siber, Austria, Alps, Italy. * H. leaflets wing-cleft, even; flowers radiated.\u2014In Poland and Lithuania the poor people are said to prepare a liquor from the leaves and seeds of this plant, which undergoes a fermentation, and is drank instead of ale. The stalks, when peeled, are eaten by the Kamtchatkans. The Russians take the leaf-stalks of the root-leaves, peel them, and hang them in the sun to dry a little; then they tie them in little bundles, and hang them up again till they become yellow: in this state they put them into bags, and a mealy substance like sugar forms upon the surface of them. This they shake off, and treat their guests with it as a great delicacy. They likewise distil an ardent spirit from it. The peelings of the stalks are acid. The leaves are a favourite food of rabbits, hogs, and asses. Cows, goats, and sheep eat them; but horses are not fond of them.\n\n542. Ligusticum, or Lovage.\n\n13 species; viz. levisticum, * scoticum, aquilegifolium, nodiflorum, peloponnesic, austriacum, * cornubiense, pyrenacum, candicans, peregrinum, balearicum, gingidium, longifolium. Alps, Austria, Portugal, Barbary. * L. leaves doubly threefold.\u2014This plant is much valued in the Isle of Skye. The root is reckoned a good carminative, and an infusion of the leaves a good purge for calves. It is, besides, used as food, either as a salad, or boiled as greens. Horses, sheep, and goats eat it. Cows refuse it.\n\n543. Angelica.\n\nSix species; viz. * archangelica, * sylvestris, razoulii, verticillaris, atropurpurea, lucida. N. Europe, N. America. * A. leaflets equal, egg-spear-shaped, serrated.\u2014It is warm, acrid, bitter, and aromatic: but the species cultivated in our gardens, possessing these properties in a higher degree, this has been long neglected. Papilio machaon feeds upon it. Cows, goats, and swine eat it. Horses refuse it.\n\n544. Sium, or Water Parsnip.\n\n18 species; viz. filifolium, * latifolium, angustifolium, * nodiflorum, * repens, f\u00edarum, rigidus, japonicum, falcaria, paniculatum, grandiflorum, patulum, gracum, decumbens, ficulum, aperum, hifpidum, villosum. Europe, China, Japan, N. America. * S. leaves winged; leaflets egg-spear-shaped, regularly and sharply serrated; the terminating leaflet 3-cleft; umbels terminating. Horses and swine eat it. Sheep are not fond of it. The roots are noxious to cattle.\n\n545. Sison, or Safe Stone-parsley.\n\nEight species; viz. * amomum, * legetum, canadensis, ammi, * inundatum, * verticillatum, salis, crinitum. Europe, N. America.\n\n546. Buron, or Macedonian Parsley.\n\nFive species; viz. macedonicum, galbanum, laevigatum, gummiferum, rigidus. Greece, Barb. Cape.\n\n547. Cuminum, or Cummin.\n\nOne species; viz. cyminum. Egypt, Ethiopia.\u2014This umbelliferous plant resembles fennel in appearance, but is much smaller. The seeds used in Britain are brought chiefly from Sicily and Malta. Cummin seeds have a bitterish warm taste, accompanied with an aromatic flavour, not of the most agreeable kind. An essential oil is obtained from them by distillation, in which their activity is concentrated; and they are not unfrequently used externally, giving name both to a plaster and cataplasm in medical practice.\n\n548. Oenanthe, or Water Dropwort.\n\n11 species; viz. * fitulosa, * crocata, prolifera, globulosa, peucedanifolia, * pimpinelloides, inebriens, tenufifera, ferulacea, interrupta, exaltata. Europe, Carolina. * O. sending forth suckers; stem-leaves winged, thread-shaped, hollow.\u2014Cows and horses refuse this plant, though, from experiments made on purpose, it does not appear to be in the least degree noxious to the former. * O. all the leaves many-cleft, blunt, nearly equal.\u2014crocata. The whole of this plant is poisonous; and Dr Pulteney remarks, that the root is the most virulent of all the vegetable poisons that Great Britain produces: many instances of its fatal effects are recorded. It is said, that an infusion of the leaves, or three tea spoonfuls of the juice of the root taken every morning, effected a cure in a very obstinate cutaneous disease, but not without occasioning very great disturbances in the constitution. Some say, that the country people in Westmorland, apply a poultice of the herb to the ulcer which forms in the fore-part of the cleft of the hoof in horned cattle, and is called the foul. Sheep eat it. Cows and horses refuse it.\n\n549. Phellandrium.\n\nTwo species; * aquaticum, motellina. Europe. * P. ramifications of the leaves straggling.\u2014The seeds aquaticum are recommended in intermittents, and are said to be diuretic, antifeptic, and expectorant: dose from one to three drams daily. The leaves are sometimes added to discutient cataplasm. It is generally esteemed a fatal poison to horses, occasioning them to become paralytic: but this effect is owing to an infect (curculio paraplecticus), which generally inhabits within the stems. The usual antidote is pig-dung. In the winter, the roots and stems affected by the influence of the weather, afford a very curious skeleton or net-work. Horses, sheep, and goats eat it. Swine are not fond of it. Cows refuse it. Chrysomela phellandria, and the gill leptura, are found upon the roots, and the curculio paraplecticus within the stems.\n550. Cicuta, or Water-Hemlock.\n\nThree species; viz. * virofa, bulbifera, maculata.\u2014Europe, N. America.\n\nC. umbels opposite the leaves; leaf-stalks bordered, blunt.\u2014This is one of the rankest of our vegetable poisons. Numerous instances are recorded of its fatality to the human species. Early in the spring, when it grows in the water, cows often eat it, and are killed by it; but, as the summer advances, and its scent becomes stronger, they carefully avoid it. Though a certain and fatal poison to cows, goats devour it greedily, and with impunity. Horses and sheep eat it with safety.\n\n551. \u00c6thusa or Fool's-parsley.\n\nFour species; viz. * cynapium, bunus, * meum, fataua.\u2014Europe.\n\n\u00c6. all the leaves alike; fruit nearly globular.\u2014This plant, from its resemblance to common parsley, has sometimes been mistaken for it, and when eaten, it occasions sickness. If the curled-leaved parsley only was cultivated in our gardens, no such mistakes would happen. Cows, horses, sheep, and swine eat it. It is noxious to geese.\n\n* \u00c6. all the leaves divided into many brittle-shaped segments; involucrum 1 leaf; fruit egg-oblong, tapering at each end.\u2014Linnaeus says, that the radical fibres of this plant form the basis of the calceolus \u00e6graegea. The roots and seeds are aromatic and acid. They have been used as stomachics and carminatives. They are sometimes given to cure tertians; and there is no doubt but they will often answer as well as pepper, and other acid aromatics.\n\n552. Coriandrum, or Coriander.\n\nTwo species; viz. * sativum, testiculatum. S. of Eur.\n\n* C. fruit globular.\u2014The leaves have a very strong and disagreeable scent. The seeds are grateful to the taste, and incrustated with sugar are sold by the confectioners, under the name of coriander comfits. The Edinburgh college use them as correctors in the bitter infusion, and the preparations of fenug; nothing so effectually covering the disagreeable taste of that medicine. They have been considered as culpacious, if not deleterious; but six drams of them have been taken at once, without any remarkable effect.\n\n553 Scandix, or Shepherd's-needle.\n\n11 species; viz. * odorata, * pecten, chilensis, * cerefolium, * anthrificus, australis, nodosa, trichosperma, infesta, grandiflora, procumbens. Eur. Virginia, Chili.\n\n* S. seeds furrowed: angular.\u2014The seeds are used in the north of England, for polishing and perfuming oak floors and furniture.\n\ncerefolium, * S. seeds globose, cylindrical and beaked; umbels lateral, nearly fitting.\u2014It is cultivated in our gardens as a pot-herb, and for salads. It is slightly aromatic and aperient. Cows are extremely fond of it. Sheep and goats eat it. Horses refuse it.\n\n554. Ch\u00e6rophylum, or Wild Chervil.\n\n11 species; viz. * sylvestre, bulbofum, aristatum, * temulum, capense, scabrum, hirtorum, aromaticum, coloratum, aureum, arbore-scens. Eur. Virginia, Japan.\n\n* C. stem smoothish, scoured, a little swollen at the knots. The roots eaten as parsnips, have been found poisonous. The umbels afford an indifferent yellow dye; the leaves and stems a beautiful green. Its presence indicates a fruitful soil. Neither horses, sheep, or goats, are fond of it. Swine refuse it. Rabbits are fond of it. In some parts of the kingdom, in times of scarcity, it is used as a pot-herb. Cows are so fond of it; that, when a pasture is over-run with it, as is often the case about Dudley, they always turn them in to eat it up.\n\n555. Imperatoria, or Master-wort.\n\nOne species; viz. ostruthium, Alps of Austria, Switzerland.\u2014Root warm and aromatic, a sudorific, diuretic, and phlegmogogue; recommended in dropsy, debilities of the stomach and bowels; and an infusion of it in wine is said to have cured quartans that have resisted the bark. When chewed, it excites a copious flow of saliva, exciting a warm and not disagreeable sensation in the gums, and frequently curing the rheumatic toothach.\n\n556. Seseli, or Hart-wort of Marseilles.\n\n15 species; viz. filifolium, pimpinelloides, montanum, striatum, glaucum, aristatum, annuum, charophyllodes, ammodes, tortuosum, turbith, hippomarathrum, pyreneum, faxigrum, elatum. Germany, S. Europe.\n\n557. Thapsia, or Deadly Carrot.\n\nFive species; viz. villosa, foetida, acleplum, garganica, trifoliata. France, Spain, Portugal, Lev. Virginia.\n\n558. Pastinaca, or Parsnip.\n\nThree species; viz. lucida, sativa, opoponax. South of Europe.\n\n* P. leaves simply winged.\u2014The roots, when cultivated, are sweeter than carrots, and are much used by those who abstain from animal food in Lent; they are highly nutritious. In the north of Ireland, they are brewed instead of malt, with hops, and fermented with yeast. The liquor thus obtained, is agreeable. The seeds contain an essential oil, and will often cure intermittent fevers. Hogs are fond of the roots, and quickly grow fat with them. See Agriculture Index.\n\n559. Smyrnium, or Alexanders.\n\nSeven species; viz. persicatum, egyptiacum, latifolium, * olusatrum, apiofolium, aureum, integerimum. Italy, Crete, Egypt, N. America.\n\nS. stem-leaves growing by threes on leaf-stalks, olusatrum, serrated.\u2014It was formerly cultivated in our gardens, but its place is now better supplied by celery. It is boiled, and greedily eaten by sailors returning from long voyages, who happen to land at the south-west corner of Anglesea.\n\n560. Anethum, or Dill.\n\nThree species; viz. graveolens, foetidum, * foeniculum. Germany, Spain, Portugal.\n\n* A. leaves with many divisions, hair-like; seeds egg-foeniculum oblong, tapering at each end, not bordered.\u2014The tender buds are useful in salads. The leaves, boiled, are used in sauce for several kinds of fish, and eaten raw with pickled fish. In Italy the stalks are blanched as a winter salad. The seeds abound with an essential oil, which is carminative and diuretic, but not heating. The papilio macbaun feeds upon it.\n\n561. Carum, or Caraways.\n\nTwo species; viz. * carui, simplex. Europe.\n\n* C. T. the young roots, are said to be better eating than carui, parsnips; the tender leaves may be boiled with pot-herbs. The seeds are used in cakes. Incrusted with sugar,\ngar, they are called caraway confits, and are distilled with spirituous liquors, for the sake of the flavour they afford. The seeds were formerly recommended by Dioscorides to pale-faced girls, and in more modern days their use is not forgotten.\u2014They are no despicable remedy in tertian agues. They abound with an essential oil, which is antipaludic, and carminative. Sheep, goats, and swine, eat it. Cows and horses are not fond of it.\n\n562. Pimpinella, or Burnet Saxifrage.\n\nTen species; viz. * saxifraga, nigra, * magna, diffecta, glauca, capensis, peregrina, anisum, dichotoma, * dioica. Europe, Egypt.\n\n* P. leaves uniform, winged; leaflets spear-shaped, irregularly serrated; floral leaves wing-cleft.\u2014This and the saxifraga partake nearly of the same qualities. The root is very acrid, burning the mouth like pepper. It affords a blue oil. Its acrimony hath occasioned it to be used to cure the toothache, and to cleanse the skin from freckles. It is chewed to promote the secretion of saliva, and is used in gargles for dissolving viscid mucus in the throat. In Germany it is preferred in the asthma and dropsy. The papilio machaon is found upon both species.\n\n563. Apium, or Parsley.\n\nTwo species; viz. petroelimum, * graveolens. Sardinia, Carolina.\n\ngraveolens * A. stem-leaves wedge-shaped.\u2014The root in its wild state (when it grows near water) is fetid, acrid, and noxious; but when cultivated in dry ground it loses these properties, and the root and lower part of the leaf-stalks and stem, blanched by covering them up with earth, are eaten raw, boiled in soups, or stewed. In this latter state it is called celery. They are said to be hurtful to people subject to nervous complaints. They are certainly good antiscorbutics. The seeds yield an essential oil. Sheep and goats eat it; cows are not fond of it; horses refuse it.\n\n564. \u00c6gopodium, or Gout-weed.\n\nOne species; viz.\n\npodagraria * A. upper leaves three together; lower ones in triple threes.\u2014The leaves may be eaten early in the spring with other pot-herbs. Cows, sheep, and goats eat it; horses are not fond of it. Europe.\n\nOrder III. TRIGYNYIA.\n\n565. Semecarpus.\n\nOne species; viz. anacardium. Ceylon.\n\n566. Rhus, or Sumach, or Poison-tree.\n\n33 species; viz. coriaria, tiphyllum, javanicum, glabrum, elegans, vernix, succedanium, fimbriatum, copallinum, alatum, pauciflorum, metopum, digitatum, cirrhiflorum, tridentatum, radicans, toxicodendron, aromaticum, huveolens, dentatum, finatum, cuneifolium, incisum, tomentosum, villosum, pubescens, viminalis, angustifolium, rosmarinifolium, laxigatum, lucidum, cotinus, afrum. S. Europe, Cape, China, N. Amer.\n\ncoriaria. R. with winged leaves, and leaflets elliptical, bluntly toothed, woolly beneath. Called common sumach.\u2014This tree or shrub is cultivated in the south of Europe on account of the culinary uses of its fruits, and for the purposes of the dyers, &c. Among us it is met with only in the gardens of the curious. The seeds and berries are of a red colour, in shape round and flat. Both these and the leaves are moderately astringent, and have sometimes been exhibited with this intention by medical practitioners; but they are not at present used.\n\nR. with winged entire leaves, with a membranaceous copallinum jointed leaf-stalk.\u2014This tree grows in New Spain, and produces a resin called copal, which is brought to us in irregular lumps, some transparent, of a yellow or brown colour; others semitransparent and whitish. It is used for making a very pure and hard varnish by painters. It has never come into use in medicine in this country, though it is introduced into some of the foreign pharmacopoeias, and may be considered as an article deserving attention.\n\n567. Viburnum, or Pliant Mealy-tree.\n\n23 species; viz. tinus, tinoides, villosum, scandens, nudum, primifolium, davuricum, dentatum, plicatum, erulum, * lantana, tomentosum, hirtum, acerifolium, orientale, * opulus, dilatatum, macrophyllum, culpida- tum, lentago, caffinoides, nitidum, laxigatum. S. of Europe, N. America.\n\n* V. leaves heart-shaped, serrated, veined, cottony lantana, underneath.\u2014The bark of the root is used to make bird-lime. The berries are drying and astringent.\n\n568. Cassine, or Coffee-berry-bush, South-Sea Tea.\n\n* Four species; viz. capensis, colpoun, barbara, mau-rocenia. C. of G. Hope.\n\n569. Sambucus, or Elder-tree.\n\nFive species; viz. * ebulus, canadensis, * nigra, japonica, racemosa. Europe, China, N. America.\n\n* S. tufts with three divisions; stipulae leaf-like; stem ebulus, herbaceous.\u2014This plant has the same medical properties with the S. nigra, but in some respects more violent, and therefore less manageable: A dram and a half of the root is a strong purge: The berries give out a violet colour: The green leaves drive away mice from granaries, and the Slavons strew them where their pigs lie, under a persuasion that they prevent some of the diseases to which they are liable. Neither cows, goats, sheep, horses, or swine will eat it.\n\n* S. tufts with five divisions; leaves winged; leaflets nigra, nearly egg-shaped, serrated; stem tree-like.\u2014The whole plant has a narcotic smell; it is not well to sleep under its shade. The wood is hard, tough, and yellow. It is commonly made into skewers for butchers; tops for angling-rods; and needles for weaving nets. It is not a bad wood to turn in the lathe. The inner green bark is purgative, and may be used with advantage where acid purgatives are requisite. In smaller doses it is diuretic, and has done eminent service in obstruent glandular obstructions, and in dropsies. If sheep that have the rot are placed in a situation where they can get at the bark and the young shoots, they will soon cure themselves. It is an ingredient in the black dye. The leaves are purgative like the bark, but more nauseous. They are an ingredient in several cooling ointments. If turnip-cabbages, fruit-trees or corn, which are subject to blight from a variety of insects are whipped with the green leaves and branches of elder, the insects will not attack them. A decoction of the flowers taken internally, is said to promote expectoration in pleuritis. If the flowers are fresh gathered\ngathered they loosen the belly. Externally they are used in fomentations to ease pain and abate inflammation. Many people use them to give a flavour to vinegar. They are fatal to turkeys. A rob prepared from the berries is a gentle opener, and promotes perspiration. The juice of the berries is employed to give a red colour to raisin or sugar wines. The berries are poisonous to poultry. The pith being exceedingly light, is cut into balls used in electrical experiments. Sheep eat it; horses, cows, and goats refuse it. The *aphis* *fambuci* and the *phalena ambucaria* are found upon it.\n\n570. **Spathelia**.\nOne species; viz. simplex. Jamaica.\n\n571. **Staphylea**, or **Bladder-nut**.\nThree species; viz. occidentalis, pinnata, trifolia. S. Europe, Virginia, Jamaica.\n\n572. **Tamarix**, or **Tamarisk**.\nFour species; viz. * gallica, songarica, germanica, articulata*.

East Indies, China.\n\n583. **Sarothra**, or **Bafe Gentian**.\nOne species; viz. gentianoides. Virginia, Pennsylvania.\n\n584. **Portulacaria**, or **Purflane-tree**.\nOne species; viz. africana. Africa.\n\n**Order IV. TETRAGYNYIA.**\n\n585. **Parnassia**, or **Grafs of Parnassus**.\nOne species; viz. * palustris*. Europe.\n\n586. **Evolvulus**.\nSeven species; viz. mammillaris, gangeticus, emarginatus, alfinoideae, hirsutus, linifolius, sericeus. East Indies, Jamaica.\n\n**Order V. PENTAGYNYIA.**\n\n587. **Aralia**, or **Berry-bearing Angelica**.\n10 species; viz. arborea, capitata, cordata, japonica, pentaphylla, feidophyllum, spinosa, chinensis, racemosa, nudicaulis. China, W. Indies, N. America.\n\n588. **Glossopetalum**.\nTwo species; viz. glabrum, tomentosum. Guiana.\n\n589. **Statice**, **Thrift**, or **Sea-pink**.\n37 species; viz. * armeria, juniperifolia, alliacea, cephalotes, graminifolia, * limonium, gmelini, scoparia, latifolia, oleosifolia, incana, auriculatofolia, cordata, scabra, tetragona, * reticulata, echiodes, speciola, tatarica, echinus, flexuosa, purpurata, longifolia, minuta, petiata, fufruticosa, monopetala, axillaris, cylindrifolia, linifolia, aurea, ferulacea, pruinata, filiata, lobata, spicata, micronata. Europe, Barbary, Canary, Amer.\n* S. stalk simple, with a head of flowers; leaves strap-shaped.\u2014It is much used in gardens as an edging for borders, and when in full bloom gives a glowing tinge to pastures on the sea coast. Horses and goats eat it; sheep are not fond of it.\n\n590. **Linum**, or **Flax**.\n29 species; viz. * uistatissimum, * perenne, viscosum, hirsutum, aquilinum, narbonense, reflexum, * teucrioides, felaginoides, prostratum, gallicum, maritimum, alpinum, austriacum, virginianum, flavum, monopetalum, strictum, monogynum, fufruticosum, arborescens, campanulatum, africanum, * ethiopicum, nodiflorum, * catharticum, * radiola, quadriflorum, verticillatum. Europe, Africa, America.\n\n* L. cal. and capsules dagger-pointed; petals col. whitish, lopped; leaves spear-shaped; stem generally solitary.\n\nThis valuable plant originally came from those parts of Egypt which are exposed to the inundations of the Nile. The seeds yield, by expression only, a large proportion of oil, which is an excellent pectoral, as is likewise the mucilaginous infusion. They make an easy and useful poultice in cases of external inflammation; and they are the food of several small birds. After the oil is expressed, the remaining farinaceous part, called oil-cake, is given to oxen, who soon grow fat upon it. The oil itself differs in several respects from other expressed oils; it does not congeal in winter, nor does it form a solid soap with fixed alkaline fats; and it acts more powerfully as a menstruum upon sulphureous bodies. When heat is applied during the expression it gets a yellowish colour, and a peculiar smell. In this state it is used by the painters and the varnishers. The fibres of the stem are manufactured into linen, and this linen, when worn on rags, is made into paper.\n\n* L. leaves opposite, egg-pear-shaped, stem forked. catharis Cor. pointed.\u2014An infusion of two drams or more of cum. the dried plant is an excellent purge, and has been given with advantage in many obstinate rheumatisms. It frequently acts as a diuretic. Horses, sheep, and goats eat it.\n\n591.\n591. ALDROVANDA.\nOne species; viz. velicula. Italy, India.\n\n592. DROsera; or Sun-dew.\n10 species; viz. acaulis, * rotundifolia, cuneifolia, burmanni, * longifolia, capensis, lusitanica, cistifolia, peltata, indica. Europe, Asia, Africa, America.\n* D. stalks from the root; leaves circular.\u2014The whole plant is acid and sufficiently caustic to erode the skin; but some ladies know how to mix the juice with milk, so as to make it an innocent and safe application to remove freckles and sunburn. The juice that exudes from it unmixed will destroy warts and corns. The plant has the same effect upon milk as the pinguicula vulgaris, and like that too is supposed to occasion the rot in sheep. The four coagulated milk of the Syrians, called leban or leven, is supposed to be at first prepared with some plant of this kind. The name sun-dew seems to be derived from a very striking circumstance in the appearance of these plants; the leaves are fringed with hairs, supporting small drops or globules of a pellucid liquor like dew, which continue even in the hottest part of the day and in the fullest exposure to the sun. Perhaps the acrimony of the plant resides in this secreted liquor.\n\n593. GISCHIA.\nOne species; viz. pharnacioides. East Indies.\n\n594. CRASSULA, or Laffer Orpine.\n71 species; viz. coccinea, cymosa, flava, pubescens, pruinosa, feabra, corallina, velfita, argentea, perforata, fruticulosa, ramosa, mollis, tetragonia, muricata, imbricata, obvallata, culturata, obliqua, spatulata, punctata, marginalis, cordata, lactea, arborecens, rupelris, pinnata, spinosa, retroflexa, lineolata, centuroides, dichotoma, glomerata, pulchella, strigosa, muscoa, pyramidalis, columnaris, hemisphaerica, aleoideae, capitella, cotyledonis, barbata, ciliata, thyrsiflora, spicata, subulata, alterniflora, rubens, celfitola, minima, molchata, verticillaris, expana, dentata, nudicaulis, tecta, cephalophora, montana, turrita, alpestris, marginata, tomentosiflora, crenulata, deltoidea, orbicularis, sparta, diffusa, prostrata, pellucida.
