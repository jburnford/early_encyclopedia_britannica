[{"h":"ARCHITECTO ROBERTO ADAM","t":"Q. F. F. Q. S.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> and west fronts of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILE\">pile</a> are to extend 255 feet, and the south and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> 358. There are to be houses for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> and six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> seven of the professors. The library is to be a room of 160 feet in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">museum</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> curiosities is to be of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>; and the dimensions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HALL\">hall</a> for degrees and public exercises are about 90 feet by 30. There are likewise to be an elegant and most convenient anatomical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a>; a chemical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LABORATORY\">laboratory</a>; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> rooms for instruments and experiments for the professors of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">natural <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>. The whole, when finished, if not the most splendid structure of the sort in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> however be the completest and most commodious. The progress of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> has now (1804) stopped. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> was completed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> munificence; but after an expenditure of 50,000l. it is supposed that not more than one third of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> has been executed.\n\nThe botanical garden belonging to the university is situated at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LEITH\">Leith</a>. It consists of about five acres of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>; and is furnished with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> variety of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, many of them brought from the most distant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of the globe. The professor's botanist to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a>, and receives a salary of 120l. annually for the support of the garden. A monument, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of the celebrated botanist Linnaeus, was erected here by the late Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">Hope</a>, who first planned the garden, and Edinburgh brought it to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>.\n\nThe university of Edinburgh, like the others in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, sends one member to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">General</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">Assembly</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> of Scotland; and the widows of the professors have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to the funds of those of ministers, the professors being trustees on that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> along with the presbytery of Edinburgh.\n\n\"In the year 1772, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOARD\">Board</a> of Trustees for the encouragement of Manufactures, &c., in Scotland, appointed Mr Alexander Runciman, painter, to teach 23 boys or girls <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a>, allowing him a yearly salary of 120l. He was succeeded in this office by Mr Allan, to whom followed Mr Graham. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> being appropriated for the use of manufactures, is not properly a school of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> art, however, very eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEACHERS\">teachers</a> are to be found in Edinburgh, but no public establishment exists for its encouragement.\n\n\"Near the University there is also a Riding School, called the Royal Academy for teaching Exercises. The teacher of this academy receives a salary of 200l. a-year from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, and is accommodated with a riding school of 120 feet in length by 40 in breadth, and stables to a considerable extent.\n\n\"In Edinburgh there is established, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of that in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, a Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>, which has published some volumes of transactions. It contains a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of members of great respectability; but in Edinburgh men of letters are apt to be extremely jealous and unsociable with regard to each other. This illiberality of temper prevents the Royal Society from being of much value. Great numbers of the most accomplished and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> men of letters are unconnected with it, while it contains others who have been introduced to it merely by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> in the world, or the circumstance of having attained to distinguished <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> situations by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> of men in power, who of late years have, in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> little of that anxiety to discriminate and bring into notice men of literary talents, which once formed the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> characteristic of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol15.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a> and gentlemen of Scotland.\"\n\n13. The Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIRMARY\">Infirmary</a> was first thought of by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> of Physicians in 1725. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> happening to be dissolved at that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, the partners contributed some of their stock towards the establishment of the Infirmary. A subscription was also let on foot, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> made to the General Assembly to recommend the same throughout their jurisdiction. This was readily complied with, and the assembly passed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> for that purpose; but very little regard was paid to it by the clergy. Notwithstanding this, however, 200l. being procured, a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> was opened for the reception of the sick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> in August 1729. In 1736, the contributors towards the Infirmary were erected into a body corporate by royal statute; and after this the contributions increased very considerably: by which means the managers were enabled to enlarge their scheme from time to time; and at last to undertake the present magnificent structure, the foundation of which was laid in 1738. During 25 years, when this institution was in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Hopetoun bestowed upon it an annuity of 200l. In 1750, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> Archibald Ker bequeathed to this incorporation 200l. a-year in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Jamaica. In 1755, the lords,\nEdinburgh: lords of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a> made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DONATION\">donation</a> to it of \u00a38000, which had been appointed for the support of invalids.\n\nIn return for this, the managers of the Infirmary constantly keep 60 beds in readiness for the reception of sick soldiers. This year also sick servants began to be admitted into the Infirmary, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARD\">ward</a> was fitted up for their reception.\n\nThis institution, however, was more indebted to George Drummond, Esq., than to any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>. He was seven times chosen lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROVOST\">provost</a> of Edinburgh; and always directed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the improvement of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a>, particularly to that of the Royal Infirmary. So sensible were the managers of their obligations to him, that, in their hall, they erected a bust of him with this inscription, \"George Drummond, to whom this country is indebted for all the benefit which it derives from the Royal Infirmary.\"\n\nIn 1748, the stock of the Infirmary amounted to \u00a33000; in 1755, to \u00a37000; besides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a> left by Doctor Ker; in 1764, to \u00a323,426; and in 1778, to \u00a327,074.\n\nThe Royal Infirmary is attended by two physicians chosen by the managers, who visit their patients daily in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of the students. All the members of the College of Surgeons were obliged to attend in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a>, according to seniority. If any surgeon declined attendance, he was not allowed to appoint a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a>; and the patients were committed to the care of one of four assistant surgeons, chosen annually by the managers: this was formerly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of attendance, but the managers have in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of a decision of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of judicature assumed to themselves the sole right of electing the surgeons.\u2014From the year 1762 to 1769, there were admitted 6261 patients; which number added to 109 who were in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">hospital</a> at the commencement of the year 1762, made, in all, 6370. Of these, 4395 were cured; 358 died; the rest were either relieved, dismissed incurable, for irregularities, or by their own desire, or remained in the hospital.\u2014From 1770 to 1775, the patients annually admitted into the Infirmary were, at an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a>, 1567; of whom 63 died. In 1776, there were admitted 1668, of whom 57 died; and in 1777, the number admitted was 1593, and of deaths, 52. In the year 1786, there were admitted 1822 patients: Of these 1354 were cured; 166 relieved; 84 died; the rest were either relieved, dismissed incurable, for irregularities, or by their own desire.\n\nThe building consists of a body and two wings, each of them three stories high, with an attic story and garrets, and a very elegant front. The body is 210 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, and 36 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> in the middle, but at the ends only 24 feet broad. There is a bust of King George II. in a Roman dress, above the great door. The wings are 70 feet long, and 25 broad. In the centre is a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAIRCASE\">staircase</a>, so wide that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEDAN\">sedan</a> chairs may be carried up. In the different wards, 228 patients may be accommodated, each in a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BED\">bed</a>. There are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> and hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a> for the patients, and also for the citizens; and to these last the patients are never admitted.\n\nBesides the apartments necessary for the sick, there are others for the officers and servants belonging to the house. There are likewise rooms for the managers, a consulting room for the physicians and surgeons\u2014a waiting room for the students, and a theatre that will hold upwards of 200 people for performing surgical operations. There is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> ward, supported by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of the \u00a38000 already mentioned; and in consequence of which a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> is always kept at the Infirmary. The wards for sick servants are supported by collections at the church doors. Besides the surgical attendance already mentioned, there are two physicians belonging to the house, who are elected by the managers, and have a salary: there is likewise a house-surgeon and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOTHECARY\">apothecary</a>. Students who attend the Infirmary paid formerly 3l. 3s. which is increased to 5l. 5s. annually, which brings in a considerable revenue towards defraying the expense of the house. Two wards are set apart for the patients whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> are supposed to be most interesting; and the medical professors in the university give clinical lectures upon them by rotation.\n\n14. The Public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISPENSARY\">Dispensary</a> was founded by Dr Duncan in 1776, for the poor whose diseases are of such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> as to render their admission into the Infirmary either unnecessary or improper. Here the patients receive advice gratis four days in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">register</a> is kept of the diseases of each, and of the effects produced by the medicines employed. All patients not improper for dispensary treatment are admitted on the recommendation of the elder or church <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARDEN\">warden</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> where they reside. The physicians officiate and give lectures gratis; so that the apothecary who lodges in the house, and the medicines, are the only expenses attending this useful institution. The expense of the whole is defrayed by public contributions, and from a small annual fee paid by the students who attend the lectures. It is under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a>, two vice-presidents, and 20 directors, elected annually from among the contributors. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUINEA\">guinea</a> entitles a contributor to recommend patients and be a governor for two years, and five guineas gives the same privilege for life. Under the same management there is an institution for the gratuitous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INOCULATION\">inoculation</a> for the cowpox.\n\n15. The High School. The earliest institution of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a> school in Edinburgh seems to have been about the year 1519. The whole expense bestowed upon the first building of this kind amounted only to about 40l. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>. Another building, which had been erected for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> of the scholars in 1578, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, notwithstanding the great increase of their number, to be used for that purpose till 1777. The foundation of the present new building was laid on the 24th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> that year by Sir William Forbes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAND\">Grand</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">Master</a> of the Free Masons. The total length of this building is 120 feet from south to north; the breadth in the middle 36, at each end 38 feet. The great hall where the boys meet for prayers, is 68 feet by 30l. At each end of the hall is a room of 32 feet by 20, intended for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LIBRARIES\">libraries</a>. The building is two stories high, the one 18, the other 17, feet in height. The expense of the whole was reckoned at 4000l.\n\nThere is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTOR\">rector</a> and four masters, who teach from 400 to 500 scholars annually. The salaries are trifling, and the fees depend upon the reputation they have obtained for teaching; and as this has been for some years very considerable, the rector's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> is supposed to be worth not less than 400l. per annum, a master's about half that sum. There is a janitor, whose place is supposed to be worth about 70l. a-year. His business is\nto take care of the boys on the play ground; and there is a woman who lives on the spot as under-janitor, whose place may be worth about \u00a321 annually. There is a library, but not large, as each of the boys pays only one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SHILLING\">shilling</a> annually to its support.\n\nThere are four established English schools in Edinburgh; the masters of which receive a small salary, upon express condition that they shall not take above a limited sum per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> from any of their scholars. There are likewise many other private schools in Edinburgh for all languages; and, in general, every kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> is to be had here in great perfection and at a very cheap rate.\n\n16. The Mint is kept up by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNION\">Union</a>, with all the offices belonging to it, though no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> is ever struck here. It stands in the Cowgate, a little to the west of the English church; but is in a ruined state, though still inhabited by the different officers, who have free houses; and the bellman enjoys his salary by regularly ringing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BELL\">bell</a>. This place, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a> of Holyroodhouse, is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a> for debtors.\n\n17. The English Chapel stands near the Cowgate Port, and was founded on the 3d of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 1771. The foundation <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> was laid by General Oughton, with the following inscription: Edificii sacri Ecclesiae episc. Anglicae, primum posuit lapidem J. Adolphus Oughton, in archetectonice Scotiae repub. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CURIO\">curio</a> maximus, militum praefectus, regnante Georgio III. tertio Ap. die, A.D. MDCCCLXXI. It is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> handsome building, neatly fitted up in the inside, and somewhat resembling the church of St Martin's in the Fields, London. It is 90 feet long, 75 broad, and ornamented with an elegant spire of considerable height. It is also furnished with an excellent bell, formerly belonging to the chapel royal at Holyroodhouse, which is permitted to be rung for assembling the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGREGATION\">congregation</a>; an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol12.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> not granted to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESBYTERIANS\">Presbyterians</a> in England. The expense of the building was defrayed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUNTARY\">voluntary</a> subscription; and to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the country, people of all persuasions contributed to this pious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>. It has already cost \u00a37000, and will require \u00a31000 more to finish the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-PORTICO\">portico</a>. This church is built in a singular manner, viz. from south to north, and the altar-piece stands on the east side. Three clergymen officiate here, of whom the first has \u00a3150, the other two \u00a3100 each: the altar-piece is finely decorated, and there is a good organ.\n\nThere is another Episcopal chapel, but small, in Blackfriars wynd, which was founded by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> Smith in the year 1722. There are also some meetings of the Episcopal church of Scotland, who adhere to their old forms, having still their bishops and inferior clergy. For some time these were subjected to penal laws, as they refused to take the oath to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, or mention the present royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> in their public prayers:\n\nbut having conformed, and taken the oath of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a>, Edinburgh, their conduct has been approved of by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">majesty</a>; so that now every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DENOMINATION\">denomination</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> pray for the royal family on the throne.\n\n18. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERIOT\">Heriot</a>'s Hospital owes its foundation to George Heriot, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOLDSMITH\">goldsmith</a> to James VI, who acquired by his business a large fortune. At his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, he left the magistrates of Edinburgh \u00a323,625.10s. \"for the maintenance, relief, and bringing up of so many poor and fatherless boys, freemen's sons of the town of Edinburgh,\" as the above sum should be sufficient for. This hospital is finely situated on the west end of the fourth ridge, almost opposite to the castle, and is the most magnificent building of the kind in Edinburgh. It was founded in July 1628, according to a plan (as is reported) of Inigo Jones; but the work being interrupted by the civil wars, it was not finished till the year 1650. The expense of the building is said to have been upwards of \u00a330,000. (a) and the hospital is now possessed of an income of about \u00a33000 a-year; though this cannot be absolutely ascertained, as the rents are paid in grain, and of course must be fluctuating.\n\nIt stands on a rising ground to the south-west of the city, and is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of 162 feet without, having a court 94 feet square in the inside, with piazzas on three of the sides. There is a spire with a clock over the gateway, and each corner of the building is ornamented with turrets; but notwithstanding the magnificent appearance of the outside, the inner <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> is far from being convenient. There is a statue of the founder over the gateway, in the dress of the times, and a very good painting of him in the governors' room, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> of the late <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol20.html#article-TREASURER\">treasurer</a> Mr Carmichael. There is a chapel 61 feet long and 22 broad, which is now repairing in such a manner as will make it worthy of notice. When Cromwell took possession of Edinburgh after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUNBAR\">Dunbar</a>, he quartered his sick and wounded soldiers in this hospital. It was applied to the same purpose till the year 1658, when General Monk, at the request of the governors, removed the soldiers; and on the 11th of April 1659, it was opened for the reception of boys, 30 of whom were admitted into it. The August after, they were increased to 40; and in 1661, to 52. In 1753 the number was raised to 130, and in 1763 to 140; but since that time it has decreased.\u2014In this hospital the boys are instructed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a>, and a knowledge of the Latin tongue. With such as choose to follow any kind of trade, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPRENTICESHIP\">apprenticeship</a> fee of \u00a310 is given when they leave the hospital; and those who choose an academical education, have an annuity of \u00a310 a-year bestowed on them for four years. The whole is under the oversight of the treasurer, who has under him a house governor, housekeeper, and schoolmasters.\n\n(a) It is to be observed, that money then bore 10l. per cent. interest.\u2014The above sums are taken from Mr Arnott's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of Edinburgh, who subjoins the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>. \"Where Maitland had collected his most erroneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of George Heriot's effects we do not know. He makes the sum received, out of Heriot's effects, by the governors of the hospital, to be \u00a343,608l. 11s. 3d. being almost double of what they really get. This blunder has been the cause of many unjust murmurings against the magistrates of Edinburgh, and even the means of spiriting up lawsuits against them.\"\n19. Watson's Hospital has its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> from the founder George Watson, who was at first clerk to Sir William Dick provost of Edinburgh in 1676, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNTANT\">accountant</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> of Scotland; after that he became receiver of the city's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-IMPOST\">impost</a> on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALE\">ale</a>, treasurer to the Merchants' <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAIDEN\">Maiden</a> Hospital, and to the society for propagating Christian knowledge. Dying a bachelor in 1723, he left \u00a32,000l. for the maintenance and education of the children and grandchildren of decayed members of the merchant company of Edinburgh. The scheme, however, was not put in execution till the year 1738, when the sum originally left had accumulated to \u00a320,000l. The present building was then erected, in which about 60 boys are maintained and educated. It is much less magnificent than Heriot's hospital, but the building is far from being despised. It stands to the southward of the city at a small distance from Heriot's hospital, and was erected at the expense of \u00a35000l.: its present revenue is about \u00a31700l. It is under the management of the master, assistants, and treasurer of the Merchant Company, four old bailies, the old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAN\">dean</a> of guild, and the two ministers of the Old church. The boys are genteely clothed and liberally educated. Such as choose an university education are allowed \u00a310l. per annum for five years: those who go to trades have \u00a320l. allowed them for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPRENTICE\">apprentice</a> fee, and at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of 25 years, if they have behaved properly, and not contracted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> without consent of the governors, they receive a bounty of \u00a350l. The boys are under the immediate inspection of the treasurer, schoolmaster, and housekeeper.\n\n20. The Merchants' Maiden Hospital was established by voluntary contribution about the end of the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, for the maintenance of young girls, daughters of the merchants burgesses of Edinburgh. The governors were erected into a body corporate, by act of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>, in 1707. The annual revenue amounts to \u00a31350l. Seventy girls are maintained in it; who, upon leaving the house, receive \u00a31l. 6s. 8d. excepting a few who are allowed \u00a38l. 6s. 8d. out of the funds of the hospital. The profits arising from work done in the house are also divided among the girls, according to their industry.\n\n21. The Trades' Maiden Hospital was founded in the year 1704 by the incorporations of Edinburgh, for the maintenance of the daughters of decayed members, on a plan similar to that of the merchants hospital. To this, as well as to the former, one Mrs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a> Erskine, a widow, gentlewoman, contributed so liberally, that she was by the governors styled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> founders of the hospital. Fifty girls are maintained in the house, who pay of entry money \u00a31l. 13s. 4d.; and, when they leave it, receive a bounty of \u00a31l. 11s. 4d. The revenues are estimated at \u00a3600l. a-year.\n\n22. The Orphan Hospital was planned in 1732, by Andrew Gairdner merchant, and other inhabitants. It was promoted by the society for propagating Christian knowledge, by other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a>, by voluntary subscriptions, and a collection at the church doors.\u2014In 1733, the managers hired a house, took in 30 orphans, maintained them, gave them instructions in reading and writing, and taught them the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEAVING\">weaving</a> business. In 1735, they were erected into a body corporate by the town of Edinburgh: and, in 1742, they obtained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a> of erection from his late majesty, appointing most of the great officers of state in Scotland, Edinburgh, and the heads of the different societies in Edinburgh, members of this corporation; with powers to them to hold real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> to the amount of \u00a31000l. a-year. The revenue is inconsiderable; but the institution is supported by the contributions of charitable persons. Into this hospital orphans are received from any part of the kingdom. None are admitted under seven, nor continued in it after 14 years of age.\n\nThe orphan hospital is situated to the east of the North <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>; and is a handsome building, consisting of a body and two wings, with a neat spire, furnished with a clock and two bells. The late worthy Mr Howard admits, that this institution is one of the most useful charities in Europe, and is a pattern for all institutions of the kind. The funds have been considerably increased, and the building greatly improved, through the attention and exertions of Mr Thomas Tod formerly treasurer.\n\n23. The Trinity Hospital. This was originally founded and amply endowed by King James II.'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>. At the Reformation, it was stripped of its revenues; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGENT\">regent</a> afterwards bestowed them on the provost of Edinburgh, who gave them to the citizens for the use of the poor. In 1585, the town <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> purchased from Robert Pont, at that time provost of Trinity college, his interest in these subjects; and the transaction was afterwards ratified by James VI. The hospital was then repaired, and appointed for the reception of poor old burgesses, their wives and unmarried children, not under 50 years of age. In the year 1700, this hospital maintained 54 persons; but, since that time, the number has decreased.\u2014The revenue consists in a real estate of lands and houses, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> rents of which are \u00a362l. a year, and \u00a3550l. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> out at bonds at 4 per cent.\n\nThis hospital is situated at the foot of Leith wynd, and maintains about 50 of both sexes, who are comfortably lodged, each having a room for themselves. They are supplied with roast or boiled meat every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DINNER\">dinner</a>, have money allowed them for clothes, and likewise a small sum for pocket money. There is a small library for their amusement, and they have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CHAPLAIN\">chaplain</a> to say prayers. There are some out-pensioners who have \u00a31l. a-year, but these are discouraged by the governors. The funds are under the management of the town council.\n\n24. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CHARITY\">Charity</a> Workhouse was erected in 1743 by voluntary contribution. It is a large plain building, on the south side of the city. Here the poor are employed, and are allowed twopence out of every shilling they earn. The expense of this institution is supposed not to be less than \u00a34000l. annually; as about 700 persons of both sexes, including children, are maintained here, each of whom cannot be reckoned to cost less than \u00a31l. 10s. per annum; and there are besides 300 out-pensioners. The only permanent fund for defraying this expense is a tax of two per cent. on the valued rents of the city, which may bring in about \u00a3600l. annually; and there are other funds which yield about \u00a3400l. The rest is derived from collections at the church doors and voluntary contributions; but as these always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> short of what is requisite, recourse must frequently be had to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> collections. The sum arising from the rents of the city, however, is constantly...\nTo the fourth-west of the castle, near a suburb called the Wright's House, on the site of a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> building, which was demolished to make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> for it, Gillespie's Hospital has lately been erected. Its appellation is derived from the founder, an eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANUFACTURER\">manufacturer</a> of snuff in Edinburgh. It is intended for the support of aged persons; and those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the name of the founder are preferred. It is a neat stone building, executed in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a> of moderate expense, with a small tower in the centre and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARAPET\">parapet</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHIC\">Gothic</a> turrets at suitable distances around the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a>.\n\nBesides these there are to be found in Edinburgh several charitable establishments, which, though not furnished with costly buildings, are not of a less benevolent or valuable nature. Of these, one of the most distinguished is the Hospital or Workhouse, or Asylum, as it is called, for the Industrious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLIND\">Blind</a>; which is supported by the contributions of charitable persons, and by the price of the articles manufactured in it. Here the blind are taught such trades as may enable them to earn a subsistence, or at least aid them in contributing to their own support. They manufacture baskets, mats, &c.; and some of them have been taught to act as weavers, for which purpose they use the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHUTTLE\">shuttle</a>.\n\nThe Magdalene Asylum also deserves notice; in which a most laudable attempt has of late years been made, by a benevolent society, to reclaim, from vice and misery, women who have degraded themselves by public prostitution, but who think fit to retire thither with the view of abandoning their mode of life, and of supporting themselves by industry. This institution is managed with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of care and delicacy which does the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> to its patrons. The objects of this charity are kept concealed: they reap the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of their own labour; and every effort is made to procure employment for them. In particular, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a>-work of all sorts is executed in it in the neatest manner; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> is washed, at moderate prices, for such persons in the city as think fit to transmit these articles to the society.\n\nBesides all these charities, there is an hospital in the city for Lying-in Women, under the care of the professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MIDWIFERY\">midwifery</a>: which is an institution analogous to that of the Royal Infirmary.\u2014There is a Society for the Relief of the Destitute Sick, which has received considerable public countenance, though it has no appropriate building or local establishment.\u2014An institution of a peculiar nature, not unconnected with the present subject, called the Repository, ought not to pass unnoticed. It is a shop or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WARE\">ware</a>-room on South Bridge Street, to which ladies in straitened circumstances have an opportunity of sending for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> curious, beautiful, or useful articles of needle-work, with the price affixed. When a purchaser has been found for the goods, the proceeds are transmitted in such a manner as to prevent its being known to the public by whom the articles were prepared. This institution has been promoted by the Duchess of Buccleugh and many other persons of rank.\n\nThere are two other charity workhouses in the suburbs, much on the same plan with that now described: one in the Canongate, and the other in St Cuthbert's Edinburgh, or West <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KIRK\">Kirk</a> parish.\n\nTo this account of the charitable establishments in Edinburgh, we shall add that of some others; which, though not calculated to decorate the city by any public building, are perhaps no less deserving of praise than any we have mentioned. The first is that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> William <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORN\">Horn</a>; who left \u00a3300l. in trust to the magistrates, the annual profits to be divided on Christmas day to poor out-door labourers, who must at that season of the year be destitute of employment; five pounds to be given to those who have large families, and one half to those who have smaller.\n\nAnother charity is that of Robert Johnston, LL.D., of London, who in 1640 left \u00a3300l. to the poor of this city; \u00a3100l. to be employed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> them to work, another \u00a3100l. to clothe the boys in Heriot's Hospital, and the third \u00a3100l. to bursars at the university.\n\nAbout the beginning of this century John Strachan left his estate of Craigcrook, now upwards of \u00a3300l. a-year, in trust to the presbytery of Edinburgh, to be by them disposed of in small annual sums to poor old people not under 65 years of age, and to orphans not above 12.\n\nThere is besides a society for the support of the industrious poor, another for the indigent sick, and there are also many charity schools.\n\nHaving thus given an account of the most remarkable edifices belonging to Old Edinburgh, we shall now proceed to those of the New Town. This is terminated on the east side by the Calton hill, round which there is a pleasant walk, and which affords one of the finest prospects that can be imagined, varying remarkably almost at every step. On this hill is a burying ground, which contains a fine monument to the memory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> Hume the historian.\u2014On the top is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATORY\">observatory</a>, the scheme for building which was first adopted in the year 1736; but the disturbance occasioned by the Porteous mob prevented anything from being done towards the execution of it at that time. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Morton afterwards gave \u00a3100l. for the purpose of building an observatory, and appointed Mr MacLaurin professor of mathematics, together with the principal and some professors of the university, trustees for managing the sum. Mr MacLaurin added to the money above mentioned the profits arising from a course of lectures which he read on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXPERIMENTAL_PHILOSOPHY\">experimental philosophy</a>; which, with some other small sums, amounted in all to \u00a3300l.; but Mr MacLaurin dying, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> was dropped.\u2014Afterwards the money was put into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of two persons who became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BANKRUPT\">bankrupt</a>; but a considerable dividend being obtained out of their effects, the principal and interest, about the year 1776, amounted to \u00a3400l. A plan of the building was made out by Mr Craig <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a>; and the foundation stone was laid by Mr Stoddart, lord provost of Edinburgh, on the 23rd of August 1776. About this time, however, Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a> architect happening to come to Edinburgh, conceived the idea of giving the whole the appearance of a fortification, for which its situation on the top of the Calton hill was very much adapted. Accordingly a line was marked out for enclosing the limits of the observatory with a wall constructed...\nfor pit and boxes; and 1s. 6d. for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GALLERY\">gallery</a>) 40l. or Edinburgh-\n45l. a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>. About this time an act of parliament\nwas passed, prohibiting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of plays, except\nin a house licensed by the king. Of this the presby-\ntery of Edinburgh immediately laid hold; and at their\nown expense brought an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> on the statute against\nthe players. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> was by the court of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SESSION\">session</a>\ndecided against the players; who thereupon applied to\nparliament for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BILL\">bill</a> to enable his majesty to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LICENSE\">license</a> a\ntheatre in Edinburgh. Against this bill petitions were\npresented in 1739 to the house of commons by the\nmagistrates and town council, the principal and pro-\nfessors of the university, and the dean of guild and his\ncouncil; in consequence of which, the affair was drop-\nped. All this opposition, however, contributed in\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> to the success of the players; for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> being excited, a way of evading the act was ea-\nily found out, and the house was frequented more\nthan usual, inasmuch that Taylor's Hall was found in-\nsufficient to contain the number of spectators.\n\nThe comedians now fell out among themselves, and\na new playhouse was erected in the Canongate in the\nyear 1746. The consequence of this was, that the old\none in Taylor's Hall became entirely deserted, and\nthrough bad conduct the managers of the new theatre\nsoon found themselves greatly involved. At last, a riot\nensuing through dissensions among the performers, the\nplayhouse was totally demolished.\u2014When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a>\nof the royalty over the spot where the New Town is\nbuilt was obtained, a clause was likewise added to the\nbill, enabling his majesty to license a theatre in Edin-\nburgh. This was obtained, and thus the opposition\nof the clergy for ever silenced. But notwithstanding\nthis, the high price paid by the managers to the pa-\ntentee, being no less than 500 guineas annually, pre-\nvented them effectually from decorating the house as\nthey would otherwise have done, or even from always\nretaining good actors in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>; by which means\nthe success of the Edinburgh theatre has not been so\ngreat as might have been expected.\n\nNot far from this building, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMPHITHEATRE\">amphitheatre</a> was\nopened in 1792, on the road to Leith, for equestrian\nexhibitions, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PANTOMIME\">pantomime</a> entertainments, dancing, and\ntumbling. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CIRCUS\">circus</a> was 60 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>; and in the\nforenoon ladies and gentlemen were taught to ride.\nThe house held about 1500 people. This building\nhas since converted into an elegant and commodious\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> room.\n\n27. The Register Office. This work was first fug-\ngetted by the late Earl of Morton, lord-register of Scot-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, with a view to prevent the danger which attended\nthe usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of keeping the public records. In\nformer times, indeed, these suffered from a variety of\naccidents. Edward I. carried off or destroyed most of\nthem, in order to prevent any marks of the former in-\ndependence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> from remaining to posterity.\nAfterwards Cromwell spoiled this nation of its records,\nmost of which were sent to the Tower of London. At\nthe time of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">restoration</a>, many of them were sent\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> again by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>; but one of the vessels was ship-\nwrecked, and the records brought by the other have\never since been left in the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>.\u2014The\nEarl of Morton taking this into consideration, obtain-\ned from his majesty a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> of 12,000l. out of the for-\nfeited estates, for the purpose of building a register\noffice,\nEdinburgh office, or house for keeping the records, and disposing them in proper order. The foundation was laid on the 27th of June 1774, by Lord Frederic Campbell lord-register, Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONTGOMERY\">Montgomery</a> of Stainhowe lord advocate, and Mr Miller of Bariskinning lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a> clerk; three of the trustees appointed by his majesty for executing the work. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> was performed under a discharge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>, in presence of the judges of the courts of session and exchequer, and in the sight of a multitude of spectators. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> plate was put into the foundation stone with the following inscription: Conservandis Tabulis Publicis positum est, anno M.DCC.LXXIV, munificentia optimi et pietissimi principis Georgii Tertii. In a glass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VASE\">vase</a> hermetically sealed, which is also placed in the foundation stone, are deposited specimens of the different coins of his present majesty.\n\nThe front of the building directly faces the bridge, extends from east to west 100 feet, and is 40 feet back from the line of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCE\">Prince</a>'s street. In the middle of the front is a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a> of three windows in breadth. Here is a pediment, having in its centre the arms of Great Britain, and the whole is supported by four Corinthian pilasters. At each end is a tower projecting beyond the rest of the building, having a Venetian window in front, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUPOLA\">cupola</a> on the top. The front is ornamented from end to end with a beautiful Corinthian entablature. In the centre of the building is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOME\">dome</a> of wooden work covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>. The inside forms a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SALOON\">saloon</a> 50 feet diameter and 80 high, lighted at top by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> window 15 feet in diameter. Round the whole is a hanging gallery of stone, with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol4.html#article-BALUSTRADE\">balustrade</a>, which affords conveniency for preludes in the walls for keeping the records. The whole number of apartments is 97; all of which are vaulted beneath, and warmed with fire-places. This building, which is the most beautiful of Mr Adam's designs, has been executed in a substantial manner, in about 16 years, at the expense of near 40,000l. and is one of the principal ornaments of the city. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERGEANT\">sergeant</a>'s guard is placed here from the castle, for the further protection of the records. It is intended to place a statue of his present majesty in the front of the building, with the lion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNICORN\">unicorn</a> above the sentinels' boxes. The lord-registrar has the direction of the whole, and the principal clerks of session are his deputies. There have a great number of clerks under them for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> on the business of the court of session. The lord-registrar is a minister of state in this country. He formerly collected the votes of the parliament of Scotland, and still collects those of the peers at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of 16 to represent them in parliament.\n\n27. On the east side of St. Andrew's square stands the General <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCISE\">Excise</a> Office, built by the late Sir Lawrence Dundas for his own residence, but sold by his son for the above purpose. It is a very handsome building, with a pediment in front ornamented with the king's arms, and supported by four Corinthian pilasters; and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONJUNCTION\">conjunction</a> with the two corner houses, has a fine effect.\n\n28. St. Andrew's Church stands on the north side of George's street. It is of an oval form; and has a very neat spire of 186 feet in height, with a chime of eight bells, the first and only one of the kind in Scotland. It has also a handsome portico in front.\n\n29. Opposite to St. Andrew's church is the Physic Hall, designed for the meetings of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a>, and which has a portico resembling that of the church.\n\n30. Farther to the westward, on the south side, stand the Assembly Rooms, which though a heavy looking building on the outside, are nevertheless extremely elegant and commodious within. The largest is 100 feet long and 40 broad, being exceeded in its dimensions by none in the island, the large one at Bath excepted. Weekly assemblies are held here for dancing and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARD\">card</a>-playing, under the direction of a master of ceremonies; admission tickets five shillings each.\n\n\"There are three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANKING\">Banking</a> Companies in Edinburgh established by statute, or by royal charters. These are, the Bank of Scotland, commonly called the Old Bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland, and the British Linen Company.\n\n31. \"The Bank of Scotland, commonly called the Old Bank, was erected by act of parliament, A.D. 1695. By the statute of erection, the company was empowered to raise a joint stock of 1,200,000l. Scots, or 100,000l. Sterling, for the purpose of carrying on a public bank. The smallest share which any person could hold in the bank was declared to be 100l. Scots; and the largest sum for which any one was allowed to subscribe was 20,000l. of the same money. Eight thousand are declared to be the qualification necessary to entitle any one to be elected governor; 600l. deputy governor; and 300l. for each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTOR\">director</a>. The management of the affairs of the company was vested in a governor, deputy governor, and twenty-four directors; and in choosing these managers, each proprietor was declared to have a vote for every 100l. of stock held by him.\n\n\"The office of this company has hitherto been held in a house down a narrow lane at the south side of that part of the High street called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LAWN\">Lawn</a>-market; but, at a great expense, they have erected for their accommodation a building which will speedily be ready to be occupied, and which is situated to the northward of the High street, in full view of Prince's street. This is at once a magnificent and beautiful fabric. The back of the building is towards Prince's street; and here, while erecting, it had the disadvantage, from its vast height, of having somewhat the aspect of a tower. This effect, however, is now removed by raising the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> for the purpose of covering up the lower part of it, and by a wall of considerable height in the nature of a curtain, which has been added to augment its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> breadth. It forms, upon the whole, a beautiful and most superb fabric. As a work of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>, it is seen to most advantage from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOUND\">mound</a> of earth which connects the Old and the New Town, at that part of the mound which is in the direction of the north-west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of the building. Here the eye is filled by the full view of two sides of the fabric, and by a display of its great height. The result of which is, that as a magnificent and stupendous structure, it seems to have no rival in this country.\n\n\"This banking company has established branches in every considerable town in Scotland, excepting Glasgow, which, in consequence of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMICABLE\">amicable</a> adjustment to avoid rivalryship, is left to the Royal Bank. By agreement, the latter has a branch at Glasgow, and no branch in any other town in Scotland.\"\n33. \"The Royal Bank was established in the following manner: By the articles of union, Scotland was declared to be liable to the same duties which were levied by way of customs or excise in England. As these duties had, in the latter of these nations, been appropriated for the discharge of debts contracted by England before the union, it was found reasonable to give Scotland an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> for this additional burden. The sum, given by way of equivalent, was ordained to be paid for certain purposes, and to certain persons or bodies corporate, mentioned in the articles of union and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> statutes. The proprietors of these sums, to the extent of \u00a3248,550 sterling, were erected into a body corporate, under the name of the Equivalent Company; and the said sum of \u00a3248,550, was declared to be the joint stock of the company. Upon application by this company, they obtained a royal charter, empowering such of them as inclined to subscribe their shares in the joint stock for that purpose, to carry on the business of banking. By this charter the subscribers to this banking business were, in A.D. 1727, erected into a body corporate, to be called, \"The Royal Bank of Scotland.\" They were vested with the requisite powers, and the management of the company's affairs declared to be in a governor, deputy governor, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> ordinary and nine extraordinary directors. The qualifications of these managers were declared to be, that of the governor to hold stock to the extent of \u00a32000; of the deputy governor, of \u00a31500; of the ordinary directors, of \u00a31000; and of the extraordinary directors, of \u00a3500. The sum originally subscribed was \u00a3111,000; but by a charter passed in favour of the Royal Bank, A.D. 1738, explaining the privileges formerly bestowed upon them, and enabling them to increase their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>, they were empowered to raise their stock to a sum not exceeding in whole, when joined to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> funds, \u00a3150,000. By the charter of erection of this company, a share of \u00a3300 entitles a proprietor to one vote, one of \u00a3500, to two, of \u00a31000, to three, and of \u00a32000, to four; and no proprietor can have more than four votes.\n\n34. \"The British Linen Company, with a capital of \u00a3100,000, was incorporated by royal charter in 1746, with a view to encourage the manufacture of linen in Scotland. By the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of this company, its affairs are declared to be under the management of a governor, deputy governor, and five directors. It is declared a necessary qualification in the governor to be possessed of a share in the company's stock to the amount of \u00a31000; of the deputy governor, \u00a3500; and of each director, of \u00a3300. A share of \u00a3200 entitles a proprietor to vote in the choice of these managers, of \u00a3500, to two votes, and of \u00a31000, to four votes; but it is declared that no proprietor shall possess more than four votes.\n\n\"This company carries on the business of banking, and issues promissory notes like the two former companies; but the banking business is carried on separately from the linen trade. The Linen Hall remains in the Canongate; but the apartments of the bank are removed to a lane on the south side of the High street, above what was called the Nether-bow port.\n\n\"Promissory notes, payable on demand, have also been long issued in Edinburgh by a private banking house, that of Sir William Forbes, Sir James Hunter, and Company; and their notes have possessed a most extensive circulation.\n\n\"Besides these there are several private banking houses of great reputation in Edinburgh, which do not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> promissory notes for small sums payable on demand, but which carry on the other branches of the banking trade, by transmitting money, discounting bills, and accommodating individuals with cash accounts.\"\n\nIt now remains only to speak something of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> and civil establishments of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>. The highest of the former is the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, who meet here annually in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of May, in an aisle of the church of St Giles fitted up on purpose for them. The throne is filled by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSIONER\">commissioner</a> from his majesty, but he neither debates nor votes. He calls them together, and dissolves them at the appointed time in the name of the king; but they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> and dissolve themselves in the name of the Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ. This assembly consists of 350 members chosen out of the various presbyteries throughout the kingdom; and the debates are often very interesting and eloquent. This is the supreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ECCLESIASTICAL\">ecclesiastical</a> court in Scotland, to which appeals <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> from the inferior ones.\n\nThe ecclesiastical court next in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> to the assembly is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYNOD\">Synod</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOTHIAN\">Lothian</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TWEEDDALE\">Tweeddale</a>, who meet in the same place in April and November; and next to them is the Presbytery of Edinburgh. These meet on the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEDNESDAY\">Wednesday</a> of every month, and are trustees on the fund for ministers widows. They have a hall in Scott's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>, where there is a good picture of Dr Webster by Martin, which was put up at the expense of the trustees, out of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> for the trouble he took in planning and fully establishing the fund.\n\nThe Society for propagating Christian Knowledge in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, was established a body corporate by Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a> in the year 1709, for the purpose of erecting schools to instruct poor children in the principles of Christianity, as well as in reading and writing. The society have a hall in Warriston's close where their business is transacted. From time to time they have received large contributions, which have always been very properly applied; and for much the same purpose his majesty gives \u00a31000 annually to the general assembly of the church of Scotland, which is employed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> of their number for instructing the poor Highlanders in the principles of the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>.\n\nThe Erse church at Edinburgh was built about 30 years ago by subscriptions for the same laudable purpose. Great numbers of people <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESORT\">resort</a> to the metropolis from the Highlands, who understand no other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> but their own, and consequently have no opportunity of instruction without it; and a most remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the benefit they have received from it is, that though the church is capable of holding 1000 people, yet it is not large enough for those who apply for seats. The minister has \u00a3100 per annum arising from the seat rents, and holds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a> with the church of Scotland. The establishment was promoted by William Dickson dyer in Edinburgh.\n\nWith regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> constitution of Edinburgh, the town council have the direction of all public affairs.\nThe ordinary council consists only of 25 persons; but the council ordinary and extraordinary, of 33. The whole is composed of merchants and tradesmen, whose respective powers and interests are so interwoven, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> is preserved between the two bodies. The members of the town council are partly elected by the members of the 14 incorporations, and they partly choose their own successors. The election is made in the following manner: First, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIST\">list</a> or list of six persons is made out by each incorporation; from which number, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEACON\">deacon</a> belonging to the incorporation must be chosen. These lists are then laid before the ordinary council of 25, who \"shorten the lists,\" by expunging one half of the names from each; and from the three remaining ones the deacon is to be chosen. When this election is over, the new deacons are presented to the ordinary council, who choose six of them to be members of their body, and the six deacons of last year then walk off. The council of 25 next proceed to the election of three merchant and two trades councillors. The members of council, who now amount to 33 in number, then make out lists, from which the lord provost, dean of guild, treasurer, and bailies, must be chosen. The candidates for each of these offices are three in number; and the election is made by the 30 members of council already mentioned, joined to the eight extraordinary council deacons.\n\nThe lord provost of Edinburgh, who is styled right honourable, is high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a>, coroner, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a>, within the city and liberties, and the town, harbour, and road of Leith. He has also a jurisdiction in matters of life and death. He is preses of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVENTION\">convention</a> of royal boroughs, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLONEL\">colonel</a> of the trained bands, commander of the city guard and of Edinburgh jail. In the city he has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRECEDENCE\">precedence</a> of all the great officers of state and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a>; walking on the right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> of the king or of his majesty's commissioner; and has the privilege of having a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> and mace carried before him. Under him are four magistrates called bailies, whose office is much the same with that of aldermen in London. There is also a dean of guild, who has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of the public buildings, and without whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANT\">warrant</a> no house nor building can be erected within the city. He has a council to consult with, a nominal treasurer, who formerly had the keeping of the town's money, which is now given to the chamberlain. These seven are elected annually; who with the seven of the former year, three merchants and two trades councillors, and 14 deacons or preses of incorporated trades, making in all 33, form the council of the city, and have the sole management and disposal of the city revenues; by which means they have the disposal of places to the amount of 20,000l. annually. Formerly the provost was also an officer in the Scots parliament. The magistrates are sheriffs-depute and justices of the peace; and the town council are also patrons for all the churches in Edinburgh, patrons of the university, and electors of the city's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPRESENTATIVE\">representative</a> in parliament. They have besides a very ample jurisdiction both civil and criminal. They are superiors of the Canongate, Portsburgh, and Leith; and appoint over these certain of their own number, who are called baron bailies: but the person who presides over Leith has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of admiral because he hath there a jurisdiction over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> affairs.\n\nThe baron bailies appoint one or two of the inhabitants of their respective districts to be their substitutes, and these are called resident bailies. They hold courts in absence of the baron bailies, for petty offences and diffusing civil causes of little moment.\n\nNo city in the world affords greater security to the inhabitants in their persons and properties than Edinburgh. Robberies are here very rare, and street <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> hardly known in the memory of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>; so that a person may walk the streets at any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> of the night in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> security. This is in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> owing to the town guard. This institution originated from the consternation into which the citizens were thrown after the guard battle at Flowden. At that time, the town council commanded the inhabitants to assemble in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the city, and every fourth man to be on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> each night. This introduced a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> duty for the defence of the town, called watching and warding; by which the trading part of the inhabitants were obliged in person to watch alternately, in order to prevent or suppress occasional disturbances. This, however, becoming in time extremely inconvenient, the town council, in 1648, appointed a body of 60 men to be raised; the captain of which was to have a monthly pay of 11l. 2s. 3d., two lieutenants of 2l. each, two sergeants of 1l. 5s. and the private men of 15s. each. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> fund was established for defraying this expense: the consequence of which was, that the old method of watching and warding was resumed, but the people on whom this service devolved were now become so relaxed in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>, that the magistrates were threatened with having the king's troops quartered in the city if they did not appoint a sufficient guard. On this 40 men were raised in 1679, and in 1682 the number was increased to 158. After the Revolution, the town council complained of the guard as a grievance, and requested parliament that it might be removed. Their request was immediately granted, and the old method of watching and warding was renewed. This, however, was now so intolerable, that the very next year they applied to parliament for leave to raise 126 men for the defence of the city, and to tax the citizens for their payment. This being granted, the corps was raised which still continues under the name of the town guard. At present the establishment consists of three officers and about 90 men, who mount guard by turns. The officers have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a>'s pay; the sergeants, corporals, drummers, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> soldiers, the same with those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>. Their arms are the same with those of the king's forces; but when called upon to quell mobs, they use Lochaber axes, a part of the ancient Scottish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMOUR\">armour</a> now in use only among themselves.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a> or trained band of the city consist of 16 companies of 100 men each. They were in use to trained turn out every king's birthday; but only the officers' bands now remain, who are chosen annually. They consist of 16 captains and as many lieutenants and ensigns; the provost, as has already been mentioned, being the colonel.\n\nThe town guard are paid chiefly by a tax on the trading people; these being the only persons formerly subject to watching and warding. This tax, how-\nEdinburgh, ever, amounts only to \u00a31250l., and as the expense of the guard amounts to \u00a31400l., the magistrates are obliged to defray the additional charge by other means.\n\nBut in the year 1805, in consequence of a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a> being established, the city guard was reduced to one lieutenant, two sergeants, two corporals, two drummers, and thirty men, the lord provost for the time being to be captain, without pay, and the company to be armed and clothed at the expense of the city, but their pay to be defrayed out of the general fund raised under the new police act; and the duty of this company is to attend upon his majesty's commissioner to the general assembly of the church of Scotland, the magistrates and town council, the supreme courts of justice, and to act in general for the support of the new system of police.\n\nThe system of police above alluded to, was established in 1805 by act of parliament, under the authority of which the city and suburbs are divided into six districts or wards for the more convenient execution of the purposes to which the act extends. The regulations included under this system of police relate to cleaning and lighting the streets and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> in the city and suburbs, apprehending and punishing vagrants and disorderly persons, suppressing common begging, preventing nuisances and obstructions, and for other purposes connected with the preservation of peace and good order. The management of the whole affairs under this system of police is entrusted to the general and resident commissioners. The general commissioners appointed by the act, are, the lord provost and magistrates of the city of Edinburgh, with the lord president of the court of session, the lord justice clerk, the lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> baron of the court of exchequer, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> officers of the crown, and several other public characters, in conjunction with the whole resident commissioners in the different wards. There are to be seven resident commissioners in each ward, the two highest in the list to go out, and two others to be elected in their stead annually; the commissioners to be occupiers of houses valued at twenty pounds sterling of free rent yearly, excepting in two wards, where occupying a house of twelve pounds rent is a sufficient qualification. In each ward there are to be elected by the resident commissioners, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROBATION\">approbation</a> of the general commissioners, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSPECTOR\">inspector</a>, and such a number of officers of police and watchmen as may be necessary, the officers of police and watchmen upon duty having the authority and possessing the powers given by the law of Scotland to the office of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTABLE\">constable</a>.\n\nThe general commissioners have the power of choosing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPERINTENDENT\">superintendent</a> or master of police for the whole city and suburbs included in the act, and to appoint a clerk who shall do the duty of clerk to the general meetings, as well as to the court of police to be held by the superintendent. The general commissioners also are authorized to fix the number of officers and watchmen to be employed in the different wards. The superintendent of police having been appointed by the commissioners, is to receive from the sheriff depute of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of Edinburgh the authority of a sheriff substitute, as well as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> of sheriff depute within the city and liberties from the lord provost who is principal sheriff within these bounds, that the superintendent acting as master or judge of police may have the full powers of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a> in the execution of his duty. By the powers with which the superintendent is invested, he may commit offenders to the tolbooth or to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BRIDEWELL\">bridewell</a> for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> not exceeding 60 days, and impose fines for offences not exceeding 40 shillings sterling, and give judgment in damages for any sum not exceeding three pounds sterling with the expenses in either case. From the sentences of the superintendent there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to the sheriff depute of the county, or to the lord provost as sheriff principal within the city. The superintendent of police is also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BILLET\">billet</a>-master within his bounds, and the inspectors of wards are billet-masters within their several wards. The inspectors also have the powers of procurator fiscaux with respect to all prosecutions for offences committed within their bounds.\n\nThe expenses necessary to carry the above act into execution, are to be defrayed from a fund raised by assessment on the inhabitants of three per cent. on the free rent of houses, shops or warehouses, and for the expenses of clothing and alimenting the persons committed to bridewell a farther assessment not exceeding \u00bd per cent. of the free rent of such houses, &c. For the purpose of ascertaining rents, surveyors are appointed; and if the rent fixed by them should be over-rated, an appeal may be made to a committee of the general commissioners specially appointed.\n\nThe office of the superintendent of police is in the Lawnmarket. The operation of the act has only continued for a few months (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> 1805) and although some complaints have been made of its rigorous execution, arising probably from such unavoidable and unforeseen circumstances as frequently occur in the establishment of a new system, yet there is every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to hope, that it will prove highly beneficial for the preservation of peace and good order in the city and suburbs over which it extends.\n\nThe number of inhabitants in the city of Edinburgh is somewhat uncertain, and has been very variously calculated. By a survey made in the year 1775, it appears that the number of families in the city, Canongate, and other suburbs, and the town of Leith, amounted to 13,806. The difficulty therefore is to fix the number of persons in a family. Dr Price fixes this number at 4\u00bd; Mr Maitland, at 5\u00bd; and Mr Arnot, at 6\u00bd; so that, according to this last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>, the whole number of inhabitants is 82,836; to which he thinks 1,400 more may be added for those in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARRISON\">garrison</a>, hospitals, &c.\n\nThe following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> exhibits a comparative view of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of the city of Edinburgh and suburbs taken in different years. The last enumeration made in 1801 by act of parliament is supposed to be considerably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a> in the real amount of the inhabitants, as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a> was industriously spread that it was done with a view to the imposition of new taxes. This, it appeared, induced many to conceal the names and number of the individuals in their families,\n\n| Year | Population |\n|------|------------|\n| 1678 | 35,500     |\n| 1722 | 40,420     |\n| 1755 | 57,195     |\n| 1775 | 70,430     |\n| 1791 | 84,886     |\n| 1801 | 82,560     |\n\nThere\nThere are in Edinburgh 14 incorporations, capable of choosing their own deacons, viz. The royal college of surgeons; the corporations of goldsmiths, skinners, furriers, hammermen, wrights and masons, tailors, bakers, butchers, shoemakers, weavers, waukers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BONNET\">bonnet</a>-makers, and merchant company.\n\nThe markets of Edinburgh are plentifully supplied with all sorts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>. Fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BUTCHER\">butcher</a> meat, as well as fowl and fish, if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> permit, may be had every day; and no city can be better supplied with garden stuffs. The Edinburgh strawberries particularly are remarkably large and fine. A striking instance of the plenty of provisions with which Edinburgh is supplied was observed in the year 1779, when several large fleets, all of them in want of necessaries, arrived in the Forth, to the amount of about 500 sail, and having on board at least 20,000 men; yet the increased consumption of provisions, which certainly ensued upon the arrival of so many strangers, made not the least increase in the rate of the markets, insomuch that several victualling ships sent down by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a> board returned without opening their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HATCHES\">hatches</a>. The city mills are let to the corporation of bakers in Edinburgh; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> made in the city is remarkable for its goodness.\n\nEdinburgh is supplied with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> brought for some miles in pipes, and lodged in two reservoirs, from whence it is distributed through the city both to public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELLS\">wells</a> and private families. A revenue accrues to the town from the latter, which must undoubtedly increase in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> as the city extends in magnitude.\n\nThere are but few merchants in Edinburgh, most of them residing at the port of Leith; so that the support of the city depends on the consumption of the necessaries as well as the superfluities of life. There are five different sorts of people on whom the shopkeepers, publicans, and different trades depend: 1. The people of the law, who are a very respectable body in the city. 2. The number of young people of both sexes who come to town for their education, many of the parents of whom come along with them. 3. The country gentlemen, gentlemen of the army and navy, and people who have made their fortunes abroad, &c., all of whom come to attend the public diversions, or to spend their time in such a manner as is most agreeable to them. 4. The vast concourse of travellers from all parts. 5. Most of the money drawn for the rents of country gentlemen is circulated among the bankers or other agents.\n\nAt Edinburgh there are excellent manufactures of linen and cambrics; there are also manufactures of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> in the neighbourhood, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> is carried on very extensively. But for some time the capital branch about Edinburgh has been building: which has gone on, and still continues to do so, with such rapidity, that the city has been increased exceedingly in its extent; and it is not uncommon to see a house built in a few months, and even inhabited before the roof is quite finished.","sp":140,"ep":150},{"h":"COROLLARIES","t":"29.

For a parallelogram lies all in the same plane.\n\nCor. 2. The motion Ab may be produced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of any two uniform motions having the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> and velocities which are represented by the sides of any parallelogram AFbG, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> ACbB, which has Ab for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DIAGONAL\">diagonal</a>.\n\n58. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">Cases</a> are not unfrequent in which the directions of two simple motions composing an observed motion may be discovered; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of the velocities is unknown. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> may be ascertained by means of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> proposition. For the direction of the three motions, namely, the two simple and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> motions, determines not only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of parallelogram, but also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of the sides. Again, in those cases in which the direction and the velocity of one of the simple motions are known, and therefore its proportion to that of the observed compound motion, the direction and velocity of the other may be also found by means of the same proposition; because from these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> the parallelogram may be determined.\n\n59. This motion in the diagonal is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> motion, or the resolving motion; for it is equivalent to the combined motions in the sides. Thus, if the moving body first describes AB, and then Bb or AC, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be in the same point, as if it had described Ab, namely, in the point b.\n\n60. It is often highly useful in investigations of this kind to substitute such motions for an observed motion, as will produce it by composition. This has been denominated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> of motions. By this manner of proceeding, a ship's change of situation at the end of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, having failed in different courses, is computed. Thus the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> failed to the eastward or the westward, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as that to the northward or southward, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> each course, is observed and marked. The whole of the eastings, and the whole of the southings, are added together; and then it is supposed that the ship has failed for the whole day on that course, which would be produced by combining the same easting and southing.\n\n61. It is also useful to consider how much the body has been advanced in a certain direction by means of the observed motion; let us suppose in the direction AB (fig. 10.) The motion CD is first considered as composed of a motion CE <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the given line AB, and another motion CF <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> to AB. CD is the diagonal of a parallelogram CEDF, one of whose sides CE is parallel to AB, and the other CF is perpendicular to AB. It is evident, that the body has advanced in the direction of AB as much as if it had moved from G to H, instead of moving from C to D, so that the motion CF has no effect either in obstructing or promoting the progress in AB. This is called estimating a motion in a given direction, or reducing it to that direction.\n\n62. A motion is also said to be estimated in a given plane, when it is considered as composed of a motion perpendicular to the plane, and of another parallel to it. In a given plane ABCD (fig. 11.), let EF be a motion compounded of a motion GE perpendicular to the plane, and EH parallel to it. For if the lines GE, FH are drawn perpendicular to the plane, they cut it in two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> e and f, and EH is parallel to ef.\n\n63. In the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> a compound motion may be formed of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of motions. Let AB, AC, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AD\">AD</a>, AE, &c. (fig. 12.) be any number of motions, of which the motion AF is compounded. The motion which is the result of this composition is thus ascertained. The motion AG is compounded of AB and AC; and the motion AG compounded with AD, gives the motion AH; which latter being compounded with AE, produces the motion AF. And the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> situation F, will be found by supposing the different motions AB, AC, AD, AE, to be performed successively. The moving body first describes AB; then BG, equal and parallel to AC; then GH, equal and parallel to AD; and lastly, HF, equal and parallel to AE. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> it is not requisite that all the motions <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> in the same plane.\n\n64. Three motions which have the direction and proportions of the sides of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLELOPIPED\">parallelopiped</a>, compose a motion having the direction of its diagonal. Let AB, AC, AD (fig. 13.), be these motions, the compound motion is in the diagonal AF of the parallelopiped; because AB and AC compose the motion AE; and AE and AD compose the motion AF.\n\nIt is in this way that the mine-surveyor proceeds. He sets <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GALLERY\">gallery</a> of a mine, not directly by its real position, but marks the easting and southing, the northing and fouthing, as well as its dip and rise. All these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> are referred to three lines, of which one runs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> and west, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> and south, and a third is perpendicular. These three lines are obviously analogous.\nCompound gous to the angular boundaries of a rectangular box, as AC, AB, AD.\n\n65. The composition of uniform motions only has yet been considered. But it is easy to conceive that any motions may be compounded. It is a case of this kind when a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> is supposed to walk on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> along a crooked path, while the ice floats down a crooked stream. Suppose a uniform motion in the direction AB (fig. 14.), to be compounded with a uniformly accelerated motion in the direction AC. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> falling from the mast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of a ship, while the ship moves uniformly forward in the direction AB, affords an example of this kind of motion; for the stone will be observed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> parallel to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLUMMET\">plummet</a> hung from the mast head. But the real motion of the stone is a parabolic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> ABFG, which AB touches in A; for while the mast head describes the equal lines AB, BF, FG, the stone has fallen to B and C and D, and the line AC is in the positions BB', FF', GG', so that AC is four times AB; and AC is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> times AB. Therefore AB, AC, AD, are as the squares of BC, CF, CG, and the line ABFG is a parabola.\n\n66. Knowing the direction and velocities of each of the simple motions in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a>, of which two motions, however variable, are compounded, we may discover the direction and velocities of the compound motions in that instant. For it may be supposed that each motion at that instant proceeds unchanged; a parallelogram is then constructed; the sides of which have the directions and proportions of the velocities of the simple motions; and the diagonal of this parallelogram will express the direction and velocity of the compound motion. But on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, if the direction and velocity of the compound motion, with the directions of each of the simple motions, be known, we may discover their velocities.\n\n67. In cases where a curvilinear motion as ABC (fig. 15.), is the result of two motions compounded, of which the direction is known to be AD and AE, we discover the velocities of the three motions in any point B, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> the tangent BF, and the ordinate BG, parallel to one of the simple motions, and from any point H in that ordinate drawing HF parallel to the other motion, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> the tangent in the point F. The three velocities are in the proportion of the three lines FH, HB, and FB.\n\n68. As the motions which are observed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> are very different from what they are taken to be, it is not easy to avoid mistakes with respect to the changes of motion, and consequently with respect to the inference of its cause. Without considering the real motion of any body, we are apt to judge only of the change of distance and direction in relation to ourselves. Thus it is that our inferences with regard to the planetary motions are very different from the motions themselves, if the rapid motion of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> be considered.\n\nProp. X.\n\n69. The motion of one body in relation to another body, or as it is seen from another body, which is also in motion, is compounded of its own real motion, and the opposite of the real motion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> body.\n\nLet A (fig. 16.) be a body in motion from A to C, as seen from B, which is another body in motion from B to D the motion of A is compounded of its own real motion, and of the opposite to the real motion of B continually deflected.\n\nJoin AB, and draw AE equal and parallel to BD. Complete the parallelogram ACFE, and join ED and DC. Produce EA, and make AL equal to AE or BD. Complete the parallelogram LACK, and draw AK and BK. If then A had moved along AE while B moves along BD, the two bodies would have been at E and D, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, and would have the same relative situation; they would have the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> and distance as before. And if the spectator in B is not sensible of his own motion, A will appear not to have changed its place. In the same way two ships becalmed in an unknown current, seem to the persons on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> to be at rest. The real position, therefore, and distance DC, are the same with BK; and if a spectator in B imagines himself at rest, the line AK will be taken as the motion of A. And this motion, it is obvious, is composed of the motion AC its real motion, and the motion AL which is the equal and opposite motion to that of BD.\n\nAgain, if BH be drawn equal and opposite to AC, and the parallelogram BHGD be completed, and BG and AG be drawn, the diagonal BG will be the motion of B as it is seen from A. Now as KAGB is a parallelogram, the relative situation and distances of A and B at the end of the motion will appear to be the same as in the former case. For B appears to have moved along BG, which is equal and opposite to AK. Hence it follows, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> or relative motions of two bodies are equal and opposite, whatever their real motions may be; and therefore they do not afford any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> of their real motions.\n\n70. Suppose equal and parallel motions are compounded with all and each of the motions of any number of bodies, moving in any manner of way, then their relative motions are not consequently changed. For if it be compounded with the motion of any one of the bodies which may be called A, the real motion of this body is changed; but its apparent motion as seen from another body B, is compounded of the real change, and of the opposite to the real change in A, which therefore destroys that change, and the relative motion of A is the same as before. Thus it is that the motions in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CABIN\">cabin</a> of a ship are not affected by the ship's progressive motion; and the motion of the earth round the sun produces no perceptible effect on the relative motions on its surface. And indeed it is only by observing other bodies which are not affected by these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> motions, and to which we refer as to fixed points, that we arrive at any knowledge of them.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. IV. Of Motions continually Deflected.\n\n71. Curvilinear motions are cases of continual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFLECTION\">deflection</a>. They are susceptible of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> varieties; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of their modifications and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> properties is attended with no small difficulty. Uniform motion in a circular arch is an example of the simplest case of curvilinear motion; for here the deflections from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTILINEAR\">rectilinear</a> motion are equal in equal times. If, however, the velocity be increased, the momentary deflection must also be augmented; for a greater arch will be described, and the end of this greater arch is\nWhen a uniform rectilineal motion \\( AB \\) (fig. 17.) is deflected into another \\( BC \\), the linear deflection is affected by drawing a line from the point \\( c \\), at which point the body would have arrived, had it not been deflected to the point \\( C \\) at which it has arrived. The result is the same, whether the lines \\( dD \\) or \\( cC \\) be drawn in this manner; for being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to \\( Bc \\), they always give the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of the velocities; and here the lines of deflection are all parallel, indicating the direction of the deflection in the point \\( B \\). But this is not the case in any curvilinear motion. It rarely happens that \\( dD : cC = Bc \\); and it is never found that \\( dD : cC = Bc \\). We cannot therefore discover which lines should be taken for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> of the direction of the deflection at \\( B \\), or for the measure of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>. A greater velocity then, in the same curve, produces a greater deflection, but if the path be more incurved, an arch of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> described with the same velocity, causes a farther deviation from the tangent. If therefore a body have a uniform motion in a curve of variable curvature, the deflection is greatest where the curvature is greatest.\n\nThus it appears that the direction and measure of the deflections by which a body deviates continually into a curvilinear path cannot be ascertained, but by investigating the ultimate positions and ratios of the lines, which join the points of the curve with the simultaneous points of the tangent, as the points \\( d \\) and \\( C \\) are taken nearer to \\( B \\). In some cases, but rarely, the lines joining the simultaneous points are parallel. But in most cases the direction of the deflection is discovered by observing what direction it approximates. The following proposition which was discovered by Newton is of great importance in this investigation.\n\n**Proposition XI.**\n\nIf a body describe a curve line \\( ABCDEF \\) (fig. 18.) being in the same plane, and if in this plane there be a point \\( S \\) so situated, that the lines \\( SA, SB, SC, \\ldots \\) drawn to the curve, cut off areas \\( ASB, ASC, ASD, \\ldots \\) proportional to the times of describing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> \\( AB, AC, AD, \\ldots \\), then the deflections are always directed to the point \\( S \\).\n\nSuppose first that the body describes the polygon \\( ABCDEF \\), formed of the chords of this curve, and that it describes each chord uniformly, and is deflected only in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> \\( B, C, D, \\ldots \\). Suppose also that the sides of the polygon are described in equal times, so that, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, the triangles \\( ASB, BSC, CSD, \\ldots \\) are all equal. Continue the chords \\( AB, BC, \\ldots \\) beyond the arches, making \\( Be \\) equal to \\( AR \\), and \\( Cd \\) equal to \\( BC \\), and so on. Join \\( cC, dD, \\ldots \\), and draw \\( cS, dS, \\ldots \\); draw \\( CB \\) parallel to \\( cB \\) or \\( BA \\), cutting \\( BS \\) in \\( b \\), and join \\( bA \\), and draw \\( CA \\), cutting \\( BB \\) in \\( o \\). And lastly, make a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> at \\( E \\).\n\nThen, because \\( cB \\) is equal to \\( BA \\), the triangles \\( ASB \\) and \\( BSc \\) are equal, and therefore \\( BS \\) is equal to \\( BSC \\). And being on the same base \\( SB \\), they are therefore between the same parallels; that is, \\( cC \\) is parallel to \\( BS \\), and \\( BC \\) is the diagonal of a parallelogram \\( BbCc \\). The motion \\( BC \\) is therefore compounded of the motions \\( Bc \\) and \\( Bb \\), and \\( Bb \\) is the deflection, by which the motion \\( Bc \\) is changed into the motion \\( BC \\); and therefore the deflection in \\( B \\) is directed to \\( S \\). By similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> it may be shown that \\( Ff \\), or \\( Ei \\), is the deflection at \\( E \\), and is likewise directed to \\( S \\); and the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> will apply to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of the polygon.\u2014This point \\( S \\) has been called the centre of deflection.\n\nIf the sides of the polygon are diminished, and their number infinitely increased, the demonstration remains the same, and continues, when the polygon coalesces with the curvilinear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AREA\">area</a>, and its sides with the curvilinear arch.\n\nBut when the whole areas are proportional to the times, equal areas are described in equal times. In such motion therefore, the deflections are always directed to \\( S \\).\n\n**Proposition XII.**\n\nIf the deflection by which a curve line is described, be continually directed to a fixed point, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> will be in one plane, and areas will be described round that point proportional to the times. Let \\( ADF \\) be the curve line described, and let the deflections be directed to the point \\( S \\), this curve line is in the same plane. For \\( BC \\) is the diagonal of a parallelogram, and is in the plane of \\( SB \\) and \\( Be \\); and \\( cC \\) is parallel to \\( BS \\), and the triangles \\( SBC, SBe, \\) and \\( SBA, \\) are equal. But equal areas are described in equal times; and therefore areas are described proportional to the times.\n\n**Corollaries.**\n\n1. The velocities in different points of the curve are inversely proportional to the perpendiculars \\( Sr \\) and \\( St \\) (fig. 19.) drawn from \\( S \\) on the tangents \\( Ar, Et \\) in those points of the curve. For since the elementary triangles \\( ASB, ESF, \\) are equal, their bases \\( AB, EF, \\) are inversely as their altitudes \\( Sr, St. \\) And these bases being described in equal times are as the velocities, and ultimately coincide with the tangents at \\( A \\) and \\( E; \\) and therefore the velocity in \\( A \\) is to that in \\( E \\) as \\( Sr \\) to \\( Sr. \\)\n\n2. The angular velocities round \\( S \\) are inversely as the squares of the distances. For if we describe round the centre \\( S \\) the small arches \\( Ba, Fa, \\) they may be considered as perpendiculars on \\( SA \\) and \\( SE. \\) Describe also with the distance \\( SF \\) the arch \\( gh. \\) It is evident that \\( gh \\) is to \\( Fa \\) as the angle \\( ASB \\) to the angle \\( ESF. \\) And since the areas \\( ASB, ESF \\) are equal, we have \\( Ba : Fa = SE : SA. \\)\n\nBut \\( gh : Fa = SE : SA. \\)\n\nTherefore \\( gh : Fa = SE^2 : SA^2. \\)\n\nAnd \\( ASB : ESF = SE^2 : SA^2. \\)\n\nLet us now proceed to determine the magnitude of the deflection, or to compare its magnitude in any two points, as for example the magnitude in \\( B \\) (fig. 18.) with its magnitude in \\( E. \\) The deflection in \\( B \\) is to that in \\( E \\) as the line \\( Bb \\) to the line \\( Ei; \\) for \\( Bb \\) and \\( Ei \\) are the motions, which, by being compounded with the motions \\( Be \\) and \\( Ef, \\) make the body describe \\( BC \\) and \\( EF. \\) And therefore when the sides of the polygon\nMotions","sp":75,"ep":78},{"h":"COROLLARY","t":"20.

II. Of Variable Motions.\n\n24. In observing the phenomena of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, it rarely happens that the motions to which our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> is directed are perfectly uniform. These motions, however, we distinctly conceive, with all their properties; and it is obviously of the utmost importance that all the deviations from uniform motions be clearly understood; because these deviations afford the only marks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of the variations, and therefore of the causes which produce these changes.\n\n25. When a body continues to move uniformly in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, or circumstances with respect to motion, have suffered no change. The condition of that body, therefore, must be allowed to be the same in any two portions of its path, whatever the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of these portions may be. And because a change of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> is involved in the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of motion, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of place does not imply any change. Two bodies, therefore, moving with the same velocity in this path, or in two lines <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to it, their condition in respect of motion must be allowed to be the same. Their direction is the same, and their rate of motion is the same. The velocity, therefore, and direction of a body, are the only circumstances which seem to enter into our conception of the state of a body, in respect of motion. Changes either in the velocity, or in the direction, or in both of these circumstances, include all the changes of which this condition is susceptible. Let us now consider the first of these changes, namely, changes of velocity.\n\nOf Accelerated and Retarded Motions.\n\n26. It has been ascertained by experiment and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> in falling is carried downward with greater rapidity in every succeeding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>. During the first second it falls 16 feet; during the next it falls 48 feet; during the third, it falls 80 feet; during the fourth it falls 112 feet; continuing to fall, during every succeeding second 32 feet more than during the preceding second. A body moving in this manner is said to have an accelerated motion. But if a body be projected perpendicularly upwards, the very reverse takes place in the circumstances of its motion. It is observed to rise with a motion which is continually retarded. These bodies therefore are conceived to be in every succeeding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> in different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of motion. The velocity of the falling body is conceived to be greater in a certain instant than in any preceding instant; as, for example, when it has fallen 144 feet its velocity is said to be thrice as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> as when it has fallen only 16 feet. But this inference it is evident cannot be made directly by comparing the spaces described in the following moments; for in these it falls 112 and 48 feet; or by comparing the spaces immediately preceding; for in these the body fell 80 and 16 feet. But in this expression it is supposed that the variable condition of a body, called its velocity, is, in every instant susceptible of an accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a>; and yet in no moment, however short, does the body describe uniformly a space which can be taken as the measure of its velocity at the beginning of that moment; because the space described in any moment is too great for measuring the velocity at the beginning of the moment, and too small for the measure of its velocity at the end of it. Till however such a measure is obtained, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> condition of the body is not known.\n\n27. But in a continually accelerated motion, no such measure can be obtained. No space is describ-\ned in an instant: for this requires time. In that instant, however, the body possesses what has been called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POTENTIAL\">potential</a> velocity, that is, a certain tendency or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a>, which remaining unchanged, causes it to describe a certain space uniformly during some assignable portion of time. At another instant it has another determination, by which, if it be not changed, another space would be uniformly described in an equal portion of time. Now it is in the difference of those two determinations that its difference of mechanical condition consists. The marks and measures of these determinations are known from the spaces which would be uniformly described. These therefore must be carefully investigated as the measures of the velocities; and the proportions of these spaces are to be taken as the proportions of the velocities.\n\nPROP. VI.\n\n28. Let the straight line ABD (fig. 5.) be described with a motion continually varied, it is required to determine the proportion of the velocity in the point A, to the velocity in any other point C.\n\nLet the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> line abd, represent the time of this motion along the path <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AD\">AD</a>, so that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> a, b, c, d, may denote the instants of the moving body being in A, B, C, D, and the portions ab, bc, cd, may express the times of describing AB, BC, CD, that is, may be in the proportion of those times; and let ae, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> to ad, express the velocity of the moving body at the instant a, or in the point A. Let egh be a line, so related to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a> ad, that the areas abfe, bcgf, cdhg, comprehended between the ordinates ae, bf, cg, dh, all perpendicular to ad, may be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the spaces AB, BC, CD, described in the times ab, bc, cd, and let this relation hold in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. Then the velocity in A is to the velocity in B, or C, or D, as ae to bf, or cg, or dh. Or it may be expressed in other words, If the abscissa ad, of a curve egh, be proportional to the time of any motion, and the areas interrupted by parallel ordinates be proportional to the spaces described, the velocities are proportional to those ordinates.\n\nMake be and cd equal, so as to represent very small and equal moments of time, and make pa equal to one of them. Complete the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTANGLE\">rectangle</a> paeq. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> represent the space uniformly described in the moment pa, with the velocity ae (Propof. 3.) Let PA be that portion of space thus uniformly described in the moment pa. Let the lines im, kn, parallel to ad, make the rectangles bemi, and cdnk, respectively equal to the areas bcgf, and cdhg. If the motions along the spaces PA and BC had been uniform, the velocities would have been proportional to the spaces described (Propof. 1.) because the times pa, and bc are equal. That is, the velocity in A would be to the velocity in C, as the rectangle paeq to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AREA\">area</a> bcgf, that is, as paeq to bemi, that is, as the base ae to the base cm, because the altitudes pa and bc are equal.\n\nBut the motion along the line BC is not represented as uniform; for the line fg diverges from the axis bd, the ordinate cg being greater than bf. And therefore the spaces measured by these areas increase faster than the times; and thus the figure represents an accelerated motion. Therefore the velocity with which BC would be uniformly described during the moment bc, is less than the velocity at the end of that moment, that is, at the instant c, or in the point C of the path; and therefore it must be represented and measured by a line greater than cm.\n\nIn the same manner it is proved that ck represents and measures the velocity with which CD would be uniformly described during the moment cd. And therefore, since the motion along CD is also accelerated, the velocity at the beginning of that moment is less than the velocity with which it would be uniformly described in the same time, and must be represented by a line less than ck.\n\nTherefore the velocity in A is to that in C, in a less ratio than that of ae to cg, but in a greater ratio than that of ae to ck. But in this case, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> as the instant b is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a>, to the instant c, cm is less, and ck is greater, than cg. Therefore the velocity in A is to that in C in a ratio that is greater than any ratio less than that of ae to cg. And, consequently the velocity in A is to that in C, as ae to cg.\n\nIt may be proved in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, with respect to the velocity in any other point D; and therefore the proposition may be considered as demonstrated. And had the motion along BCD, instead of being accelerated as in this case, been retarded, the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> would still apply.","sp":69,"ep":70},{"h":"COROLLARY","t":"39. Therefore, accelerations are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the spaces described in equal times, with motions uniformly accelerated from a state of rest. For in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the spaces are the halves of what would be uniformly described in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> with the acquired <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> velocities, and are therefore proportional to these velocities, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> to the accelerations, since the velocities were acquired in equal times.\n\n40. It is then said, that accelerations are proportional to the increments of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> uniformly acquired, directly, and to the times in which they are acquired inversely.\n\n\\[A : a = \\frac{V}{T} : \\frac{v}{t}\\]\n\nThis relation between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a>, velocity, and time, is also true, in uniformly accelerated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, with respect to all momentary changes of velocity, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as to those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of motion passing through all degrees of velocity from nothing to the final <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> \\(v\\). For the velocity increasing at the same rate with the time, we have \\(v : v' = t : t'\\); and \\(v\\) and \\(v'\\) express the simultaneous increments of velocity and time.\n\n41. But if the augmentation of velocity be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of the acceleration, and therefore proportional to it, and if in uniformly accelerated motions, the velocity increases at the same rate with the times, the increments of velocity are as the accelerations and as the times jointly. Hence the proportional equation\n\n\\[\\frac{v}{v'} = \\frac{a}{a'}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\\frac{v}{v'} = \\frac{a}{a'}.\\]\n\n42. It appears from (39.), that when the velocity has uniformly increased from nothing, the spaces described in equal times are proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of acceleration. And in (37.\u20143.) uniformly accelerated motions, the spaces are as the squares of the times. Therefore, when the acceleration continues the same, the fraction \\(\\frac{s}{t^2}\\) must also remain of the same value, and \\(a\\) is proportional to \\(\\frac{s}{t^2}\\). And therefore, accelerations are proportional to the spaces described with a motion uniformly accelerated from rest, directly, and to the squares of the times inversely.\n\n43. And since \\(a = \\frac{v}{t}\\), we have \\(a = \\frac{v}{v'}\\); but \\(v = \\frac{s}{t}\\),\n\ntherefore \\(a = \\frac{v^2}{s}\\). Therefore we have another measure of acceleration, viz. Accelerations are directly as the squares of the velocities, and inversely as the spaces along which the velocities are uniformly augmented.\n\n44. But when the spaces are equal, we have \\(a = \\frac{v^2}{s}\\), and in uniformly accelerated motions, that is, when \\(a\\) remains constant, the space being increased in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a>, \\(v^2\\) increases in the same proportion; it follows that \\(v^2\\) increases in the proportion both of the acceleration and of the space. And therefore, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, we have, \\(v^2 = a s\\). And, as in 41, 42, we shall have \\(v^2 = a s\\), and \\(v^2 = a s - a s'\\), or \\(S = S' - s\\), which may be thus expressed \\(v v' = a s'\\), that is, in a motion uniformly accelerated, the momentary change of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the velocity is proportional to the acceleration and to the space jointly. Thus it appears, that the acceleration <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> during a given time \\(t\\), or \\(t'\\), produces a certain augmentation of the simple velocity; but the acceleration continued along a given space \\(s\\), or \\(s'\\), produces a certain augmentation of the square of the velocity.\n\n45. But accelerations which are constant and uniform, and such as have been considered, are very rare in the phenomena of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. They are as variable as velocities, and therefore it is not less difficult to discover their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> measure. By changes of velocity only we obtain any knowledge of the changing cause. From the continual acceleration of a falling body we learn, that the same power which makes it press <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, presses it downward, as it falls through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; and whatever be the rapidity of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>, it is from observing that it acquires equal increments of velocity in equal times, that we know the downward pressure to be the same.\nIn the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> that we obtain measures of a velocity which is continually varying, we may obtain accurate measures of a similarly varying acceleration. A line may be conceived to increase along with the velocity, and at the same rate; and this rate of increase of velocity is what is called acceleration, in the same way as the rate at which the line increases, is what is called velocity. If, then, we consider the areas (fig. 5.) or the line <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AD\">AD</a>, as representing a velocity; the ordinates to the line eg h, which were demonstrated to be proportional to the rate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AREA\">area</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be proportional to the variation of the velocity, that is, to the acceleration.\n\nProp. VII.\n\n46. If the abscissa ad of a curve line egh represent the time of a motion, and if the areas abfe, acge, adhe, &c. are proportional to the velocities at the instants b, c, d, &c., then the ordinates ae, b f, cg, dh, &c. are proportional to the accelerations at the instants a, b, c, d, &c.\n\nBy substituting the word acceleration for the word velocity, the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> may be applied here as in Prop. 6. (28.) From this proposition may be deduced some corollaries of practical use in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> discussions.\n\n47. The momentary increments of velocity are as the accelerations, and as the moments jointly.\n\nFor the increment of velocity in the moment cd is accurately represented by the area cdhg, or by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTANGLE\">rectangle</a> cdnk; and cd accurately represents the moment. Also, the ultimate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of cd to such another ordinate bi, is the ratio of eg to bf; that is, the ratio of the acceleration in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> c to that in the instant b. And therefore the increment of velocity during the moment pa is to that during the moment cd as pa \u00d7 ae to cd \u00d7 dg. Or it may be expressed by the proportional equation v = <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AI\">ai</a>.\n\n48. Conversely. The acceleration a is proportional to v, as in the case when the motion is uniformly accelerated (46.)\n\nAnd as the area of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> is analogous to the sum of all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> rectangles, when the circumstances of the case admit of its being measured, it may be expressed by fat; and thus is obtained the whole velocity acquired during the time AC, and we say v = fat.\n\nThe intensities (or at least their proportions) of the accelerating power of nature in the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of the path being frequently known, we wish to discover the velocities in those points. This may be done by the following proposition.\n\nProp. VIII.\n\n49. If the abscissa AE (fig. 8.) of a line ace be the space along which a body moves with a motion continually varied, and if the ordinates Aa, Bb, Cc, &c. be proportional to the accelerations in the points A, B, C, &c., then the areas <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBA\">ABba</a>, ADda, AEea, &c. are proportional to the augmentations of the square of the velocity in A at the points B, D, E, &c.\n\nTake BC, CD, as two very small portions of the line AE, and draw bf, cg, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to AE. Then, supposing the acceleration Bb, to continue through the space BC, the rectangle BbfC will express the augmentation made on the square of the velocity in B. In the same way CcgD will express the augmentation of the square of the velocity in C; and, in like manner, the rectangles inscribed in the remainder of the figure will express the increments of the squares of the velocity acquired, while the body moves over the corresponding portions of the abscissa. And, therefore, the whole augmentation of the square of the velocity in A (should there be any velocity in that point) during the time of moving from A to B, will constitute the aggregate of these partial increments. The same thing must be affirmed of the motion from B to E. And, when the subdivision of AE is carried on without end, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that the ultimate ratio of the area AEea to the aggregate of inscribed rectangles, is that of equality; that is, when the acceleration varies continually, the area ABba will express the increment made on the square of the initial velocity in A, while the body moves along AB; and the same must be affirmed with respect to the motion along BE. And, therefore, the intercepted areas ABba, BDdb, DEed, are proportional to the changes made on the squares of the velocities in the points A, B, and D.\n\nCorollaries.\n\n50. Cor. 1. If the body had no velocity in A, the areas ABba, ADda, &c. are proportional to the squares of the velocity acquired in the points B, D, &c.\n\nCor. 2. The momentary change on the square of the velocity, is as the acceleration and increment of the space jointly; or we have v = ai.\n\nCor. 3. v being equal to half the increment of the square of the velocity, it follows that the area AEea, or the fluent fat is only equal to \\(\\frac{V^2 - v^2}{2}\\), taking v and V as the velocities in A and E.\n\n51. What has now been said of the acceleration of motion, is equally applicable to motions that are retarded, whether these motions be uniform or unequal. The momentary variations in this case are to be taken as decrements of velocity instead of increments. A moving body, subject to uniform retardation till it come to rest, will continue in motion during a time proportional to the initial velocity; and describe a space proportional to the square of this velocity; and the space which is so described, is one half what it would have been if the initial velocity had continued undiminished.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>.

Having obtained the marks and measures of every variation of velocity, we are now to discover the changes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> in similar characteristics for every change of direction. In the above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of the general marks of any change of motion, it is plain that the change being the same in any two or more instances, the sensible marks must also be the same, whatever may have been the previous\nprevious condition of the moving bodies. In every case of change, some circumstance in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the former motions and the new motions must be observed, which is exactly the same both in respect of velocity and direction. One of the bodies then may be supposed to have been at rest; and thus the change produced on it, is the motion which it has acquired, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> to this motion. Therefore, a change of motion is itself a motion, or determination to motion.\n\nIn the above case, it is the new motion only; but it is not the new motion in every other case. For supposing the previous condition of the body to have been different from that of a body at rest, and supposing the same change produced on it, the new condition of the one body must be different from the new condition of the other. The change, therefore, being the same in both cases, the new condition cannot be that change. But, when the same change happens in any previous motion, the difference between the former motion and the new motion, must indicate something that is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to the motion produced in a body previously at rest, or the same with that motion, this body having received the same change. And the difference between the new motions of the two bodies will be such as shall indicate the difference between the previous conditions of each body. The change of motion then is itself a motion; and this being assumed as a principle, we are now to endeavour to discover a motion, which alone shall produce that difference from the former motion, which, in all cases, is observed in the new motion. This is to be considered as the proper characteristic of the change.\n\nThe following motions may serve as an illustration of these conditions. Let it be supposed that the straight line AB (fig. 9.) lies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> and west, and that it is crossed by the line AC from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> to south. Suppose this line AC to be a rod or wire, and to be carried along the line AB in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, but always in the same position, that is, lying north and south. The end of the rod or wire A having moved uniformly one-third of AB at the end of 20\", it will be in the position D d; at the end of 40\" it will have the position E e; and at the end of the minute it will be in the position B b.\n\nLet the line AB, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, (supposing it also to be material) be uniformly moved from north to south, and always parallel to its first position AB. When it has passed over one-third of AC, at the end of 20\", it will be in the position m n; at the end of 40\" it will have the position o p, and Ao is two-thirds of AC. At the end of the minute, it will have the position C c b. It is evident that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERSECTION\">intersection</a> of these two lines will be always in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DIAGONAL\">diagonal</a> A b of the parallelogram AC b B; for the parallelogram A m D is similar to the parallelogram A C b B, because AD : AB = Am : AC; and, in like manner, Ao : E is a parallelogram similar to AC b B. Therefore, these parallelograms are about a common diagonal A b.\n\nAgain, the motion of the point of intersection of these lines is uniform; for AD : AB = A d : A b, and AE : AB = A e : A b, &c. Therefore the spaces A d, A e, A b are proportional to the times.\n\nThus the intersection of two lines having each a uniform motion in the direction of the other, moves uniformly in the direction of the diagonal of the parallelogram, which is formed by the lines in their first or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> position; and the velocity of the intersection is to the velocity of each of the motions of the lines as the diagonal is to the side in the direction of which the motions are made. This motion of the intersection is very properly said to be compounded of two motions in the direction of the sides; for which the point d of the line D d moves eastward, the same point d of the line m n is at the same instant moving southward. The point d, therefore, may be considered as a point of both lines, partaking in every instant of both motions. The motion along A b then contains both motions along A B and A C, and being identical with a motion compounded of these motions, indicates both, or the determination to both. In every situation of the point of intersection, its velocity is compounded of the velocity A B and A C. A body, therefore, whose motion continued unchanged, would have described A B in one minute; but when it reaches the point A, it turns aside, and describes A b uniformly in the same time; the change then which the body sustains in the point A is a motion A C. For suppose the body had been at rest in the point A, and it is observed to describe A C in one minute, the motion A C is the change which it has sustained. The motion A b is not the change: for if A F had been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> motion, the same motion A b would have been the result of compounding with it the motion A G. But since A F is different from A B, the same change cannot produce the same new conditions. But, farther, there is no other motion which, by compounding it with A B, will produce the motion A b; and the motion A C is the only circumstance of difference between changing the motion A B into the diagonal motion A b, and giving the motion A C to a body which was previously at rest.\n\nFrom these conditions it follows, that a change of motion, is that motion, which by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> with the previous state of motion, produces the new motion.\n\nThis composition of motion has been considered in another way. While a body is supposed to move uniformly in the direction A B, the space in which this motion is performed, is supposed to be carried in the direction A C. But it cannot be conceived that any portion of space is moved from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. A distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of this composition may be obtained, by supposing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> walking along a line A B, while this is drawn on a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>, and the ice is floating in the direction A C. But the motion on moving ice is not precisely a composition of two determinations to motion; for this is completed in the first instant. When the motion in the direction and with the velocity A b begins, no further exertion is needed; the motion continues, and A b is described. It serves, however, to exhibit to the mind the mathematical composition of two motions. In the result of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a>, all the characteristics of the two determinations are to be found; for the point of intersection, in whatever way it is considered, partakes of both motions.\n\nThus a general characteristic of a change of motion is obtained, and this corresponds with the mark and measure of every moving cause; for it is the very motion which it is conceived to produce. It may perhaps even be considered as the foundation of former measures; for in every acceleration, retardation, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFLECTION\">deflection</a>, there is a new motion compounded with the former.\nSect.

In dyeing yellow, it is necessary to employ mordants, because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> of yellow colouring matters for either animal or vegetable stuffs is not sufficiently strong to produce durable colours. Yellow colours, therefore, belong to that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> which Dr Bancroft has denominated adjective colours. As in the former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECTION\">section</a>, we shall first give a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and properties of the substances employed in dyeing yellow, and then point out the most approved modes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> their colours to woollen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, cotton, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> stuffs.\n\nThe substances capable of giving a yellow colour to different stuffs are very numerous; they do not all produce similar quantities of colouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>; their dye is not equally free; the colours they impart incline more or less to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a> or green; they possess various degrees of brightness and permanency, and differ considerably in price; circumstances by which the choice of the dyer ought always to be regulated. But those commonly employed in dyeing yellow, are weld, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol9.html#article-FUSTIC\">fustic</a>, anotta, and quercitron bark.\n\nI. Of the Substances employed in dyeing Yellow.\n\n244. Weld (refedla luteola, Lin.) is a plant which grows wild in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, and in different European countries. Its leaves are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, narrow, and of a bright green, but the whole plant is made use of in the dyeing of yellow. There are two kinds of weld, cultivated and wild, the former of which is deemed more valuable than the latter, as it yields a much greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of colouring matter. When this plant is fully ripe, it is pulled, dried, and bound up in bundles for the use of the dyer. The wild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> grows higher and has a stronger stalk than that which is cultivated, by which the one may be readily distinguished from the other.\n\nProperties. 245. A strong decoction of weld is of a brownish yellow colour, and if very much diluted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, the colour inclines to a green. An alkali gives to this decoction a deeper colour, and the precipitate it occasions is not soluble in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol4.html#article-ALKALIES\">alkalies</a>. Most of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a> give it a paler tinge, occasioning a little precipitate which is soluble in alkalies. Alumina has so strong an affinity for the colouring matter of weld, that it can even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> it from sulphuric acid, and the oxide of tin produces a similar effect. The greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of metallic salts throw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> similar precipitates, which vary in their shades of colour according to the metal employed. A solution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> renders the liquor turbid, and a solution of tin yields a copious yellow precipitate, while the liquor long continues turbid, and slightly coloured.\n\n246. Fustic (morus tinctoria, Lin.) is procured from Fustic, a tree of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>, which grows in the West Indies. The wood is yellow, as its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> imports, with orange veins. Ever since the discovery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> it has been used in dyeing, as appears from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> in the Transactions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>, of which Sir William Petty was the author. Its price is moderate, the colour it imparts is permanent, and it readily combines with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a>, which properties give it a claim to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> as a valuable ingredient in dyeing. Before it can be employed as a dye-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STUFF\">stuff</a>, it must be cut into chips and put in a bag, that it may not fix in, and tear the stuff, to which it is to impart its colouring matter.\n\n247. When a decoction of yellow wood or fustic is Properties. made very strong, the colour is of a reddish yellow, and when diluted it is of an orange yellow, which it readily yields to water. It becomes turbid by means of acids, its colour is of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> yellow, and the greenish precipitate may be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-dissolved by alkalies. The sulphates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>, throw down precipitates composed of the colouring matter and the different bases of the salts employed.\n\nIn examining the causes of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIXITY\">fixity</a> of yellow colours, obtained from vegetables, Chaptal discovered that the durability of the pale yellow depended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TANNING\">tanning</a> principle, which is found united with the yellow colouring matter. He obtained by analyzing fustic, 1. A resinous or gummy matter, which can communicate a beautiful yellow colour. 2. An extractive matter, which is also yellow, and affords a beautiful colour. 3. A tanning principle of a pale yellow colour, which becomes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a>, or exposure to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>. This latter diminishes the brilliancy of the two former; but it may be separated by a simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>. Chaptal boiled with the wood some animal substance containing gelatinous matter, such as bits of skin, strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLUE\">glue</a>, &c. The tanning principle was thus precipitated with the gelatinous matter, and the bath held in solution only the colouring matters which yield a bright, full yellow; and by means of this process he procured colours from several vegetables, equally bright with those which are communicated by yellow wood and quercitron bark.\n\n248. Anotta is a species of paste of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> colour, obtained from the berries of the bixa orellana Lin. Ancati, which is a native of America.

Gel. 319.\n\nThe bark of it yields a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of colouring matter, which was first discovered by Dr Bancroft in the year 1784, in whom the use and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of it in dyeing were exclusively vested for a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of years by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a>. To prepare it for use, the epidermis is taken off and pounded in a mill, the result of which process is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of filaments and a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> powder; but as these do not contain equal quantities of colouring matter, it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be proper to employ them in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> proportions.\n\nProperties. Quercitron bark readily imparts its colouring matter to water at 100\u00b0 of Fahrenheit, which is of a yellowish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>, capable of being darkened by alkalies, and brightened by acids. With muriate of tin the precipitate is copious, and of a yellow colour; with sulphate of tin it is a dark olive; and with sulphate of copper it is yellow, but inclining to an olive. Nitro-muriate of tin yields a yellow extremely beautiful, probably owing to the oxide of tin combining with the colouring matter in a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> than some other salts.\n\nOther substances. Besides the substances already mentioned as employed in the dyeing of yellow, we may add <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>-wort to the number (Jerratula tinctoria, Linn.) a plant which yields a colouring matter nearly similar to that of weld, and may of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> be used as a proper substitute. Dyers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROOM\">broom</a> (Genista tinctoria) produces a yellow of very indifferent nature, and is therefore only employed in dyeing stuffs of the coarsest kind. Turmeric (Curcuma longa) is a native production both of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">East</a> and West Indies, and yields a more copious quantity of colouring matter than any other yellow dye-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STUFF\">stuff</a>; but it will probably never be of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> in dyeing yellow, as no mordant has yet been discovered, capable of giving permanency to its colour.\n\nChamomile (Anthemis tinctoria) yields a faint yellow colour, the hue of which is not unpleasing, but is far from being durable, and even mordants are not capable of fixing it. Sulphate of lime, tartar and alum, bid fairest for success.\n\nFenugreek (Trigonella fenugraenum) yields seeds which, when <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, communicate to stuffs a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> yellow of tolerable durability; and the best mordants are found to be alum and muriate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SODA\">soda</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> common salt. American hickory (Juglans <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBA\">alba</a>) is a tree, the bark of which yields a colouring matter in every respect resembling that of the quercus nigra, but in quantity greatly inferior. French berries (Rhamnus infectarius) produce a tolerable yellow colour, but it is by no means permanent. When used in the process of dyeing, they are to be employed in the same manner as weld. According to Scheffer, a fine yellow colour may be imparted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, thread and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, by means of the leaves of the willow; but Bergman informs us that only the leaves of the sweet willow (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALIX\">Salix</a> pentandra) are proper for producing a permanent colour, as a few weeks exposure to the sun extracts that which is produced by the colouring matter from the leaves of the common willow.\n\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SWITZERLAND\">Switzerland</a> and in England, the seeds of purple trefoil are sometimes employed in the art of dyeing, on which Vogler made a number of experiments, in order to ascertain what colours they would produce; and he found that a fine deep yellow was afforded by a bath made of a solution of these seeds with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POTASH\">potash</a>; that sulphuric acid yielded a light yellow, and sulphate of copper or blue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VITRIOL\">vitriol</a>, a yellow inclining to green. M. Dize informs us, that the seeds of trefoil impart to wool a beautiful orange, and to silk a greenish yellow; and that while alumining is necessary in the process of dyeing with the seeds of trefoil, a solution of tin cannot be employed.\n\nII. Of the Processes for Dyeing Wool Yellow.\n\nIn dyeing woollen stuffs with weld, the mordants employed are alum and tartar, and by their means a pure, permanent yellow is obtained. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> is to be conducted in the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>; and according to Hellot, four ounces of alum to one ounce of tartar are to be employed. Other dyers, however, employ half as much tartar as alum. The colour is rendered paler, but more lively, by means of the tartar.\n\nThe bath is prepared by boiling the plant inclosed in a thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> bag, and keeping it from rising of the bath by means of a wooden crofs. Some boil it till it sinks to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the vessel, while others, after it is boiled, take it out, and throw it away. From three to four lbs. of weld, and sometimes less, are allowed for every lb. of stuff; but the quantity must be regulated by the intensity of the shade desired. Some dyers add a small quantity of quicklime and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a>, which are found to promote the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRACTION\">extraction</a> of the colouring matter. These substances at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> heighten the colour, but render it less susceptible of resisting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of acids.\n\nWith other additions, and different management, different shades may be obtained. Thus, lighter shades are produced by dyeing after deeper ones, adding water at each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIPPING\">dipping</a>, and keeping the bath at the boiling temperature. These shades, however, are less lively than when fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a> are employed, with a suitable proportion of weld. The addition of common salt or sulphate of lime to the weld bath communicates a richer and deeper colour. With alum it is paler and more lively, with tartar still paler, and with sulphate of iron the shade inclines to brown. According to Scheffer, by boiling the stuff two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, with one-fourth of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of a solution of tin, and the same proportion of tartar, and then washing and boiling it with an equal weight of weld, a fine yellow is produced; but if the stuff...\nstuff be in the state of cloth, its internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a> is not penetrated. Poerner recommends a similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> as for dyeing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol9.html#article-FUSTIC\">fustic</a>, and by these means the colour is brighter, more permanent, and lighter.\n\n257. Dr Bancroft recommends the quercitron bark as one of the cheapest and best substances for dyeing wool yellow. The following is the simple process which he has proposed for its application. The bark is to be boiled up with about its weight, or one-third more, of alum, in a suitable proportion of water, for about 10 minutes. The stuff previously scoured is then to be immersed in the bath, taking care to give the higher colours first, and afterwards the paler straw colours. By this cheap and expeditious process, colours which are not wanted to be of a full or bright yellow, may be obtained. The colour may be considerably heightened by passing the unrefined stuff a few times through hot water, to which a little clean powdered chalk, in the proportion of about 1/4 lb. for each 100 lbs. of stuff has been previously added. The bark, when used in dyeing, being first reduced to powder, should be tied up in a thin linen bag, and suspended in the liquor, so that it may be occasionally moved through it, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSE\">diffuse</a> the colouring matter more equally.\n\n258. But although the above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> possesses the advantages of cheapness and expedition, and is fully sufficient for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> pale yellows; to obtain fuller and more permanent colours, the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of preparation, by previously applying the alumino-mordant, ought to be preferred. The stuff, therefore, should be boiled for about one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> or one hour and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, with one-sixth, or one-eighth of its weight of alum, dissolved in a proper proportion of water. The stuff is then to be immersed without being rinsed, into the dyeing bath, with clean hot water, and about the same quantity of powdered bark tied up in a bag, as that of the alum employed in the preparation. The stuff is then to be turned as usual through the boiling liquor, until the colour appears to have acquired sufficient intensity. One <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of clean powdered chalk for every 100 lbs. of stuff is then to be mixed with the dyeing bath, and the operation <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for eight or ten minutes longer. This addition of the chalk raises and brightens the colour.\n\n259. Orange Yellow.\u2014To communicate a beautiful orange yellow to woollen stuffs, 10 lbs. of quercitron bark, tied up in a bag, for every 100 lbs. of stuff are to be put into the bath with hot water. At the end of six or eight minutes, an equal weight of muriato-fulphate of tin is to be added, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> stirred for two or three minutes. The cloth, previously scoured, and completely wetted, is then immersed in the dyeing liquor, and briskly turned for a few minutes. By this process the colouring matter fixes on the cloth so quickly and equally, that after the liquor begins to boil, the highest yellow may be produced in less than 15 minutes.\n\n260. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">High</a> shades of yellow, somewhat similar to those obtained from quercitron bark by the above process, are frequently given with young fustic (Chus cotinus, Lin.) and dyers <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>, or nitro-muriate of tin; but this colour is much less beautiful and permanent, while it is more expensive than what is obtained from the bark.\n\n261. Bright <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> Yellow.\u2014This colour is produced by employing 10 pounds of bark for every 100 lbs. of cloth, the bark being first boiled a few minutes, and then adding seven or eight lbs. of muriato-fulphate of tin, with about five pounds of alum. The cloth is to be dyed in the same manner as in the process for the orange yellow.\n\n262. Bright yellows of less body are produced by employing a smaller proportion of bark, as well as by diminishing the quantity of muriato-fulphate of tin and alum. And indeed every variety of shade of pure bright yellow may be given by varying the proportions of the ingredients.\n\n263. To produce the lively delicate green shade, which, for certain purposes, is greatly admired, the addition of tartar, with the other ingredients, only is necessary, and the tartar must be added in different proportions, according to the shade which is wanted. For a full bright yellow, delicately inclining to the greenish tinge, it will be proper to employ eight pounds of bark, six of muriato-fulphate of tin, with six of alum, and four of tartar. An additional proportion of alum and tartar renders the yellow more delicate, and inclines it more to the green shade; but when this lively green shade is wanted in the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>, the ingredients must be used in equal proportions. The delicate green lemon yellows are seldom required to have much fulness or body. Ten pounds of bark, therefore, with an equal quantity of the other ingredients, are sufficient to dye three or four hundred pounds of stuffs.\n\n264. To produce the exquisitely delicate and beautiful pale green shades, the surest method, Dr Bancroft observes, is to boil the bark with a small proportion of green yellow water, in a separate tin vessel for six or eight minutes, and then to add the muriato-fulphate of tin, alum, and tartar, and to boil them together for about fifteen minutes. A small quantity of this yellow liquor is then to be put into a dyeing vessel, which has been previously supplied with water sufficiently heated. The mixture being properly stirred, the dyeing process is to be conducted in the usual way, and the yellow liquor, as it is wanted, gradually added from the first vessel. In this way, the most delicate shades of lively green lemon yellows are dyed with ease and certainty. Weld is the only dye-stuff from which similar shades of colour can be obtained; but it is four times more expensive. The yellows dyed from quercitron bark, Dr Bancroft adds, with muriato-fulphate of tin and alum as mordants, do not exceed the expense of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENNY\">penny</a> for each pound of stuff; besides a considerable saving of time, labour, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a>.\n\n265. A greenish shade may also be produced without tartar, by substituting verdigris dissolved in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a>, along with the bark; but it is neither so permanent, nor so bright and delicate, as that produced by means of tartar. Sulphate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a> also, in very small proportion, communicates a similar shade, when it is employed with the bark, muriato-fulphate of tin, and alum; but it is apt to take unequally on the stuff, and besides, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of the dyers, the colour has a tendency to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> or fly in the finishing.\n\n266. Small proportions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COCHINEAL\">cochineal</a> employed along with the bark and other ingredients, raise the colour to a madder a beautiful orange, and even to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AURORA\">aurora</a>. Madder employed may be also employed with the same view, for it heightens the yellow obtained from quercitron bark, although...\nChap. I.","sp":36,"ep":39},{"h":"DYEING","t":"Of Simple Colours.\n\nAlthough the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> thus obtained is inferior in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> to that from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COCHINEAL\">cochineal</a>. The madder may also be employed with weld for the same purpose.\n\n267. The colours obtained from quercitron bark, by the processes which we have now described, are very durable. They resist the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>, citron bark and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>. It is by the effects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>, but especially of tartar, that these colours become fixed as to remain permanent by exposure to the air. It is observed of the highest yellows, even when they approach to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a>, and which are best dyed, either with muriate, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> muriato-fulphate of tin and bark, that although they resist the action of soap and acids, they are apt to lose their lustre and become <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> by the effect of the sun and air; but this also happens to yellows dyed with nitro-muriate of tin, both with the bark and with weld, but in a still greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> with other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> vegetable colouring matters. In some of these this defect is less easily obviated by alum and tartar, than it is in the yellow obtained from weld and quercitron bark.\n\nIII. Of the Processes for Dyeing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">Silk</a> Yellow.\n\nWith weld.\n\n268. To dye silk a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> yellow colour, the only ingredient which was formerly employed is weld. The following is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>. The silk being previously scoured in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of 20 lbs. of soap to the 100 of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STUFF\">stuff</a>, and then alumed and washed after the aluming, or as it is called, refreshed, the bath is prepared with two pounds of weld for every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of silk; and, having boiled for 15 minutes, it is to be passed into a vat through a sieve or cloth. When the temperature is such as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> can bear, the silk is introduced, and turned, until it has acquired a uniform colour. While this operation is going <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a>, the weld is to be boiled a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> in fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>; one half of the first bath is taken out, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> supplied with a fresh decoction. The temperature of the fresh bath may be a little higher than the former, but it is necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> against too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> a degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, that the colouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> already fixed may not be dissolved. The stuff is to be turned as before, and afterwards taken out of the bath. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SODA\">soda</a> is to be dissolved in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the second decoction, and a larger or smaller proportion of this solution is to be added to the bath, according to the intensity of the shade required. When the silk has been turned a few times, it is again rung out, that it may be examined whether the colour be sufficiently full, and have the proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> shade. To render the colour deeper, and to give it the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>, an addition of the alkaline solution is to be made to the bath, and to be repeated till the shade has acquired sufficient intensity. The alkaline solution may also be added along with the second decoction of the weld, observing the precaution, that the temperature of the bath be never too great.\n\n269. To produce other shades of yellow, having more of a gold or jonquille colour, a quantity of anotta, proportioned to the shade required, is to be added to the bath, along with the alkali. Lighter shades of yellow, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> lemon, or Canary-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> colour, are obtained, by previously whitening the silk, and regulating the proportion of ingredients in the bath by the shade required. To communicate a yellow having a tinge of green, a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a> is added to the bath, if the silk has not been previously azured. To prevent the intensity of the shade from being too great, the silk may be more slightly alumed than usual.\n\n270. But, according to Dr Bancroft, the different shades of yellow obtained from weld, may be given to silk with equal facility and beauty, and at a cheaper rate, by employing quercitron bark as a substitute. A quantity of bark powdered and inclosed in a bag, in proportion to the shade of colour wanted, as from one to two pounds for every twelve pounds of silk, is put into the dyeing vat while the water is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>. Heat is then applied; and when it has become rather more than blood warm, or of the temperature of 100\u00b0, the silk having previously undergone the aluming process, is to be immersed and dyed in the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>. If a deep shade is wanted, a small quantity of chalk or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEARL\">pearl</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a> may be added towards the end of the operation. To produce a more lively yellow, a small proportion of muriato-fulphate of tin may be employed; but it should be cautiously used, as it is apt to diminish the lustre of the silk. To produce such a shade, the proportions of the ingredients may be four pounds of bark, three of alum, and two of muriato-fulphate of tin. These are to be boiled with a proper quantity of water for ten or fifteen minutes; and the temperature of the liquid being so much reduced as the hand can bear it, the silk is immersed and dyed as usual, till it has acquired the proper colour. Care should be taken to keep the liquor constantly agitated, that the colouring matter may be equally diffused.\n\n271. To dye silk of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AURORA\">aurora</a> or orange colour, after being properly scoured, it may be immersed in an alkaline solution of anotta, the strength of which is to be regulated by the shade required; and the temperature of the bath should be between tepid and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> water. When the desired shade has been obtained, the silks are to be washed and twice beetleed, to free them from the superfluous colouring matter, which would injure the beauty of the colour. When raw silk is to be dyed, that which is naturally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> should be selected, and the bath should be nearly cold; for otherwise the alkali, by dissolving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> of the silk, destroys its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>. Silk is dyed of an orange shade with anotta, but the stuff must be reddened with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a>, alum, or lemon juice. The acid, by saturating the alkali employed to dissolve the anotta, destroys the yellow shade produced by the alkali, and restores its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> colour, which inclines to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>. But although beautiful colours are obtained by this process, they do not possess any great degree of permanency.\n\n272. Several kinds of mushrooms afford lively and durable yellow dyes. A bright shining dye of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> has been extracted from the boletus luridus, which commonly grows on walnut and apple trees. The colouring matter is contained both in the tubular part, and also in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PARENCHYMA\">parenchyma</a> of the body of the mushroom. To extract the colouring matter, it is pounded in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a>, and the liquor which is thus obtained, is boiled for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> in water. An ounce of liquor is sufficient to communicate colouring matter to fix pounds of water. After the liquor has been strained, the stuff to be dyed is immersed in it, and boiled for fifteen minutes. When silk is subjected to this process, after being dyed, it is made to pass through a bath of soft soap, by which it acquires a shining appearance.","sp":39,"ep":39},{"h":"DYEING","t":"Of Simple Colours.\n\ning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, which has a near resemblance to the yellow of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> employed to imitate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMBROIDERY\">embroidery</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>.

The use of mordants, it is supposed, would modify and improve it greatly.\n\nIV. Of the Processes for Dyeing Cotton and Linen Yellow.\n\n273. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> which has been usually followed in dyeing cotton and linen yellow, is by scouring it in a bath prepared in a ley with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a> of green wood. It is afterwards washed, dried, and alumed, with one-fourth of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>. After 24 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, it is taken out of the aluming, and dried, but without being washed. The cotton is then dyed in a weld bath, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of weld for each pound of cotton, and turned in the bath till it has acquired the proper colour. After being taken out of the bath, it is soaked for an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> and a half in a solution of blue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VITRIOL\">vitriol</a> (fulphate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>), in the proportion of one-fourth of the weight of the cotton, and then immersed, without washing, for nearly an hour, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> solution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>, after which it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> washed and dried.\n\n274. A deeper yellow is communicated to cotton, by omitting the process of aluming, and employing two pounds and a half of weld for each pound of cotton. To this is added a dram of verdigrise, mixed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the bath. The cotton is then to be dipped and worked till the colour become uniform. It is then taken out of the bath, that a little solution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SODA\">soda</a> may be added, after which it is returned, and kept for fifteen minutes. It is then wrung out and dried.\n\n275. Other shades of yellow may be obtained, by varying the proportion of ingredients. Thus, a lemon colour is dyed by using only one pound of weld for every pound of cotton, and by diminishing the proportion of verdigrise, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> using alum as a substitute.\n\n276. But a better method, as it affords more permanent and more beautiful colours, and at a smaller expense, is recommended by Dr Bancroft. This is by the use of quercitron bark, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALICO\">calico</a> printers' aluminous mordant, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>. The following is the process which he proposes to employ, for producing bright and durable yellow colours. One pound of sugar of lead, and three pounds of alum, are to be dissolved in a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of warm <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. The cotton or linen, after being properly rinsed, is to be soaked in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a>, heated to the temperature of 100\u00b0, for two hours. It is then taken out, moderately pressed over a vessel, to prevent the waste of the aluminous liquor. It is then dried in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOVE\">stove</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, and after being again soaked in the aluminous solution, it is wrung out and dried a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. Without being rinsed, it is to be barely wetted with lime water, and afterwards dried, and if a full, bright, and durable yellow is wanted, it may be necessary to soak the stuff in the diluted aluminous mordant, and after drying, to wet it a second time with lime water. After it has been soaked for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> time, it should be well rinsed in clean water, to separate the loose particles of the mordant, which might injure the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of the colouring <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>. By the use of the lime water, a greater proportion of alumina combines with the stuff, besides the addition of a certain portion of lime.\n\n277. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of the dyeing bath, from 12 lbs. of powdered quercitron bark are inclosed in a bath bag, for every 100 lbs. of the stuff, varying the proportion according to the intensity of the shade desired. The bark is put into the water while it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>; and immediately after the stuff is immersed and agitated or turned for an hour, or an hour and a half, during which the water should be gradually heated, and the temperature raised to about 120\u00b0. At the end of this time the heat is increased, and the dyeing liquor brought to a boiling temperature; but at this temperature the stuff must remain in it only for a few minutes, because otherwise the yellow assumes a brownish shade. The stuff having thus acquired a sufficient colour, is taken out, rinsed and dried.\n\n278. Dr Bancroft observes, that when the alumino-mordant is employed, without the addition of water, or a diluted tere, one soaking only, and an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMERSION\">immersion</a> in lime water, may be sufficient; but he thinks that greater advantage is derived from the application of a more diluted mordant at two different times, or even by the immersion of the stuff a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of times, alternately in the diluted aluminous mordant, and lime water, and drying it after each immersion. By this treatment he found, that the colour always acquired more body and durability.\n\n279. Chaptal has proposed a process for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> to cotton a nankeen yellow, which at the same time that it affords a durable colour, has the advantage of being cheap and simple. When cotton is immersed in a solution of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, it has so strong an affinity for the oxide, that it decomposes the salt, combines with the iron, and assumes a yellow colour. The process recommended by Chaptal is the following. The cotton to be dyed is put into a cold solution of copperas (fulphate of iron) of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIFIC\">specific</a> gravity 1.02. It is afterwards wrung out, and immediately immersed in a ley of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POTASH\">potash</a> of the specific gravity 1.01. This ley must have been previously saturated with a solution of alum. When the stuff has been kept for four or five hours in this bath, it may be taken out, washed and dried. By varying the proportion of fulphate of iron, every variety of shade of nankeen yellow may be obtained.\n\n280. We shall lay before our readers another process for dyeing nankeen colour, which is proposed and followed by Mr Brewer, a practical dyer. It is as follows.\n\n\"Mix as much sheep's dung in clear water as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> make it appear of the colour of grass; and dissolve in clear water one pound of best white soap for every ten pounds of cotton <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YARN\">yarn</a>, or in that proportion for a greater or lesser quantity.\n\n\"Observe.\u2014The tubs, boards, and poles, that are used in the following preparations must be made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a>; the boiling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAN\">pan</a> of either iron or copper.\n\nFirst Operation.\u2014Pour the soap liquor prepared as above into the boiling pan; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRAIN\">strain</a> the dung liquor through a sieve; add as much thereof to the soap liquor in the pan as will be sufficient to boil the yarn, intended to be dyed, for five hours.

A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of dyeing cotton and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> a durable yellow colour is practised in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of Proceeds following this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, which is tedious, is to increase the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> between the alumina and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STUFF\">stuff</a>, so that it may adhere with sufficient force to produce a permanent colour. For this purpose three mordants are employed: these are oil, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TAN\">tan</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a>. The cotton is soaked in a bath of oil, mixed with a weak solution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SODA\">soda</a>. Animal oil, as it is found to answer best, is preferred. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLUE\">Glue</a> has also been tried, and is found to answer very well. The soda must be in the caustic state, for in that state it combines with the oil, and produces on the cloth an equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a>. The stuff is then to be washed, and afterwards put into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFUSION\">infusion</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol15.html#article-NUT\">nut</a> galls of the white kind, and the infusion should be used hot. The tan combines with the oil, while the gallic acid carries off any portion of alkali which may adhere to the cloth. When the stuff is removed from the bath, it should be quickly dried; and too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of galls beyond a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> with the oil should be avoided, as it is apt to darken the shade of colour. After this preparation the stuff is to be immersed in a solution of alum; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the affinity which exists between tan and alumina, the alum is decomposed, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> combines with the tan. After these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> steps, the cotton is to be dyed with quercitron bark, according to the process which has been already described.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. III.\n\n(m) Iron liquor is what the linen printers use.\nSect. III. Of Blue.\n\n282. The next of the simple colours is blue. We shall first treat of the substances which are employed in dyeing blue, and then describe the processes which are followed in fixing this colour.\n\nI. Of the Substances which are employed in Dyeing Blue.\n\nThe only substances which are used in dyeing blue, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a> and woad.\n\n283. Indigo was not used for the purpose of dyeing in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a> till near the middle of the 16th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>. A substance is mentioned by Pliny*, which was brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>, and termed indicum, which seems to have been the same as the indigo of the moderns; but it does not appear that either the Greeks or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> knew how to dissolve indigo, or its use in dyeing, although it was applied as a paint. It was, however, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before known as a dye in India. The first indigo which was employed for the purpose of dyeing by Europeans, was brought by the Dutch from India. One of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of the plant from which it is obtained, was discovered by the Portuguese in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRAZIL\">Brazil</a>, where it grows spontaneously, as well as in other parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>. Being afterwards successfully cultivated in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEXICO\">Mexico</a>, and some islands of the West Indies, the whole of the indigo employed in Europe was supplied from these countries. The indigo from the East Indies has, however, of late recovered its character, and is imported into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a> in considerable quantities.\n\nThere are three species of the indigo plant, which are usually cultivated in America. The first is the indigofera tinctoria, Linn. which besides being a smaller and less hardy plant, is inferior to the others on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of its pulp, but as it yields a greater proportion, it is generally preferred. The second is the indigofera difformis, Linn. or Guatemala indigo plant. This is a taller and hardier plant, and affords a pulp of a superior <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> to the former. The third is the indigofera argentea, Linn. which is the hardiest of the three species; yields a pulp of the finest quality, though in smallest proportion.\n\n285. When the indigo plant has arrived at maturity, it is cut a few inches above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, chopped in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a> in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> vessel or steamer, and being kept down with boards, is covered with water; and in this state it is left to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENT\">ferment</a> till the pulp is extracted. The process commences by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EVOLUTION\">evolution</a> of heat, and the emission of a great quantity of carbonic acid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAS\">gas</a>. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENTATION\">fermentation</a> has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> for a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of time, which is known by the tops becoming tender and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PALE\">pale</a>, the liquor, which is now of a green colour, is drawn off into large flat vessels, called beaters, where it is agitated with buckets or other convenient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a>, till blue floccules begin to appear. To promote this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRANULATION\">granulation</a> or separation of the floccules it is usual to add clear lime water till the liquor in which they are suspended become quite colourless. The liquor being sufficiently impregnated with the lime water, is left at rest to allow the particles of the colouring matter to precipitate; after which the supernatant liquor is drawn off, and the sediment collected into linen bags, which are suspended for some time to let the water drain off. It is then put into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> boxes, or formed into lumps and dried in the shade. The indigo thus prepared is in a state fit for the market.\n\n286. The indigo which is produced in this operation differs greatly, not only according to the quality of the plant from which it is obtained, but according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of preparation. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of quality seems to depend entirely on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a> substances with which it is mixed, and on the degree of consistence which it has acquired in drying. The lightest kind which is brought from Guatemala, is called light indigo; it is of a fine blue colour, and is the most valuable, because it is of the finest quality. Indigo exhibits various shades of colour, which is also owing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of foreign substances. The most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> shades are blue, violet, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> colour.\n\n287. Other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> have also been discovered, which is obtained by a process somewhat similar, afford indigo, and in particular the nerium tinctorium, or rose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>, an ac. plants. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> of which, with the method of manufacturing indigo from its leaves, has been given by Dr Roxburgh. This tree grows in great abundance in different parts of the East Indies; and plantations of it, raised from seeds, have succeeded well in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENGAL\">Bengal</a>. The leaves of the nerium afford indigo, not only when they are fresh gathered, but also when they are nearly dried; but they yield the best indigo after being kept a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> or two. The leaves collected the preceding day are put into a copper, so as nearly to fill it without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PRESSING\">pressing</a>. The copper is filled with water till within three inches of the top; and hard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> water, which increases the quantity of indigo, and improves its quality, is preferred. The fire is then applied, and kept up, till the liquid becomes of a green colour in the vessel. The leaves then become of a yellowish colour, and the heat of the liquor about 150\u00b0, or 160\u00b0. The leaves should be constantly agitated, that they may be equally heated, as well as to promote the operation, by the expulsion of the carbonic acid gas. When the process exhibits the above appearances, the liquor is to be drawn off, passed through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>-cloth, and agitated while hot, in the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, till granulation takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, or the appearance of blue floccules is observed. About \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of strong lime water is then added, to promote the precipitation of the indigo, and the remaining part of the process is similar to that described above, for the manufacture of indigo from indigofera\u2020.\n\n288. The object of the processes which are followed in the manufacture of indigo, is to extract from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of plants which yield it, a green substance, which is soluble in water. This substance, which has a strong affinity for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a>, gradually attracts it from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, becoming of a blue colour, and is then insoluble in water. This absorption is greatly promoted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a>, for then a greater surface is exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the air; and the lime water, by combining with carbonic acid, which exists in the green matter, also promotes the separation of the indigo.\n\n289. Indigo is insoluble in water, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALCOHOL\">alcohol</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a>, and oils, and the only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a> which produce any effect of indigo upon it, are the sulphuric and nitric. By the latter it is soon changed to a dirty white colour, and is at last entirely decomposed. When the acid is concentrated, the indigo is inflamed; but when it is diluted, the indigo becomes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CRYSTALS\">crystals</a> like those of oxalic and...\nOf Simple and tartarous acids make their appearance; and when the acid and crystals are washed off, there remains behind a kind of resinous matter. Sulphuric acid in the concentrated state dissolves indigo, with the evolution of a great deal of heat. The solution is opaque and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, but when diluted with water, it changes to a deep blue colour. Dr Bancroft has denominated this solution sulphate of indigo, which has been long known by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of liquid blue. The fixed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol4.html#article-ALKALIES\">alkalies</a> in the state of carbonate precipitate slowly from sulphate of indigo, a blue coloured powder, which has the properties of indigo, but is found to be soluble in most of the acids and alkalies. Pure alkalies destroy the colour of sulphate of indigo, as well as that which is precipitated.\n\n292. Indigo is employed in dyeing, both in the state of liquid blue, or sulphate of indigo, from which is obtained the beautiful colour called Saxon blue; and also in the state of simple indigo, or the indigo of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>. In dyeing with indigo, it must be reduced to the state of the green matter as it exists in the plants, or when it is first extracted from them. It must be deprived of the oxygen, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of which the blue colour is owing. In this state it becomes soluble in water by means of the alkalies. To effect this separation of the oxygen, the indigo must be mixed with a solution of some substance which has a stronger affinity for oxygen than the green matter of indigo. Such substances are green oxide of iron and metallic sulphurates. Lime, green sulphate of iron, and indigo, are mixed together in water, and during this mixture the indigo is deprived of its blue colour, becomes green, and is dissolved, while the green oxide of iron is converted into the red oxide. In this process, part of the lime decomposes the sulphate of iron, and as the green oxide is set at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, it attracts oxygen from the indigo, and reduces it to the state of green matter, which is immediately dissolved by the action of the rest of the lime. Indigo is also deprived of its oxygen, and prepared for dyeing, by another process. Some vegetable matter is added to the indigo mixed with water, with the view of exciting fermentation; and quicklime or an alkali is added to the solution, that the indigo, as it is converted into the green matter, may be dissolved.\n\n291. Another plant, known under the name of pastel or woad, (Isatis tinctoria), is employed for dyeing blue. Another species (Isatis baltica), which is a smaller plant, is also employed in dyeing. The Isatis tinctoria is cultivated in France and in England. When the plant has reached maturity, it is cut down, washed in a river, and speedily dried in the sun. It is then ground in a mill, and reduced to a paste, which is formed into heaps, covered up to protect them from the rain, and at the end of a fortnight the heap is opened, to mix the whole well together. It is afterwards formed into round balls, which are exposed to the wind and sun, that the moisture may be separated. The balls are heaped upon one another, become gradually hot, and exhale the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol2.html#article-AMMONIA\">ammonia</a>. To promote the fermentation, which is stronger in proportion to the quantity heaped up, and the temperature of the season, the heap is to be sprinkled with water till it falls down in the state of coarse powder, in which state it appears in commerce. The blue colour obtained from woad is very permanent, but has little lustre. But its colour is not only inferior in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> to that obtained from indigo; it affords also a smaller proportion of colouring matter, so that since the discovery of indigo, the use of woad has diminished.\n\nII. Of the Processes for Dyeing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">Wool</a> Blue.\n\n292. The preparation for dyeing blue is made in a large wooden vessel or vat, which should be so constructed as to retain the heat, which is a matter of considerable importance in the process. The vat is therefore set up in a separate place from the coppers, and is sunk so far in the ground as to be only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> above it. Before the introduction of indigo, blue was dyed with woad, which affords a permanent, but not a deep colour; but a very rich blue is obtained by mixing indigo with the woad, and these are almost the only substances which are now employed for dyeing woollen stuffs. The proportions of these substances are varied by different dyers, and according to the shade which is required. The following is the account of the preparation of a vat, as it is given by Quatremere. Into a vat of about seven and a half feet deep, and five and a half in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, are thrown two balls of pastel or woad, which are previously broken, and together amount to about 400 pounds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>; 30 pounds of weld are boiled in a copper for three hours, in a sufficient quantity of water, to fill the vat. To this decoction are added 20 pounds of madder, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BASKET\">basket</a> full of bran. The boiling is then continued half an hour longer. This bath is cooled with 20 buckets of water, and after it is settled, and the weld taken out, it is poured into the vat, which must be stirred with a rake all the time that it is running in, and for 15 minutes longer. The vat is then covered up very hot, and allowed to stand for six hours, when it is uncovered, and raked again for 30 minutes. The same operation must be repeated every three hours. When the appearance of blue streaks is perceived on the surface of the vat, eight or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> pounds of quicklime are added; the colour then becomes of a deeper blue, and the vat exhales more pungent vapours. Immediately after the lime, or along with it, the indigo, which has been previously ground in a mill, with the smallest possible quantity of water, is put into the vat. The quantity is to be regulated by the intensity of the shade required. From ten to thirty pounds may be put into a vat such as we have now described. If on striking the vat with the rake, a fine blue fume arises, no other previous preparation is required than to stir it with the rake twice in the space of six hours, to mix the ingredients completely. Great care should be taken not to expose the vat to the air, except during the time of stirring it. When that operation is finished, it is covered with a wooden lid, on which are spread thick cloths, to retain the heat as much as possible; but after all these precautions, at the end of eight or ten days it is greatly diminished, and is at last entirely dissipated, so that the liquor must be again heated, by pouring the greater part of the liquor of the vat into a copper under which a large fire is made. When the liquor has acquired a sufficient temperature, it is returned into the vat, and carefully covered up.\n\n293. Vats of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> are sometimes liable to accidents. A vat is said to be repelled, when having to which previously afforded fine shades of blue, it appears liable to black.\nOf Simple Black, without any blue streaks; and if it be flirred, the black colour becomes deeper; the vat at the same time exhales, instead of a sweetish smell, a pungent odour; and the stuff dyed in a vat in this state, comes out of a dirty gray colour. These effects are ascribed to an excess of lime.\n\n294. Different means are employed to recover a repelled vat. Some are satisfied with merely reheating it; while others add tartar, bran, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-URINE\">urine</a>, or madder. Hellot recommends bran and madder as the best remedy. If the excess of lime be not very great, it is sufficient to leave it at rest five or six hours, putting in a quantity of bran and three or four pounds of madder, which are to be sprinkled on the surface, and then it is to be covered up, and after a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, to be tried again. But if the vat has been so far repelled as to afford a blue only when it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, it must be left at rest to recover, and sometimes must remain whole days without being flirred with the rake. When it begins to afford a tolerable pattern, the bath must be reheated. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, this revives the fermentation. The addition of bran or madder, or a balkef or two of fresh wood, produces the same effect.\n\n295. This vat sometimes runs into the putrefactive process. When this happens, the colour of the vat becomes reddish, the paste rises from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>, and a fetid smell is exhaled. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a> is owing to a deficiency of lime, and it must be corrected by adding a fresh quantity. The vat is then to be raked; after two hours more lime is added, and the process of raking again performed. These operations are to be repeated till the vat is recovered.\n\n296. Nothing requires more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> in treating a vat of this kind, than the dilution of the lime, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> use of which is to moderate the tendency to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a>, and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> the fermentation to that degree which is necessary to deprive the indigo of its oxygen. If too much lime be added, the necessary fermentation is retarded, and if there be too little, the putrefactive process commences.\n\n297. Two hours previous to the dyeing operation, the vat should be raked; and to prevent the stuff coming in contact with the sediment, which would produce inequalities in the colour, a crofs of wood is introduced. The stuff is then to be completely wetted with pure water a little heated; and being wrung out, it is dipped into the vat, where it is moved about for a longer or shorter time, according to the depth of shade required. During this operation it is taken out occasionally, to be exposed to the air, the action of which is necessary to change the green colour of the bath into a blue. Stuffs dyed blue in this manner must be carefully washed, to carry off the loose particles of colouring matter; and when the shade of blue is deep, they ought even to be cleansed, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FULLING\">fulling</a> with soap. This operation does not alter the colour.\n\n298. When a vat is prepared entirely of indigo, without pastel or woad, it is called an indigo vat. The vessel employed for this purpose is of copper, into which water is poured, according to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a>, to the amount of 40 buckets, in which have been boiled six pounds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POTASH\">potash</a>, twelve ounces of madder, and six pounds of bran. Six pounds of indigo ground in water are then put in, and after it has been carefully raked, the vat is to be covered. A slow fire is to be kept up, and twelve hours after it is filled, it is to be raked a second time. This operation is to be repeated every twelve hours, till it come to a blue colour, which will generally be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> in about 48 hours. If the bath is properly managed, it will be of a fine green, exhibiting on the surface coppery scales, and a blue scum or flower. In this vat the indigo is rendered soluble in water, by means of the alkali instead of lime. The dyeing operation is to be conducted in the same manner as the preceding.\n\n299. Two vats have been described by Hellot, in Hellot's which the indigo is dissolved by means of urine. Madder is added to it, and in the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VINEGAR\">vinegar</a>, in the other alum and tartar, of each a quantity equal in weight to that of the indigo. The proportion of urine must be considerable. In considering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of this process, it seems probable that the indigo, deprived of its oxygen by the urine and madder during the fermentation, is dissolved by the ammonia which is formed in the urine. When the solution of alum and tartar is added, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EFFERVESCENCE\">effervescence</a>, which Hellot observed, is produced. This, it is probable, has a tendency to retard or stop the putrefaction. But in vats of this description, operations on a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> cannot be carried on; they seem only adapted for small dye-houses.\n\nIII. Of the Processes for Dyeing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">Silk</a> Blue.\n\n300. Silk is dyed blue with indigo alone, without any proportion of woad. The proportion of indigo mentioned in the preparation of the indigo vat, and sometimes a larger proportion, is employed, with six pounds of bran, and about twelve ounces of madder. According to Macquer, half a pound of madder for each pound of potash, renders the vat greener, and produces a more fixed colour in the silk. When the vat is come to, it should be refreshed with two pounds of potash, and three or four ounces of madder; and after being raked in the course of four hours, it is fit for dyeing. The temperature should be moderated, that the hand may be held in it without uneasiness.\n\n301. The silk, after being boiled with soap, in the proportion of 30 pounds of soap to 100 of silk, and of the silk well cleaned by repeated beatings in a stream of water, must be dyed in small portions, because it is apt to take on an uneven colour. When it has been turned once or oftener in the bath, it is wrung out, and exposed to the air, that the green colour may change to a blue. When the change is complete, it is thrown into clear water, and afterwards wrung out. Silk dyed blue should be speedily dried. In damp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> and in winter, it is necessary to conduct the drying in a chamber heated by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOVE\">stove</a>. The silk should be hung on a frame kept constantly in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. To dye light shades, some dyers employ vats that are somewhat exhausted; but it ought to be observed, that the colour thus obtained is less beautiful and less permanent than when fresh vats, containing a smaller quantity of indigo, are employed.\n\n302. Some addition is required to be made to the indigo, to give silk a deep blue. A previous preparation is necessary, by giving it another colour or ground. For the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a> blue, which is the deepest, a strong bath of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIL\">archil</a> is first prepared. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COCHINEAL\">Cochineal</a> is also sometimes used, instead of archil, for the ground, to render the colour more permanent. A blue is given to silk\nOf Simple silk by means of verdigris and logwood, but it possesses little durability. It might be rendered more permanent, by giving it a lighter shade in this bath, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIPPING\">dipping</a> it in a bath of archil, and finally in the indigo vat.\n\nDyeing raw silk. 303. When raw silk is to be dyed blue, such as is naturally white should be selected. Being previously soaked in water, it is put into the bath in separate hanks, as already directed for scoured silks; and as raw silk is found to combine more readily with the colouring matter, the scoured silk, when it can be conveniently done, should be first put into the bath. If archil, or any of the other ingredients which have been already mentioned, are required, to give more intensity to the colour, the mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> is the same as that directed for scoured silk.\n\nIV. Of the Processes for Dyeing Cotton and Linen Blue.\n\nPreparation. 304. For dyeing cotton and linen blue, Pileur of the vat. d\u2019Aphigny recommends a vat containing about 120 gallons. From six to eight pounds of indigo reduced to powder, are boiled in a ley drawn off from a quantity of lime, equal in weight to the indigo, and a quantity of potash double its weight. During the boiling, which is to be continued till the indigo is completely penetrated with the ley, the solution must be constantly stirred, to prevent the indigo from being injured, by adhering to the bottom of the vessel.\n\n305. During this process, another quantity of quicklime, equal in weight to the indigo, is to be flaked. Twenty quarts of warm water are added, in which is to be dissolved a quantity of copperas (sulphate of iron) equal to twice the weight of the lime. The solution being completed, it is poured into the vat, which is previously half filled with water. To this the solution of indigo is added, with that part of the ley which was not employed in the boiling. The vat must now be filled up to within two or three inches of the top. It must be raked twice or thrice a day till it is completely prepared, which is generally the case in 48 hours, and sometimes sooner, as it depends on the temperature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. A small proportion of bran, madder, and woad, is recommended by some, to be added to such a vat as we have now described.\n\n306. The process which is followed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROUEN\">Rouen</a>, and described by Quatremere, is simpler. The vats, which are constructed of a kind of flint, are coated within and without with fine cement, and are arranged in one or more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> lines. Each vat contains four hogsheads of water. The indigo, to the amount of 18 or 20 pounds, being macerated for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> in a cauldron, strong enough to bear an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a>, is ground in a mill; three hogsheads and a half of water are put into the vat, and afterwards 20 pounds of lime. The lime being thoroughly flaked, the vat is raked, and 36 pounds of copperas are added; and when the solution is complete, the ground indigo is poured in through a sieve. It is raked seven or eight times the same day, and after being left at rest for 36 hours, it is in a state fit for dyeing.\n\nProcess on a larger scale. 307. In extensive manufactories, it is necessary to have vats set at different times. In conducing the processes of dyeing, the stuffs are first dipped in the most exhausted vat, and then regularly proceeding from the weakest to the strongest, if they have not previously attained the desired shade. The stuffs should remain in the bath only about five or six minutes, for in that time they combine with all the colouring matter they can take up. After the stuffs have been dipped in a vat, it should not be used again, till it has been raked, and stood at least 24 hours, unless it has been lately set, when a shorter period is sufficient.\n\n308. After the stuffs have been dipped three or four times in a vat, it begins to change. It becomes black, and no blue or copper-coloured streaks are seen on the surface after raking it. It must then be renewed, by adding four lbs. of copperas, with two of quicklime, after which it must be raked twice. In this way, a vat may be renewed three or four times; but the additional quantity of ingredients must be diminished, as the strength of the vat is exhausted.\n\n309. A vat which is still more simple, and more easily prepared, has been recommended by Bergman. The proportion of the ingredients which he has directed to be employed, is the following. To three drachms of indigo reduced to powder, three drachms of copperas, and three of lime, add two pints of water. Let it be well raked, and in the course of a few hours it will be in a proper state for dyeing.\n\n310. Hauffman employs still a smaller proportion of Hauffman\u2019s indigo. For 3000 lbs. of water he takes 36 lbs. of quicklime flaked in 200 lbs. of water, with which the indigo in the proportion of from 10 to 20 lbs. wellground, is to be mixed. He then dissolves 30 lbs. of copperas in 120 lbs. of hot water. The whole being left at rest for fifteen minutes, the vat is filled, and gently and constantly stirred. When a deeper shade is wanted, and particularly when linen is to be dyed, the proportion of indigo should be greater; but the shade depends very much on the time the stuffs remain in the vat, and the times it has been used. When the vat becomes turbid, the process of dyeing must be interrupted, till it has been again raked, and the supernatant liquor become transparent. If the effects of the lime fail, a new quantity fresh flaked, must be added; and if the iron cease to produce the effect on the indigo, a new portion must be also added, observing the precaution to have a greater quantity of lime than what is necessary to saturate the sulphuric acid. When the indigo seems to be exhausted, fresh portions ground in water are also to be added; the vat is to be raked several times, and allowed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a>, after which it is again fit for use. In this way Mr Hauffman informs us he preferred a vat for the space of two years; and had it not been for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a> of sediment, which prevented the stuffs from being immersed to a sufficient depth, it might have been continued in use for a much longer time. It is worth while to add, that Mr Hauffman found, that a pattern of cloth dipped in water, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACIDULATED\">acidulated</a> with sulphuric acid, immediately after it was taken out of the bath, became of a much deeper blue than a similar pattern exposed to the air, or another dipped in river water.\n\n311. Another convenient and expedient vat is mentioned by Bergman, and described by Scheffer. Indigo reduced to fine powder, in the proportion of three drachms to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUART\">quart</a>, is added to the strong ley of the soap-boiler. After a few minutes, when the colouring matter is well penetrated by the ley, fix drachms of powdered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORPIMENT\">orpiment</a> are to be added. In a few minutes after the bath has been well raked, it becomes green,\nOf simple and the blue streaks appear on the surface. Heat is to be applied; when the operation of dyeing may commence.\n\n312. The preparation employed for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> cottons is similar to the above bath, excepting in the proportions of orpiment and indigo, which are greater in the former; but these proportions are very different in different manufactories.\n\n313. Saxon Blue.\u2014The colour which is obtained by dyeing with a solution of indigo in sulphuric acid is known under the name of Saxon blue, because the process was first carried on at Gro\u00dfenhain in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAXONY\">Saxony</a>, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNSELLOR\">Counsellor</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARTH\">Barth</a>, who made the discovery about the year 1740. This discovery was for some time kept secret, and the method seems to have been originally very complicated. Alumina, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a>, and some other substances, were previously added to the sulphuric acid. These, however, are now omitted, and the indigo alone is dissolved in the acid.\n\n314. From a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of experiments which were made on this process by Bergman, he concluded, that in those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> where the sulphate of indigo afforded only a fading colour, the acid employed had been too weak. Quatremere observes that, among several processes for dyeing with sulphate of indigo, he discovered only two, in which the stuffs were completely penetrated with colouring matter. To effect this, he employed an alkali, in the proportion of one ounce to an ounce of indigo, and six ounces of sulphuric acid. With these proportions of the ingredients he obtained a deep vivid blue, equally intense through every part of the stuff. Poerner, who has paid great attention to this preparation, also employs an alkali, by means of which a more pleasing colour, which penetrates deeper, is produced. The proportions which he recommends are four parts of sulphuric acid to one of indigo. The indigo is first reduced to a fine powder, and the sulphuric acid, in the concentrated state, is poured upon it. The mixture is stirred for some time, and having stood twenty-four hours, one part of dry potash in fine powder, is added; and after the whole is again stirred, it remains for twenty-four hours longer. It is then to be diluted with eight times its weight of water, which must be gradually added, or a greater or less proportion as may be wanted.\n\nDr Bancroft seems to be of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that a more durable blue may be obtained by diluting the acid with an equal quantity of water, when the indigo is put in, and allowing the mixture to remain forty-eight hours; for he thinks by this slower and more moderate action, the basis of the indigo is less injured. Instead of the potash employed by Poerner, Dr Bancroft uses chalk; and even in such a quantity as to saturate the acid. In this case the indigo is precipitated along with the chalk; and, when collected into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>, communicates a blue colour to wool, but more slowly than by the common method, in which the combination is very rapid and the dyeing unequal. This inconvenience he thinks might be obviated by the use of chalk.\n\n315. To produce a Saxon blue colour on woollen stuffs, they are prepared with alum and tartar. And in proportion to the shade required, the quantity of solution of indigo put into the bath must be regulated. When a deep shade of Saxon blue is wanted, the stuff must be passed different times through vessels containing such a quantity of colouring matter as is sufficient to give light colours. In this way, by repeated applications, the colour becomes more uniform.\n\n316. The sulphate of indigo is also employed to dye silk. For this purpose attempts have been made to unite the advantages of the indigo vat and its solution in sulphuric acid. A process of this kind is greatly recommended by Gublache, which produces beautiful colours, and is at the same time cheap and convenient. The bath is composed of one pound of indigo, three pounds of quicklime, three of copperas, and one and a half of orpiment. The indigo is first to be carefully ground and mixed with water, put into a wooden vat, and diluted with water, according to the shade of colour wanted. The lime is then to be added, and the mixture being well stirred, it is covered up, and allowed to remain at rest for some hours. After this the copperas in the state of powder is added, the whole well stirred, and the vat covered up. And lastly, at the end of some hours, the orpiment reduced to powder is thrown in, and the whole left at rest for several hours. The mixture is afterwards to be stirred, and then left to settle, till the liquor becomes clear; when the blue streaks or flower which covers it is removed, and the silk previously dipped in warm water, is to be dyed hank by hank. When it is removed from the bath, it is to be washed in a stream of water, and dried.\n\n317. This process is recommended as the means of obviating a greenish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a>, which is sometimes observed in Saxon blue, and which is supposed to be owing to some change in the particles of indigo, by means of the sulphuric acid.\n\n318. The colour denominated English blue is produced by means of the sulphate of indigo. To give blue silk this colour, it is first to be dyed a light blue; and, when taken out of this bath, it is dipped in hot water, washed in a stream, and left in a bath composed of the sulphate of indigo, to which a little of the solution of tin has been added, until the proper shade is obtained, or the bath is exhausted. Previous to its being put into this bath, it may be dipped in a solution of alum, in which it should only remain a very short time. Silk, which has been dyed according to this process, is free from the reddish tinge which it derives from the blue vat, as well as from the greenish cast of the Saxon blue.\n\n319. The sulphate of indigo has been hitherto only applied for the purpose of dyeing wool and silk. The affinity of indigo for vegetable substances is not sufficiently strong to effect the decomposition of the sulphate. It cannot, therefore, be employed with advantage in dyeing cotton and linen.\n\n320. Attempts have been made to dye with Prussian Dyeing blue. The process which was followed by Macquer is with prussiate of iron, the following. He soaked wool, silk, cotton, and tan blue thread, in a solution of alum and sulphate of iron, and afterwards in an alkaline solution, which was partly saturated with prussic acid. He then immersed the stuffs in water, acidulated with sulphuric acid, for the purpose of dissolving that part of the oxide of iron which remained uncombined with the prussic acid, and which the uncombined alkali had precipitated. By successive repetitions of these immersions he obtained a fine blue, but very unequal. Berthollet justly remarks on this experiment.\nOf Simple experiment, that an alkali saturated with prussic acid should be employed, or lime water or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGNESIA\">magnesia</a>, both of which have the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of combining with that acid. In a second experiment Macquer boiled the stuffs in a solution of tartar and alum, and then passed them through a bath which contained the prussian blue merely diffused in it. The colour was faint, and could not be made deeper; but it was equal, and soft to the touch.\n\n321. In the process proposed by Abb\u00e9 Menon for thread and cotton, they are first dyed black, and soaked for a few minutes in prussiate of alkali, and afterwards boiled in a solution of alum. In this way they acquired a deep blue. When a lighter blue is wanted, the stuffs must be passed through a weak acid.\n\n322. Similar to the second experiment of Macquer is the process of Roland de la Plati\u00e8re. He takes prussian blue in the proportion of a pound to a piece of stuff, powdered, and passed through a very fine sieve, and adds muriatic acid till it is reduced to the consistence of syrup. It is to be constantly stirred for about half an hour, while it ferments. It is then well diluted, and stirred every hour for a day, till the fermentation ceases. The particles are thus in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>. Seven or eight buckets of water for one piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELVET\">velvet</a>, are put into a trough; then add the mixture, which has been previously well diluted in a separate vessel, and poured into the bath through a very fine sieve. When the piece is placed on the winch, over the trough, let the bath be briskly stirred, and the piece speedily let down; and the same operation must be continued as quickly as possible for several hours. This colour requires great management, for as the particles of the prussian blue are only in a state of minute division, and heavy, they are quickly deposited on the stuff. Hence the colour appears very unequal and in patches, even with the utmost care; and nothing can be done to avoid it, but repeating the operations again and again. The stuff should be put into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a> thoroughly wet, for when it is dry, it penetrates with difficulty, and is always unequal. Between the dryings the stuff is always to be washed and beatled, excepting the last time, when it is not washed, but dried in the open air, either in the sun or in the shade; observing however, that it be well stretched. This beautiful colour is not changed by the air; it resists the action of acids, and is little altered by boiling with alum; but it is soon tarnished by friction, or particles of dust that adhere to it. It is scarcely necessary to add, that it is instantly decomposed by alkaline liquids. Guhlische employs a solution of tin in nitro-muriatic acid, as a substitute for muriatic acid, in the process of dyeing with prussian blue.\n\n323. Dr Bancroft made a number of experiments in dyeing both vegetable and mineral matters, with prussian blue, and particularly with the view of obviating the difficulties which had occurred to others in the use of it. He boiled up copperas with quercitron bark, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol9.html#article-FUSTIC\">fustic</a>, and logwood, separately, in what he thought the best proportions; and in each of these mixtures he dyed a piece of woollen cloth by boiling it for 10 or 15 minutes. The stuffs were afterwards separately immersed in warm diluted prussiate of potash neutralized by sulphuric acid. They acquired an equal and beautiful blue. This however, was not the uniform result; for when too much copper as was employed in dyeing with quercitron bark, there was an excess of oxide of iron, which combining with the fibres of the wool, gave the prussian blue a greenish tinge; but this he found could be remedied, by passing the cloth through warm water, slightly acidulated with muriatic acid. The prussian colouring matter, Dr Bancroft observes, must always be applied in a moderate heat, otherwise it will be precipitated by the sulphuric acid, and rendered unfit for this purpose, till it is again dissolved by potash, lime, or some other substance.\n\n324. He then tried to fix prussian blue by means of the aluminous mordant, but at the end of 15 minutes, after being immersed in a solution of prussiate of potash, it had acquired no colour. The addition of a small proportion of a solution of iron in muriatic acid, communicated a blue colour. All parts of the cloth, as well as those to which the mordant had been applied, received the colour. The cloth being washed with soap, the whole of the colour was discharged, excepting where it had been impregnated with alumina, and even there it had become fainter. A piece of the same cotton was immersed in a solution of ammonia (volatile alkali); the pale blue was greatly heightened. Another piece was put into water slightly tinged with a solution of copper in ammonia. The blue colour became suddenly of an intensely deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARTER\">garter</a>-blue or violet, and it resisted the action of soap. Into water mixed with a little of a solution of muriate of copper, he put another piece of the same cotton, and it soon became of a deeper blue, without any of the purple or violet shade. This resisted the action of soap, and after long exposure to the weather, the colour was little diminished; and when the colour remained in any degree weakened, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMERSION\">immersion</a> in water slightly acidulated with fulphuric acid, completely restored it. From these facts it would appear to be advantageous to prepare woollens by the usual boiling with alum, or alum and tartar, before they are dyed with copperas and quercitron bark, fustic or logwood, for a prussian blue; but a greater proportion of sulphuric acid, in the prussiate of potash or lime, that the excess of acid may discharge the vegetable colouring matters becomes necessary.\n\n325. Dr Bancroft afterwards tried pieces of silk and cotton in the diluted prussiates of potash, soda, lime, &c., with solutions of most of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> in different acids and alkalis; and from the different metallic solutions he obtained a very full, lively colour, which he calls the red copper colour; from the different solutions of copper in fulphuric, nitric, muriatic, and acetic acids; the same effect succeeded well from a solution in ammonia. He obtained also the same colour from the nitrates of silver and of cobalt. The prussian colouring matter fixed by these metallic mordants resisted the action of acids, washings with soap, and exposure to the weather for the greatest length of time; but in all these cases there must be a double application. The prussian colouring matter must first be applied to the linen, cotton or silk, which must be afterwards allowed to dry. It must then be immersed in the metallic solution, or the metallic solution must be applied first, and then the solution of prussiate of potash, soda, lime, &c.\n\nSect. IV. Of Dyeing Black.\n\nThe next of the simple colours is black, of which we shall treat as in the former sections; first describing the substances which are employed, and then giving an account\nOf Simple account of the processes which are followed in dyeing different stuffs of a black colour.\n\nI. Of the Substances employed in Dyeing Black.\n\n326. There are few substances which have the property of producing a permanent black colour, without any addition. The juice of some plants produces this effect on cotton and linen. A black colour is obtained from the juice of the cashew nut, which will not wash out, and even resists the process of boiling with soap or alkalies. The cashew nut of India is employed for marking linen. That of the West Indies (Anacardium occidentale, Lin.) also yields a permanent dye, but the colour has a brownish shade. The juice of some other plants, as that of the toxicodendron, or floes, affords a durable blueish black colour; but these substances cannot be obtained in sufficient quantity, even if they afforded colours equal to those produced by the common processes.\n\n327. The principal substances which are employed to give a black colour are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GALL\">gall</a> nuts which contain the astringent principle, or tan, and the red oxide of iron (r). For a particular account of the nature and properties of tan, see <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a> Index. The black colour is produced by the combination of the astringent principle with the oxide of iron, held in solution by an acid, and fixed on the stuff. When the particles are precipitated from the mixture of tan and a solution of iron, they have only a blue colour; but after they are exposed for some time to the air, and moistened with water, the colour becomes deeper, although the blue shade is still perceptible. After the particles are fixed on the stuff, the shade becomes much deeper.\n\n328. Logwood is not to be considered as affording a black dye, but is much employed to give a lustre to black colours. We have (180,) already described its nature and properties, among the substances from which red colouring matters are obtained.\n\n329. Black colours are rarely produced by a simple combination between the colouring matter and the stuff; but are usually fixed by means of mordants, as in the case of the black particles which are the result of a combination of the astringent principle and the oxide of iron, held in solution by an acid. But when the particles are precipitated from the mixture of an astringent and a solution of iron, they have only a blue colour. By being exposed to the air, and moistened with water, the colour becomes deeper, although the blue shade is still perceptible. No fine black colour is ever obtained, unless the stuffs are freely exposed to the air. In dyeing black, therefore, the operations must be conducted at different intervals. Berthollet has observed that black stuffs, when brought in contact with oxygen gas, diminish its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, so that some portion of it is absorbed.\n\nII. Of the Processes for Dyeing Woollen Black.\n\n330. In dyeing woollen stuffs black, if a full and fine deep colour is wanted, it is necessary that they are pre-dyed blue. To remove all the particles of colouring matter which happen to be loosely attached to the stuff, it should be washed in a river as soon as it is taken out of the vat, and afterwards cleansed at the fulling mill. After these preliminary processes, the stuffs are ready to receive the black colouring matter. The process of Hellot is the following:\n\nFor every hundred pounds of stuff, ten pounds of log-Hellot's wood, and ten pounds of galls reduced to powder, are procured, put into a bag and boiled in a middle-sized copper, with a sufficient quantity of water, for 12 hours. A third of this bath is put into another copper, along with two pounds of verdigris. The stuff is immersed in this bath, and continually stirred for 2 hours. The bath should be kept hot, but it ought not to boil. At the end of two hours the stuff is taken out, and a similar portion of the bath is put into the copper, with eight pounds of copperas (sulphate of iron). During the solution of the copperas, the fire is diminished, and the bath is allowed to cool for half an hour, stirring it well the whole time. The remainder of the bath is then to be added, and after making this addition, the bag containing the astringent matters should be strongly pressed, to separate the whole. A quantity of sumach from 15 to 20 pounds, is now to be added, and the bath is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> raised to the boiling temperature; and when it has given one boil, it is to be immediately dropped with a little cold water. A fresh quantity of sulphate of iron, to the amount of two pounds, is then added, and the stuff is kept in it for another hour, after which it is taken out, washed and aired; it is again put into the copper, and constantly stirred for an hour. It is then carried to the river, well washed, and fulled. To soften the black colour, and make it more firm, another bath is prepared with weld. This is made to boil for a moment, and when it has cooled, the stuff is passed through it. By this process, which is indeed somewhat complicated, a beautiful black colour is produced.\n\n331. But the processes usually followed for dyeing common black, are more simple. Cloth which has been pre-process, violently dyed blue, is merely boiled in a vat of galls for two hours. It is then kept two hours, but without boiling, in the bath of logwood and sulphate of iron, and afterwards washed and fulled. According to Hellot's process, a bath is to be prepared of a pound and a half of yellow wood, five pounds of logwood, and ten pounds of sumach, which is the proportion of the ingredients.\n\n(r) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAK\">Oak</a> bark has been recommended as a substitute for gall-nuts in dyeing black, and particularly in dyeing hats; and it is said that the colour thus obtained is fuller, more beautiful and durable, while the operation is easier and less liable to accident. It was first proposed in the year 1782 by Stephanopoli, a Corfican, and a surgeon in the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> of the process was referred by the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> to Macquer, who gave a favourable report of it; and afterwards to Berthollet, who gave a different opinion. The process has since been examined, and promises to be more economical and advantageous, especially for dyeing hats.\nOf Simple Colours.\n\n332. When fluffs are to be dyed at a less expense, instead of the blue ground, a brown or root-coloured ground may be substituted. This brown or fawn colour is communicated by means of the root of the walnut tree, or green walnut peels. The fluffs are then to be dyed black, according to some of the processes already described.\n\n333. The proportions of the ingredients employed by the English dyers are, for every hundred pounds of cloth previously dyed a deep blue, about five pounds of sulphate of iron, five pounds of galls, and 30 of logwood. The first step in the process is to gall the cloth, after which it is passed through the decoction of logwood, to which the sulphate of iron has been added.\n\n334. The leaves of the arbutus unedo have been recommended, and employed as a substitute for galls. The leaves must be carefully dried, so that the green colour may be preserved. A hundred pounds of wool are boiled with 16 pounds of sulphate of iron, and eight of tartar, for two hours. The day following the cloth is to be rinsed as after aluming. A hundred and fifty pounds of the leaves of unedo are then to be boiled for two hours in water, and after being taken out, a small quantity of madder is to be added to the liquor, putting in the cloth at the same time, which is to remain about an hour and a half. It is then taken out and rinsed in water. By this process, it is said, blue cloth receives a pretty good black, but white cloth becomes only of a deep brown. It is said, too, that the madder and tartar are useless ingredients.\n\n335. After the different operations for dyeing the cloth have been finished, it is washed in a river, and fulled, till the water comes off clear and colourless. Soap lads are recommended by some in fulling fine cloths, but it is found difficult to free the cloth entirely from the soap. After the cloth has come from the fulling mill, some propose to give it a dip in a bath of weld, by which it is said to be softened, and the colour better fixed; but according to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEWIS\">Lewis</a>, this operation, which in other cases is of some advantage, is useless after the cloth has been treated with the soap suds.\n\nIII. Of the Processes for Dyeing Silk Black.\n\n336. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> a black colour to silk, different operations are necessary, such as boiling, galling, repairing the bath, dyeing, and softening.\n\n337. To give a deeper shade to silk, it is necessary to deprive it of the gummy substance to which its stiffness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a> are owing. This is done by boiling the silk four or five hours with one fifth its weight of white soap, and afterwards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEATING\">beating</a> and carefully washing it.\n\nGalling.\n\n338. In conducting the process of galling silk, three fourths of its weight of galls are to be boiled for three or four hours, but the proportion of galls must depend on their quality. After the boiling, the liquor is allowed to remain at rest for two hours; the silk is then put into the bath, and left there from 12 to 36 hours, when it is to be taken out, and washed in the river. But as silk is capable of combining with a great proportion of the altrigent principle, or tan, from which it receives a considerable increase of weight, it is allowed to remain for a longer or shorter time, as the silk is required to have more or less additional weight. To communicate, therefore, to silk what is called a heavy black, it is allowed to remain longer in the gall liquor; the process is repeated oftener, and the silk is also dipped in the dye a greater number of times.\n\n339. While silk is preparing for the process of dyeing, the bath is to be heated, and should be occasionally stirred, that the grounds which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> to the bottom may not acquire too much heat. It should always be kept under the boiling temperature. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GUM\">Gum</a> and solution of iron are added in different proportions, according to the different processes. When the gum is dissolved, and the bath near the boiling temperature, it is left to settle for about an hour. The silk, which in general is previously divided into three parts, that each may be successively put into the bath, is immersed in it. Each part is then to be three times wrung, and after each wringing hung up to air. The silk being thus exposed to the action of the air, acquires a deeper shade. This operation being finished, the bath is again heated, with the addition of gum and sulphate of iron, and this is repeated two or three times, according as the black required is light or heavy. When the process of dyeing is finished, the silk is rinsed in a vessel with some cold water, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> or shaking it over.\n\n340. Silk, after it has been taken out of the dye, is softened extremely harshly, to remove which it is subjected to the operation of softening. A solution of four or five pounds of soap for every hundred pounds of silk, is poured through a cloth into a vessel of water. The solution being completed, the silk is immersed, and allowed to remain in it for about 15 minutes; it is then to be wrung out and dried.\n\n341. When raw silk is to be dyed, that which has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> yellow colour is preferred. The galling operation must be performed in the cold, if it be proposed to preserve the whole of the gum, and the elasticity which it gives to the silk; but if part only of the gum is wished to be preserved, the galling is to be performed in the warm bath.\n\n342. The dyeing operation is also performed in the cold. All that is necessary is to add the sulphate of iron to the water in which the stuff is rinsed. By this simple process the black dye is communicated. It is then washed, once or twice beetleed, and dried without wringing, that its elasticity may not be destroyed. Raw silk may be dyed by a more speedy process. After a speedier galling, it may be turned or thicken over in the cold bath; and thus by alternately dipping and airing the stuff, the operation may be completed. It is then to be washed and dried as in the former processes.\n\n343. The method of dyeing velvet at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENOA\">Genoa</a>, which has been simplified and improved in France, is thus described by Macquer. For every 100 pounds of silk velvet: 20 pounds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEPPO\">Aleppo</a> galls, reduced to powder, are boiled in a sufficient quantity of water for an hour. The bath is allowed to settle till the galls have fallen to the bottom; they are then taken out, and two pounds and a half of sulphuric acid, twelve pounds of iron filings, and 20 pounds of gum, are put into a copper\nThis vessel is immersed in the bath, and supported that it may not touch the bottom. The gum, which is allowed to dissolve for an hour, is to be occasionally stirred; and if it appear that the whole of the gum is dissolved, three or four pounds more are to be added. Excepting during the operation of dyeing, the cullender is to remain in the copper, which must be kept hot the whole time, but at a temperature below the boiling point. In galling the silk, one-third of Aleppo galls is employed, and the stuff should remain five hours in the liquor the first time, and twelve hours the second. By frequent additions of sulphate of iron, and repeated immersions of the stuff, a fine black, according to Lewis, has been obtained. In the above process, the proportion of sulphate of iron is too small, and the gum, according to some, being carried off in the washing, may be considered as useless. Berthollet thinks that, although the quantity be excessive, it has some effect in keeping up the bath, and he adds, if it is to be diminished, it would be useful to add the sulphate of iron in separate portions during each interval.\n\n344. To diminish the quantity of galls, which are an expensive ingredient in dyeing silk black, other substances have been proposed as substitutes. With this view the following process is recommended.\n\nThe silk being boiled and washed, is immersed in a strong decoction of green walnut peels, and allowed to remain till the colouring matter of both is exhausted. It is then to be slightly wrung out, dried and washed (m). To give the silk a blue ground, logwood and verdigris are employed, in the proportion of one ounce of the latter for every pound of silk. The verdigris is dissolved in cold water, and the silk is allowed to remain two hours in this solution. It is then immersed in a strong decoction of logwood, slightly wrung out, dried, and afterwards washed at the river. The bath is prepared by macerating two pounds of galls and three of fumach in 25 gallons of water, over a slow fire, for twelve hours. The liquid being strained, three pounds of sulphate of iron, and the same quantity of gum arabic, are to be dissolved in it. The silk is dipped in this solution at two different times; it is to remain in the bath two hours each time, and it must be aired and dried between each dip. After being twice beatled at the river, it is dipped a third time, and left in the bath four or five hours, after which it is to be dried, washed and beatled as before. The temperature of the bath should not exceed 120\u00b0. After the first dipping, it may be necessary to add half a pound of sulphate of iron, and an equal quantity of gum arabic.\n\n345. Silk which has been previously dyed blue with indigo, it is said, takes only a mealy black; but when it has been prepared with logwood and verdigris, it acquires a velvety lustre. A fine black may be obtained from green walnut peel; but the addition of logwood and verdigris renders a smaller quantity of sulphate of iron necessary, and this is of importance, because it is apt to weaken the silk. The only use of galls, according to some, is to increase the weight of the silk; for the purposes of dyeing, fumach is considered sufficient.\n\nIV. Of the Processes for Dyeing Cotton and Linen Black.\n\n246. It is more difficult to communicate a fine black stuff to linen or cotton than to silk or woollen stuffs. To previously succeed in producing a black colour of that degree of blue intensity which will resist soap, it is necessary to adopt particular processes. In dyeing animal matters black, as silk, and wool, the best colours are obtained on those which have been previously dyed blue. This also is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> preliminary process in dyeing linen and cotton black; for it is found that the process which succeeds best, is first to give a deep blue grain to the cotton or linen.\n\n347. The first part of the process is the operation of Galling. The stuffs which have been previously dyed blue, wrung out and dried, are kept 24 hours in the gall-liquor, composed of four ounces of galls to every pound of thread. A bath is then prepared of a solution of iron in acetic acid. This solution is obtained by saturating the acid with oxide of iron. In France, vinegar, small beer, or small wine, is employed for this purpose. To promote the acid fermentation, rye <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>, or some other substance, is added, and pieces of old iron are thrown into the liquid, which are allowed to remain for six weeks or two months, that the acid may be saturated with the iron. This solution, called iron liquor in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, is prepared from fermented worts, to which old iron is added, as is described above. Five quarts of the iron-liquor for every pound of stuffs, dyeing, are put into a vessel. In this the stuffs are wrought with the hand, pound by pound, for 15 minutes: they are then wrung out and aired. This operation is to be again repeated, taking care to add a fresh quantity of the iron-liquor, which should be carefully scummed, after which the stuffs are to be wrung out, aired, and washed at the river. In the next operation, a pound of alder bark for every pound of stuff is boiled in a sufficient quantity of water for an hour. One half of the bath which was employed in the galling, and about one half the quantity of fumach as of alder bark, are then added. The whole is boiled together for two hours, and strained through a sieve. When this liquid is cold, the stuffs are immersed, wrought pound by pound, and occasionally aired. They are afterwards put into the bath, and after remaining for 24 hours, are wrung out and dried. The above is the process which, according to D'Apligny, is followed at Rouen, for dyeing cotton and linen.\n\n348. The process followed at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANCHESTER\">Manchester</a>, which is another described by Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILTON\">Wilton</a>, is the following. For the process of operation of galling, galls or fumach are employed. The stuff is afterwards dyed in a bath consisting of a solution of iron in acetic acid. This bath is also frequently composed of alder bark and iron. After having passed through this bath, the stuff is dipped in a decoction of logwood, to which a small quantity of verdigris has been added. This process is to be repeated.\n\n(m) The decoction of walnut peels is prepared by boiling for 15 minutes, after which it is taken from the fire. After it has subsided, the silk, which has been previously immersed in warm water, is dipped in it.\nChap. I.\n\nOf Simple Colours.\n\nPreparation of solution of iron.\n\nAccording to Gubliehe, a solution of iron may be prepared by the following process. A pound of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol19.html#article-RICE\">rice</a> is to be boiled in 12 or 15 quarts of water, till the whole is dissolved. A sufficient quantity of old iron made red hot, to reach half way to the surface of the liquor, is thrown into the solution. The vessel in which the solution is kept must be under cover, but exposed to the air and light at least for a week. In another vessel, containing a quantity of warm vinegar equal to the solution of rice, an equal quantity of red-hot iron is to be put. This vessel must also be exposed in the same way to the air and light. After several days, the contents of both vessels are mixed together, and the mixture is to be exposed for a week to the open air, after which it is to be decanted and kept for use in a clothe vessel. To give a sufficient black to linen and cotton, it is only necessary, it is said, to steep them 24 hours in this solution; and if it should appear that the liquor is exhausted of colouring matter, a fresh portion is to be employed. In this way a fine permanent black is obtained. According to the same author, this solution may be advantageously employed as a substitute for sulphate of iron, in dyeing silk and wool. But to give them a fine black, silk and woollen stuffs must be dipped in a decoction of logwood after they are taken from the bath.\n\nSect. V. Of Brown.\n\n350. The last of the simple colours is brown. This is also known under the name of fawn colour, (fauve, Fr.) It is that brown colour which has a shade of yellow, and might perhaps be considered as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> colour, although it is communicated to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a> by one process.\n\nI. Of the Substances employed in Dyeing Brown.\n\n351. The vegetable substances which are capable of inducing a fawn or brown colour on different stuffs, are very numerous, but those chiefly employed for this purpose are walnut peels and sumach. The peels constitute the green covering of the nut; they are internally of a white colour, which is converted into brown or black by exposure to the air. The skin when impregnated with the juice of walnut peels, becomes of a brown or almost black colour. When the inner part of the peel, taken fresh, is put into weak oxymuriatic acid, it affumes a brown colour. If the decoction of walnut peels be filtered and exposed to the air, its colour becomes of a deep brown; the pellicles on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> are almost black; the liquor detached from these yields a brown extract completely soluble in water. The colouring particles are precipitated from a decoction of walnut peels, by means of alcohol, and they are soluble in water. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> change is at first produced by a solution of potash; but it gradually becomes turbid, and the colour is deepened. A copious precipitate of a fawn colour, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> to an ash colour, is produced in a decoction of walnut peels by means of a solution of tin, and the remaining liquor has a slightly yellow tinge.\n\n352. A decoction of walnut peels yields a small quantity of fawn-coloured precipitate by means of a solution of alum, and the liquor remains of the same colour. Sulphate of copper renders it slowly turbid, and throws down a small quantity of precipitate of a brownish green colour, leaving the supernatant liquor of the same colour. Sulphate of iron deepens the colour; when diluted, the colour becomes brownish green, without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> of any sediment. Sulphate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a> also deepens the colour, and produces no precipitate. The same properties are exhibited by a decoction of the walnut-tree wood, but the colouring matter is not obtained from it in such abundance as from the peels; and the bark may also be used with advantage in dyeing.\n\n353. The affinity of the colouring matter of walnut peels for wool is very strong; and it readily imparts to it a durable colour, which even mordants do not seem capable of increasing, but they are generally understood to give it additional brightness. A lively and very rich colour is obtained with the assistance of alum. Walnut peels afford a great variety of pleasing shades, and as they require not the intervention of mordants, the softness of the wool is preserved, and the process of dyeing becomes both cheap and simple.\n\n354. Walnut peels are not gathered till the nuts are completely ripe, when they are put into large casks, along with as much water as is sufficient to cover them. When used in dyeing at the Gobelins in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, Berthollet informs us, they are kept for upwards of a year, and very extensively used; but if not made use of till the end of two years, they yield a greater quantity of colouring matter, at which time their odour has become peculiarly disagreeable and fetid. The peels separated from the nuts before they arrive at maturity, may likewise be used in dyeing, but in this state they do not keep so long.\n\n355. Sumach (rhus coriaria, Linn.) is a shrub produced naturally in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PORTUGAL\">Portugal</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPAIN\">Spain</a>, being carefully cultivated in the two last of these countries. Its shoots are annually cut down, dried, and reduced to powder in a mill, by which process they are prepared for the purposes of dyeing.\n\n356. The infusion of sumach, which is of a fawn colour with a greenish tinge, is changed into a brown by exposure to the air. A solution of potash has little action on the recent infusion of sumach; its colour is changed to yellow by the action of acids; the liquor becomes turbid by means of alum, a small quantity of precipitate being at the same time formed, and the supernatant liquor remaining yellow. A copious precipitate of a yellowish green colour is thrown down by sulphate of copper, and the liquor remains clear. No change is speedily produced by muriate of soda (common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>), but it becomes rather turbid at the end of some hours, and its colour is rather clearer. Sulphate of copper produces a copious precipitate of a yellowish green, which after standing some hours, changes to a brownish green; the supernatant liquor, which is slightly yellow, remains clear. Sulphate of zinc renders the liquor turbid, darkens its colour, and produces a deep blue precipitate; but when the sulphate of zinc is pure, the precipitate, which is of a brownish fawn colour, is in very small quantity. Acetate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> gives a copious precipitate, of a yellowish colour; the supernatant liquor is of a clear yellow colour. No astringent has so strong a resemblance to galls as sumach; but the precipitate...\nDYEING\n\nOf Simple precipitate thrown down from an infusion of it by a solution of iron, is not so copious as that which is yielded by an equal quantity of galls, on which account fumach may be generally employed as a substitute for galls, only its quantity will require to be increased.\n\n357. The bark of the birch-tree (Betula <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBA\">alba</a>, Lin.) yields a decoction of a clear fawn colour, but it soon becomes turbid and brown. The addition of a solution of alum in the open air, produces a copious yellow precipitate; a solution of tin gives also a copious precipitate of a clear yellow colour. With solutions of iron the decoction of the birch-tree strikes a black colour, and it dissolves in considerable quantity the oxide of iron, but in smaller proportion than the decoction of walnut peels. On account of this property it is employed in the preparation of black vats for dyeing thread.\n\n358. Saunders, or fandal wood, is also employed for the purpose of giving a fawn colour. There are three kinds of fandal wood, the white, the yellow, and the red. The last only, which is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> heavy wood, brought from the Coromandel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, is used in dyeing. By exposure to the air it becomes of a brown colour; when employed in dyeing, it is reduced to fine powder, and it yields a fawn colour with a brownish shade, inclining to red. But the colouring matter which it yields of itself is in small quantity, and it is said that it gives <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a> to woollen stuffs. When it is mixed with other substances, as fumach, walnut peels, or galls, the quantity of colouring matter is increased; it gives a more durable colour, and produces considerable modifications in the colouring matter with which it is mixed. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SANDAL\">Sandal</a> wood yields its colouring matter to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRANDY\">brandy</a>, or diluted alcohol, more readily than to water.\n\n359. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOOT\">Soot</a> communicates to woollen stuffs a fawn or brown colour, of a lighter or deeper shade, in proportion to the quantity employed; but the colour is fading, and its affinity for wool is not great; and besides leaving a disagreeable smell, it renders the fibres harsh. In some manufactories, it is employed for browning certain colours, and it produces shades which could not otherwise be easily obtained.\n\nII. Of the Processes for Dyeing Woollen, &c. a Fawn or Brown Colour.\n\n360. In dyeing with walnut peels, a quantity proportioned to the quantity of stuff, and the intensity of shade wanted, is boiled for fifteen minutes in a copper. All that is necessary in dyeing with this substance is, to moisten the cloth or yarn with warm water, previous to their immersion in the copper, in which they are to be carefully stirred till they have acquired the proper shade. This is the process, if the aluminoous mordant is not employed. In dyeing cloth, it is usual to give the deepest shades first, and the lighter ones afterwards; but in dyeing woollen yarn, the light shades are given first, and the deeper ones afterwards. An additional quantity of peels is joined to each parcel.\n\n361. Berthollet made a number of experiments to ascertain the difference of colour obtained from the simple decoction of walnut peels, and the addition of metallic oxides as mordants. The oxide of tin, he found, yielded a clearer and brighter fawn colour than that of the simple decoction. The oxide of zinc produced a still clearer colour, inclining to ash or gray. Compound colours from oxide of lead had an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a> cast, while that from oxide of iron was of a greenish brown.\n\n362. A fawn colour, which has a shade of green, is obtained from fumach alone; but to cotton stuffs dyeing which have been impregnated with printers mordant, with fumach communicates a good wash and durable yellow. Here, however, some precaution is necessary in the use of this substance for this purpose; for as the colouring matter is of so fixed a nature, the ground of the stuff cannot be bleached by exposure on the grats. This inconvenience is avoided by impregnating the whole of the stuff with different mordants, producing in this way a variety of colours, and leaving no part white.\n\n363. Vogler employed the tincture of saunders wood with fandal for dyeing patterns of wool, silk, cotton, and linen, wood, having previously impregnated them with a solution of tin, and afterwards washing and drying them. Sometimes he used the solution unmixed, and at other times added fix or ten parts of water, and in whatever way he employed it, he obtained a poppy colour. When the mordant employed was solution of alum, the colour was a rich scarlet; with sulphate of copper it was a clear crimson, and with sulphate of iron a beautiful deep violet.\n\nCHAP. II. Of Compound Colours.\n\n364. A mixture of two colouring substances, it is Nature of well known, produces a very different shade from that compound of either of the uncombined colouring matters; hence colours, compound colours are obtained, which are merely mixtures of simple colours. It would undoubtedly be a desirable thing to ascertain with accuracy the peculiar shade produced by the combination of two colouring matters; but these results can only be certainly known by experiment, because by the action of different substances in the baths, they are subject to great variations in their effects, according to the affinities which are brought into action, and the new combinations which are formed. What is natural to colouring particles is not to be considered as a constituent part of compound colours, but only the difference of shade which they ought to assume, with a particular mordant, or in a particular bath. The effects, therefore, of the chemical agents employed in these processes, and the result of different combinations, ought to be particularly attended to. It is in dyeing compound colours that skill and ingenuity are most conspicuous, and their application of greatest utility, to enable the dyer to vary his processes, according to the shade desired, and at the same time to accomplish his operations by the shortest and cheapest means.\n\n365. As compound colours are obtained by the mixture of simple colours, very different shades will be obtained from different proportions of the simple colours; hence compound colours exhibit an indefinite variety of shade, and the processes by which they are produced are very numerous. It would extend this treatise to an unusual length, were we to attempt to describe every variety of shade which is obtained from the mixture of simple colours. We shall therefore limit our observations to some of the principal compound colours, and an\nCompounds an account of the processes by which they are obtained, leaving it to our readers, who have made themselves familiar with the principles already detailed, to vary these colours, by employing different proportions and different combinations of simple colouring matters.\n\n366. Compound colours have been usually divided into four classes, namely, green, purple, orange, and gray or drab colour. These are obtained from mixtures of the following simple colours.\n\n1. Blue and yellow produce a green.\n2. Red and blue, a purple, &c.\n3. Red and yellow, orange.\n4. Black and other colours, gray, &c.\n\nThe following sections will be occupied in a short detail of the methods which are usually employed in producing these different compound colours.\n\nSect. I. Of the Mixture of Blue and Yellow, or Green.\n\n367. Green colours, from the great variety of shades which they exhibit, have been long known by different names, by which the intensity of shade is characterized, such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-green, apple-green, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MEADOW\">meadow</a> or grass green, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol17.html#article-PEA\">pea</a>-green, parrot-green, &c. Many plants afford a green colour, such as brome grass (Bromus secalinus, Lin.), green berries of Rhamnus frangula, wild chervil (Cheerophyllum fylvetra, Lin.), purple clover (Trifolium pratense), common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REED\">reed</a> (Orinus phragmites). These colours, however, do not possess sufficient permanency. According to D'Ambourney, indeed, a permanent green may be obtained from the fermented juice of the berries of the berry-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> alder (Rhamnus frangula). Having previously prepared the cloth with tartar, solution of nitrate of alum and common salt, he added to the fermented juice of the berries, after it was warmed, a small proportion of acetate of lead; and in this bath he communicated to the cloth an intermediate shade between parrot and grass green. But it is usually from the mixture of blue and yellow that green is obtained; and it may be observed, that it requires much skill and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, especially in giving light shades, to produce a colour which is uniform, and entirely without spots.\n\nI. Of the Processes for Dyeing Woollen Stuffs Green.\n\n368. To dye woollen green, either the yellow or the blue dye may be given to it first. But when the stuff is first dyed yellow, and in this state is introduced into the blue vat, part of the yellow colouring matter being dissolved in the vat, communicates to it a green colour, which renders it unfit for dyeing any other colour than green. To avoid this inconvenience, therefore, the blue colour is first given, and afterwards the yellow. It would be quite unnecessary to resume the account of any part of the processes for dyeing blue, which have been already detailed. It is proper, however, to add, that the intensity of the blue shade must be proportioned to the green, or to the depth of the green colour which is wished to be obtained. Thus, for instance, to produce a parrot green, a ground of sky blue is given, and for the green like that of a drake's neck, a deep blue is required. When the blue dye has been communicated, the yellow is afterwards given, according to some of the processes which have been already described for dyeing yellow. The proper ground being communicated to the cloths, they are washed in the fulling mill, and boiled as for the common process of welding; but when the shade is light, the proportion of faults should be less. Cloths which are to receive light shades are first boiled, and when they are taken out, tartar and alum are added in fresh portions, till the cloths which are intended for the darkest shades are boiled. The process of welding is conducted in the same way as for dyeing yellow, with this difference, that a larger proportion of weld is employed, excepting for lighter shades, when the proportion must be smaller. In dyeing green, it is usual to have a succession of shades at the same time; the process is begun with the deepest, and ends with the lightest. Between each dip there should be an interval of one-half or three-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of an hour, and at each interval water is added to the bath. It is the practice of some dyers to give each parcel two dips, beginning the first time with the deep shades, and the second with the lighter ones; but when this practice is followed, the time of immersion should be shortened. In dyeing very light shades, the bath should never be permitted to reach the boiling temperature. For deep greens, a browning is given with logwood, and a small proportion of sulphate of iron.\n\n369. For some kinds of green, sulphate of indigo is Saxon employed; and in this case either the blue and yellow green are dyed separately, or the whole of the ingredients are mixed together in the bath, and the whole process is finished at a single operation. The colour thus obtained has been distinguished by the name of Saxon green. The following is the process recommended by Dr Bancroft.\n\n370. \"The most beautiful Saxon greens (says he) may be produced very cheaply and expeditiously, by combining the lively yellow which results from quercitron bark, muriato-sulphate of tin, and alum, with the blue afforded by indigo when dissolved in sulphuric acid, as for dyeing the Saxon blue.\n\n\"To produce this combination most advantageously, the dyer, for a full-bodied green, should put into the dyeing vessel after the rate of six or eight pounds of powdered bark, in a bag, for every 100 lb. weight of cloth, with only a small proportion of water as soon as it begins to grow warm; and when it begins to boil, he should add about six pounds of muriato-sulphate of tin (with the usual precautions), and a few minutes after, about four pounds of alum; these having boiled together five or six minutes, cold water should be added, and the fire diminished so as to bring the heat of the liquor nearly down to what the hand is able to bear; and immediately after this, as much sulphate of indigo is to be added as will suffice to produce the shade of green intended to be dyed, taking care to mix it thoroughly with the first solution by stirring, &c.; and this being done, the cloth previously scoured and moistened, should be expeditiously put into the liquor, and turned very briskly through it for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an hour, in order that the colour may apply itself equally to every part, which it will certainly do in this way with proper care. By these means, very full, even, and beautiful greens may generally be dyed in half an hour; and during this space, it is best to keep the liquor at rather less than a boiling heat. Muriato-sulphate of\nCompound of tin is infinitely preferable, for this use, to the dyer's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>; because the latter consists chiefly of nitric acid, which by its highly injurious action upon indigo, would render that part of the green colour very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUGITIVE\">fugitive</a>, as I have found by repeated trials. But no such effect can result from the muriatic acid of tin, since the muriatic acid has no action upon indigo; and the sulphuric acid is that very acid which alone is proper to dissolve it for this use.\n\nRespecting the beauty of the colour thus produced, those who are acquainted with the unequalled lustre and brightness of the quercitron yellows, dyed with the tin balsam, must necessarily conclude, that the greens composed therewith will prove infinitely superior to any which can result from the dull muddy yellow of old fustic; and in point of expense, it is certain that the bark, muriatic acid of tin, and alum necessary to dye a given quantity of cloth in this way, will cost less than the much greater quantity (six or eight times more) of fustic, with the alum necessary for dyeing it in the common way, the sulphate of indigo being the same in both cases. But in dyeing with the bark, the vessel is only to be filled and heated once; and the cloth, without any previous preparation, may be completely dyed in half an hour; whilst in the common way of producing Saxon greens, the copper is to be twice filled; and to this must be joined the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-FUEL\">fuel</a> and labour of an hour and a half's boiling and turning the cloth, in the course of preparation, besides nearly as much boiling in another vessel to extract the colour of the fustic; and after all the dyeing process remains to be performed, which will be equal in time and trouble to the whole of the process for producing a Saxon green with the bark; so that this colour obtained from bark will not only prove superior in beauty, but in cheapness, to that dyed as usual with old fustic.*\n\nII. Of the Processes for Dyeing Silk Green.\n\n371. In giving silk a green colour, greater precaution is necessary, to preserve uniformity of colour, and to prevent spots and stripes. Silk which is intended to receive a green colour, is scoured in the same way as for other colours; but for light shades, the scouring must be as complete as for blue. Silk which is to be dyed green, is first dyed yellow, and being well alummed, it is slightly washed at the river, and divided into small parcels, that it may receive the colouring matter uniformly, and then carefully turned in the weld bath. When the ground is supposed to have acquired a sufficient degree of intensity, a pattern is put into the blue vat, to ascertain the proper shade. When this is the case, the silk is taken out of the bath, washed, and immersed in the blue vat. To produce a deeper colour, and at the same time to give variety of shade, a decoction of logwood, fustic, or annatto, is added to the yellow bath, after the weld has been taken out. For very light shades, such as apple and sea green, it is scarcely necessary to add, that a weaker ground is to be given. For all light shades except sea green, the process is found to succeed better when the yellow is communicated by baths which have been already used; but these baths should not contain any logwood or fustic.\n\n372. Saxon green is produced by means of sulphate of indigo. This is a brighter, but less durable colour than the former. This process is conducted by boiling as for welding, after which the cloth is washed. Fus- fusic in chips is enclosed in a bag, put into the same bath, and boiled for an hour and a half; when it is taken out, and the bath allowed to cool till the hand can bear it. A pound and a quarter of sulphate of indigo for each piece of cloth of eighteen yards, is added. The cloth is at first to be turned quickly, and afterwards more slowly, and it should be taken out before the bath boils. Some dyers put in only two-thirds of the solution at first; and after two or three turns, take out the cloth, and add the other one-third. By this means the colour is more uniform.\n\n373. To produce Saxon green at one operation, the following process is recommended by Dr Bancroft. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATION\">ration</a> bath is prepared of four pounds of quercitron bark, three pounds of alum, and two pounds of muriatic acid, with a sufficient quantity of water. The bath is boiled ten or fifteen minutes, and when the liquor is so far reduced in temperature as the hand can bear it, it is fit for dyeing. By adding different proportions of sulphate of indigo, various and beautiful shades of green may be obtained, and the colour thus produced is both cheap and uniform. Care should be taken to keep the bath constantly stirred, to prevent the colouring matter from subsiding. Those shades which are intended to incline most to the yellow, should be dyed first; and by adding sulphate of indigo, the green, having a shade of blue, may be obtained. This process, Dr Bancroft observes, is the most commodious and certain for dyeing the most beautiful Saxon greens upon silk\u2020.\n\n374. To produce English green, which is more beautiful than common green, and is said to be more durable than the Saxon green, Guhlke gives the following process. He first dyes the silk of a light-blue in the cold vat already described (316.), then soaks it in warm water, washes it in a stream, and dips it in a weak solution of alum. He then prepares a bath of sulphate of indigo, one ounce of solution of tin, with the tincture of French berries made with aceto-citric acid. The silk is kept in this bath till it has obtained the desired colour. It is then washed and dried in a shady place. Lighter shades may be dyed afterwards\u2021.\n\nIII. Of the Processes for Dyeing Cotton and Linen Green.\n\n375. Cotton and linen, after being scoured in the usual way, are first dyed blue; and after being cleaned, given they are dipped in the weld bath, to produce a green colour. The strength of the blue and yellow is proportioned to the shade of green which is wanted. But as it is difficult to give to cotton velvet an uniform colour in the blue vat, it is first dyed yellow with turmeric, and the process is completed by giving it a green with sulphate of indigo. The same result, however, will be obtained by commencing the process either with the yellow or the blue.\n\n376. The process which D'Apligny describes for dyeing cotton velvet, or cotton thread a sea or apple-cotton velvet green in one bath is the following. A quantity of verdigris is dissolved in vinegar, and the mixture is kept excluded from the air in the heat of a stove for fifteen days. A quantity of potash equal in weight to the verdigris employed is dissolved in water, and four hours...\nCompounds hours before dyeing it is added to the solution of verdigris. This mixture is to be kept hot. One ounce of alum in five quarts of water for each pound of stuff being prepared, the cotton thread or velvet is soaked in this solution. It is then taken out, and the verdigris mixture being added to the solution of alum, it is again introduced to be dyed.\n\n377. The different shades of olive green, and drake's neck green, are given to thread after it has received a blue ground, by galling it, and dipping it in a weaker or stronger bath of iron liquor, then in the weld bath, to which verdigris has been added, and afterwards in the bath with sulphate of copper. The colour is lastly to be brightened with soap.\n\n378. Cotton dyed with Prussian blue may be dyed green by previously aluming while it is still wet with the blue, and then dipping in a weld bath, the strength of which is proportioned to the shade required. The colour from weld is more lively than that obtained from fustic. But fustic which gives a deeper shade than weld, and diminishes the brightness of the blue, is to be preferred when a green with an olive shade is wanted.\n\n379. The shade of green given to any stuff, it is obvious, must vary according to the intensity of the blue shade, the strength of the yellow bath, and the nature of the yellow colouring matter employed. Yellow colours are rendered more intense by means of alkalies, sulphate of lime and ammoniacal salts; but become fainter by means of acids, alum, and solutions of tin. In dyeing Saxon green the result will be different according to the process which is followed. The effects will be different by adding a yellow to a Saxon blue, from the process in which the sulphate of indigo is mixed with the yellow ingredients; because in the latter case the sulphuric acid has a considerable action on the colouring matter, and thus diminishes the intensity of the yellow. As the particles of indigo have a stronger affinity for the stuff than the yellow colouring matter, in dyeing a succession of shades in a bath in which both are mixed, the bath being first exhausted of the indigo, the last shades incline more to the yellow on account of the predominance of the yellow colouring matter.\n\nSect. II. Of the Mixture of Red and Blue, or Purple, &c.\n\n380. By the mixture of red and blue, violet, purple, dove-colour, lilac, and a great variety of other shades, according to the proportions of the substances employed, or the predominance of the blue or the red, are produced. In stuffs which are to be dyed violet, a deeper blue must be given, but for purple colours, the ground requires to be of a lighter blue; but in lilac and similar light colours, it is necessary that both the blue and the red have a light shade.\n\nI. Of Dyeing Wool Violet, Purple, &c.\n\n381. In the attempts which have been made to communicate a violet or purple colour to a scarlet ground, according to the observations of Hellot, the colour is very unequal. It becomes therefore necessary to give the blue colour first; and for violets and purples, the shade of blue ought not to be deeper than that of sky blue. The stuff being dyed blue, is boiled with alum, and two fifths of tartar, and is afterwards dipped in a bath composed of nearly two thirds the quantity of cochineal required for scarlet, with the addition of tartar. The same process, indeed, as for dyeing scarlet, is followed. It is a common practice to dye these colours after the reddening for scarlet, making such additions of cochineal and tartar as the intensity of the shade may require.\n\n382. For lighter shades, as lilacs, dove-colours, &c., the stuff may be dipped in the bath which has served for violet and purple, and is now somewhat exhausted, taking care to add a quantity of alum and tartar. For reddish shades, such as peach <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLOSSOM\">blossom</a>, a small proportion of solution of tin is added. It may be observed, in general, that although the proportion of cochineal is less in dyeing lighter shades, the quantity of tartar must not be diminished.\n\n383. To obtain the same colours, a shorter and less expensive process is recommended by Poerner. In this shorter process he employs sulphate of indigo. He boils the process stuff in a solution of alum, in the proportion of three ounces of the latter to one pound of the former, for an hour and a half, and afterwards allows it to remain in the liquid for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> after it has cooled. The dyeing bath is prepared with an ounce and a half of cochineal, and two ounces of tartar, which are boiled for three quarters of an hour: two ounces and a half of sulphate of indigo are then added, the whole is stirred, and boiled gently for fifteen minutes. The dyeing operation is conducted in the usual way, and a beautiful violet is thus obtained. To have all the variety of shades which are produced by the mixture of red and blue, the proportion of the sulphate of indigo is increased or diminished. It is sometimes increased to five ounces, and diminished to five drachms, for each pound of stuff. The quantity of cochineal is also varied, but when it is less than an ounce, the colour is dull. Different proportions of tartar are also employed. To produce variety of shades, the stuff is also prepared with different proportions of solution of tin.\n\n384. To communicate a purple colour to wool, as Purple from well as some other shades, logwood, with the addition logwood of galls, has been employed. The stuff is previously dyed blue, and to give a brown shade, sulphate of iron is used; but the colours thus obtained are not permanent. By the following process, described by Decroizille, a durable dye is produced, by means of this wood. He dissolved tin in sulphuric acid, to which were added common salt, red <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACIDULOUS\">acidulous</a> tartarite of potash, and sulphate of copper; or it may be more conveniently done by making a solution of tin in a mixture of sulphuric acid, common salt, and water, to which are to be added the tartarite and sulphate in the state of powder. Of this mordant not less than 1500 quarts were made in twenty four hours, in a leaden vessel to which a moderate heat was applied. A very lucrative trade was carried on for three years by Decroizille, who sold it at the rate of 1s. 3d. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a> per pound.\n\n385. If wool in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEECE\">fleece</a> is to be dyed, it will require a third of its weight of this mordant, while a fifth is a proportion sufficient for stuffs. A bath is prepared of such a degree of temperature as the hand can bear, with which the mordant is properly mixed, and the wool or stuff dipped in it and stirred, the same degree\nCompound of temperature being kept up for two hours, and increased a little towards the end; after which it is taken out, aired, and well washed. A fresh bath of pure water is prepared at the same temperature, to which is added a sufficient quantity of the decoction of logwood; the stuff is then immersed, stirred, and the heat increased to the boiling temperature, which is to be continued for 15 minutes, after which the stuff being taken out, aired, and carefully rinsed, the process of dyeing is completed. If for every three pounds of wool, one pound of a decoction of logwood has been used, and a proportionate quantity for stuffs which require less, a fine violet colour is produced, to which a sufficient quantity of brazil-wood imparts the shade known in France by the name of prune de Monfeur.\n\n386. Logwood and brazil, fustic and yellow wood, are colouring substances which may be fixed with advantage upon wool by means of this mordant. The colour communicated by the two first of these is liable to be changed in the fulling by the action of the soap or urine employed for that purpose; but this change, which is always produced by alkaline substances, is remedied by a slightly acid bath a little hot, called brightening, for which the sulphuric acid has the preference. The colour becomes as deep, and frequently much brighter than before the change. Wools which have been dyed by means of this mordant, are said to admit of being spun into a finer and more beautiful thread, than by the use of alum. If the use of sulphate of copper is omitted, more beautiful colours are produced by fustic and yellow wood, as well as by weld. An orange red colour is communicated by madder, but not so deep as with a similar quantity of alum. When sulphate of copper is omitted, the wool is said to become much harsher, and the mordant thus prepared yields but indifferent colours with logwood, and in particular with brazil-wood. The use and carriage of this mordant are inconvenient, on account of the heavy sediment by which the vessel is half filled under a corrosive liquor, capable only of being kept in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WARE\">ware</a>. These inconveniences may be remedied by the omission of the water in the receipt, which leaves only a part more conveniently used, and the carriage of it two-fifths cheaper.\n\n387. The above process is thus explained by Berthollet. The decomposition of the muriate of soda is effected by the action of the sulphuric acid, and the muriatic acid being thus disengaged, dissolves the tin, part of which is precipitated by means of the tartaric acid, producing the sediment already mentioned. The oxide of copper produces the blue with the colouring particles of the logwood; the violet is formed by the oxide of tin with the same wood, and the red, with the colouring matter of the brazil-wood. The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> chemist farther observes, that as an excess of acid is retained in the liquor, it might probably be of advantage to employ acetate as a substitute for sulphate of copper, in which case the action of the free acid would be moderated. He thinks it would still be more advisable to make use of verdigris; because the uncombined part of the oxide of copper would, in that case, unite with the excess of acid, on which account a smaller quantity of acid would remain in the liquor; and probably the quantity of tartar might be diminished, as a smaller quantity of tin would thus be precipitated.\n\nII. Of Dyeing Silk Violet or Purple.\n\n388. Silk is capable of receiving two kinds of violet colours, denominated the fine and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a>, the latter of which is produced by means of archil or brazilwood. When the fine violet colour is required, the silk must first be paffed through cochineal, and dipped afterwards in the vat. The preparation and dyeing of the silk with cochineal are the same as for crimson, with the omission of tartar and solution of tin, by means of which the colour is heightened. The quantity of cochineal made use of is always proportioned to the required shade, whether it is more or less intense; but the usual proportion for a fine violet colour is two ounces of cochineal for each pound of silk. When the silk is dyed, it is washed at the river, twice beetleed, dipped in a vat more or less strong, in proportion to the depth of the violet shade, and then washed and dried with precautions similar to those which all colours require that are dyed in the vat. If the violet is to have greater strength and beauty, it is usual to pass it through the archil bath, a practice which, though frequently abused, is not to be dispensed with for light shades, which would otherwise be too dull.\n\n389. When silk has been dyed with cochineal according to the above directions, only a very light shade is requisite for purple; the shades which are deepest are dipped in a weak vat, while dipping them in cold water is sufficient for such as are lighter, the water having been incorporated with a small quantity of the liquor of the vat, because in the vat itself, however weak it might be, they would acquire too deep a tinge of blue. In this manner are the light shades of this colour, such as gilly-flower, peach blossom, &c., produced by diminishing the quantity of cochineal.\n\n390. There are various ways of imparting to silk whatever are denominated the false violets; but those let, which are most frequently used, and polished of greatest beauty, are prepared with archil, the bath of which is, in point of strength, to be suited to the colour required. Having been beetleed at the river after scouring, the silk is turned in the bath on the skein sticks; and when the colour is deemed sufficiently deep, a pattern is tried in the vat, to ascertain whether it takes the violet colour intended to be produced. If the shade is found to have acquired the proper depth, the silk is beetleed at the river and dipped in the vat, in the same way as for the fine violet colours; and let either of the blue or of the archil colour is given, according as it is meant that the red or blue shade of the violet colour should predominate.\n\n391. The process recommended by Guhlche for communicating a violet colour to silk is the following. A pound of silk is to be soaked in a bath of two ounces of alum, and a like quantity of solution of tin, after having carefully poured off the sediment formed in the mixture. The dye-bath is prepared with two ounces of cochineal reduced to powder with a dram of tartar, and the remaining part of the bath which has answered the purpose of a mordant, with the addition of a sufficient quantity of water. When slightly boiled, such a quantity of solution of indigo is added as may communicate\ncate to the bath a proper shade of violet; after which the silk is immersed, and boiled till it has acquired the intended shade. It is then wrung, washed in a stream, and like every other delicate colour, must be dried in the shade. The light shades exhaust the bath. But it ought to be observed, that this colour, which is said to be a beautiful violet, possesses little durability, and is apt to assume a reddish tinge, owing to the colour of the indigo fading first.\n\n392. A violet colour may be imparted to silks, by immersing them in water impregnated with verdigrise, as a substitute for aluming, and next giving them a bath of logwood, in which they assume a blue colour, which is converted to a violet, either by the addition of alum to the bath, or by dipping them in a weaker or stronger solution of that substance, which communicates a red colour to the particles of logwood. This violet possesses but a small degree of beauty, and little durability. But if alumed silk be immersed in a bath of brafil-wood, and next in a bath of archil, after washing it at the river, a colour is obtained possessing a much higher degree of beauty and intensity. The process described above (385.), for dyeing wool, succeeds equally well, according to M. Decroizille, in communicating to silk a violet colour.\n\nIII. Of Dyeing Cotton and Linen Violet.\n\n393. The most ordinary mode by which a violet colour is communicated to cotton and linen stuffs, is first to give them a blue ground in the vat, proportioned to the required shade, and to dry them. They are afterwards galled, in the proportion of three ounces of galls to a pound of stuff, and being left in this bath for 12 or 15 hours, are wrung out and dried again. They are next passed through a decoction of logwood, and when thoroughly soaked and taken out, the bath receives an addition of two drams of alum, and one of dissolved verdigrise for each pound of cotton or thread. The skeins are then dipped again on the skein sticks, and turned for about 5 minutes, when they are taken out and aired. They are next immersed in the bath for 15 minutes, taken out and wrung. To complete the process, the vat employed is emptied; half of the decoction of logwood not formerly made use of is now poured in, with the addition of two drams of alum, and the thread is again dipped in it till it has acquired the shade proposed, which must always regulate the strength or weakness of the decoction of logwood. This colour resists in a considerable degree the action of the air, but in point of permanency is much inferior to that which is obtained from the use of madder.\n\nSect. III. Of the Mixture of Yellow and Red, or Orange.\n\n394. Orange is the usual result of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of yellow and red colours, but an almost endless variety of shades may be produced, according as we vary the proportion of the ingredients, and the particular nature of the yellow used. It is sometimes the practice of dyers to combine blue with yellow and red, the result of which is the colour denominated olive. Many varieties may be obtained from the use of weld, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>-wort, dyers-weed, and other yellows, and by employing tartar, alum, sulphate of zinc, or sulphate of copper in the bath, or in the preparation of the Compound Colours.\n\nI. Of Dyeing Wool Orange.\n\n395. By a process exactly the same as that which is followed in communicating to stuffs a scarlet colour, an orange may be given to wool; but the quantity of red must be diminished, and that of the yellow increased. If wool is dyed a red colour by means of madder, and afterwards yellow with weld, the resulting compound is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CINNAMON\">cinnamon</a> colour, and the most proper mordant in this case is a mixture of alum and tartar. The shades may be varied at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> by substituting other yellow dye stuffs instead of weld, and by varying the proportions as circumstances may require. Wool may receive a reddish yellow colour by passing it through a madder bath, after it has undergone the usual process for yellow, which has already been described. The strength of the madder bath is always to be proportioned to the shade required. Brafil-wood is sometimes employed with yellow substances, or mixed with cochineal and madder. Snuff, chestnut, mulk, and other shades are produced, by substituting walnut-tree root, walnut peels or sumach, for weld.\n\nII. Of Dyeing Silk, Orange, &c.\n\n396. Logwood, brafil-wood, and fustic, communicate to silk a maroon and cinnamon colour, together &c., with all the intermediate shades. The silk is scoured in the usual manner, alumed, and a bath is prepared, by mixing together decoctions of the three different woods mentioned above, made separately, varying the quantity of each according to the shade intended to be given; but the proportion of fustic should be greatest. The silk is turned in the bath on the skein sticks, and when it is taken out, if the colour be uniform, it is wrung and again dipped in a second bath of these three ingredients, according to the effect produced by the first, in order to obtain the shade required.\n\n397. The blue vat is not made use of, when an olive colour is to be communicated to silk. After being alumed, it is dipped in a bath of weld, which is made very strong. To this is afterwards added the juice of logwood, with a small quantity of solution of alkali when the silk is dipped. This converts it into green, and gives the olive colour. It is dipped again in this bath till it has acquired the shade wanted.\n\n398. To communicate to it the colour known by the name of rotten olive, fustic and logwood are added to the bath after welding, without any alkali. If the colour wanted is to incline more to a red, the addition of logwood alone is sufficient. A sort of reddish olive may likewise be obtained, by dyeing the silk in a fustic bath, to which a greater or lesser quantity has been added of sulphate of iron and logwood.\n\nIII. Of Dyeing Cotton and Linen Orange, &c.\n\n399. A cinnamon colour is communicated to thread cinnamon and cotton, by commencing the process for dyeing colour, them with verdigrise and weld; they are afterwards to be dipped in a solution of sulphate of iron, denominated by the French bain d'affaiblissement, and then wrung out and dried. As soon as they are dried, they are galled in\nCompound the proportion of three ounces to the pound of stuff; then dried again, alumed as for red colours, and maddered. After being washed and dried, they are put into hot soap-flids, and turned till they have acquired a sufficient degree of brightness. It is the practice of some dyers to add to the aluming a decoction of fustic.\n\n400. By boiling four parts of weld and one of potash in a sufficient quantity of water, M. d'Apligny informs us, a fine olive colour is communicated to cotton and thread. Brazil wood which has been steeped for a night, is boiled separately with a small quantity of verdigris, and these solutions are mixed together in various proportions, according to the particular shade required. The thread or cotton is dipped in the compound solution in the usual way.\n\nSect. IV. Of the Mixture of Black with other Colours.\n\nThe compound colours which are obtained from the mixture of black and other colours, are brown, gray, drab, &c., according to the nature and proportions of the simple colours employed.\n\nI. Of Dyeing Woollen Stuffs Brown, Gray, &c.\n\n401. To give a browning to cloth, as soon as it has been dyed, it is dipped in a solution of sulphate of iron, with the addition of an astringent, which makes a black bath. It is more common to mix a small quantity of solution of iron with a bath of water, adding more till the dyed stuff dipped in it has received the intended shade. Sulphate of iron is sometimes added to the dye bath; but by dipping the dyed stuff in a solution of this salt, the end is more easily attained. It is the usual practice of M. Poerner to soak the stuff in a solution of sulphate of iron, to which other ingredients are sometimes added, and after having taken it out of the mordant, it is dipped in the dye bath.\n\n402. In order to obtain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COFFEE\">coffee</a> and damascene colours, with other shades of browns of the common dye, the first method is adopted; a colour more or less deep is communicated to them, according to the shade intended to be obtained by the browning; and a bath is made of galls, fumach, and alder bark, with the addition of sulphate of iron. Those stuffs are first dipped to which the lightest shades are to be communicated, and when these are finished, the browner ones are dipped; a quantity of sulphate of iron being added for each operation, proportioned to the effect intended to be produced.\n\n403. Blueish grays are communicated to stuffs, according to Poerner, by the solution of indigo in sulphuric acid, combined with a mixture of decoction of galls and sulphate of iron, varying the shades according to the different quantities of these ingredients made use of. If to a bath composed of cochineal, fustic and galls, sulphate of iron be added, other shades are obtained.\n\n404. For marone, and such other colours as bear a strong resemblance to it, saunders and galls are employed, and sometimes a browning, with the addition of logwood. If dyed in the remains of a cochineal bath, these colours may be made to incline to a crimson or purple, and the same effect is produced by adding a small quantity of madder or cochineal to the bath. A little tartar gives a greater degree of bright compoundness to the colour. With a mixture of galls, fustic, and logwood, and a greater or smaller quantity of madder, with the addition of a little alum, those colours may be communicated to stuffs which are known by the name of hazel.\n\n405. M. Guhliche produces what is called a puce co-puce colour, by boiling for fifteen minutes a pound of woollen stuff with two ounces of alum, a certain proportion of vinegar and solution of iron, after which he leaves it in the mordant for twelve hours. He then makes a bath with the decoction of two ounces of white galls carefully poured off from the sediment, and mixed with four ounces of madder, in which, when it grows hot, the stuff is immersed, after being taken out of the mordant, allowing it to remain there, while the temperature is gradually increased, till the colour intended has been imparted to it; after which it is boiled for two minutes, washed, and dried in the sun. The colour thus obtained possesses a great degree of durability. It is of a deeper brown by the omission of the alum and vinegar in the mordant; and after these colours the lighter shades are dyed. Sumach may be employed as a substitute for half of the madder. Different brown colours possessing considerable permanency, may likewise be produced by the use of brazil and logwood, if more or less of a solution of iron be mixed with a decoction of these substances. The wool being previously alumed and galled, is dyed in it.\n\nII. Of Dyeing Silk with Mixtures of Black, &c.\n\n406. M. Guhliche imparts to silk a purple violet purple without a blue ground, with a mixture of one part of galls dissolved in white wine, with three parts of water, in which a pound of silk is macerated for twelve hours, soaked in a mordant made up of two ounces of alum, one ounce of solution of tin, and half an ounce of muriatic acid. After wringing the stuff, it is dyed in a bath composed of two ounces of cochineal and a small quantity of solution of iron, till the intended shade has been communicated; and for shades which are lighter, the residue of these baths are sufficient, either separately or mixed together. Madder may be used in the same way, macerating a pound of silk in a solution of alum, mixed with an ounce of muriatic acid, and a quantity of solution of iron. When the stuff is wrung out, it is dyed in a bath made of eight ounces of madder. When deeper colours are wanted, some of the solution of galls in white wine is mixed with the madder and cochineal baths.\n\n407. Silk may be dyed in a bath made of equal parts of brazil and logwood juice, adding a certain quantity of solution of iron, after the stuff has been soaked in a solution of two ounces of alum, and an ounce of muriatic acid. If solution of galls be added, the colour becomes deeper.\n\nColours resembling that of brick, may be produced, by immersing silk in an annatta bath, after preparing it with a solution of galls mixed with a certain quantity of solution of iron. By the mixture of brazil, logwood, archil, and galls, and by a browning with sulphate of iron, a number of different shades are produced; but the whole of them have more or less\nIII. Of Dyeing Silk with Mixtures of Black, &c.\n\n408. A permanent violet colour may be given to thread and cotton, when scoured in the ordinary way, by preparing a mordant with two quarts of the bath of what is called the black caulk, and four quarts of water for each pound of stuff, which is made to boil, and the scum is removed which forms on the surface, till it wholly disappears. The liquor is poured into a vat, and when warm, four ounces of sulphate of copper and one ounce of nitre are dissolved in it. The skeins are left to soak in it for ten or twelve hours, wrung out, and dried. If it is required to produce a deep violet colour, two ounces of verdigris must be added to the bath; and if the nitre be omitted, the colour becomes still deeper by galling the thread more or less, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIOR\">prior</a> to its being put into the mordant. If the nitre be increased, and the sulphate of copper diminished, the violet colour becomes more inclined to lilac. A number of various shades may be produced, by different modifications of the mordants employed.\n\n409. Cotton is galled, dipped, and wrought in the common way, when different shades of maroon colour are wanted. To the bath employed must be added more or less of the liquor of the black caulk. The cotton is then washed in a bath mixed with verdigris, next welded, and dyed to a fulvic bath, to which a solution of soda and alum is sometimes added. When the cotton prepared in this manner has been thoroughly washed, it is next well maddered, dipped in a weak solution of sulphate of copper, and last of all in soap suds.\n\n410. For some hazel and snuff colours, a browning is communicated to stuffs by means of root, after the welding and madder bath, to which galls and fulvic have been added; sometimes root is mixed with this bath, and a browning is likewise imparted by means of a solution of sulphate of iron; and for browning colours, walnut peels are sometimes employed as a substitute for solutions of iron. For such wools as are designed for the manufacture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TAPESTRY\">tapestry</a>, they are very advantageous, because the colour is not changed into yellow by exposure to the air, as is the case in browning which is imparted by means of iron; but remains a considerable time without any sensible change. The hue is indeed rather dull; but its goodliness and very moderate price are sufficient to recommend a more extensive use of it for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a> colours, which in common stuffs are sometimes fashionable.\n\nCHAP. III. Of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALICO\">Calico</a>-printing.\n\n411. This may be defined to be the art of communicating different colours to particular spots on the surface of cotton or linen cloth, while the rest of the stuff retains its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> white colour.\n\nThe wonderful and truly ingenious art of calico-printing seems to have been first known in India, and for more than two centuries before the commencement of the Christian era. Although the Egyptians were well acquainted with this art in the days of Pliny, as he himself informs us, it can scarcely be doubted that they derived the knowledge of it from India, as that country rather than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, produced the colouring and other materials for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> it on. If we consider its present improved state, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a> of different patterns, the beauty and durability of the colours which can now be imparted to cotton or linen stuffs, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISPATCH\">dispatch</a> with which the various operations of this art are conducted, we must be astonished at the rapidity of its improvements, when we recollect that it has been known in Europe for little more than a century. Perhaps no other art has risen to such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> in so short a period.\n\n412. Our readers will not expect that our account of this subject should be tedious or elaborate, since the art is presumed to be already acquainted with the different processes which are employed in calico-printing; and to such as with only for a general knowledge of the art, in a theoretical point of view, prolixity would be disagreeable.\n\n413. The art of calico-printing consists in impregnating Nature of with a mordant, such parts of cotton or linen stuffs as this art are to have particular colours communicated to them, and then dyeing them in the usual manner with some colouring substance. Those parts of the cloth only which receive the mordant are intimately united with the colouring matter, although the whole surface must be more or less tinged; but the parts which have not received the mordant are restored to their original brightness by means of washing, and afterwards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BLEACHING\">bleaching</a> it upon the grats for some days, taking care to turn the wrong side towards the sun. If red stripes are to be communicated to a piece of white cotton cloth, those parts of its surface on which the stripes are intended to appear, are marked out by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> dipped in acetate of alumina; after which it is dyed with madder in the usual way. When it is first taken out of the dyeing vessel, its whole surface is red, but when it is washed and bleached, it resumes its original whiteness, the stripes only excepted which, being impregnated with the acetate of alumina, remain red. By a similar process may yellow or any other stripes be fixed upon cotton or linen, by the substitution of quercitron bark, weld, &c., in the room of madder.\n\n414. When different parts of the cloth are to receive different coloured stripes at the same time, different morinate dyes must be employed. If stripes are delineated on different colours with the acetates of alumina and iron, and if it be then dyed with madder in the ordinary way, it will, after being washed and bleached as formerly directed, exhibit stripes of a red and brown colour. If the same mordants are employed, but quercitron bark used instead of madder, the stripes will then be yellow, and olive or drab.\n\n415. The mordants known by the names of acetate of alumina and acetate of iron, which are made use of in calico-printing, may either be applied to stuffs with a pencil, as already mentioned, or still more expeditiously by means of blocks, on which the intended patterns are cut. Being designed only for particular parts of the surface of the cloth, great caution is necessary to prevent them from spreading to any part of it which is to remain white, and to prevent their interference when the application of more than one is required. Such a degree of confidence must of consequence be given to the mordants employed, as will prevent this disagreeable effect, which cannot fail to destroy the beauty and...\nand elegance of the print. If blocks are to be made use of, the mordants may be brought to a proper consistence by means of tarich; but gum arabic must be mixed with them, when the pencil is to be employed. The thickness should not exceed what is absolutely necessary to prevent the mordants from spreading; because, if carried too far, the cotton is frequently not saturated with the mordant, in consequence of which the dye is but imperfectly communicated.\n\n416. To distinguish those parts of the cloth which are impregnated with mordants, it is a common practice to give the mordants some particular tinge by which they may be known; and for this purpose printers commonly make use of the decoction of brasil wood. Dr Bancroft objects to this practice, because he is of opinion that the process of dyeing is impeded by the colouring matter of brasil wood. The affinity of the dye stuff for the mordant displaces the colouring matter of the brasil wood; and without such affinity it would be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to strike the colour. Some of the dye-stuff to be employed afterwards is recommended by Dr Bancroft for colouring the mordant, who prohibits the use of a larger quantity than what is sufficient to render it indistinguishable when an application of it is made to the cloth. Should too large a quantity be united with the mordant, a considerable proportion of the latter would be combined with colouring matter, by which means its affinity for the cloth would be diminished, and therefore a permanent colour could not be expected to result from such a partial combination.\n\n417. It is necessary to dry the cloth completely after the application of the mordants, for which purpose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> heat may be employed, which has a tendency to promote the separation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ACETOUS\">acetous</a> acid from its base, and assist its evaporation, and thus the combination of the mordant with the cloth will be facilitated.\n\n418. When the cloth is thoroughly dried, it is customary to wash it with warm water and cow-dung, till every particle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STARCH\">starch</a> or gum arabic which had been employed to give a proper consistence to the mordants, and those parts of them which do not combine with the cloth, are entirely removed. The loose particles of the mordant are entangled by means of the cow-dung, and prevented from being attached to those parts of the cloth which are to remain white. After this, it must be completely rinsed in pure water.\n\nColouring matters employed.\n\n419. Indigo, madder, quercitron bark, and weld, are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> dying ingredients made use of by calico-printers; but the last of these is seldom used by the printers of this country, except for the purpose of communicating yellows of a delicate greenish shade. Quercitron bark, on account of its inferior price, and capacity of imparting colours equally good, as well as requiring a less degree of heat, is employed as a substitute. It is usual to apply indigo at once, either by means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol3.html#article-BLOCK\">block</a> or pencil, because it requires not the intervention of a mordant to fix it. This preparation is made by boiling together indigo, potash reduced to the caustic state by means of quicklime, and orpiment; afterwards thickening the solution with gum. Dr Bancroft recommends the use of coarse brown <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> as a substitute for orpiment, which operates as powerfully in the decomposition of the indigo, and in promoting its solubility, answering at the same time all the purposes of gum.\n\n420. When the cloth is thoroughly cleaned after it has been impregnated with the mordant, the dyeing process is conducted in the usual manner. As the whole of it receives a tinge of the dye, it must be completely washed and bleached for some days on the grats, as formerly mentioned, by which means the colour is entirely removed from those parts of the cotton not impregnated with the mordant, while all the other parts of it retain the colouring matter as powerfully as at first.\n\n421. One of the most common colours imparted to Nankeen cotton <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol17.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a> is a species of nankeen yellow of different shades, and for the most part in stripes or spots. It is produced by means of a block on which is cut the intended pattern, rubbed over with acetate of iron brought to a proper consistence with gum or starch, and applied to the cotton; which, being dried and cleansed in the ordinary way, is immersed in a ley of potash. It is proper to observe, that the quantity of acetate of iron must be proportioned to the particular shade required.\n\n422. In order to produce a yellow colour, the block is yellow, rubbed over with acetate of alumina; and the cloth, after being impregnated with this mordant, is dyed with quercitron bark in the common manner, and then bleached.\n\n423. If madder be substituted for the quercitron bark, Red, a red colour is given to cotton by the same process.\n\n424. To communicate to fluffs the fine light blue colours Blue, which we frequently behold upon cotton, the block is rubbed over with a composition consisting partly of wax, by means of which all those parts of its surface are to remain white. It is next dyed in a cold vat of indigo, and when it is dried, the wax composition may be removed by the use of hot water.\n\n425. Lilac and blackish brown colours are communicated by acetate of iron, proportioning the quantity to the particular shade required, and adding a little fumach for such shades as are to be very deep. The cotton is then dyed with madder and bleached in the usual manner. Dove colour and drab are produced by means of acetate of iron and quercitron bark.\n\n426. When a variety of different colours are to be made on the same print, a greater number of operations is necessary. Upon each of the blocks is cut that particular part of the pattern which is to have one appropriate colour; and when these blocks are rubbed over with their respective mordants and thus applied to the cloth, the dyeing process is afterwards conducted in the ordinary manner. If, for example, three different blocks are to be made use of, the first rubbed over with acetate of alumina brought to a proper consistence, the second with acetate of iron, and the third with a composition of these two, the colours resulting, after the dyeing and bleaching processes are finished, will be the following.\n\n- Acetate of alumina yellow,\n- Iron olive, drab, dove.\n- From the compound olive green, olive.\n\nIt is proper to observe, that these are the results when quercitron bark is employed; but by the substitution of madder the following colours will be obtained.\n\nAcetate\nAcetate of alumina red,\niron brown, black.\n\nFrom the compound purple.\n\nWhen it is required to produce at the same time both those colours which are imparted by madder, and likewise by the use of quercitron bark, mordants are first applied for one part of the pattern, after which the cotton is dyed in a bath of madder, and then bleached. The rest of the mordants are then applied in a similar manner, after which the cotton is dyed with the quercitron bark, and bleached as before. The colours which the madder communicates are very little affected by the second dyeing, because the mordants by which their permanency is secured, are previously saturated. A new mordant may be applied to some of the colours resulting from the use of madder, by which means they receive a new durable colour from the bark. And by means of the indigo liquor other new colours may still be communicated after the last bleaching.\n\n427. The following colours may be communicated to cotton, by means of the different processes which have been described.\n\nMadder Dye.\n\n| Acetate of alumina | red, |\n|-------------------|-----|\n| iron              | brown, black, lilac, purple |\n\nBark Dye.\n\n| Acetate of alumina | yellow, |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| iron              | dove, drab, olive, orange |\n\nIndigo Dye.\n\n| Indigo            | blue, |\n|------------------|-------|\n| Indigo and yellow | green |\n\nThus may twelve different colours be communicated to the same print by these different processes.\n\n428. If durable colours could be directly applied to cotton by means of the block or pencil, without the help of mordants, nothing could be conceived more simple than the art of calico-printing; but with the single exception of indigo, the communicating of permanent colours requires the process of dyeing. Yellow, indeed, which is a compound colour, and some others, may be communicated to cotton at once, by mixing together an infusion of quercitron bark and acetate of alumina, while the same mordant with a decoction of madder, imparts to it a red colour; but those which are produced in this way are far from being durable, since they are destroyed by washing, and sometimes even by exposure to the air.\n\n429. But as it is not always practicable for calico-printers to avoid the application of colours in this manner, every endeavour to give them a greater degree of permanency becomes an object of importance. The following composition has been recommended for a yellow printing colour. Three pounds of alum, and three ounces of pure chalk are to be dissolved in a gallon of hot water, to which are to be added two pounds of acetate of lead. This mixture is to be occasionally stirred for 24 or 36 hours, after which it is to remain at rest during 12 hours. The clear liquor is then to be poured off, and as much more hot water added to the residuum, as will, after being stirred and allowed to settle, amount to three quarts when added to the first quantity. Into a tinned copper vessel put five pounds, or at most a quantity not exceeding eight pounds, of quercitron bark sufficiently ground, and boil it for an hour in four or five gallons of clean soft water, adding afterwards a little more water if the bark is not properly covered. When the liquor is thoroughly boiled, let it be removed from the fire, and left to settle for half an hour, when the clear decoction is to be poured off through a fine sieve. Six quarts more of pure water are then to be put upon the same bark, and boiled for a quarter of an hour, being previously well stirred. When it has stood a sufficient time to settle, the clear liquor is to be strained off, and being mixed with the former, both are put into a shallow wide vessel to be evaporated by boiling, till the whole, in addition to the mordant already mentioned, and the gum or paste for bringing it to a proper consistence, does not exceed three gallons. It will be proper not to add the three quarts of aluminous mordant till the decoction has been cooled down almost to the natural heat of blood. Let gum arabic or gum fenegal be taken for thickening, if the pencil is to be used, and starch or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLOUR\">flour</a> when blocks are to be employed.\n\n430. If a pound of muriatic sulphate of tin be used as for bright a substitute for the aluminous mordant in the composition described above, a mixture will be produced which is capable of imparting to cotton a very bright yellow, and considerably permanent.\n\n431. A cinnamon colour possessed also of a sufficient degree of permanency may be given to cotton, by means of a mixture of sulphate of tin and a decoction of the quercitron bark.\n\n432. If the decoctions of this bark and of logwood Green are boiled together, and proper quantities of sulphate of copper and verdigris added to them, together with a small proportion of carbonate of potash, there results a compound which communicates to cotton a green colour. Although the expectations of Dr Bancroft were not fully answered by the trials which he made of this substance, he deemed his success sufficient to encourage him to a farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of it.\n\n433. A permanent drab colour may be given to cotton by means of acetate of iron mixed with a decoction of quercitron bark, and reduced to a proper consistence. This mixture will also produce an olive, if added to the olive colouring liquor already mentioned; and the colours may be made still more permanent, if a solution of iron in diluted nitric or muriatic acid be used as a substitute for iron liquor. They ought, however, to be used sparingly and with caution, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a> of the cotton or linen to which they are applied may not be injured.\n\n434. Dr Bancroft made a number of experiments with the decoction of quercitron bark, to ascertain its effects when combined with different metallic salts as mordants. The sulphate, nitrate, and muriate of zinc, the quercitron decoction, yielded brownish yellow colours of different shades; but none of them were found sufficiently permanent when they were applied topically to linen or cotton. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">Mercury</a> in the different acids produced","sp":41,"ep":61},{"h":"DYEING","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">Method</a> of Dyeing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">Red</a>.\n\nduced with the decoction of bark different shades of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> yellowish brown colours; but they did not prove more durable than the former.

Nitrate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> with the same decoction gave by topical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> a drab <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> which was not less durable than the former. Nitrate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BISMUTH\">bismuth</a> produced with the decoction of bark a very full and strong brownish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>. This colour, however, is attended with the inconvenience of becoming almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> when exposed to the action of the alkaline sulphurates, sulphurated hydrogen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAS\">gas</a>, or even by the action of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>. Muriate of bismuth with the decoction gives a drab colour; sulphate of the same metal affords a yellow; but these colours when applied to cotton or linen are not durable. Nitro-muriate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTIMONY\">antimony</a> produced with the decoction of bark something of a fluff colour, which applied to linen and cotton possesses some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of durability. Nitrate and muriate of cobalt with the quercitron bark gave different shades of brown; but these colours were extremely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUGITIVE\">fugitive</a>; they soon faded by exposure to the sun and air.\n\n435. The art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALICO\">calico</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINTING\">printing</a> has been hitherto almost solely limited to linens and cottons. Many colouring matters have such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a> for these stuffs that they readily enter into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> with them at the ordinary temperature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>. This is also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">silk</a>, so that colouring matters might be applied topically to the latter by means of similar operations as to linen and cotton. Attempts, however, woollen have been made to extend the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of topical dyeing stuffs printing to woollen stuffs, and particularly those kinds known by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of kerfeymeres, which are employed after being prepared in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> for waistcoat patterns. When it is recollected that woollen stuffs when they are to be dyed generally must be exposed to a considerable degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, it is easy to conceive that it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be difficult to communicate spots or figures by printing to woollen stuffs. The means by which this difficulty is obviated in those manufactures where this operation is conducted have been hitherto kept secret. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of colouring matters, whether such as may be employed simply or require the use of mortants to fix them, will be easily understood from what we have already fully detailed in the course of this treatise. The application of the colours is made in the usual way; and it is said that, after the woollen stuffs are printed, they are wrapped up in two or three folds of thick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, to prevent the access of moisture which might cause the colours to run, and exposed to the <a class=\"xref\"

Jour. de l'Ecole Polytechnique, the author thus speaks. \"Some important knowledge, says he, might be acquired, had we the easy means of ascertaining, in a comparative manner, our relative strengths at the different periods of life, and in different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>. Buffon and Gueneau, who had some excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> this subject, requested me to endeavour to invent a portable machine, which, by an easy and simple mechanism, might conduct to a solution of this question, on which they were then engaged. These philosophers were acquainted with that invented by Graham, and improved by Dr Defaguliers, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>; but this machine, constructed of wooden-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, was too bulky and heavy to be portable; and, besides, to make experiments on the different parts of the body, several machines were necessary, each suited to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> required to be tried. They were acquainted also with the dynanometer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITIZEN\">Citizen</a> Leroy of the Academy of Sciences at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>. It consisted of a metal tube 10 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 12 inches in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, placed vertically on a foot like that of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLESTICK\">candlestick</a>, and containing in the inside a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRAL\">spiral</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, having above it a graduated shank terminating in a globe. This shank, together with the spring, sunk into the tube in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> acting upon it, and thus pointed out, in degrees, the strength of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> who pressed on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>.\n\nThis instrument, though <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a>, did not appear sufficient however to Buffon and Gueneau; for they wished not merely to ascertain the muscular force of a finger or hand, but to estimate that of each limb separately, and of all the parts of the body. I shall not here give an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the attempts I made to fulfil the wishes of these two philosophers, but only observe, that in the course of my experiments I had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to be convinced that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of the instrument was not so easy as might have been expected. Besides the use which an enlightened naturalist may make of this machine, it may be possible to apply it to many other important purposes. For example, it may be employed with advantage to determine the strength of draught cattle; and, above all, to try that of horses, and compare it with the strength of other animals. It may serve to make known how far the assistance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>-constructed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> may favour the movement of a carriage, and what is its vis inertiae in proportion to the load. We might appreciate by it, also, what resistance the slope of a mountain opposes to a carriage, and be able to judge whether a carriage is sufficiently loaded in proportion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of horses that are to be yoked to it. In the arts, it may be applied to machines of which we wish to ascertain the resistance, and when we are desirous to calculate the moving force that ought to be adapted to them. It may serve, also, as a Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> to weigh burdens. In short, nothing would be easier than to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> it into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANEMOMETER\">anemometer</a>, to discover the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> force of the wind, by fitting to it a frame of a determined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> filled up with wax-cloth; and it would not be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to ascertain by this machine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOIL\">recoil</a> of fire-arms, and consequently the strength of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GUN\">gun</a>-powder.\n\nThis dynanometer, in its form and size, has a near resemblance to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAPHOMETER\">graphometer</a>. It consists of a spring twelve inches in length, bent into the form of an ellipse; from the middle of which arises a semicircular piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a>, having engraved upon it the different degrees that express a force of the power acting on the spring. The whole of this machine, which weighs only two pounds and a half, opposes, however, more resistance than may be necessary to determine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the strongest and most robust <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>.\" For a fuller description, see Phil. Mag. vol. i.","sp":109,"ep":109},{"h":"DYNAMICS","t":"1. Dynamics is that branch of physico-mathematical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> which includes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> doctrine of moving forces; that is, the necessary results of the relations of our thoughts concerning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, the immediate causes of motion, and its changes.\n\n2. Motion and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> properties are the first and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>. This science indeed presupposes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of motion; and we may consider it as universally admitted and recognized. With regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of motion, however, philosophers are greatly divided in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>. The most obvious and simplest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of motion is the successive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of the moving body to the different parts of indefinite space, which are considered as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of the body. This idea of motion supposes a space whose parts are penetrable and immoveable; a doctrine directly contrary to that of the followers of Des Cartes, who regarded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> as one and the same thing. To have a distinct idea of motion, it seems requisite to conceive two kinds of extension; the one, which is considered as impenetrable, and which constitutes what we properly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> matter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> body; the other, which being simply considered as extended, without taking any other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of one body from another; and whose parts being supposed fixed and immoveable, enable us to judge of the rest or motion of bodies. We may therefore conceive bodies to be placed in indefinite space, whether real or supposed; and motion as a change in the state or condition of a body from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of space to another. We must indeed consider motion as a state or condition of existence of a body, which would remain till it is changed by some cause; otherwise we could not have any idea of motion in the abstract. From the changes which we observe, we infer agency in nature; and in these changes we are to discover what we know of their causes.\n\n3. In mechanical disquisitions, the simplest, and at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> the most usual conception of space, is mere extension. We think only of the distance between two places. The path along which any body moves in passing from one place or point in space to another, is said figuratively to be the path described by that body. Space is considered by the geometer not only as having <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> but also breadth. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> it is called a surface. But to have a more complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of the capacities of any portion of space, thickness, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as length and breadth, is taken into consideration. This is called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> space. By this, however, is meant only the susceptibility of measure in three ways, or extension of three dimensions. The adjacent parts or portions of space are distinguished from each other by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> boundaries. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">Contiguous</a> portions of a line are separated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>; contiguous portions of a surface are separated by lines; and contiguous portions of a solid are separated by surfaces. The boundaries of any portions of space are not to be considered as parts of the contiguous portions. They must be conceived as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to both; as the places where one portion ends and another begins. Space cannot be said to have any bounds or limits; it is therefore said to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> or unbounded.\n\n4. Any portion of space may be considered in relation to its place or situation among other portions of space. This portion of space which is occupied by any body has been called the relative place of that body. But this portion of space may be considered as a determinate portion of infinite space; and this portion of infinite space occupied by any body has been called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> place of that body. Space, it is obvious, taken in this meaning, is immoveable; for it cannot be conceived that this identical portion of space can be removed from one place to another. The body which occupies that space may be removed, but the space remains. We have no perception of the absolute space of any object. This may be illustrated by the motion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> or that of a ship. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CABIN\">cabin</a> of a ship does not consider the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> as changing its place while it remains fixed to the same spot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the deck. While a mountain is observed to retain the same situation among other objects, few persons think that it changes its place.\n\n5. The idea of time is acquired by means of the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> in observing the succession of events, time. We conceive time as unbounded, continuous, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMOGENEOUS\">homogeneous</a>, unchangeable in the order of its parts, and infinitely divisible. It is conceived as a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> made up of its own parts, and measured by them. But as the relation of the parts of time is unknown, the only means which we can employ to discover this relation, is to find out some other relation which is more obvious and better known, to which it may be compared. We shall then have discovered the simplest measure of time, if we compare in the simplest manner possible the relation of the parts of time with those relations which are most familiar. Hence it follows, that uniform motion is the simplest measure of time. For, on the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, the relation of the parts of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> line is that which is most easily conceived; and, on the other hand, there are no relations more susceptible of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> with each other than equal relations. Now, in uniform motion, the relation of the parts of time is equal to that of the corresponding parts of the line described. Uniform motion then gives us at once, both the means of comparing the relation of the parts of time with that which is most obvious to our senses, and also of making this comparison in the simplest manner. In uniform motion, then, we find the simplest measure of time. It may be added, that the measure of time by uniform motion, is independent of its simplicity, that which is the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to think of employing. Indeed as there is no relation with which we are acquainted more accurate than that of the parts of space; and, as in general, a motion, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of which is given, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to discover the relation of the parts of time, by the known <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> with that of the parts of space passed over, it is evident that such a motion would be the most accurate measure of time, and","sp":65,"ep":66},{"h":"DYNAMICS","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">Motion</a> and that which ought to be employed in preference to every other. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> measurement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, some event which is imagined always to require an equal time for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a> is selected; and this time is employed as a unit of time <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>, in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> as a foot rule is employed as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a>. During any observed operation, as often as this event is accomplished, so often is it supposed that the time of the operation contains this unit. While a heavy body falls 16 feet, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a>, 39\u00bd inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, makes one vibration; but it makes three vibrations, while the same body falls 144 feet. It is therefore said that the time of a body falling 144 feet, is thrice as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> as the time of falling 16 feet.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">PART</a> I. OF MOTION.\n\nBEFORE we enter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the consideration of the different kinds of motion, it may be necessary to notice some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> circumstances regarding it.\n\n7. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to conceive that any motion can be instantaneous. A moving body, in passing from the beginning to the end of its path, must pass through all the intermediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>. Now to suppose the motion along even the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> portions of the space passed through instantaneous, is to suppose that the moving body is in every intervening point at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a>; which is impossible.\n\n8. Relative motion is the change of situation with regard to other objects. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">Absolute</a> motion is the change of absolute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. These two motions, it may be observed, may not only be different, but even contrary to each other. From the relative motions of things which are the differences of their absolute motions, we cannot find out what are the absolute motions. It is often a subject of elaborate and intricate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> to discover and determine the absolute motions, by means of observing the relative motions.\n\n9. The affections or circumstances of motion are various with regard to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. That affection of motion by which the quantity is determined, is called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of the line, which is uniformly described or passed over during some given portion or unit of time, is the proper measure of this velocity. When a ship sails six miles per <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, she describes a length of line equal to six miles in the space of a given portion or unit of time, namely, the hour; and thus the velocity of the ship is said to be ascertained.\n\n10. Another affection or circumstance of motion is its direction. This is the position of the straight line along which the motion is performed. The straight line which a body describes or tends to describe is called its direction. The motion is said to be in the direction AB fig. 1, when the body moved passes along the line AB from A to B. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, it is not unusual to express the direction of motion in a manner quite the reverse of this. We have an instance of this kind in speaking of the direction of the winds. A current of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> or wind which moves eastward is said to be a westerly wind, deriving its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> from the point or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> from which it proceeds, not as in other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, and in strict <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, from the point to which it is directed.\n\n6. Between the affections of time and space, there is an obvious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a>; and hence in most languages the same words are employed to express the affections between both. Thus it is that time may be represented by the lines and measured by motion; since uniform motion is of the simplest succession of events that can be conceived, time and space. In the order of situation, all things are placed in space, in the order of succession all events happen in time.\n\nHaving made these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRELIMINARY\">preliminary</a> observations, we propose to divide the following treatise into two parts. In the first, we shall consider motion in general. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, we shall treat of moving forces, or of dynamics.\n\n11. Motions are of different kinds. They are either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTILINEAR\">rectilinear</a>, rectilineal, deflected, or curvilinear. In a rectilinear motion, the direction remains unchanged during the whole time that the motion is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, as when a body moves from A to B fig. 1. In a deflected motion, it is performed along two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> straight lines in succession. Thus if a body moves from A to B fig. 2, and at the point B its direction is changed from that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AD\">AD</a> to BC; this change has been called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFLECTION\">deflection</a>, the quantity of which may be measured either by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> DBC, or by a line DC drawn from the point D to which the body would have arrived in the same time, if its motion had remained unchanged, in which it has actually reached the point C. When a body in moving along describes the sides of a polygon, the deflections are repeated, with the intervention of undeflected motions. In curvilinear motion the deviation and deflection are supposed to be continual. Continual deflection therefore constitutes curvilinear motion. Let the motion be performed along a curve line ABCDE (fig. 3.), the direction is continually changing. When the body is in the point C the direction is that of the tangent CF; because this direction alone lies between any pair of polygonal directions, such as CE and CA, or CB and CD, however near the points A and E, or B and D, are taken to the point C.\n\n12. Motions have been divided into uniform motions, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of variable, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a>, and curvilinear. These we shall consider separately in the following sections.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">SECT</a>. I. Of Uniform Motion.\n\n13. It is of great importance in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> disputes, to have the characters of uniform or unchanged fixed motion fixed. For in our conceptions of motion in general, in which we do not turn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to its alterations, the motion is supposed to be equable and rectilineal. By the deviations from such motion only can we determine the marks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of all changes; and hence also we are to obtain the measures of all changing causes, or in other words of the mechanical powers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>.\n\nPROPOSITION I.\n\n14. In uniform motions, the velocities are in the proportions of the spaces described in the same or in equal times;\ntimes; or as it is sometimes expressed, The velocities are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the spaces described in equal times.\n\nThe spaces described are the measures of the velocities, and things are proportional to their measure. Let the spaces described in the time $T_s$ be represented by $S$ and $s$, and let the velocities be represented by $V$ and $v$. We have the analogy $V : v = S : s$. Or, as it may be expressed by the proportional equation\n\n$$\\frac{v}{s} = \\frac{V}{S}.$$  \n\n**Prop. II.**\n\n15. In uniform motions with equal velocities, the times are in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of the spaces described during their currency. Or, as it is also expressed, The times are proportional to the spaces described with equal velocities.\n\nFor in uniform motions, equal spaces are described in equal times. The successive portions of time therefore are equal, in which equal spaces are described in succession; and the sums of the equal times must be proportional to the corresponding sums of equal spaces. In all cases, therefore, which are susceptible of being represented by numbers, this proposition is evident. And it may be extended to all other cases, in a way similar to that in which Euclid has demonstrated that triangles of equal bases are in the proportion of their sides.\n\n16. As proportion can only take place between quantities of the same kind, all that is to be understood by the expressions in the above propositions, which are far from being accurate, is, that the proportions of the velocities and the times are the same with the proportions of the spaces. For as space and time are quantities of a different nature, it is evident that we cannot divide space by time. Thus when it is said that the velocities are as the spaces divided by the times, it is an abridged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of expression, which signifies that the velocities are as the relations of the spaces to the same common measure, divided by the relations of the times to the same measure. Thus, for example, if we take a foot for the measure of the spaces, and a minute for the measure of the times, the velocities of two bodies which move uniformly, are to each other as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of feet described, divided by the number of minutes which the bodies require to describe the portion of space passed through, and not as the feet divided by the minutes.\n\n17. Hence it is that uniform motion is universally employed as a measure of time. But it is often difficult to find out whether the motion which is proposed for the measure of time be perfectly uniform. What then are the means to ascertain this? To this it may be answered that there is no motion which is not uniform, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of which we can determine exactly; so that this difficulty only proves that we cannot ascertain the relation of the parts of time with mathematical precision; but it does not follow that uniform motion from its nature may not be the first and simplest measure. And having no strictly accurate measure of time, we endeavour to discover the measure which comes nearest in the motions which approach nearest to uniformity.\n\n18. There are three ways by which it may be ascertained that a motion is nearly uniform. 1. When the moving body describes equal spaces in times which we judge to be equal; and we can determine that the times are equal, after having observed from repeated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> that similar events take place in the same times. Thus we conclude that the times which the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLEPSYDRA\">clepsydra</a> requires to be emptied are equal; so also the times in which the same quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> runs in the sandglass; the times in which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a> moves over the same space on the sundial; the times of the same number of vibrations of a pendulum of the same length; and the times of the revolution of the heavenly bodies through the same spaces are equal. If then it is found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> that a body during the same times passes over equal spaces, we conclude that the motion is uniform. 2. Another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of ascertaining how far any motion is uniform, is when the effect of the accelerating or retarding cause, if such operate, is imperceptible. It is by combining these two methods that we conclude the motion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> round its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a> to be uniform; and this inference is not only not opposed by any of the celestial phenomena, but seems to be in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCORD\">accord</a> with them. 3. By a third method of determining the uniformity of any motion, we compare it with others; and when the same law is observed in both the one and the other, we may conclude that the motion compared is uniform. Thus if several bodies move at such a rate that the spaces described in the same time are always to each other, either precisely or very nearly so, in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a>, the motion of these bodies, we conclude, is either precisely, or at least very nearly uniform. For if a body A which moves uniformly passes through the space E during the time T taken at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, and another body B also moving uniformly, passes through the space e; during the same time T, the relation of the spaces E, e <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be always the same, whether the two bodies have begun to move in the same or in different instants; and it is only to uniform motion that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> belongs. Wherefore if we divide the time into parts, whether equal or unequal, and if it be observed that the spaces passed through by two bodies during one part of the time, are always in the same relation, the greater the number the parts of the time taken, the more there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> to conclude that the motion of each body is uniform. None of these methods, it has been observed, possesses geometrical precision; but they are sufficient, especially when they are repeated and taken together, to afford a satisfactory conclusion, if not with regard to absolute uniformity of motion, at least with regard to a near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a> to uniform motion.\n\n**Prop. III.**\n\n19. In uniform motions, the spaces described are in the compound ratio of the velocities and the ratio of the times. This proposition is frequently expressed otherwise thus; The spaces described with an uniform motion are proportional to the products of the times and the velocities: Or otherwise thus; The spaces described with a uniform motion are proportional to the rectangles of the times and the velocities.\n\nFor let $S$ be the space described with the velocity $V$, in the time $T$, and let $s$ be the space described with the velocity $v$, in the time $t$. Let another space $Z$ be described in the time $T$ with the velocity $v$.\n\nThen by proposition 1st we have $S : Z = V : v$,\n\nAnd by proposition 2nd $Z : s = T : t$.\nSect.

In 30 and 35, \\( s \\) does not represent a space uniformly described. But \\( S : s \\) expresses the ultimate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of \\( S' \\) to \\( s' \\) when they are diminished continually, and vanish together. Therefore the meaning of the equation\n\n\\[ s = vt \\]\n\nis that the ultimate ratio of \\( S' \\) to \\( s' \\) is the same with that of \\( VT' \\) to \\( vt' \\).\n\n32. The following is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> of this proposition.\n\nIf the abscissa \\( a d \\) of the line \\( e f h \\), represent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> along the line \\( ABD \\), and if the ordinates \\( a c, b f, c g, \\ldots \\) be as the velocities in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> \\( A, B, C, \\ldots \\), then the areas are as the spaces described. This is proved by an indirect <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a>, thus:\n\nFor if the spaces \\( AB, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AD\">AD</a> \\), be not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the areas \\( a b f e, a d h e \\), they must be proportional to some other, \\( a b f' e, a d h' e \\), of another line \\( e f' h' \\), passing through \\( e \\). Assuming this to be true, then (by Propof. 6.) the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> in \\( A \\) is to that in \\( B \\), as \\( a c \\) to \\( b f \\). Therefore \\( a c : b f = a e : b f \\), which is absurd.\n\n33. The relation between the space described and the time which elapses is the only immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> to be made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> these variable motions. By means of the foregoing propositions, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> condition of the body, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> rather the effect and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of this condition, denominated velocity, is inferred. The same inference is made in another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>. Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton often represents the uniform <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAPSE\">lapse</a> of time by the uniform increase of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AREA\">area</a> during the motion along the line taken for the abscissa. The velocities or determinations to motion in the different points of this line, are inversely proportional to the ordinates of the curve which bounds this area.\n\nAlong the straight line \\( AD \\), (fig. 6.) let a point move with a motion any how continually changed, and let the curve line \\( LKH \\) be so related to \\( AD \\), that the area \\( LICB \\) is to the area \\( LHDB \\) as the time of moving along \\( BC \\) to that of moving along \\( BD \\). Let this be true in every point of the line \\( AD \\). Let \\( Cc, Dd \\) be two very small spaces described in equal times, draw the ordinates \\( i c, h d \\), and draw \\( ik, hl \\) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> to \\( IC, HD \\).\n\nThe areas \\( IC \\times i \\) and \\( HD \\times h \\) must be equal, because they represent equal moments of time. It is evident also, that as the spaces \\( Cc \\) and \\( Dd \\) are continually diminished, the ratio of \\( IC \\times i \\) and \\( HD \\times h \\) to the rectangles \\( kC \\times i \\) and \\( lD \\times h \\) continually approximates to that of equality, and that the ratio of equality is the limiting or ultimate ratio. Since therefore, the areas \\( IC \\times i \\) and \\( HD \\times h \\) are equal, the rectangles \\( kC \\times i \\) and \\( lD \\times h \\) are ultimately in the ratio of equality. Therefore their bases \\( i c \\) and \\( h d \\) are inversely as their altitudes \\( Cc \\) and \\( Dd \\), that is, \\( i c : h d = Dd : Cc \\). But as \\( Cc \\) and \\( Dd \\) are described in equal times, they are ultimately as the velocities in \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) (29). Therefore \\( i c \\) and \\( h d \\), are inversely as the velocities in \\( c \\) and \\( d \\). And as the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> may be applied to every point of the abscissa, the proposition is demonstrated.\n\n34. In all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, then, in which the relation between the spaces described, and the times elapsed can be discovered by observation, we discover the mechanical condition of the moving body, or its velocity. But Variable Motions.\n\nIn the practical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of these conclusions, recourse must always be had to arithmetical conclusions; and the indications of these are the algebraic symbols of geometrical reasonings. Thus any ordinate \\( c g \\), (fig. 5.) is represented by \\( v \\), and the portion \\( cd \\) of the abscissa by \\( i \\), and the area \\( cd \\times g \\), or its equal, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTANGLE\">rectangle</a> \\( cd \\times g \\), by \\( vi \\). This rectangle then being as the corresponding portion \\( CD \\) of the line of motion, and \\( CD \\) being represented by \\( s \\), we have the equation\n\n\\[ s = vt. \\]\n\n35. The mathematical consequences of these representations may now be assumed to be true; and therefore \\( i = \\frac{s}{v} \\), as in (23.) Algebraic symbols being the representations of arithmetical operations, they represent more remotely the operations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>, and only because the area of a rectangle is analogous to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> of numbers which are proportional to its sides.\n\nThe symbol \\( \\int vt \\) being used to represent the sum of all these rectangles, expresses the whole area \\( adhe \\), as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the whole line of motion \\( AD \\); and the equation may be stated \\( s = \\int vt \\). In like manner \\( \\int \\frac{s}{v} \\) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to \\( \\int i \\), that is, to \\( i \\), and will express the whole time \\( ad \\). It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> too that \\( \\frac{s}{v} \\) represents the ordinate \\( DH \\) of the line \\( LKIH \\) (fig. 6.) because any portion \\( Dd \\) of its abscissa, is properly represented by \\( s \\), and the ordinates are reciprocally proportional to the velocities, that is, are proportional to the quotients of some constant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> divided by the velocities, and therefore to \\( \\frac{i}{v} \\). And as \\( i \\) is represented by the rectangle \\( kC \\times i \\), which is also represented by \\( s \\times \\frac{i}{v} \\), we have \\( i = \\frac{s}{v} \\) and \\( t = \\frac{s}{v} \\), as above.\n\n36. In one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of varied motion, when the line \\( efgh \\) (fig. 5.) is a straight line, the characters are very particular and useful. Let this case of motion be represented along the line \\( AD \\) (fig. 7.) and let \\( pa, b c, c d \\) represent equal moments of time, in which the moving body describes \\( PA, BC, CD \\); and draw \\( fm, gn, es \\), <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the abscissa \\( ad \\). Now it is evident that \\( mg \\) and \\( nh \\) are equal, or that equal increments of velocity are acquired in equal times; \\( eg, er, es \\) are also proportional to \\( gf, fr, fh \\), and therefore the increments \\( gf, fr, fh \\), of velocity are proportional to the times \\( ab, ac, ad \\), in which they are acquired. This motion may very properly be denominated uniformly accelerated; for here the velocity increases in the same ratio with the times, and equal increments are acquired in equal times. If the line \\( eh \\) cut the abscissa in \\( v \\), it will represent a motion uniformly accelerated from rest, during the time \\( vd \\), and thus exhibit the relations between the spaces, velocities, and times in such motions.\n\nHence it follows from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of expressing these relations,\nrelations that in motions uniformly accelerated from a state of rest, the acquired velocities are proportional to the times from the beginning of the motion. For \\(a, b, c, d, e\\), represent the velocities gained during the times \\(v, a, v, b, v, c, v, d\\), and are in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> with those lines.\n\n37. Also, the momentary increments of velocity, are as the moments in which they are acquired.\n\n2. Also, the spaces described from the beginning of the motion, are as the squares of the times.\n\n3. Also, the increments of the spaces are as the increments of the squares of the times; reckoning from the beginning of the motion.\n\n4. Also, the spaces described from the beginning of the motion, are as the squares of the acquired velocities.\n\n5. Also, the momentary increments of the spaces are as the momentary increments of the squares of the velocities.\n\n6. Also, the space described during any portion of time by a motion uniformly accelerated from rest, is one-half of the space uniformly described in the same time with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> velocity of the accelerated motion.\n\n7. And the space described during any portion of the time of the accelerated motion, is equal to that which would be described in the same time with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> between the velocities at the beginning and end of this portion of time.\n\nIn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of all other varied motions, the properties of uniformly accelerated motion stated above, will be found extremely useful, and especially in cases where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROXIMATION\">approximation</a> only can be easily obtained. But for the fuller illustration of these properties the reader is referred to Robison's Elements of Mechanical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">Philosophy</a>, p. 38.\n\n38. Supposing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a> to be always the same, we conceive of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSTANCY\">constancy</a>, that in equal times there are equal increments of velocity; and therefore that the augmentations of velocity are proportional to the times in which they are acquired. That acceleration then, according to this supposition, must be accounted double, or triple, &c., where the velocity acquired is double or triple. And, acceleration being considered as a measurable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>, the augmentation of velocity uniformly acquired in any given time is its measure.","sp":71,"ep":72},{"h":"DYNAMICS","t":"What is taken for the beginning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of surrounding bodies, is nothing more than a change induced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> a motion already produced.\n\n56.

The following is the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEOREM\">theorem</a> to which all others may be reduced.\n\nPROP. IX.\n\nTwo uniform motions, having the directions and velocities represented by the sides AB, AC, of a parallelogram, compose a uniform motion in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DIAGONAL\">diagonal</a>. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> of this has been already given. The motion of the point of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERSECTION\">intersection</a> of these two lines, each moving uniformly in all its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the other, is, in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a>, composed of the two motions. It is the same as if a point described AB uniformly, while AB is carried uniformly in the direction AC. This motion is along the diagonal Ab, and it has been already shown to be uniform. And, because AB and Ab are described in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, the velocities of the motions along AB, AC, and Ab are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to those lines.","sp":75,"ep":75},{"h":"DYNAMICS","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">Part</a> II.\n\n74. Motions are infinitely diminished, the ultimate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of continually Bb to Ei is the ratio of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFLECTION\">deflection</a> at B to the deflection at E.\n\nTo obtain a convenient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> of this ultimate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, let ABCXYZ be a circle which passes through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> A, B, C. Draw BSZ through the point S, and draw CZ, AZ. Now the triangles BCb and AZC are similar, for CB was drawn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to CB <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> BA; and therefore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> CB is equal to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> angle bBA or ZEA, which is equal to the angle ZCA, because it is subtended by the same chord ZA; and because they stand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the same chord CZ, CBb, or CBZ, is equal to CAZ. And therefore the remaining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> CB and CAZ are equal, and the triangles are similar. Therefore Bb : CA = BC : AZ.\n\nNow if the sides of the polygon are continually diminished, the points A and C continually approach to B, and CA continually approaches to cA, or to 2CB, or 2CB, and is ultimately equal to it; and AZ is ultimately equal to BZ.\n\nTherefore ultimately, Bb : BC = BC : BZ, and\n\n\\[ Bb \\times BZ = 2BC^2, \\text{ and } Bb = \\frac{2BC^2}{BZ}. \\]\n\nAlso, at the point E, we have Ei ultimately equal to 2EF, for Ei is that chord of the circle through D, E, and F, which passes through i.\n\nTherefore Bb : Ei = 2BC^2 : 2EF.\n\nThe ultimate circle, when the three points A, B, C, coalesce, is called the circle of equal curvature, or the equicurve circle, which coalesces with the curve in B in the closest manner; and the chord BZ of this circle, having the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the deflection in B, is called its deflective chord. And since BC and EF are described in equal times, they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the velocities in B and E. This proposition therefore may be expressed as follows.\n\nIn curvilinear motions, the deflections in different points of the curve, are proportional to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the velocities in those points directly, and to the deflective chords of the equicurve circles inversely.\n\nIt ought however, to be remarked, that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEOREM\">theorem</a> is not limited to curvilinear motions, in which the deflections tend always to the same fixed point; it may be extended to all curvilinear motions whatever. A symbolical expression of this theorem <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be convenient. If therefore the deflective chord of the equicurve circle be represented by c, and the deflection by d, the theorem may be thus expressed.\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{v^2}{c}, \\text{ or } d = \\frac{2\\text{<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a>}^2}{c}. \\]\n\n76. The line Bb is the linear deflection by which the uniform motion in the chord AB is changed into a uniform motion in the chord BC, or it is the deviation cC from the point to which the moving body would have arrived, if the deflection at B had not taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of curvilinear motion which we are now considering, the lines Bb and Bc are expressions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of the velocities of these motions. Bc is to Bb as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> of the progressive motion is to the velocity of the deflection, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> that the arch BC is described. But the deflection in the arch has been continual, and like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a>, it may be measured by the velocity generated during any moment of time. It may therefore be measured by the velocity generated during the time the arch BC is described. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> will therefore be double of the space through which the body is actually deflected from the tangent in B in that time. The space described will be BO, or only one-half of Bb. This is exactly what happens; for the tangent is ultimately parallel to OC, and it bisects cC; therefore the velocity gradually generated is that which constitutes the polygonal motion in the chords, although the deflection from the tangent to the curve is only half of the deflection from the produced chord to the curve.\n\n77. In any point of a curvilinear motion, the velocity is that which would be generated by the deflection in that point, if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> through one-fourth of the deflective chord of the equicurve circle. Take x for the space along which a body is to be accelerated that it may acquire the velocity BC.\n\nWe have Bb^2, or 4BO : BC^2 = B : x (37.1); and therefore \\( x = \\frac{BC^2 \\times BO}{4BO^2} = \\frac{BC^2}{4BO} \\), or \\( x = \\frac{BC^2}{BO} \\).\n\nBO : BC = BC : 4x. But BO : BC = BC : BZ; therefore \\( x = \\frac{1}{4} BZ \\).\n\n78. We have now obtained characteristic expressions, or marks and measures of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> affections of motion. These expressions may be brought into one view as follows.\n\nThe acceleration \\( a \\) is \\( \\frac{v}{t} \\) (48.), or \\( \\frac{v}{s} \\) (49.), or \\( \\frac{s}{t^2} \\) (42.).\n\nThe momentary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of velocity \\( v = a t \\) (48.).\n\nThe momentary variation of the square of velocity \\( 2v = 2a^2 \\) (49.).\n\nThe momentary deflection \\( d = \\frac{\\text{arc}^2}{\\text{chord}} \\) (76.)\n\nThe deflective velocity \\( = \\frac{2v^2}{c} \\) (75.).\n\n79. But for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of these doctrines, it is necessary to select some point in any body of sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>, or in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of bodies, by whose position or motion, a distinct and accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of the position or motion of the body or system may be formed. The condition by which the propriety of this selection is ascertained, is, that the position, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, or motion of this point shall be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a> of the positions, distances, and motions of every particle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> in the aggregate or system.\n\nThis will happen, if the point be so situated, that Center of when a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> is made to pass through it in any direction whatever, and perpendiculars being drawn to this plane from every particle of matter in this aggregate or system, the sum of the perpendiculars on the one side of the plane is equal to the sum of the perpendiculars on the other side. And that such a point, which is called the centre of position, may be found in every body, is proved by the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a>.\n\nFor let P (fig. 20.) be a point so situated, and let QR be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECTION\">section</a> of a plane <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a>, and at any distance from it, the distance PP' of the point P from this plane is the average of all the distances of each particle from it. Let the plane APB pass through P, and parallel to QR. The distance CS\nMotions CS of any particle C from the plane QR is equal to continually DS\u2014DC, or to P\u03c1\u2014DC. And the distance GT of a particle G on the other side of APB, is equal to HT+GH, or to P\u03c1+GH. Let n be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of particles on that side of AB which is nearest to QR, and let o be the number of particles on the other side of AB. Let m be the number of particles in the whole body; we have then \\( m = n + o \\). It is evident that the sum of all the distances of all the particles such as CS, is \\( n \\times P\\rho \\)\u2014the sum of all the distances, such as CD. Also the sum of all the distances of the particles, such as G, is \\( o \\times P\\rho \\), \\( + \\) the sum of the distances GH. And therefore the sum of both sets is \\( n + o \\times P\\rho \\), \\( + \\) the sum of GH\u2014the sum of DC, or \\( m \\times P\\rho \\), \\( + \\) the sum of GH\u2014the sum of DC. But by the supposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of the point P, the sum of GH wanting the sum of DC is nothing; and therefore \\( m \\times P\\rho \\) is the sum of all the distances, and \\( P\\rho \\) is the nth part of this sum, or the average distance.\n\nSuppose the body to have changed both its place and its position with respect to the plane QR, and that P (fig. 21.) is still the same point of the body, and \\( P\\rho \\) a plane parallel to QR. Make \\( P\\rho \\) equal to \\( P\\rho \\) of fig. 20. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that \\( P\\rho \\) is still the average distance, and that \\( m \\times P\\rho \\) is the sum of all the present distances of the particles from QR, and that \\( m \\times P\\rho \\) is the sum of all the former distances. Therefore \\( m \\times P\\rho \\) is the sum of all the changes of distance, or the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of motion estimated in the direction \\( P\\rho \\). \\( P\\rho \\) is the nth part of this sum, and is therefore the average motion in this direction. The point P has therefore been properly selected; and its position, and distance, and motion, in respect of any plane, is a proper representation of the situation and motion of the whole.\n\nHence it follows, that if any particle C (fig. 20.) moves from C to N, in the line CS, the centre of the whole will be transferred from P to Q, so that PQ is the nth part of CN; for the sum of all the distances has been diminished by the quantity CN, and therefore the average distance must be diminished by the nth part of CN, or \\( PQ = \\frac{CN}{m} \\).\n\nBut it may be doubted whether there is in every body a point, and but one point, such that if a plane passes through it, in any direction whatsoever, the sum of all the distances of the particles on one side of this plane is equal to the sum of all the distances on the other.\n\nIt is easy to show that such a point may be found, with respect to a plane parallel to QR. For if the sum of all the distances DC exceed the sum of all the distances GH, we have only to pass the plane AB a little nearer to QR, but still parallel to it. This will diminish the sum of the lines DC, and increase the sum of the lines GH. We may do this till the sums are equal.\n\nIn like manner we can do this with respect to a plane LM (also perpendicular to the paper), perpendicular to the plane AB. The point wanted is somewhere in the plane AB, and somewhere in the plane LM. Therefore it is somewhere in the line in which these two planes intersect each other. This line passes through the point P of the paper where the two lines AB and LM cut each other. These two lines represent planes, but are, in fact, only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERSECTION\">intersection</a> of those planes with the plane of the paper. Part of the body must be conceived as being above the paper, and part of it behind or below the paper. The plane of the paper therefore divides the body into two parts. It may be situated, therefore, that the sum of all the distances from it to the particles lying above it shall be equal to the sum of all the distances of those which are below it. Therefore the situation of the point P is now determined, namely, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> intersection of three planes perpendicular to each other. It is evident, that this point alone can have the condition required in respect of these three planes.\n\nIt still remains to be determined whether the same condition will hold true for the point thus found, in respect to any other plane passing through it; that is, whether the sum of all the perpendiculars on one side of this fourth plane is equal to the sum of all the perpendiculars on the other side.\n\nLet AGHB (fig. 22.), AXYB, and CDFE, be three planes intersecting each other perpendicularly in the point C; and let CIKL be any other plane, intersecting the first in the line CI, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> in the line CL. Let P be any particle of matter in the body or system. Draw PM, PO, PR, perpendicular to the first three planes respectively, and let PR, when produced, meet the oblique plane in V; draw MN, ON, perpendicular to CB. They will meet in one point N. Then PMNO is a rectangular parallelogram. Also draw MQ perpendicular to CE, and therefore parallel to AB, and meeting CI in S. Draw SV; also draw ST perpendicular to VP. It is evident that SV is parallel to CL, and that STRQ and STPM are rectangles.\n\nAll the perpendiculars, such as PR, on one side of the plane CDFE, being equal to all those on the other side, they may be considered as compensating each other; the one being considered as positive or additive quantities, the other as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> or subtractive. There is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between their sums, and the sum of both sets may be called o or nothing. The same must be affirmed of all the perpendiculars PM, and of all the perpendiculars PO.\n\nEvery line, such as RT, or its equal QS, is in a certain invariable ratio to its corresponding QC, or its equal PO. Therefore the positive lines RT are compensated by the negative, and the sum total is nothing.\n\nEvery line, such as TV, is in a certain invariable ratio to its corresponding ST, or its equal PM, and therefore their sum total is nothing.\n\nTherefore the sum of all the lines PV is nothing; but each is in an invariable ratio to a corresponding perpendicular from P on the oblique plane CIKL. Therefore the sum of all the positive perpendiculars on this plane is equal to the sum of all the negative perpendiculars, and the proposition is demonstrated, viz. that in every body, or system of bodies, there is a point such, that if a plane be passed through it in any direction whatsoever, the sum of all the perpendiculars on one side of the plane is equal to the sum of all the perpendiculars on the other side.\n\nSo. If A and B (fig. 23.) be the centres of position of two bodies, whose quantities of matter (or numbers of equal particles) are \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), the centre C lies in the straight line joining A and B, and AC : CB = \\( a : b \\); or its distance from the centres of each are inversely as their quantities of matter. For let \\( \\<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPHA\">alpha</a> C \\beta \\) be any plane passing...","sp":78,"ep":79},{"h":"DYNAMICS","t":"Of Moving passing through C. Draw \\( A_a, B_b \\), <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>. Then we have \\( a \\times A_a = b \\times B_b \\), and \\( A_a : B_b = a : b \\), and by similarity of triangles, \\( CA : CB = a : b \\).\n\nIf a third body D, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> is d, be added, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> centre of position E of the three bodies is in the straight line DC, joining the centre D of the third body with the centre C of the other two, and \\( DE : EC = a + b : d \\). For, passing the plane \\( E_x \\) through E, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> the perpendiculars \\( D_x, C_x \\), the sum of the perpendiculars from D is \\( d \\times D_x \\); and the sum of the perpendiculars from A and B is \\( a + b \\times C_x \\), and we have \\( d \\times D_x = a + b \\times C_x \\); and therefore \\( DE : EC = a + b : d \\).\n\nIn like manner, if a fourth body be added, the common centre is in the line joining the fourth with the centre of the other three, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from this centre and from the fourth is inversely as the quantities of matter; and so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> for any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of bodies.\n\n81. If all the particles of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> be moving uniformly, in straight lines, in any directions, and with any velocities whatever, the centre of the system is either moving uniformly in a straight line, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> is at rest.\n\nFor, let m be the number of particles in the system. Suppose any particle to move uniformly in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. It is evident from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> in a former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PARAGRAPH\">paragraph</a>, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> of the common centre is the \\( m^{th} \\) <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of this motion, and is in the same direction. The same must be said of every particle. Therefore the motion of the centre is the motion which is compounded of the \\( m^{th} \\) part of the motion of each particle.\n\nPART II. OF MOVING FORCES.\n\n84. HAVING in the former part considered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> doctrine of motion, which is the foundation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> investigations, we now proceed to treat of moving forces or dynamics, properly so called.\n\nIt has been already observed, that dynamics includes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> doctrine of moving forces, or the necessary results of the relations of our thought concerning motion, the immediate causes of motion, and its changes; and that from the changes observed, we infer agency in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>; and in these changes we are to discover what we know of their causes.\n\n85. When we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> our eyes around us, it cannot escape <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, that the changes which we perceive in the state or condition of any body in respect of motion, are constantly and distinctly related to the situation and distance of other bodies. The motions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>, or of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> projected through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, have a palpable relation to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>; the motions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a> have also an obvious relation to the moon; and the motions of a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> have a palpable dependence on a magnet. The vicinity of the one of these bodies seems to be the occasion, at least, of the motions of the other; and the causes of these motions have an evident connection with, or dependence on, the other body. Such dependences have been called the mechanical relations of bodies. They are indications of properties or distinguishing qualities. They accompany the bodies wherever they are, and are usually conceived to be inherent in them. They at least ascertain and determine what is called the mechanical nature of bodies.\n\n86. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> relation of bodies is differently considered according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> we may have in the phenomenon. The cause of the approach of the iron bodies different to the magnet is generally ascribed to the magnet. It is said to attract the iron. The approach of a stone to the earth is ascribed to the stone. It is said to tend to the earth. But it is probable that the procedure of nature is the same in both; that both bodies are affected alike, and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> is distinctive of both. For in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> that have been observed, the indicating phenomenon is equally connected with both bodies; as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGNETISM\">magnetism</a> the magnet and the iron approach each other; and an electrified body and another body near it approach each other. This property is therefore equally inherent in both bodies, between which there is a mutual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a>. But, according to some philosophers, no such mutual tendencies exist either in the one body or the other. The observed approaches or mutual separations of bodies, or their attractions and repulsions, are supposed to depend on the extraneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of an ethereal fluid.\n\n87. These qualities thus inherent in bodies, which constitute their mechanical relations, or the mechanical effects of matter, have been called powers or forces. The event which is indicated by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a>, is considered\nOf Moving considered as the effect and mark of their agency. Thus Forces, the magnet is said to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> on the iron, the earth is said to act on the stone which falls to its surface; and the iron and the stone are said to act on the magnet and the earth. But all this, it must be observed, is figurative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. Power, force, and action, when used in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> strict <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>, express only the notions of the power, force and action of sentient, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> beings; and cannot be predicated of any thing but the exertions of such beings; for such beings only are agents. In strict propriety, it is perhaps only the exerted influence of the mind on the body which ought to be called action. Language having begun among simple men, such denominations were very properly given to their own exertions; because to move a body they found it necessary to exert their force or power, or to act. But when the changes of motion, observed in the occurrence or vicinity of bodies, were attended to by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECULATIVE\">speculative</a> men, and it was found that the phenomena greatly resembled the results or effects when they exerted their own strength, similar terms were employed to express these occurrences in nature. The old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> was retained, in preference to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of a new language, to express things which had so near a resemblance. The danger of confounding things from the use of the same terms, was avoided from the differences in other circumstances of the case. It is not, however, to be imagined, that they supposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INANIMATE\">inanimate</a> bodies exerted force or strength in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> as living beings. But, in the progress of refinement, the word power or force came at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> to be employed to express any efficiency whatsoever; and hence the common expressions, the force of arguments, the action of motives, the power of an acid to dissolve a metal, &c. It is to this idea of convenience, that the use of the terms attraction, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPULSION\">repulsion</a>, pressure, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPULSION\">impulsion</a>, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as of the words power and force, which express efficiency in general, is to be ascribed. But these terms, excepting in those cases when they are applied to the exertions or actions of living beings, are metaphorical. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a>, however, of the resemblance between the phenomena and those which are observed when we draw a thing toward us, push it from us, forcibly compress it, or kick it away, these different actions being analogous to attraction, repulsion, pressure, and impulsion, these words are employed as terms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>. The action of the mind on the body is perhaps the only case of pure unfigurative action. But this action being always exerted with the view of effecting some change on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> bodies, our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> is only directed to them. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> passes unnoticed; and hence it is said that we act on the external body. The real action is only the first movement in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> succession of events, and is only the remote cause of the interesting event. In many cases of mechanical phenomena, we find the resemblance to such actions to be very strong. The following is of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> is projected from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> by the motion of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a>; and in the same way a ball is impelled by the unbending of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>. In all circumstances there is a resemblance between these two events, excepting in the action of the mind on the corporeal organ. And, hence in general, because the ultimate results of the mutual influence of bodies on each other have a strong resemblance to the ultimate results of our actions on bodies, no new or appropriate terms have been invented; but, as has been already observed, mankind have remained satisfied with the use of those terms that are employed to express their own actions, or the exertions of their own powers or forces.\n\n88. When power or force is spoken of as existing or acting of residing in a body, and the effect is ascribed to the exertion of this power, one body considered as possessing powers, it, is said to act on another. Thus a magnet is said to act on a piece of iron; a billiard ball is said to act on one which it strikes. But if it be attempted to fix the attention on this action, independent both of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> and the thing acted on, we shall find that there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a>. The exertion or procedure of nature in effecting the change is kept out of view; and if we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> our attention to the action as a thing distinct from the agent, we shall find that it is not the action, strictly speaking, but the act, that is brought under consideration. And in the same way, it is only in the effect produced that the action of a mechanical power can be conceived.\n\n89. In the very nature of action some change is implied. Without producing some effect, a man is never said to act. Thought is the act of the thinking principle; and the motion of the limb is the act of the mind on it. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a> too there is action only so far as some mechanical effect is produced. For instance, to begin motion on a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>, or to slide along it, we must act violently; we must exert force; and this force being exerted produces motion. In all cases, the productions of motion are conceived as the exertions of force; but to continue the motion which has been begun along the ice, no exertion seems requisite. Being conscious of no exertion, we ought to infer that no force is necessary for the continuation of motion. It is not the production of any new effect, but the permanency or continuation of an effect already produced. Motion is indeed considered as the effect of some action; but there would be no effect or no change, if the body were not moving. Motion is not to be considered as an action, but the effect of an action.\n\n90. Mechanical actions or forces have been divided into pressures and impulsions. The idea of pressure is very familiar; perhaps it enters into every distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> that we can form of a moving force, when the attention is endeavoured to be fixed on it. Changes of motion by the collision of moving bodies are produced by impulsion. Pressures and impulsions are usually considered as of different kinds, the actions or exertions of different powers. It is supposed that there is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between pressure and impulsion. That we may obtain all the knowledge that these distinctions can give us, let us state some examples of these kinds of forces, instead of attempting to define or describe them.\n\nLet us first take some examples of pressure. Pressure is known as a moving force; for if a ball lying on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> be gently pressed on one side, it moves toward the other side of the table. If it be followed with the finger, the pressure being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, its motion is continually increased. There is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a> of its motion. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PRESSING\">pressing</a> in the same way on the handle of a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACK\">jack</a>, the fly begins to move; and if the pressure be continued on the handle, the motion of the fly becomes very rapid; and there is:\nOf Moving is also a continual acceleration. Such motions as these are the effects of genuine prelure. The unbending of a spring would urge the ball in the same way along the table, and would produce a continually accelerated motion; and a spring coiled up round the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a> of the handle of the jack would, by uncoiling itself, urge round the fly with a similar accelerated motion. By comparing the prelure of the finger on the ball with the effects of the spring, we perceive distinctly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> similarity. These exertions or actions, or influences, are denoted by the word prelure, which is derived from the most familiar instance of them.\n\nThe same motion may be produced in the ball or fly, by pulling the ball or machine by means of a thread having a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> suspended to it. Both being motions accelerated in the same manner, the action of the thread on the ball or machine comes under the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DENOMINATION\">denomination</a> of prelure. Weight is therefore considered as a preluring power. And indeed the same compulsion is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> from the real prelure of a man on the shoulders and a load laid on them. But in the instance above, the weight acts by the intervention of the thread. By the prelure of the weight it pulls at that part of the thread to which it is attached, this part pulls at the next by the force of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a>; and this at a third, and so on, till the most remote pulls at the ball or machine. In this way <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a>, weight, cohesion, and other forces, perform the office of a genuine power; and their result being always a motion beginning from nothing, and accelerating to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> by perceptible degrees, from this resemblance we are led to give them one familiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>.\n\n91. If the thread by which the weight is suspended be cut, it falls with an accelerated motion. This also is ascribed to some preluring power which acts on the weight; and it is even considered as the cause of the body's weight, which word is a name by which this instance of preluring power is distinguished. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAVITATION\">Gravitation</a>, therefore, comes under the denomination of prelure. For the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> the attractions and repulsions of the magnet, or of electric bodies, belong to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of phenomena; for on bodies placed between them they produce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> compellings, as well as motions which are continually accelerated, in the same way as gravitation does. To all these powers, therefore, the descriptive name of prelures may be given, although this name properly speaking belongs to one of them only. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> class has been subdivided by some philosophers into prelusions and solicitations. Gravity is considered as a solicitation ab extra, by which a body is urged downward. The forces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a> and magnetism, with many other attractions and repulsions, are also called solicitations. But this classification seems to be of little use.\n\n92. We have a familiar instance of impulsion in one ball striking another, and putting it in motion. In this case the appearances are very different from the phenomena of prelure. For the body that is struck acquires in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> of impulse a sensible quantity of motion. But after the stroke this motion is neither accelerated nor retarded, unless by the action of some other force. The rapidity of the motion, it is observed depends on the previous velocity of the striking ball. If for instance a clay ball, moving with any velocity, strike another equal ball which is at rest, the ball which is struck moves with one half of the velocity of the other. It is farther observed that the striking ball always loses as much motion as the ball which is struck gains. From this remarkable fact there seems to have arisen an indistinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of a kind of transference of motion from one body to another. It is not said that the one ball produces motion or causes it in the other, but it is said to communicate motion to it; and the phenomenon is usually termed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of motion. This, however, is a very inaccurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>. We distinctly conceive the cause or communication of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>, the communication of fatigues, of sweetmeats, and of many other things; but we have no clear conception of part of the identical motion which existed in one body being transferred to another. From this, therefore, it appears that motion is not a thing which can exist independently, and is susceptible of actual transference; but is a state or condition of which bodies are susceptible which may be produced in bodies, and which is the effect or characteristic of certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> properties or powers.\n\nThe notion of the actual transference of something formerly possessed by the striking body, and now separated from it, or transferred into the body which is struck, has obtained support from the remarkable circumstance in the phenomenon, that a rapid motion requiring for its production the action of a preluring power, continued for a sensible, and frequently a long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, is or seems to be effected instantaneously by impulsion. Here then we find room for the employment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHOR\">metaphor</a>, both in thought and language. We see the striking body affect the body which is struck. It possesses the power of impulsion, or of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> motion, but it only possesses this power while it is itself in motion; and we therefore conclude that this power is the efficient distinguishing cause of its motion. Hence it has been called inherent force, the force inherent in a moving body, vis inusta corpori moto. This force is communicated to the body impelled, or transferred into it; the transference is instantaneous, and the body thus impelled continues its motion till it is changed by a new force. But if we attend scrupulously to those feelings which have given rise to this metaphorical conception, we shall find, that although at first sight this train of observation seems very plausible, we should entertain very different notions. To begin the motion of sliding on a smooth piece of ice, we are conscious of exertion; but when the ice is very smooth, no exertion that we are conscious of seems requisite to continue the motion. No exertion of power is here necessary; and therefore we have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> feeling of power while we slide along. And indeed we cannot think of moving forward without effort otherwise than as a certain mode of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>. It has however been imagined that those who support this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> have in some way deduced it from their feelings. To move forward in walking, we must continue the exertion with which we began; and unless this power of walking be continually exerted, we must stop our progress. But this is inaccurate observation. In the action of walking there is much more than the continuance in progressive motion. It is the repeated and continued lifting the body up a small height, and allowing it to come <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> again, and this repeated ascent requires repeated exertion.\n93. From the consideration of the instantaneous production of rapid motion by impulse, some distinguished philosophers have been led to suppose that the force or power of impulse is not susceptible of being compared with a pressing power. It has been asserted that impulse when compared with pressure is infinitely great. But the similarity of the ultimate results of impulse and pressure, have always led them to adopt a different view. There is no difference between the motion of two balls which move with equal rapidity, one of which descends from a height by the force of gravity, while the other has been struck by another body. In this struggle of the mind attached to preconceived opinions, and at the same time accommodating these opinions to observed phenomena, other singular forms of expression have arisen. Pressure is considered as an effort to produce motion. And here we have another instance of metaphorical expression as well as thought. The weight of a ball on the table is called a power; and this weight is continually endeavouring to move the ball downward. But these efforts being ineffectual, the power in this case is said to be dead. It is called *vis mortua*, in contradistinction to the force of impulse which is called a living power, *vis viva*. But this mode of expression must appear very inaccurate, if we consider the case of the impelling ball falling perpendicularly on the other ball lying on the table. No motion is induced by this impulse; and if the table be conceived to be annihilated, the power of gravity becomes a *vis viva*.\n\nTo prove that impulse is infinitely greater than pressure, numerous familiar instances have been adduced by those who support this doctrine. A nail is driven with a moderate blow of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAMMER\">hammer</a>, which would require a pressure many hundred times greater than the impelling effort of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> who employs the hammer. A hard body may be shattered into pieces with a moderate blow, which would support an inconceivable weight gradually applied. This prodigious superiority in impulse leaves it a difficult matter to account for the production of motion by means of pressure; because the motion of the hammer might have been acquired in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the continued pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARPENTER\">carpenter</a>'s arm. It is considered as the aggregate of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> number of succeeding pressures repeated in every instant of its continuance. The smallness of each effort is compensated by their number.\n\n94. After all, it does not appear clear that there are two kinds of mechanical force which are essentially different in their nature. It is, indeed, in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> given up by those who support the doctrine that impulse is infinitely greater than pressure: Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> might perhaps be found of explaining satisfactorily this remarkable difference between the two modes of producing motion. But there seems to be no considerable advantage in thus arranging the phenomenon under two distinct heads.\n\n95. The nature of the sole moving force in nature has given rise to much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> among mechanicians, and produced no small diversity of opinion. According to some, all motion is the effect of pressure; for when impulse is considered as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to the aggregate of an infinite number of pressures, every pressure, however small, is supposed to be a moving force.\n\nThe sole cause of motion, according to other philosophers, is impulse. Bodies are observed in motion; they impel others, and produce motion in them; and this production of motion is said to be regulated by such laws, that there is only one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> quantity of motion in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>, which quantity remains invariably the same. Some portion of this motion, therefore, must be transferred or transfused when bodies come into collision with each other. But besides, there are some cases in which it is perfectly obvious that motion produces pressure. Cases, which are indeed both whimsical and complicated have been adduced by Euler, to show that an action, in all respects similar to pressure, may be produced by motion. Such a case is the following. If two balls are connected by a thread, they may be struck in such a way, that they shall not only move forward, but at the same time also wheel round. When this happens, the thread by which they are connected is stretched. Since then, according to this reasoning, motion is observed, and pressure is produced by motion, it would be absurd to suppose that pressure is anything else than the result of certain motions. The philosophers who are attached to this doctrine of moving forces, proceed to account for those pressing powers or solicitations to motion which are observed in the acceleration of falling bodies, the phenomena of magnetism and electricity, and others of the same kind, where motion is induced on certain bodies which are in the vicinity of other bodies, or as it is expressed in common language by the action of other bodies at a distance. To say that a magnet cannot act on a piece of iron at a distance, is to say that it acts where it is not; which is not less absurd than to say that it acts, when it is not. Euler assumed it is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIOM\">axiom</a>, *nihil movetur nisi a contiguo et moto*.\n\nThe methods proposed by these philosophers to produce pressure, are less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> and not more satisfactory than that adduced by Euler which was mentioned above; and indeed they do not seem to be very anxious about the manner in which these motions are produced. The phenomena of magnetism are induced, or a piece of iron is put in motion, when it is in the vicinity of a magnet, by a stream of fluid which issues from one pole of a magnet, passes in a circle round the magnet, and enters at the other pole. By this stream of fluid the iron is impelled, and brought to arrange itself in certain determined positions. In the same way all bodies are impelled in lines perpendicular to the surface of the earth by a stream of fluid which is in continual motion towards its centre. In the same way similar phenomena are accounted for, and thus these motions are reduced to simple cases of impulse. But to say nothing worse of this doctrine, it is not very compatible with the dictates of common sense. It proceeds on the supposition that something acts which we do not see; and of the existence of which there is not the smallest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>.\n\n96. Pressure, according to the opinion of others, is or pressure, the only moving force in nature; but it is that kind of pressure which has been termed solicitation, not what arises from the mutual contact of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> bodies. Gravitation is an instance of the kind of pressure here alluded to. It is affirmed by these philosophers, that there is no such thing as contact on the instantaneous communication of motion by the real collision of bodies. It is said that the particles of solid bodies exert very strong repulsions.\nOf Moving repulsions to a small distance; and when they are brought by any motion sufficiently near to another body, they exert a repulsive force, and are equally repelled by this body. Motion is thus produced in the one body, while it is diminished in the other. It is then shown by scrupulously considering the state of the bodies while the one advances, and the other retires, in what way they attain a common velocity, the quantity of motion before collision remaining the same, and the one body gaining exactly as much as the other loses. Cases also are adduced, of such mutual action between bodies, where it is obvious they have never come into contact; but where the result is exactly the same as when the motion seemed to be instantaneously changed. And hence it is concluded that there is no such thing as instantaneous communication, or transmutation of motion by contact in collision or impulse. All moving forces according to these philosophers, are of that kind which have been named solicitations; such as gravity is.\n\n97. Different names have been given to the exertions of mechanical forces, according to the reference that is made to the result. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRESTLING\">wrestling</a> when my antagonist exerts his strength to prevent being thrown down, and I am sensible of his exertion, I thus discover that he resists. But if I oppose him only to prevent him throwing me, I am said to resist. If I strike or endeavour to throw him, I am said to act. The same distinction is applied to the exertion of mechanical powers. If, for instance one body A change the motion of another body B, the change in the motion of B may be considered either as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> and measure of the power of A in producing motion, or as the indication and measure of the resistance made by A in being brought to rest, or having any change induced on its motion. The distinction which is here made is not in the thing itself, but exists only in the reference which we are disposed to make of its effect, from other considerations. If a change of motion take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> when one of the powers ceases to be exerted, it is conceived that this power has resisted. But this language is metaphorical. Resistance, effort, endeavour, are all words which express motion that relate to sentient beings. There is perhaps no word preferable to the word reaction, to express the mutual force which is observed in all the operations of nature which have been successfully investigated.\n\n98. A difficulty has been started with regard to the opinion of those who affirm that all mechanical phenomena are dependent on attracting and repelling forces; because it is here supposed that bodies act on each other at a distance, and however small this distance may be, this is conceived to be absurd. It may however be observed, that the mutual approaches or recedes of bodies may be ascribed to tendencies to, or from each other. Without thinking of any intermediate connection between the iron and the magnet, we conceive the iron to be affected by the magnet; and if this be conceivable, it is not absurd. Our knowledge of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENCE\">essence</a> or nature of matter is not such as to render this tendency of the iron to the magnet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>. We do not indeed see intuitively why the iron should approach to the magnet; but this is by no means sufficient to pronounce it impossible or inconsistent with the nature of matter. To suppose therefore in the production of motion, the impulse of an invisible fluid, of which we know not anything, and of whose existence there is no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>, is a rash and unwarrantable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a>. But farther, if it be true that bodies do not come into contact, even when one ball strikes another, and drives it before it, the supposition of the existence of this invisible fluid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not assist us in solving the difficulty; for the same difficulty would occur in the action of any one particle of the fluid in the body. At any rate the production of motion without any observed contact, is more familiar to us than the production of motion by one body acting on another by impulse. Every case of gravitation is an instance of this.\n\n99. In those cases where the exertions of any mechanical power are observed to be always directed toward any body, that body is said to attract. Thus a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> is attracted toward a man when he pulls it toward him by means of a rope. This is a case of pure attraction. But when the other body always moves off, the body exhibiting this phenomenon is said to repel; and it is a case of pure repulsion when a person pushes any body from him. And because there is a resemblance to the results of real attraction and repulsion, the same terms are employed to express the mechanical phenomena of nature. But that our conceptions may not be embarrassed or rendered obscure by the use of such metaphorical expressions, it is requisite to be careful not to allow these words to suggest to us any opinion about the manner in which mechanical forces produce their effects. If the opinion which is held of the existence of an invisible fluid on which mechanical action depends be well founded, it is obvious that there can be neither attraction nor repulsion in the universe.\n\n100. Forces are conceived as measurable quantities. Thus we conceive one man to possess double the strength measurable of another man, when we observe that he can resist the quantities, combined efforts of two others. It is in this way that animal force is conceived as a quantity made up of its own parts and measured by them. This however seems not to be a very accurate conception. Our conception of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRAIN\">strain</a> being added to another is obscure, although we have a distinct notion of their being combined. There are no words to express the difference of these two notions in our minds; but we think that the same difference is perceived by others. We have a clear conception of the addition of two lines or two minutes; but our notions of two forces combined are indistinct; although it cannot be affirmed that two equal forces are not double of one of them. They are measured by the effects which they are known to produce.\n\n101. In the same way mechanical forces are conceived as measurable by their effects, and thus become the subjects of mathematical discussion. We speak of the proportions of magnetism, electricity &c., and even of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of gravity to magnetism. These however, considered in themselves, are quite different, and do not admit of any proportion; but some of their effects are measurable, and these assumed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> being quantities of the same kind are susceptible of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a>. The acceleration of motion in a falling body, is one of the effects of gravity; magnetism accelerates the motion of a piece of iron; and these two accelerations may be compared together. But because none of the measurable effects of magnetism with which we are acquainted\nPart II.","sp":79,"ep":85},{"h":"DYNAMICS","t":"Thus of the first kind are the terms accelerating, attractive, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> repulsive forces; of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, are the terms <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGNETISM\">magnetism</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a>, &c.\n\nOf the Laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">Motion</a>.\n\n105. Such then being our notions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> forces, of the causes of the production of motion and its changes, there are certain results, which by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> mind, necessarily arise from the relations of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>. These results are laws of human judgment, independent of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. Some of these laws may be intuitive, presenting themselves to the mind as soon as the ideas which they involve are presented to it. These may be called axioms. Others may be as necessary results from the relations of these notions, are less obvious, and may require a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> to establish their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>.\n\nOf these laws there are three, which were first distinctly propounded by Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton. These may be considered as the first principles of all discussions in mechanical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>, give a sufficient foundation for all the doctrines of Dynamics, and to these principles we may refer for the elucidation of all the mechanical phenomena of nature.\n\nFirst <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">Law</a> of Motion.\n\n106. Every body continues in a state of rest, or of uniform <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTILINEAR\">rectilinear</a> motion, unless it is affected by some mechanical force.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">On</a> the truth of this proposition the whole of mechanical philosophy chiefly depends. But with regard to its truth and the foundation on which it rests, the opinions of philosophers are very different. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> these opinions are obscure and unsatisfactory; and, as is usual, they influence the discussions of those who hold them in all their investigations.\n\n107. It is not only the popular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that a state of rest is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> state of body, and that motion is something foreign to it, but the same opinion has been supported by many philosophers. They allow that of body <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> unless it is acted on by some moving force <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> remain at rest; and nothing seems necessary for matter to remain where it is, but its continuing to exist. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is widely different, according to these philosophers, with respect to matter in motion. For here the relations of the body to other things are continually changing; and as there is the continual production of an effect, the continual agency of a changing cause is necessary. This metaphysical argument, it is said, is fully confirmed by the most familiar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>. All motions, whatever may have been their violence, terminate in rest, and for their continuance the continual exertion of some force is necessary.\n\n108. It is affirmed by these philosophers, that the continual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the moving cause is essentially requisite for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of the motion. But their opinions of the nature of this cause are not uniform. According to some, all the motions in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a> are produced and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> agency of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a> himself. By others all the motions and changes of every particle of matter are ascribed to a sort of mind which is inherent in it. This is called an elemental mind. It is the same as the \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7 and the \u1f10\u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>. Every thing, according to these philosophers,\nOf Moving Bodies, which moves, is mind, and every thing which is moved is body. But this elemental mind is only known and characterized by the effects which are ascribed to its action; and these are observed in the motions or changes which are produced. These, we learn from uniform experience, are regulated by laws equally precise with the laws of mathematical truth. But there is nothing which indicates anything like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a> or purpose; none of the marks or characters by which mind was brought first into view. They resemble the effects produced by the exertions of corporeal force; and hence the word force has been applied to express the causes of motion.\n\n109. A state of rest, it has been supposed, is the natural state of matter. But it does not appear that the continued action of some cause is necessary for continuing matter in motion. Experience gives us no authority for supposing that the natural condition of matter is a state of rest. It cannot be affirmed of any body whatever that it has ever been seen in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> rest. All the parts of the planetary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> are in motion; and even the sun himself with his attendant planets is carried in a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a>. There is no unquestionable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> that any of the stars are absolutely fixed; and many of them, it has been ascertained by observation, are in motion. Rest, therefore being so rare a condition of matter, no experience which we have, supports the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> that this is its natural condition. This opinion seems to be derived from our own experiments on matter. To continue the motion of a body, we find that the continued action of some moving force is necessary, otherwise the motion becomes gradually slower, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> terminates in rest. Since then we see that our own exertions are constantly necessary in the production of motion, and especially in those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> where we are interested; we are thus induced to ascribe to matter something that is naturally quiescent and inert, and even something that is sluggish and aversive from motion. But this is an erroneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a>, which is suggested to our thoughts from the imperfection of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>. We ascribe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATION\">animation</a> to matter to give it motion, and endow it with a kind of moral character in order to explain the phenomena of motion.\n\n110. But more accurate and more extended observation leads us to conclude that matter has no peculiar aptitude to a state of rest. Every observed retardation has a distinct reference to external circumstances. Wherever there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of motion, it is invariably accompanied by the removal of obstacles; as in the case when a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> moves through fluid, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>. The diminution of motion is also owing to opposite motions which are destroyed. And it is found that the more these obstacles are kept out of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, the less is the diminution of motion. The vibration of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a> in water soon ceases; it continues longer in air; and much longer in the exhausted receiver. The conclusion then from these observations is, that if all obstacles could be completely removed, motion would continue for ever. This conclusion is strongly supported by the motions of the heavenly bodies. These motions, so far as we know, are retarded by no obstacles; and accordingly they have been observed to retain them without perceptible diminution for thousands of years.\n\n111. The inactivity of matter has been denied by other philosophers. According to them it is essentially <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>, and continually undergoing changes in its condition. Some traces of this doctrine are to be found in the writings of some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> philosophers; but it others was reduced to a systematic form by Leibnitz. According to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>, every particle of matter is endowed with a principle of individuality. This he calls a monad, which is supposed to have a kind of perception of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in the universe, and of its relation to all other parts of the universe. This monad too is supposed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> on the particle of matter in the same way as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> acts on the body. The motion of the material particle is modified by the monad, and thus are produced, according however to unalterable laws, all the observed modifications of motion. And thus matter, or the particles of matter, are continually active and continually changing their situation. No <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> in any way useful can be obtained from this fanciful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>. It is not unlike the system of elemental minds. And should its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> be admitted, it would not any more than the actions of animals invalidate the general proposition which is considered as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> law of motion. The powers of the monads or of the elemental minds are supposed to be the causes of all the changes; but the particle of matter itself is subject to the law, and any change of motion which it exhibits is ascribed to the exertion of the monad.\n\n112. By another set of philosophers, this law of motion is deduced from the want of a determining cause. At the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> is Sir Isaac Newton, who maintains the doctrine affirmed in the proposition. But these determiners are not uniform in their opinion of the foundation on which it rests. It is asserted by some that it is a kind of necessary truth which arises from the nature of the thing. If, for instance, a body in a state of rest, and if it be affected that it will not remain at rest, it must move in some direction; and if it be in motion in any direction, and with any velocity, and do not continue its equable, rectilinear motion, it must be either accelerated or retarded; it must either turn to one side, or to some other side. The event, whatever it be, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> and determinate; but no cause which can determine it being supposed, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> cannot take place, and no change with respect to motion will happen in the condition of the body. It will either remain at rest, or persevere in its rectilinear and equable motion. But to this argument of sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, as it has been called, considerable objections may be made. In the immensity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> uniformity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> and space, there is no determining cause why the visible universe should exist in one place rather than in another, or at this time rather than at another. It is essentially necessary that there should be a cause of determination; for a determination may be without a cause, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as a motion without a cause.\n\n113. Other philosophers deduce this law of motion and from experience. They consider it merely as an experimental truth, of the universality of which there are innumerable proofs. When a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> is thrown from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, it is pressed forward, and when the hand has the greatest velocity that we can give it, the stone is let go, and it continues in that state of motion which it gradually acquired along with the hand. A stone may be thrown much farther by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SLING\">sling</a>, because with\nOf Moving a very moderate motion of the hand, the stone being whirled round acquires a very great velocity, and when it is let go, it continues its rapid motion. We have a similar illustration in the case of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARROW\">arrow</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> from a bow. The string which presses hard on the notch of the arrow carries it forward with an accelerated motion as it becomes a straight line by the unbending of the bow; and there being nothing to check the arrow, it flies off. In these simple cases of perseverance in a state of motion the procedure of nature is easily traced; it is perceived almost intuitively. In many other phenomena it is not less difficult, although somewhat more complicated. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> can stand on the saddle of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> at a gallop, and step from it to the back of another horse that gallops along with him at the same rate; and this he seems to do with the same ease as if the horses were standing still. The man is carried along with the same velocity as the horse which gallops under him, and he retains the same velocity while he steps from the back of one horse to that of the other. But if the horse to which he steps were standing still, he would fly over his head, because he is carried forward with the velocity of the galloping horse; or if he stepped from the back of a horse standing still to that of one at a gallop, he would be left behind; because he has not acquired the velocity of the galloping horse. In the same way, a man tosses oranges from one hand to the other while he is carried forward with the motion of a horse at a gallop, or while he swings on the slack-wire. In both cases the oranges have the same motion as the man, and while they are in the air are moving forward with the same velocity, so that they drop into the hand at a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from the place in which they were thrown from the other hand. While a ship sails forward with a rapid motion a ball dropped from the mast head falls at the foot of the mast; for it retains the motion which it had previous to its being dropped, and follows the mast during the whole time of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>.\n\n114. Familiar instances may also be given of a body in a state of rest. A vessel filled with water drawn suddenly along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>, leaves the water behind, which is dashed over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> side of the vessel; and when a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COACH\">coach</a> is suddenly dragged forward, the persons in it find themselves strike against the hinder <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the carriage or boat; or rather it should be said the carriage strikes on them, for it sooner acquires motion from the action of the force applied. A ball discharged from a cannon will pass through a wall and move onward; but the wall remains behind.\n\n115. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">Common</a> experience is perhaps insufficient for establishing the truth of this fundamental proposition. It must be granted, that we have never seen a body either at rest, or in uniform rectilinear motion; yet this seems necessary before it can be said that the proposition is experimentally established. What is supposed in our experiments to be putting a body, formerly at rest, into motion, is in fact only producing a change of a very rapid motion\u2014a motion not less than 90,000 feet per second.\n\n116. For the purpose of obtaining such experimental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of the truth of this proposition, it will be necessary to refer to other observations. The relative motions of bodies, which are the differences of their absolute motions, only can be measured. We cannot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> their absolute motions. If then it can be shown by experiment that bodies have equal tendencies to resist the augmentation and diminution of their relative motions, they thus have equal tendencies to resist the augmentation or diminution of their absolute motions.\n\nLet A and B two bodies be put into such a situation, that they cannot persevere in their relative motions. The change which we observe produced on A is the effect and measure of the tendency of B to persevere in its former state. From the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of these changes therefore we derive the proportion of their tendencies to remain in their former condition. This will be illustrated by the following experiment which should be made at noon.\n\n117. Let the body moving at the rate of three feet per second to the westward, strike the equal body B which is apparently at rest. Different cases of the results of the changes thus produced may be supposed.\n\n118. Let A impel B forward without having its own velocity at all diminished. From this result it appears that B shows no tendency to maintain its motion unchanged, but that A retains its motion without diminution.\n\n2d. Suppose that A stops, and that B remains at rest. This case shows that A does not resist a diminution of motion, and that the motion of B is not changed.\n\n3d. Let it be supposed that both move westward at the rate of one foot per second. There is in this case a diminution of the velocity in A, equal to two feet per second. This then is to be considered as the effect and measure of the tendency of B to maintain its velocity unaltered. B has received an augmentation of one foot per second in its velocity. From this change it appears that the tendency is but half of the former; and the result shows that the resistance to a diminution of velocity is only equal to one half of the resistance to augmentation; and perhaps equal only to one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, since the change on B has effected a double change on A.\n\n4th. Let it be supposed that both bodies move forward with the velocity of one and a half feet per second. In this case it is obvious that the tendencies of the two bodies to maintain their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> unchanged are equal.\n\n5th. But suppose that $A = 2B$, and that the velocity of both after collision is equal to two feet per second. The body B has then received an addition of two feet per second to its former velocity; and this is the effect and measure of the whole tendency of A to preserve its motion undiminished. One half of this change on B <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> the persevering tendency of one half of A; but it is supposed that A which formerly moved with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> or relative velocity three, now moves with the velocity two, and thus has lost the velocity of one foot per second. Therefore each half of A has lost this velocity; and the whole loss of motion is two. This then is the measure of the tendency of B to maintain its former state unaugmented; and it is the same with the measure of the tendency of A to preserve its former state undiminished. From such a result therefore the conclusion would be that bodies have equal tendencies to maintain their former states of motion unaugmented and undiminished.\n\nThe suppositions made above in the 4th and 5th cases are the result of all the experiments which have been made; and in all the changes of motion which are,\nOf Moving produced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> action of bodies on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPULSION\">impulsion</a>, this is the regulating law. To this there is no exception. And thus it appears that there exists in bodies no preferable tendency to rest. No fact can be adduced which should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> us to suppose that a motion having once begun should suffer any diminution without the intervening action of some changing cause.\n\n118. It must, however, be observed that this is a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> way of establishing the first law of motion. It is inapplicable to those cases where experiment cannot be made; and at best it is subject to all the inaccuracy of the best managed experiments. If this proposition be examined by means of the general principles which have been adopted in the article Philosophy, (which see) an accurate decision of this question may be given. These principles, which are the foundation of all our knowledge, show that this proposition is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIOM\">axiom</a> or intuitive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the relations of those ideas which we have of motion, of its changes, and of their causes.\n\n119. Powers or forces, it has been shewn, are not the immediate objects of our perceptions. Their existence, kind, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, are inferences from the motions which we observe. And hence it follows, that when no change of motion is observed, no such inference is made; no force or power is supposed to act. But when any change of motion is observed, the inference is made; a power or force is supposed to have acted. By a similar conclusion, it is said, that when no change of motion is supposed, no force is thought of or supposed; and whenever a change of motion is supposed, it always implies a changing force. On the other hand, when the action of a changing force is supposed, the change of motion is also supposed; the action of this force and the change of motion being the same thing. The mind does not admit the idea of the action, without at the same time thinking of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> of the action, and this indication is the change of motion. And in the same way, when we do not think of the changing force, or do not suppose the action of a changing force, we suppose, although it be not expressed in terms, that there is no indication of this changing force; that there is no change. If, therefore, it be supposed that no mechanical force acts on a body, we suppose in fact that the body remains in its former condition with respect to motion. And if it be supposed that nothing accelerates or retards, or deflects the motion, it is conceived as neither accelerated nor retarded, nor deflected. Hence it follows, that we suppose the body to continue in its former state of rest or motion, unless we suppose that it is changed by some mechanical force.\n\n120. This proposition then does not depend on the properties of body as a matter of experience or contingency. It is to us a necessary truth. It is not so much any circumstances with regard to body that are expressed in the proposition, as the operations of the mind in considering these circumstances. The truth of the proposition will not be invalidated by taking into view, that it may be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> to move in some particular direction; that it may be essential to body to stop when the moving cause ceases to act; or gradually to diminish its motion, and at last come to rest. The circumstances in the nature of body which render these modifications essentially necessary, are the causes of these modifications; and they are to be considered as changing forces.\n\nIf we should suppose that body of its own nature is capable of producing a change in its condition, this change must be effected according to some law which characterizes the nature of body. But the knowledge of this law can be obtained only by observing the deviations from uniform rectilinear motion. It then becomes indifferent whether external causes operate these changes, or they depend on the nature of the thing; for in considering the various motions of bodies, we must first consider the nature of matter as one of its mechanical affections which operates in every instance; and this brings us back to the law contained in the proposition. This is rendered more certain by reflecting, that the external causes, such as instance are gravity and magnetism, which are acknowledged to operate changes of motion, are not less unknown to us than this essential <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of matter. They are, like it, only inferences from the phenomena.\n\n121. Many philosophers, among which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> may be included Newton himself, have introduced modes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a>, which suggest inadequate notions, and such getted as are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCOMPATIBLE\">incompatible</a> with the doctrine of the proposition; for although they allow that rest is the natural condition of body, and that force is necessary for the continuation of motion, yet they speak of a power or force residing in a moving body by which it perseveres in its motion. This has been called the vis insita, or the inherent force of a moving body. Now if the motion be supposed to be continued in consequence of a force, that force must be supposed to be exerted, and it is supposed that if it were not exerted the motion would cease. The proposition, therefore, must be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a>. To obviate this objection it is indeed sometimes said, that the body continues in uniform rectilinear motion, unless it is acted on by some external cause. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of expression, however, subjects us to the impropriety of afflicting that gravity, electricity, and other mechanical forces, are external to the bodies on which they are supposed to act and to put in motion. Everything which produces a change of motion is very properly called a force; and when a change of motion is observed, the action of such a force is very properly inferred. But to give the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> to what has not this property of producing a change, and to infer the action of a force when no change is observed, is not a very accurate or consistent expression. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> has arisen from the use of analogical language in philosophical discourses.\n\n122. But motion is not, as philosophers have imagined, the continual production of an effect. We can conceive there is such a thing as a moving cause, to which the name of force has been given. This produces motion, and the character of motion in body, which is a continual change of place. Motion is the effect of an action; and previous to the commencement of the motion, this action is equally incomplete as it is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> after. The immediate effect of a moving force is a determination to motion, which if not obstructed by some cause would go on for ever. In this determination only the condition of the body differs from a state of rest. Motion then is a condition or mode of existence, which no more requires the continued agency of the moving cause than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. Some mechanical cause is required to change this condition into the state or condition of rest. When a moving\nPart II.","sp":85,"ep":89},{"h":"DYNAMICS","t":"Of Moving moving body is brought to rest, some cause of this cessation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> never fails to occur to the mind. A cause is no less necessary to stop the motion of body than it is to produce it. Now this cause must either reside in the body <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> to it. If it reside in the body, then it possesses a self-determining power or force, by which it may be able to stop its own motion as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as to produce it.\n\n123. Taking this view of the subject, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of a force residing in a moving body by which its motion is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> must be given up; and the remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between a body in a state of motion and a state of rest must be explained <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> other principles. Motion, it cannot be doubted, is necessary in the impelling body to permit the forces which are inherent in one or both bodies to continue the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRELUDE\">prelude</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> enough for the production of sensible motion. But whether bodies be in the condition of motion or rest, these forces are inherent in them. If we reflect on the motions that are involved in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of one body being impelled and put in motion by another, we shall see that there is nothing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> transferred from the one to the other. Before collision took <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> to motion existed only in the impelling body. After collision, both bodies possessed this condition or determination. But we have no conception, we can form no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of the thing transferred.\n\n124. An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> not less vague and indefinite is \"vis inertiae,\" an indecisive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a>. This is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PHRASE\">phrase</a> \"inertia,\" or \"vis inertiae.\" This expression, which was introduced by Kepler, seems to have been generally employed by him as well as by Newton to express the fact of the perseverance of body in a state of motion or rest. Sometimes, however, it has been employed by these philosophers to express something like indifference to motion or rest; and this is supposed to be manifested by body requiring the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of force to make an augmentation of its motion, as is necessary to produce an equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of it. To suppose resistance from a body at rest seems to be in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> use of the word \"force\"; and yet this expression \"vis inertiae\" is very common. It is not less absurd to say that a body remains in the condition of rest by the exertion of a \"vis inertiae,\" than to affirm that it maintains itself in a state of motion by the exertion of an inherent force. Such expressions, which are metaphorical, should be carefully avoided, because they are apt to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> to misconception of the procedure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>.\n\n125. In the phenomena of motion the force employed of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> always produces its complete effect. No resistance whatever is observed. When one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> throws <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> another, and he finds that no more force has been required than to throw down a similar and equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INANIMATE\">inanimate</a> matter, he concludes that no resistance has been made; but if more force be necessary, the conclusion is that resistance has been made. When, therefore, the exerted force produces its full effect, there is no such thing as resistance properly so called. It is therefore misconceiving the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> forces operate in the collision of bodies, to say that there is any resistance. For there is no more in these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> than in other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> changes of condition. It may be observed, that these terms \"inherent force,\" and \"inertia,\" may be employed for the purpose of abbreviation <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, provided they are used only for expressing either the simple fact of persevering in the former state, or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of a determinate force to produce a change on that state, being careful to avoid all thought of resistance.\n\n126. Thus it appears that deviations from uniform motions are the only indications of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> and from unagency of mechanical forces. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> is simple, implying change of place; and it can only indicate what is actions of very simple, something competent to the production of force. The same thing is indicated by two similar changes of motion. A compass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a> in a state of rest, can be moved some degrees by means of the finger, a magnet, an electrified body, or by the unbending of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>, &c., in all which cases the indication is precisely the same; and therefore the thing indicated must also be the same. This is the intensity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of some moving power. The circumstances of resemblance by which the affections of matter are to be characterized are impulsiveness, intensity, and direction. This leads us to consider the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of motion.\n\nSecond Law of Motion.\n\nEvery change of motion is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the force impressed, and it is made in the direction of that force.\n\n127. This law of motion also may almost be considered as an identical proposition. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to saying that the changing force is to be measured by the position; change produced, and the direction of this force is the direction of the change. Considering the force only in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of its being the cause of motion, and withdrawing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> from the manner or form of its exertion, there can be no doubt of this. In whatever <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> a body is put in motion, whether by the expansive force of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, by the unbending of a spring, or by any similar prelude, when it moves off in the same direction, and with the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a>, the force or the exertion of the force is considered as the same. Even when it is put in motion by instantaneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERCUSSION\">percussion</a> from a smart stroke, although in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the manner of the effect being produced is essentially different from the other cases, we cannot conceive the propelling force, as such, but as precisely one and the same. The expression of this law of motion by Newton is equivalent to saying, \"that the changes of motion are taken as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of the changing forces, and the direction of the change is taken as the indication of the direction of the forces; for it cannot be said that it is a deduction from the acknowledged principle, that deduced from effects are proportional to their causes. This law is not affirmed from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of the forces and the forces, proportion of the changes, and that these proportions are the same, having been observed; and that this universally holds in nature. For forces are not objects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, and we do not know their proportions. In this way it would be established as a physical law, as indeed it is in fact. But according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-DEFINITION\">definition</a> of the term, this does not establish it as a law of motion; or as a law of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> thought, the result of the relations of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a>. Philosophers having attempted to prove this as a matter of observation, have produced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> diversity of opinion in the mode of eliminating forces. A bullet, it is well known, which moves with double velocity, penetrates four times as far. This is confirmed.","sp":89,"ep":89},{"h":"DYNAMICS","t":"Of Moving confirmed by other similar facts; and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> this double <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> in the bullet, it has been observed by philosophers four times the force is expended, four times as much powder is required. This is the invariable result; and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> of this kind, it would appear that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of the forces employed has been very accurately ascertained. The conclusion therefore is, that moving forces are not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the velocities produced, but to the squares of the velocities. This is strongly confirmed by observing that moving bodies seem to possess forces in this very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a>, and to produce effects in this proportion; when, for instance, the velocity is only twice as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a>, they penetrate four times as deep.\n\n128. If this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of estimation be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a>, it is irreconcilable with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of those who admit that the velocity is proportional to the force impressed, in those cases where no previous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> can be had of the ratio of the forces, and of its equality to the ratio of the velocities. Such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is the force of gravity, which these philosophers always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> by its accelerating power, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> the velocity <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> in a given <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>. This must be granted; for there are cases in which the force can be measured by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> pressure which it exerts. Thus a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> steelyard can be constructed, the rod of which is divided by hanging <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> successively a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of perfectly equal weights. In the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of tension of the spring, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a> is proportional to the pressures of gravity which it balances. If it be found, that at Quito in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-PERU\">Peru</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> pull out the rod to the mark 312, and that the same weight at Spitzbergen draws it out to 313, it seems to be a fair inference to say, that the pressure of gravity at Quito is to its pressure at Spitzbergen as 312 to 313; and this is affirmed on the authority of effects being proportional to their causes. Such cases, however, are very rare; for it is seldom, that the whole of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> power, accurately measured in some other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, is employed in producing the observed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">Part</a> of it is generally otherwise expended, and therefore it frequently happens that the motions are not in the proportion with the supposed forces. And allowing that this could be done with accuracy, it would only be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> or fact; but these philosophers attempt to establish it as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>.\n\n129. It seems to be considered by Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton only as a physical law. And in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> good arguments are not wanting. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> which moves with a double, triple, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPLE\">quadruple</a> velocity, generates by impulse in another, a double, triple, or quadruple velocity, or it generates the same velocity in a double, triple, or quadruple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, and losing at the same time similar proportions of its own velocity.\n\nTwo bodies, having equal quantities of motion, meeting together, mutually stop each other.\n\nWhen two forces, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> similarly during equal times, produce equal velocities in a third body, they will, by acting together during the same time, produce a double velocity.\n\nIf a pressure which acts for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, produce a certain velocity, a double pressure acting during a second, will produce in the same body a double velocity.\n\nA force which is known to act equably, produces in equal times equal increments of velocity, whatever the velocities may be.\n\nIn all the examples above adduced, the forces are observed to be in the same proportion with the change of motion effected by them in a similar way.\n\nBut the curious discoveries of Dr Hooke, about the middle of the 17th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, seemed to show, from a great collection of facts, forces to be in a very different proportion. In the production of motion it was found, that four springs equal in strength, and bent to the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, generated only a double velocity in the ball which they impelled; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> springs generated only a triple velocity, &c. In the extinction of motion, it was found, that a ball moving with a double velocity, will penetrate four times as deep into a uniformly resisting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>; and a triple velocity will make it penetrate nine times as far, &c.\n\n130. These facts were brought forward by Leibnitz in support of his own pretensions to the discovery of the real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and measure of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> and force, which he said had been hitherto totally mistaken. He affirmed, that the inherent force of a moving body was in the proportion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the velocity. In this argument he was supported by John Bernoulli, who adduced many simple facts to confirm the relation between the inherent force of a moving body and its velocity. One of the strongest arguments urged by Leibnitz is, that the inherent force of a moving body is to be estimated by all that it is able to do before the total extinction of its motion; and therefore, when it penetrates four times as far, it is to be considered as having produced a quadruple effect. In this mode of estimation many things are gratuitously assumed, many contradictions are incurred; and it is only because forces are assumed as proportional to the velocities which they generate, that these facts come to be proportional to the squares of the same velocities. When Leibnitz assumes the quadruple penetration as the proof of the quadruple force of a body having twice the velocity, he has not considered that a double time is employed during this penetration. But a double force, acting equably during a double time, should produce a quadruple effect. This circumstance is lost sight of in all the facts which this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> has adduced. It may, however, be observed, that Leibnitz, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as his followers, holds no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> in all the consequences which are deduced from the measure which is here adopted. They admit, that a force producing an uniformly accelerated motion must be constant; they agree with the followers of Des Cartes in the valuations both of accelerating and deflecting forces; and have assiduously and successfully cultivated the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> of Newton, which proceeds on the principle of estimating the measure of moving forces by the velocity generated.\n\n131. It ought here to be observed, that moving forces only are taken into consideration. When a ball has acquired a certain velocity, whether it has been impelled by the elasticity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, by a spring, or struck off by a blow, or urged forward by means of a stream of air or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, or has obtained its velocity by falling; in all these cases it is conceived that it has sustained the same action of moving force. The only distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a>, perhaps, which we are able to form, is pressure;\nThe following is the enunciation, adapted to the characteristic and measure of a change of motion.\n\nLaw of the Changes of Motion.\n\nPROP. XII.\n\n134. In every change of motion, the new motion is compounded of the former motion, and of the motion which the changing produces in a body at rest.\n\nLet the change of motion be from AB (fig. 23.) to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AD\">AD</a>, this new motion AD is compounded of the former motion AB and of the motion AC.\n\nFor it has been shewn, that the change in any motion, is that motion, which when compounded with the former motion, produces the new motion; and the new motion (55.) is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> of the former motion and the changing motion. Since then the change of motion is the mark and measure of the changing force (133.) by which both the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> and intensity or velocity produced, are determined, the truth of the proposition will appear of course.\n\n133. It has been already observed (54.), that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of motions and the similar composition of forces are very different things. The first is a pure mathematical truth; the second, is a physical question dependent on the nature of the mechanical forces as they exist in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>. Our notions are not very distinct of two forces, each of which separately produces motions, having the directions and velocities expressed by the sides of a parallelogram, producing by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> action a motion in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DIAGONAL\">diagonal</a>. The demonstrations which have been frequently given, are altogether inconclusive, and only include the composition of motions; while gratuitous postulates have been assumed by those who endeavoured to accommodate their reasonings to physical principles. The celebrated Daniel Bernoulli gave the first legitimate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> of this proposition, in which, however, he employs a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of many propositions, some of which are very arbitrary. It was greatly simplified by D'Alembert, Mem. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol2.html#article-ACAD\">Acad</a>. des Sciences 1769, still, however, requiring many propositions. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">Ingenious</a> demonstrations have also been given by other celebrated mechanicians. In the following demonstration by Professor Robison, this distinguished philosopher has attempted to combine the demonstration of Bernoulli, D'Alembert, and others, thus rendering it more expeditious, and at the same time legitimate. This demonstration is entirely limited to preludes, without at all considering or employing the motions supposed to be produced by them.\n\n(A) If two equal and opposite preludes or incitements to motion act at once on a material particle, it suffers no change of motion; for if it yields in either direction by their joint action, one of the preludes prevails, and they are not equal.\n\nEqual and opposite preludes are said to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> each other; and such balance must be esteemed equal and opposite.\n\n(B) If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are two magnitudes of the same kind, proportional to the intensities of two preludes which act in the same direction, then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> \\(a + b\\) will measure the intensity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRELUDE\">prelude</a>, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a>, and may be called equal, to the combined effort of the other two; for when we try to form a notion of pressure as a measurable magnitude, distinct from motion...\nOf Moving Forces.","sp":89,"ep":92},{"h":"DYNAMICS","t":"Of Moving Forces.\n\nIf Moving <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> any other effect of it, we find nothing that we can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> it by but another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRELUDE\">prelude</a>.

Therefore the lines \\(Gg\\), \\(Oo\\), \\(Hh\\), are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a>, and \\(IL\\) is bisected in \\(K\\). Therefore \\(AI + AL\\) is equal to twice \\(AK\\).

It is evident, that the direction of the prelude, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by their joint action, will bisect the angle formed by their directions; because no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> can be assigned for the direction inclining more to one side than to the other.\n\nIn the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, since a force in the direction \\(AD\\) does, in fact, arise from the joint action of the equal preludes \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\), the prelude \\(AB\\) may be conceived as arising from the joint action of two equal forces similarly inclined and proportioned to it. Draw \\(EAF\\) perpendicular to \\(AD\\). One of these forces must be directed along \\(AD\\), and the other along \\(AE\\). In like manner, the prelude \\(AC\\) may arise from the joint action of a prelude in the direction \\(AD\\), and an equal prelude in the direction \\(AF\\). It is also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, that the preludes in the directions \\(AE\\) and \\(AF\\), and the two preludes in the direction \\(AD\\), must be all equal. And also, any one of them must have the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to \\(AB\\) or to \\(AC\\); that \\(AB\\) or \\(AC\\) has to the force in the direction \\(AD\\), arising from their joint action.\n\nTherefore, if it be said that \\(AD\\) does not measure the prelude arising from the joint action of \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\), let \\(Ad\\) greater than \\(AD\\), be its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> measure, and make \\(Ad : AB = AG : AB = AE\\). Then \\(AG\\) and \\(AE\\) have the same inclination and proportion to \\(AB\\) that \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\) have to \\(Ad\\). We determine, in like manner, two forces \\(Af\\) and \\(Ag\\) as constituents of \\(AC\\).\n\nNow \\(Ad\\) is equivalent to \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\), and \\(AB\\) is equivalent to \\(AE\\) and \\(AG\\); and \\(AC\\) is equivalent to \\(Af\\) and \\(Ag\\).

Therefore \\((B)\\) their measure is a magnitude equal to twice \\(Ag\\). But if \\(Ad\\) be greater than the diagonal \\(AD\\) of the square, whose sides are \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\); then \\(Ag\\) must be less than \\(AI\\), the side of the square whose diagonal is \\(AB\\). But twice \\(Ag\\) is less than \\(AD\\), and much less than \\(Ad\\). Therefore the measure of the equivalent of \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\) cannot be a line \\(Ad\\) greater than \\(AD\\).

Therefore AB and AC acting together, are equivalent to AR, AG, and AC acting together; that is, to AF and AE acting together; that is (N) to AD; or the forces AB and AC compose the force AD.\n\nHence arises the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> proposition.\n\nIf a material particle be urged at once by two pre-compositions or incitements to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, whose intensities are proportion of all to the sides of any parallelogram, and which incitements <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in the directions of those sides, it is affected in the same manner as if it were acted on by a single force, whose intensity is measured by the diagonal of the parallelogram, and which acts in its direction: Or, two pre-compositions, having the direction and proportion of the sides of a parallelogram, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> a pre-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, having the direction and proportion of the diagonal.\n\n136. Thus is demonstrated from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> principles the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> similarity of the composition of pre-compositions and the composition of forces measured by the motions which are produced. A separate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> seems indifferently necessary; for what may be deduced from the one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is not always applicable to the other. The change produced on a motion already existing by a deflecting force, cannot be explained by any composition of pre-compositions; because the changing pre-composition is the only one that exists, and there is none with which it may be compounded.","sp":93,"ep":93},{"h":"DYNAMICS","t":"Of Moving Forces.\n\n137. Considering this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> merely as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> fact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> physical law, abundant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> may be adduced in support of it.\n\n1. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of different forces is quite familiar. A lighter, for example, is dragged in different directions by two ropes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> different sides of the canal, the lighter moving in an intermediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, as if dragged in that direction by one rope only. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> moving in a particular direction, which receives a stroke across this direction, takes a direction lying between that of the first motion and that of the transverse stroke.\n\n2. If a particle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> A (fig. 23.) be urged at once by two pressures in the directions AB and AC; and if AB and AC be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the intensities of those pressures, the joint action of these two pressures is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to the action of a third pressure in the direction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DIAGONAL\">diagonal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AD\">AD</a>, and having its intensity in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> of AD. This is proved by observing, that the point A is withheld from moving by a pressure AE, which is equal and opposite to AD. But pressures are moving forces, producing velocities when they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> similarly during equal times, proportional to their intensities. The proportion, therefore, is true with respect to pressures, considered merely as such, and also with respect to the motions which may be produced by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>.\n\n3. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of a ball which is suspended by a thread, and drawn aside from its position in a state of rest, urges it downwards, and the ball is supported obliquely by the thread. Supposing this proposition to be true, the directions and intensities of the forces inciting it to motion in any position, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the result of the velocities, can be precisely ascertained.\n\n4. The motions of the planets computed on these principles of the composition of forces, do not exhibit any perceptible deviation from calculation, at the end of thousands of years.\n\nNothing, therefore, can be relied on with greater confidence than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> agreement between the composition of motions, and the composition of the forces, which, separately taken, would produce those motions, and which are measured by the velocities produced. But it ought to be remarked, that if the moving forces are measured by the squares of the velocities which they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a>, the composition cannot possibly hold; namely, from two forces which are represented by the sides of a parallelogram made proportional to the squares of the velocities, there <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not result a force which can be represented by the diagonal. But supposing the composition of forces to be as the velocities, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> exhibits them exactly.\u2014This proposition, therefore, whether it be considered as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> or as a physical law, may be received as fully established. The following is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> of this proposition.\n\nPROP. XIII.\n\n138. The force by which the motion AB is changed into AD, is that which would produce in a body at rest, the motion AC, and this compounded with AB produces the observed motion AD.\n\nPROP. XIV.\n\n139. The force which will produce in a body at rest a motion having the direction and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> represented by AC, when applied to a body moving with the velocity and in the direction AB, will change its motion into the motion AD, which is the diagonal of the parallelogram ABDC. For the new motion must be that which is compounded of AB and AC, that is, it must be the motion AD.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of these two propositions gives rise to the following, which is still more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>.\n\nPROP. XV.\n\n140. A body A being urged at once by two forces, which separately would cause it to describe AB and AC, the sides of a parallelogram ABDC, the body by their joint action will describe the diagonal AD in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>.\n\nFor if the body had been already moving with the velocity and in the direction AB, and if it had been acted on in A by the force AC, it would describe AD in the same time. But it matters not at what time it acquired the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> to describe AB. Let it be then at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> that the force AC is applied to it. And because its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> condition in A, which has the determination to the motion AB, is the same as in any other point of that line, it must describe AD.","sp":93,"ep":94},{"h":"DYNAMICS","t":"Of Moving Forces.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">On</a> the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> more motions, the constituent motions are supposed to continue; and it is only during their continuance that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> exists. If it be possible, which does not appear to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, that any force can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATE\">generate</a> a finite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> by its instantaneous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, two such forces generate in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DIAGONAL\">diagonal</a>. But supposing the action to continue for some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, to generate the velocities \\(AB\\) or \\(AC\\), there must be a continuance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> action during the same time to produce the velocity \\(<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AD\">AD</a>\\). And although the moving powers of the two forces may vary in their intensity, yet it is necessary that they retain the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to each other during the whole time of their joint action. Overlooking this circumstance, experiments have been made for the purpose of comparing this doctrine with the phenomena; and they have been found to exhibit very different results. But experiments made by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of pressures, such as weights pulling a body by means of threads, coincide precisely with this doctrine; for it is always found that two weights pulling in the directions \\(AB\\), \\(AC\\), and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to those lines, are balanced by a third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> in the proportion of \\(AD\\), and pulling in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> \\(AE\\). In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> the composition of pressures is clearly proved; and, having no other distinct <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCEPTION\">conception</a> of a moving force, these experiments may be considered as sufficient. But we may go farther; for there is the clearest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> by experiment, that pressures produce motions in proportion to their intensities by their similar action during equal times. In the planetary motions, the directions and intensities of the compound forces are accurately known as moving forces. These motions afford a complete proof of the physical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> coincidence with the calculations which proceed on the principles of this doctrine. This coincidence must be acknowledged as a full proof of the propriety of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> which has been assumed. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSUMPTION\">assumption</a> of any other measure would exhibit results quite different from the phenomena.\n\n143. Forces which produce motions along the sides of a parallelogram are called simple forces, or constituent forces. And the force which singly produces the motion in the diagonal, is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> force, the compound force, or the resulting force.\n\n144. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> conclusions may now be pointed out, which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> facilitate greatly the use of the parallelogram of forces.\n\nGeneral Corollaries.\n\n1. The constituent and the resulting forces, or the simple and compound forces, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>; for the sides and diagonal of a parallelogram are in one plane.\n\n2. The simple and the compound forces are proportional to the sides of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a> which are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to their directions. For if any three lines \\(ab\\), \\(bd\\), \\(ad\\), be drawn parallel to \\(AB\\), \\(AC\\), and \\(AD\\) (fig. 31.), they will form a triangle similar to the triangle \\(ABD\\). For the same reasons they are proportional to the sides of a triangle \\(a'b'd'\\), which are respectively <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> to their directions.\n\n3. Therefore each is proportional to the fine of the opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of this triangle; for the sides of any triangle are proportional to the fines of the opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>.\n\n4. Each is proportional to the fine of the angle contained by the directions of the other two; for \\(AD\\) is to \\(AB\\) as the fine of the angle \\(ABD\\) to the fine of the angle \\(ADB\\). Now the fine of \\(ABD\\) is the same with the fine of \\(BAC\\) contained between the directions \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\), and the fine of \\(ADB\\) is the same with the fine of \\(CAD\\); also \\(AB\\) is to \\(AC\\), or \\(BD\\), as the fine of \\(ADB\\) (or \\(CAD\\)) to the fine of \\(BAD\\).\n\n145. Let us now proceed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of this special use <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNDAMENTAL\">fundamental</a> proposition. And we observe, in the first of the places, that since \\(AD\\) may be the diagonal of an indefinite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of parallelograms, the motion or the pressure \\(AD\\) may result from the joint action of many pairs of forces. It may be produced by forces which would separately produce the motions \\(AF\\) and \\(AG\\). This generally gives us the means of discovering the forces which concur in its production. If one of them, \\(AB\\), is known in direction and intensity, the direction \\(AC\\), parallel to \\(BD\\), and the intensity, are discovered. Sometimes we know the directions of both. Then, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> the parallelogram or triangle, we learn their proportions. The force which deflects any motion \\(AB\\) into a motion \\(AD\\), is had by simply drawing a line from the point \\(B\\) (to which the body would have moved from \\(A\\) in the time of really moving from \\(A\\) to \\(D\\)) to the point \\(D\\). The deflecting force is such as would have caused the body move from \\(B\\) to \\(D\\) in the same time. And, in the same manner, we get the compound motion \\(AD\\), which arises from any two simple motions \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\), by supposing both of the motions to be accomplished in succession. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> of the body is the same, whether it moves along \\(AD\\) or along \\(AB\\) and \\(BD\\) in succession.\n\n146. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEOREM\">theorem</a> is not limited to the composition Equivalent of two forces only; for since the combined action of many two forces puts the body into the same state as if their forces equivalent alone had acted on it, we may suppose this to have been the case, and then the action of a third force will produce a change on this equivalent motion. The resulting motion will be the same as if only this third force and the equivalent of the other two had acted on the body. Thus, in fig. 32., the three forces \\(AB\\), \\(AC\\), \\(AE\\), may act at once on a particle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>. Complete the parallelogram \\(ABDC\\); the diagonal \\(AD\\) is the force which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\). Complete the parallelogram \\(AEFD\\); the diagonal \\(AF\\) is the force resulting from the combined action of the forces \\(AB\\), \\(AC\\), and \\(AE\\). In like manner, completing the parallelogram \\(AGHF\\), the diagonal \\(AH\\) is the force resulting from the combined action of \\(AB\\), \\(AC\\), \\(AE\\), and \\(AG\\), and so on of any number of forces.\n\nThis resulting force and the resulting motion may be much more expeditiously determined, in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of composition, by drawing lines in the proportion and direction of the forces in succession, each from the end of the preceding. Thus, draw \\(AB\\), \\(BD\\), \\(DF\\), \\(FH\\), and join \\(AH\\); \\(AH\\) is the resulting force. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> is evident.\n\n147. In the composition of more than two forces, we are not limited to one plane. The force \\(AD\\) is in the same plane with \\(AB\\) and \\(AC\\); but \\(AE\\) may be elevated above this plane, and \\(AG\\) may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> below it.\nOf Moving AF is in the plane of AD and AE, and AH is in the plane of AF and AG.\n\nComplete the parallelograms ABLE, ACKE, ELFK. It is evident that ABLFKCD is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLELOPIPED\">parallelopiped</a>, and that AF is one of its diagonals. Hence we derive a more general and very useful theorem.\n\nThree forces having the proportion and direction of the three sides of a parallelopiped, compose a force having the proportion and direction of the diagonal.\n\n148. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a> of very complicated phenomena, the mechanician considers every force as resulting from the joint action of three forces at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> angles to each other, and he takes the sum or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of these in the same or opposite directions. Thus he obtains the three sides of a parallelopiped, and from these computes the position and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> of the diagonal. This is the force resulting from the composition of all the partial ones. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> is called the elimination or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of forces. Forces may be estimated in the direction of a given line or plane, or they may be reduced to that direction, as has been done with respect to motion. See Cor. 2. Propos. 9. in Art. 57.\n\nThe laws of motion which have now been considered, are necessary consequences of the relations of those conceptions which we form of motion and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> force, and they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> facts or physical laws. To these Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton has added another, which is the following.\n\nThird Law of Motion.\n\n149. Every action is accompanied by an equal and contrary reaction, or the actions of bodies on one another are always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a>, equal, and in contrary directions.\n\nIn all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> which can be accurately examined, this holds to be a universal fact. Newton has made this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFIRMATION\">affirmation</a> on the authority of what he conceives to be a law of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> thought; namely that the qualities discovered in all bodies on which experiments and observations can be made, are to be considered as universal qualities of body. But if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> law of motion be limited to those consequences that necessarily flow from our notions of motion, of the causes of its production and changes, this proposition is not such a result. Because a magnet causes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> to approach toward it, it by no means follows from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of the iron shall be accompanied by any motion or change of state of the magnet, or it does not appear to be necessarily supposed that the iron attracts the magnet. When this was observed, it was accounted a discovery, and a discovery which is to be ascribed to the ancients. Dr Gilbert, who first mentions it, affirms that the magnet and the iron are observed mutually to attract each other, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as all electrical substances, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> bodies which are attracted by them. The discovery was made by Kepler that a mutual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> exists between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>. Newton discovered that the sun acts on the planets, and that the earth acts on the moon. It had been observed too by Newton that the iron reacts on the magnet, that the actions of electrified bodies are mutual, and that all the actions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> bodies are accompanied by an equal and contrary reaction. On the authority of the rule of philosophizing which he had laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, he affirmed that the planets react on the sun, and that the sun is not at rest, but is continually agitated by a small motion round the general centre of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>; and he pointed out several of the consequences of this reaction.\n\nAs the celestial motions were more narrowly examined by astronomers, their consequences were found to obtain, and to produce disturbances in the planetary motions. This reciprocity of action is now found to hold with the utmost precision through the whole of the solar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>; and therefore this third proposition of Newton is to be considered as a law of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>. And it is true with respect to all bodies on which experiment or observation can be made.\n\n150. This then being a universal law, we cannot divest our minds of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> that it depends on a general principle, by which all the matter in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a> is influenced. It strongly induces the persuasion of the ultimate particles of matter being alike, that a certain number of properties belong in the same degree to each atom, and that all the sensible differences of substance which are observed, arise from a different combination of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> atoms in the formation of a particle of those substances. All this is no doubt perfectly possible. But if each primary atom be so constituted, no action of any kind of particle or collection of particles can take place on another, which is not accompanied by an equal reaction in the opposite direction.\n\n151. Let us now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to the application of these laws. This answers a twofold purpose. The first is to discover the mechanical powers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> substances by which they are fitted to become parts of a permanent universe. This is accomplished by observing the changes of motion which always accompany those substances. It is from these changes that the only characteristics of powers are derived; and thus is discovered the power of gravity, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGNETISM\">magnetism</a>, &c. Another purpose in the employment of these laws is, that, after having obtained the mechanical character of any substance, we may ascertain what will be the result of its being in the vicinity of the bodies mechanically allied, or we may ascertain what is the change induced on the condition of the neighbouring bodies.\n\n152. The mechanical powers of bodies occasionally produce accelerations, retardations, and deflections in the motions of other bodies. These names have been given, because nothing is known of their nature, or of the manner in which they are effective; they are therefore named, as they are measured by the phenomena which are observed and considered as their effects. Let us now attend a little to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> circumstances relating to the action of these forces.\n\nOf Accelerating and Retarding Forces.\n\n153. Changes of motion are the only marks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of changing forces; and having no other mark of the force but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCELERATION\">acceleration</a>, it has obtained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of an accelerating force. When the motion is retarded it is called retarding force. Nor is there any other measure of the intensity of an accelerating force, but the acceleration which it produces. To investigate therefore the powers which produce all the changes of motion it is necessary to obtain measures of the acceleration. What has been said of accelerations and retardations of motion is equally descriptive of the effects of accelerating and retarding forces. Hence the following proposition.\n\nIf\nCorollaries.\n\nCor. 1. The momentary change of velocity is as the force \\( f \\) and the time \\( t \\) jointly. It may be thus expressed:\n\n\\[\nv_t = \\frac{v}{t} = \\frac{f}{t}\n\\]\n\nAlso, the accelerating or retarding force is proportional to the momentary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of the velocity, directly, and to the moment of time in which it is generated, inversely (48).\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{v}{t}, \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{v}{t} = \\frac{f}{t}\n\\]\n\nIndeed, all that we know of force is that it is something which is always proportional to \\( \\frac{v}{t} \\).\n\nCor. 2. Uniformly accelerated or retarded motion is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> of a constant or invariable accelerating force. For, in this case, the areas \\( abfe, acge, \\ldots \\) increase at the same rate with the times \\( ab, ac, \\ldots \\), and therefore the ordinates \\( ae, bf, cg, \\ldots \\) must all be equal; therefore the forces represented by them are the same, or the accelerating force does not change its intensity, or, it is constant. If, therefore, the circumstances mentioned in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> 37 and 38, are observed in any motion, the force is constant. And if the force is known to be constant, those propositions are true regarding the motions.\n\nCor. 3. No finite change of velocity is generated in an instant by an accelerating or retarding force. For the increment or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECREMENT\">decrement</a> of velocity is always expressed by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AREA\">area</a>, or by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRODUCT\">product</a> \\( ft \\), one side or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACTOR\">factor</a> of which is a portion of time. As no finite space can be described in an instant, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> must pass in succession through every point of the path, so it must acquire all the intermediate degrees of velocity. It must be continually accelerated or retarded.\n\nCor. 4. The change of velocity produced in a body in any time, by a force varying in any manner, is the proper measure of the accumulated or whole action of the force during this time. For, since the momentary change of velocity is expressed by \\( \\frac{f}{t} \\), the aggregate of all these momentary changes, that is, the whole change of velocity, must be expressed by the sum of all the quantities \\( \\frac{f}{t} \\). This is equivalent to the area of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> employed in art. 148, and may be expressed by \\( \\int f \\cdot t \\).\n\nCorollary.\n\nThe momentary change on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> of the velocity is as the force, and as the small portion of space along which it acts, jointly;\n\n\\[\nv^2 = \\frac{f}{s}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nf = \\frac{v^2}{s}\n\\]\n\n155. It deserves remark here, that as the momentary change of the simple velocity by any force \\( f \\) depends only on the time of its action, it being \\( = \\frac{f}{t} \\) (148.) Cor. 1. to the change on the square of the velocity depends on the space, it being \\( = \\frac{f}{s} \\). It is the same, whatever is the velocity thus changed, or even though the body be at rest when the force begins to act on it. Thus, in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> of the falling of a heavy body, the velocity is augmented 32 feet per second, and in every foot of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>, the square of the velocity increases by 64.\n\n156. The whole area \\( AE \\cdot ea \\), expressed by \\( \\int f \\cdot s \\), expresses the whole change made on the square of the velocity which the body had in \\( A \\), whatever this velocity may have been. We may therefore suppose the body to have been at rest in \\( A \\). The area then measures the square of the velocity which the body has acquired in the point \\( E \\) of its path. It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> that the change on \\( v^2 \\) is quite independent on the time of action, and therefore a body, in passing through the space \\( AE \\) with any initial velocity whatever, sustains the same change of the square of that velocity, if under the influence of the same force.\n\n157. This proposition is the same with the 39th of the First Book of Newton's Principia, and is perhaps the most generally useful, of all the theorems in Dynamics, in the solution of practical questions. It is to be found, without demonstration, in his earliest writings, the Optical Lectures, which he delivered in 1669 and following years.\n\n158. One important use may be made of it at present. It gives a complete solution of all the facts which were observed by Dr Hooke, and adduced by Leibnitz, with such pertinacity in support of his measure of the force of moving bodies. All of them are of precisely the same nature with the one mentioned in art. 157, or with the fact, \"that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> projected directly upwards with a double velocity, will rise to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPLE\">quadruple</a> height,\" and that a body, moving twice as fast, will penetrate \"four times as far into a uniformly tenacious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>.\" The uniform force of gravity, or the uniform tenacity of the penetrated body, makes a uniform opposition to the motion, and may therefore be considered as a uniform retarding force. It will therefore be represented, in fig. 8, by an ordinate always of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, and the areas which measure the square of the velocity lost will be portions of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTANGLE\">rectangle</a> \\( AE \\cdot ea \\). If therefore \\( AE \\) be the penetration necessary for extinguishing the velocity \\( v_2 \\), the space \\( AB \\), necessary for extinguishing the velocity \\( v_1 \\), must be \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of \\( AE \\), because the square of \\( 1 \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the square of \\( 2 \\).\n\n159. What particularly deserves remark here, is, that this proposition is true, only on the supposition that forces are proportional to the velocities generated by them in equal times. For the demonstration of this proposition proceeds entirely on the previously established measure of\nOf Moving of acceleration. We had \\( \\dot{v} = f \\dot{i} \\); therefore \\( v = f i \\).\n\nBut \\( \\dot{v} = \\dot{s} \\); therefore \\( v = f s \\), which is precisely this proposition.\n\n160. Those may be called similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of space, and similar instants of time, which divide given portions of space or time in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a>. Thus, the beginning of the 5th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a>, and of the 2nd foot, are similar points of a foot, and of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-YARD\">yard</a>. The beginning of the 21st <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, and of the 9th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, are similar instants of an hour, and of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>.\n\nForces may be said to act similarly when, in similar instants of time, or similar points of the path, their intensities are in a constant ratio.\n\n161. Lemma. If two bodies be similarly accelerated during given times \\( ac \\) and \\( hk \\) (fig. 33.), they are also similarly accelerated along their respective paths AC and HK.\n\nLet \\( a, b, c \\) be instants of the time \\( ac \\), similar to the instants \\( h, i, k \\) of the time \\( hk \\). Then, by the similar accelerations, we have the force \\( ae : hf : im \\). This being the case throughout, the area \\( af \\) is to the area \\( hm \\) as the area \\( ag \\) to the area \\( hn \\). These areas are as the velocities in the two motions 48. Therefore the velocities in similar instants are in a constant ratio, that is, the velocity in the instant \\( b \\) is to that in the instant \\( i \\), as the velocity in the instant \\( c \\) to that in the instant \\( k \\).\n\nThe figures may now be taken to represent the times of the motion by their abscissae, and the velocities by their ordinates, as in art. 28. The spaces described are now represented by the areas. These being in a constant ratio, as already shewn, we have A, B, C, and H, I, K, similar points of the paths. And therefore, in similar instants of time, the bodies are in similar points of the paths. But in these instants, they are similarly accelerated, that is, the accelerations and the forces are in a constant ratio. They are therefore in a constant ratio in similar points of the paths, and the bodies are similarly accelerated along their respective paths (155.)\n\n162. If two particles of matter are similarly urged by accelerating or retarding forces during given times, the whole changes of velocity are as the forces and times jointly; or \\( v = ft \\).\n\nFor the abscissae \\( ac \\) and \\( hk \\) will represent the times, and the ordinates \\( ae \\) and \\( hl \\) will represent the forces, and then the areas will represent the changes of velocity, by art. 47. And these areas are as \\( ac \\times ae \\) to \\( hk \\times hl \\).\n\nHence \\( t = \\frac{v}{f} \\), and \\( f = \\frac{v}{t} \\).\n\n163. If two particles of matter are similarly impelled or opposed through given spaces, the changes in the squares of velocity are as the forces and spaces jointly; or \\( v^2 = fs \\).\n\nThis follows, by similar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a>, from art. 49.\n\nIt is evident that this proposition applies directly to the argument to confidently urged for the propriety of the Leibnitzian measure of forces, namely, that four springs of equal strength, and bent to the same degree, generate, or extinguish only a double velocity.\n\n164. If two particles of matter are similarly impelled through given spaces, the spaces are as the forces and the squares of the times jointly.\n\nFor the moveables are similarly urged during the times of their motion (<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a> of 156.) Therefore \\( v = f t \\), and \\( v^2 = f s \\); but (158.) \\( v^2 = f s \\). Therefore \\( f s = f^2 t^2 \\) and \\( s = f t^2 \\).\n\nCorollary.\n\n\\( t^2 = \\frac{s}{f} \\) and \\( f = \\frac{s}{t^2} \\). That is, the squares of the times are as the spaces, directly, and as the forces, inversely; and the forces are as the spaces, directly, and as the squares of the times, inversely.\n\n165. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of motion in a body is the sum of the motions of all its particles. Therefore, if all are moving in one direction, and with one velocity \\( v \\), and if \\( m \\) be the number of particles, or quantity of matter, \\( mv \\) will express the quantity of motion \\( q \\), or \\( q = mv \\).\n\n166. In like manner, we may conceive the accelerating forces \\( f \\), which have produced this velocity \\( v \\) in each particle, as added into one sum, or as combined on one particle. They will thus compose a force, which, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>'s sake, it is convenient to mark by a particular name. We shall <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> it the motive force, and express it by the symbol \\( p \\). It will then be considered as the aggregate of the number \\( m \\) of equal accelerating forces \\( f \\), each of which produces the velocity \\( v \\) on one particle. It will produce the velocity \\( mv \\), and the same quantity of motion \\( q \\).\n\n167. Let there be another body, consisting of \\( n \\) particles, moving with one velocity \\( u \\). Let the moving force be represented by \\( \\pi \\). It is measured in like manner by \\( nu \\). Therefore we have, \\( p : \\pi = mv : nu \\), and \\( v : u = \\frac{p}{m} : \\frac{\\pi}{n} \\); that is,\n\nThe velocities which may be produced by the similar action of different motive forces, in the same time, are directly as these forces, and inversely as the quantities of matter to which they are applied.\n\nIn general, \\( \\frac{v}{f} = \\frac{p}{m} \\).\n\nAnd \\( f \\) being \\( \\frac{v}{t} \\), \\( f = \\frac{p}{mt} \\).\n\nRemark.\n\n168. In the application of the theorems concerning accelerating or retarding forces, it is necessary to attend carefully to the distinction between an accelerative and a motive force. The caution necessary here has been generally overlooked by the writers of Elements, and this has given occasion to very inadequate and erroneous notions of the action of accelerating powers. Thus, if a leaden ball hangs by a thread, which passes over a pulley, and is attached to an equal ball, movable along a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> plane, without the smallest obstruction, it is known, that, in one second, it will descend 8 feet, dragging the other 8 feet along the plane, with a uniformly accelerated motion, and will generate in it the velocity 16 feet per second. Let the thread be attached to three such balls. We know that it will descend 4 feet in a second, and generate the velocity 8 feet per second. Most readers are disposed to think that it should generate no greater velocity than \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\) feet per second, or \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of 16, because it is applied to three times as much matter (162.) The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>\nOf Moving error lies in considering the motive force as the same in both cases, and in not attending to the quantity of matter to which it is applied. Neither of these conjectures is right. The motive force changes as the motion accelerates, and in the first case, it moves two balls, and in the second it moves four. The motive force decreases similarly in both motions. When these things are considered, we learn by articles 202 and 207, that the motions will be precisely what we observe.\n\nOf Deflecting Forces, in General.\n\n169. It was observed, in art. 71, that a curvilinear motion is a case of continual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFLECTION\">deflection</a>. Therefore, when such motions are observed, we know that the body is under the continual influence of some natural force, acting in a direction which crooks that of the motion in every point. We must infer the magnitude and direction of this deflecting force by the magnitude and direction of the observed deflection. Therefore, all that is affirmed concerning deflections in the first and subsequent articles, may be affirmed concerning deflecting forces. It follows, from what has been established concerning the action of accelerating forces, that no force can produce a finite change of velocity in an instant. Now, a deflection is a composition of a motion already existing with a motion accelerated from rest by insensible degrees. Supposing the deflecting force of invariable direction and intensity, the deflection is the composition of a motion having a finite velocity with a motion uniformly accelerated from rest. Therefore the linear deflection from the rectilineal motion must increase by insensible degrees. The curvilinear path, therefore, must have the line of undeflected motion for its tangent. To suppose any finite angle contained between them would be to suppose a polygonal motion, and a sublunary deflection.\n\nTherefore no finite change of direction can be produced by a deflecting force in an instant.\n\n170. The most general and useful proposition on this subject is the following, founded on art. 75.\n\nThe forces by which bodies are deflected from the tangents in the different points of their curvilinear paths are proportional to the squares of the velocities in those points, directly, and inversely to the deflective chords of the equicurve circles in the same points. We may still express the proposition by the same symbol\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{v^2}{c} \\]\n\nwhere \\( f \\) means the intensity of the deflecting force.\n\n171. We may also retain the meaning of the proposition expressed in article 76, where it is shown that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> linear deflection from the tangent is the third proportional to the deflective chord and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> described in a very small moment. For it was demonstrated in that article (see fig. 18.) that \\( BZ : BC = BC : BO \\).\n\nWe see also that \\( Bb \\), the double of \\( BO \\), is the measure of the velocity, generated by the uniform action of the deflecting force, during the motion in the arch \\( BC \\) of the curve.\n\n172. The art. 77, also furnishes a proposition of frequent and important use, viz.\n\nThe velocity in any point of a curvilinear motion is that which the deflecting force in that point would generate in the body by uniformly impelling it along the fourth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the deflective chord of the equicurve circle.\n\nRemark.\n\n173. The propositions now given proceed on the supposition that, when the points \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) of fig. 18, after continually <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> to \\( B \\), at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> coalesce with it, the last circle which is described through these three points has the same curvature which the path has in \\( B \\). It is proper to render this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of solving these questions more plain and palpable.\n\nIf \\( ABCD \\) (fig. 35.) be a material curve or mould, and a thread be made fast to it at \\( D \\), this thread may be lapped on the convexity of this curve, till its extremity meets it in \\( A \\). Let the thread be now unlapped or evolved from the curve, keeping it always tight. It is plain that its extremity \\( A \\) will describe another curve line \\( Abc \\). All curves, in which the curvature is neither infinitely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> nor infinitely small, may be thus described by a thread evolved from a proper curve. The properties of the curve \\( Abc \\) being known, Mr Huyghens (the author of this way of generating curve lines) has shewn how to construct the evolved curve \\( ABC \\) which will produce it.\n\nFrom this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENESIS\">genesis</a> of curves we may infer, 1st, that the detached portion of the thread is always a tangent to the curve \\( ABC \\); 2dly, that when this is in any situation \\( Bb \\), it is perpendicular to the tangent of the curve \\( Abc \\) in the point \\( b \\), and that it is, at the same time, describing an element of that curve, and an element of a circle \\( abx \\), whose momentary centre is \\( B \\), and which has \\( Bb \\) for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADIUS\">radius</a>. 3dly, That the part \\( bA \\) of the curve, being described with radii growing continually shorter, is more incurvated than the circle \\( ba \\), which has \\( Bb \\) for its constant radius. For similar reasons the arch \\( bc \\) of the curve \\( Abc \\) is less incurvated than the circle \\( abx \\). 4thly, That the circle \\( abx \\) has the same curvature that the curve has in \\( b \\), or is an equicurve circle. \\( Bb \\) is the radius, and \\( B \\) the centre of curvature in the point \\( b \\).\n\n\\( ABC \\) is the curva evoluta or the evolute. \\( Abc \\) is sometimes called the involute of \\( ABC \\), and sometimes its evolventrix.\n\n174. By this way of describing curve lines, we see clearly that a body, when passing through the point \\( b \\) of the curve \\( Abc \\) may be considered as in the same state, in that instant, as in passing through the same point \\( b \\) of the circle \\( abx \\); and the ultimate ratio of the deflections in both is that of equality, and they may be used indiscriminately.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> difficulty in the application of the preceding theorems to the curvilinear motions which are observed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> phenomena of nature, is in ascertaining the direction of the deflection in every point of a curvilinear motion. Fortunately, however, the most important cases, namely those motions, where the deflecting forces are always directed to a fixed point, afford a very accurate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a>. Such forces are called by the general name of\n\nCentral Forces.\n\n175. If bodies describe circles with a uniform motion, the deflecting forces are always directed to the centres of the\nOf Moving the circles, and are proportional to the square of the velocities, directly, and to their distances from the centre, inversely.\n\nFor, since their motion in the circumference is uniform, the areas formed by lines drawn from the centre are as the times, and therefore (72.) the deflections, and the deflecting forces (164.) are directed to the centre. Therefore, the deflective chord is, in this case, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> of the circle, or twice the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of the body from the centre. Therefore, if we call the distance from the centre \\(d\\), we have \\(f = \\frac{v^2}{d}\\).\n\n176. These forces are also as the distances, directly, and as the square of the time of a revolution, inversely.\n\nFor the time of a revolution (which may be called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PERIODIC\">periodic</a> time) is as the circumference, and therefore as the distance, directly, and as the velocity, inversely. Therefore \\(t = \\frac{d}{v}\\), and \\(v = \\frac{d}{t}\\), and \\(v^2 = \\frac{d^2}{t^2}\\), and therefore \\(f = \\frac{d}{t^2}\\).\n\n177. These forces are also as the distances, and the square of the angular velocity, jointly.\n\nFor, in every uniform circular motion, the angular velocity is inversely as the periodic time. Therefore, calling the angular velocity \\(a\\), \\(a^2 = \\frac{1}{t^2}\\), and \\(d^2 = d \\cdot a^2\\), and therefore \\(f = \\frac{d}{a^2}\\).\n\n178. The periodic time is to the time of falling along half the radius by the uniform action of the centripetal force in the circumference, as the circumference of a circle is to the radius.\n\nFor, in the time of falling through half the radius, the body would describe an arch equal to the radius (37.\u20146.) because the velocity acquired by this fall is equal to the velocity in the circumference (167.). The periodic time is to the time of describing that arch as the circumference to the arch, that is, as the circumference is to the radius.\n\n179. When a body describes a curve which is all in one plane, and a point is so situated in that plane, that a line drawn from it to the body describes round that point areas proportional to the times, the deflecting force is always directed to that point (72.)\n\n180. Conversely. If a body is deflected by a force always directed to a fixed point, it will describe a curve lying in one plane which passes through that point, and the line joining it with the centre of forces will describe areas proportional to the times (73.)\n\nThe line joining the body with the centre is called the radius vector. The deflecting force is called centripetal, or attractive, if its direction be always toward that centre. It is called repulsive, or centrifugal, if it be directed outwards from the centre. In the first case, the curve will have its concavity toward the centre, but, in the second case, it will be convex toward the centre. The force which urges a piece of iron towards a magnet is centripetal, and that which causes two electrical bodies to separate is centrifugal.\n\n181. The force by which a body may be made to describe circles round the centre of forces, with the angular velocities which it has in the different points of its curvilinear path, are inversely as the cubes of its distances from the centre of forces. For the centripetal force in circular motions is proportional to \\(da^2\\) (172.) But when the deflections (and consequently the forces) are directed to a centre, we have \\(a = \\frac{1}{d^2}\\) (75.) and \\(a^2 = \\frac{1}{d^4}\\), therefore \\(da^2 = d \\times \\frac{1}{d^4} = \\frac{1}{d^3}\\), therefore \\(f = \\frac{1}{d^3}\\).\n\nThis force is often called centrifugal, the centrifugal force of circular motion, and it is conceived as always acting in every case of curvilinear motion, and to act in opposition to the centripetal force which produces that motion. But this is inaccurate. We suppose this force, merely because we must employ a centripetal force, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as we suppose a resisting vis inertiae, because we must employ force to move a body.\n\n182. If a body describe a curve line ABC by means of a centripetal (fig. 36.) force directed to S, and varying according to some proportion of the distances from it, and if another body be impelled toward S in the straight line aS by the same force, and if the two bodies have the same velocity in any points A and a which are equidistant from S, they will have equal velocities in any other two points C and c, which are also equidistant from S.\n\nDescribe round S, with the distance SA, the circular arch Aa, which will pass through the equidistant point a. Describe another arch Bb, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> off a small arc AB of the curve, and also cutting AS in D. Draw DE perpendicular to the curve.\n\nThe distances AS and aS being equal, the centripetal forces are also equal, and may be represented by the equal lines AD and ab. The velocities at A and a being equal, the times of describing AB and ab will be as the spaces (14.) The force ab is wholly employed in accelerating the rectilineal motion along aS. But the force AD, being transverse or oblique to the motion along AB, is not wholly employed in thus accelerating the motion. It is equivalent to the two forces AE and ED, of which ED, being perpendicular to AB, neither promotes nor opposes it, but incurvates the motion. The accelerating force in A therefore is AE. It was shewn, in art. 48, that the change of velocity is as the force and as the time jointly, and therefore it is as AE \\(\\times\\) AB. For the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, the change of the velocity at a is as ab \\(\\times\\) ab, or ab\u00b2. But, as the angle ADB is a right angle, as also AED, we have AE : AD = AD : AB, and AE \\(\\times\\) AB = AD\u00b2 = ab\u00b2. Therefore, the increments of velocity acquired along AB and ab are equal. But the velocities at A and a were equal. Therefore the velocities at B and b are also equal. The same thing may be said of every subsequent increase of velocity, while moving along BC and bc; and therefore the velocities at C and c are equal.\n\nThe same thing holds, when the deflecting force is directed in lines parallel to aS, as if to a point S' infinitely distant, the one body describing the curve line VA'B', while the other describes the straight line VS.\n\n183. The propositions in art 73. and 74. are also true in curvilinear motions by means of central forces.\nWhen the path of the motion is a line returning into itself, like a circle or oval, it is called an orbit; otherwise it is called a trajectory.\n\nThe time of a complete revolution round an orbit is called the periodic time.\n\n184. The formula \\( f = \\frac{v^2}{c} \\) serves for discovering the law of variation of the central force by which a body describes the different portions of its curvilinear path; and the formula \\( f = \\frac{d}{r^2} \\) serves for comparing the forces by which different bodies describe their respective orbits.\n\n185. It must always be remembered, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> to art. 77, that \\( f = \\frac{v^2}{c} \\) or \\( f = \\frac{\\text{arc}^2}{c} \\) expresses the linear deflection from the tangent, which may be taken for a measure of the deflecting force, and that \\( f = \\frac{2v^2}{c} \\) or \\( f = \\frac{2\\text{arc}^2}{c} \\) expresses the velocity generated by this force, during the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the arc, or the velocity which may be compared directly with the velocity of the motion in the arc. The last is the most accurate, because the velocity generated is the real change of condition.\n\n186. A body may describe, by the action of a centripetal force, the direction of which passes through C (fig. 36), a figure VPS, which figure revolves (in its own plane) round the centre of forces C, in the same manner as it describes the quiescent figure, provided that the angular motion of the body in the orbit be to that of the orbit itself in any constant ratio, such as that of m to n.\n\nFor, if the direction of the orbit's motion be the same with that of the body moving in it, the angular motion of the body in every point of its motion is increased in the ratio of m to n + m, and it will be in the same ratio in the different parts of the orbit as before, that is, it will be inversely as the square of the distance from S (75). Moreover, as the distances from the centre in the simultaneous positions of the body, in the quiescent and in the revolving orbit, are the same, the momentary increments of the area are as the momentary increments of the angle at the centre; and therefore, in both motions, the areas increase in the constant ratio of m to m + n (75.) Therefore the areas of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> path, produced by the composition of the two motions, will still be proportional to the times; and therefore (73.) the deflecting force must be directed to the centre S; or, a force so directed will produce this compound motion.\n\n187. The differences between the forces by which a body may be made to move in the quiescent and in the moveable orbit are in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERSE\">inverse</a> triplicate ratio of the distances from the centre of forces.\n\nLet VKSBV (fig. 36.) be the fixed orbit, and u p k b n the same orbit moved into another position; and let VP n No N t QV be the orbit described by the body in absolute space by the composition of its motion in the orbit with the motion of the orbit itself. If the body be supposed to describe the arch VP of the fixed orbit while the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a> VC moves into the situation u C, and if the arch u p be made equal to VP, then p will be the place of the body in the moveable orbit, and in the compound path V p. If the angular motion in the fixed orbit be to the motion of the moving orbit as m to n, it is plain that the angle VCP is to VCP as m to m + n. Let PK and p k be two equal and very small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> of the fixed and moving orbits. PC and p c are equal, as are also KC and k C, and a circle described round C with the radius CK will pass through k. If we now make VCK to VC n as m to m + n: the point n of the circle K k n will be the point of the compound path, at which the body in the moving orbit arrives when the body in the fixed orbit arrives at K, and p n is the arch of the absolute path described while PK is described in the fixed path.\n\nIn order to judge of the difference between the force which produces the motion PK in the fixed orbit and that which produces p n in the absolute path, it must be observed that, in both cases, the body is made to approach the centre by the difference between CP and CK. This happens, because the centripetal forces, in both cases, are greater than what would enable the body to describe circles round C, at the distance CP, and with the same angular velocities that obtain in the two paths, viz. the fixed orbit and the absolute path. We shall call the one pair of forces the circular forces, and the other the orbital. Let C and c represent the forces which would produce circles, with the angular velocities which obtain in the fixed and moving orbits, and let O and o be the forces which produce the orbital motions in these two paths.\n\nThese things being premised, it is plain that o \u2014 c is equal to O \u2014 C, because the bodies are equally brought towards the centre by the difference between O and C and by that between o and c. Therefore o \u2014 O is equal to c \u2014 C (a). The difference, therefore, of the forces which produce the motions in the fixed and moving orbits is always equal to the difference of the forces which would produce a circular motion at the same distances, and with the same angular velocity. But the forces which produce circular motions, with the angular motion that obtains in an orbit at different distances from the centre of forces, are as the cubes of the distances inversely (175.) And the two angular motions at the same distance are in the constant ratio of m to m + n. Therefore the forces are in a constant ratio to each other, and their differences are in a constant ratio to either of the forces. But the circular force at different distances is inversely as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a> of the distance (221). Therefore the difference of them in the fixed and moveable orbits is in the same proportion. But the difference of the orbital forces is equal to that of the circular. Therefore, finally, the difference of the centripetal\n\n(a) For let A o, AO, Ac, AC represent the four forces o, O, c, and C. By what has been said, we find that o c = OC. To each of these add O c, and then it is plain that o = c C, that is, that the difference of the circular forces c and C is equal to that of the orbital forces o and O.\nOf Moving petal forces by which a body may be retained in a fixed orbit, and in the same orbit moving as determined in article 180, is always in the inverse triplicate ratio of the distances from the centre of forces.\n\nIn this example, the motion of the body in the orbit is in the same direction with that of the orbit, and the force to be joined with that in the fixed orbit is always additive. Had the orbit moved in the opposite direction, the force to be joined would have been subtractive, unless the retrograde motion of the orbit exceeded twice the angular motion of the body. But in all cases, the reasoning is similar.\n\n188. Thus we have considered the motions of bodies influenced by forces directed to a fixed point. But we cannot conceive a mere mathematical point of space as the cause or occasion of any such exertion of forces. Such relations are observed only between existing bodies or masses of matter. The propositions which have been demonstrated may be true in relation to bodies placed in those fixed points. That continual tendency towards a centre, which produces an equable description of areas round it, becomes intelligible, if we suppose some body placed in the centre of forces, attracting the revolving body. Accordingly, we see very remarkable examples of such tendencies towards a central body in the motions of the planets round the sun, and of the satellites round the primary planet.\n\nBut, since it is a universal fact that all the relations between bodies are mutual, we are obliged to suppose that whatever force inclines the revolving body towards the body placed in the centre of forces, an equal force (from whatever source it is derived) inclines the central body toward the revolving body, and therefore it cannot remain at rest, but must move towards it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of a fixed centre of forces is thus taken away again, and we seem to have demonstrated propositions inapplicable to anything in nature. But more attentive consideration will show us that our propositions are most strictly applicable to the phenomena of nature.\n\n189. For, in the first place, the motion of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> centre of position of two, or of any number of bodies, is not affected by their mutual actions. These, being equal and opposite, produce equal and opposite motions, or changes of motion. In this case, it follows from art. 115, that the state of the common centre is not affected by them.\n\n190. Now, suppose two bodies S and P, situated at the extremities of the line SP (fig. 37.) Their centre of position is in a point C, dividing their distance in such a manner that SC is to CP as the number of material atoms in P to the number in S or SC : PC = P : S. Suppose the mutual forces to be centripetal. Then, being equal, exerted between every atom of the one, and every particle of the other, the vis motrix may be expressed by $P \\times S$. This must produce equal quantities of motion in each of the bodies, and therefore must produce velocities inversely as the quantities of matter. In any given portion of time, therefore, the bodies will move towards each other, to $s$ and $p$, and $S : s$ will be to $P : p$ as $P$ to $S$, that is, as $SC$ to $PC$. Therefore we shall still have $s : C : p C = SC : PC$. Their distances from C will always be in the same proportion. Also we shall have $SC : SP = s : P : S + P$; and therefore $SC : SP = s : C : s P$. Consequently, in whatever manner the mutual forces vary by a variation of distance from each other, they will vary in the same manner by the same variation of distance from C. And, conversely, in whatever manner the forces vary by a change of distance from C, they vary in the same manner by the same change of distance from each other.\n\nLet us now suppose that when the bodies are at S and P, equal moving forces are applied to each in the opposite directions SA and PB. Did they not attract each other at all, they would, at the end of some small portion of time, be found in the points A and B of a straight line drawn through C, because they will move with equal quantities of motion, or with velocities SA and PB inversely as their quantities of matter. Therefore $SA : PB = SC : PC$, and A, C, and B are in a straight line. But let them now attract, when impelled from S and P. Being equally attracted toward each other, they will describe curves $Sa$ and $Pb$, so that their deflections $Aa$ and $Bb$ are as $SC$ and $PC$; and we shall have $aC : bC = SC : PC$. As this is true of every part of the curve, it follows that they describe similar curves round C, which remains in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> place.\n\nLastly, If the motion of P be considered by an observer placed in S, unconscious of its motion, since he judges of the motion of P only by its change of direction and of distance, we may make a figure which will perfectly represent this motion. Draw the line EF equal and parallel to PS, and EG equal and parallel to $ab$. Do this for every point of the curve $Sa$ and $Pb$. We shall then form a curve FG similar to the curves $Sa$ and $Pb$, having the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMOLOGOUS\">homologous</a> lines equal to the sum of the homologous lines of these two curves. Thus the bodies will describe round each other curve lines which are similar and equal (linearly) to the lines which they describe round their common centre by the same forces. They may appear to describe areas proportional to the times round each other; and they really describe areas proportional to the times round their common centre of position, and the forces, which really relate to the body which is supposed to be central, have the same mathematical relation to their common centre.\n\nThus it appears that the mechanical inferences, drawn from a supposed relation to a mere point of space, are true in the real relations to the supposed central body, although it is not fixed in one place.\n\n191. The time of describing any arch FG of the curve described round the other body at rest in a centre of forces (where we may suppose it forcibly withheld from moving) is to the time of describing the similar arch $Pb$ round the common centre of position in the subduplicate ratio of $S + P$ to $S$, that is, in the ratio of $\\sqrt{S + P}$ to $\\sqrt{S}$. For the forces being the same in both motions, the spaces described by their similar actions, that is, their deflections from the tangent, are as the squares of the times $T$ and $t$ (204). That is, $HG : BA = T^2 : t^2$; and $T : t = \\sqrt{HG} : \\sqrt{BA} = \\sqrt{S + P} : \\sqrt{S}$.\n\nHence it follows that the two bodies S and P are moved in the same way as if they did not act on each other, but were both acted upon by a third body, placed in their common centre C, and acting with the same forces on each; and the law of variation of the forces by a change of distance from each other, and from this third body, is the same.\n\n192.

Being a monk in the cathedral of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTERBURY\">Canterbury</a>, he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a> to become the bosom friend and inseparable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> of two archbishops of that see, St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANSELM\">Anselm</a> and his successor Ralph. To the former of these he was appointed spiritual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTOR\">director</a> by the pope; and that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRELATE\">prelate</a> would do nothing without his permission. In the year 1120, he was sent for by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">King</a> Alexander I. of Scotland, to be raised to the primacy of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>; and having obtained leave of King Henry and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">archbishop</a> of Canterbury, he departed for Scotland, where he was kindly received by the king; and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the third <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> after his arrival, he was elected bishop of St Andrew's with much unanimity. But on the day after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a>, an unfortunate dispute arose between the king and him, in a private conference about his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSECRATION\">consecration</a>. Eadmerus having been a constant companion of the late and of the present archbishop of Canterbury, was a violent stickler for the prerogatives of that see. He therefore told the king, that he was determined to be consecrated by none but the archbishop of Canterbury, who he believed to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMATE\">primate</a> of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>. Alexander, who was a fierce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>, and supported the independency of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> and kingdom with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>, was so much offended, that he broke off the conference in a violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, declaring, that the see of Canterbury had no pre-eminency over that of St Andrew's. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> between the king and the bishop-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECT\">elect</a> became daily wider, till at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> Eadmerus, despairing of recovering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> favour, sent his pastoral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a> to the king, and laid his pastoral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">staff</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> altar, from whence he had taken it, and abandoning his bishopric returned to England. He was kindly received by the archbishop and clergy of Canterbury, though they disapproved of his stiffness, and thought him too hasty in forsaking the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> station to which he had been called. Nor was it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before Eadmerus became sensible of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, and desirous of correcting it. With this view he wrote a long submissive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to the king of Scotland, entreating his leave to return to his bishopric, promising compliances with his royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> in every thing respecting his consecration, which was accompanied by an epistle to the same purpose from the archbishop. These letters, however, which were written A.D. 1122, did not produce the desired effect. But Eadmerus is most worthy of the grateful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-REMEMBRANCE\">remembrance</a> of posterity for his historical works, particularly for his excellent history of the affairs of England in his own time, from A.D. 1066 to A.D. 1122; in which he hath inserted many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> papers, and preserved many important facts, that are nowhere else to be found. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> hath been highly commended, both by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> writers, for its authenticity, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as for regularity of compilation and purity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>.

See Falco, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORNITHOLOGY\">Ornithology</a> Index.\n\nEagle, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HERALDRY\">Heraldry</a>, is accounted one of the most noble bearings in armoury; and, according to the learned in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, ought to be given to none but such as greatly excel in the virtues of generosity and courage, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> for having done singular services to their sovereigns; in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> they may be allowed a whole eagle, or an eagle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NAIANT\">naiant</a>, or only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> or other parts thereof, as may be most agreeable to their exploits.\n\nThe eagle has been borne, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of ensign or standard, by several nations. The first who seem to have assumed the eagle are the Persians; according to the testimony of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-XENOPHON\">Xenophon</a>. Afterwards it was taken by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>; who, after a great variety of standards, at length fixed on the eagle, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> year of the consulate of C. Marius: till that time, they used indifferently wolves, leopards, and eagles, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> of the commander.\n\nThe Roman eagles, it must be observed, were not painted on a cloth or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a>; but were figures in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIEVO\">relievo</a>, of silver or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, borne on the tops of pikes; the wings being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a>, and frequently a thunderbolt in their talons. Under the eagle on the pike, were piled bucklers, and sometimes crowns. Thus much we learn from the medals.\n\nConstantine is said to have first introduced the eagle with two heads, to intimate, that though the empire seemed divided, it was yet only one body. Others say, that it was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLEMAGNE\">Charlemagne</a> who resumed the eagle as the Roman ensign, and added to it a second head; but that opinion is destroyed, by an eagle with two heads, noted by Liphius, on the Antonine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a>; as also by the eagle's only having one head on the feet of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> bull of the emperor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> IV. The conjecture, therefore, of F. Menefrier appears more probable, who maintains, that as the emperors of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">East</a>, when there were two on the throne, at the same time, struck their coins with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>, with a double travers, which each of them held in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, as being the symbol of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>; the like they did with the eagle in their ensigns; and instead of doubling their eagles, they joined them together, and represented them with two heads. In which they were followed by the emperors of the West.\n\nF. Papebroche wishes that this conjecture of Menefrier were confirmed by ancient coins; without which, he rather inclines to think the use of the eagle with two heads to be merely arbitrary; though he grants it probable, that it was first introduced on occasion of two emperors on the same throne.\n\nThe eagle on medals, according to M. Spanheim, is a symbol of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">providence</a>; and, according to all other antiquaries, of empire. The princes on whose medals it is most usually found, are the Ptolemies and the Seleucides of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>.

There were, besides the eagles, lionines, rosettes, and many other coins of the same sort, named according to the figures they were impressed with.\n\nThe current <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-COIN\">coin</a> of the kingdom was at that time a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> and silver, in a determined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a>, but these were so much worse than the standard proportion of that time, that they were not intrinsically worth quite half so much as the others. They were imported out of France and other foreign countries. When this prince had been a few years established on the throne, he set up mints in Ireland for the coining sufficient quantities of good money, and then decreed the use of these eagles, and other like kinds of base coins, and made it death, with confiscation of effects, to import any more of them into the kingdom.","sp":110,"ep":112},{"h":"EAGLE","t":"in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">Astronomy</a>, is a constellation of the northern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEMISPHERE\">hemisphere</a>, having its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> wing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> to the equinoctial.

It is thought to have been first discovered in 1686 by one Davis an Englishman, who called it Davis's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">Land</a>. It was next visited by Commodore Roggewein, a Dutchman, in 1722; who gave it the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EASTER\">Easter</a> Island, and published many <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol8.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a> accounts concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> and its inhabitants. It was also visited by a Spanish ship in 1770, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">captain</a> of which gave it the name of St. Carlos. The only authentic accounts of this island, however, which have yet appeared, are those published by Captain Cook and Mr Forster, who visited it in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> 1774. According to these accounts, the island is about 12 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> 13 leagues in circumference, and of a triangular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>; its greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>-west to south-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> is about four leagues, and its greatest breadth two. The hills are so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, that they may be seen at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of 15 or 16 leagues. The north and east <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of the island are of a considerable height; between them, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the south-east side, the shore forms an open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>, in which Captain Cook thinks the Dutch anchored in 1722. He himself anchored on the west side of the island, three miles northward.\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARD\">ward</a> from the south point. This, he says, is a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> with easterly winds; but a dangerous one when the wind blows from the contrary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>, as the other on the south-east side must be with easterly winds; so that there is no good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> to be had for shipping round the whole island.\n\nThe island itself is extremely barren; and bears evident marks not only of a volcanic origin, but of having been not very long ago entirely ruined by an eruption. As they approached the south point, Mr Forster informs us, that they observed the shore to rise perpendicularly. It consisted of broken rocks, whose cavernous appearance, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERRUGINOUS\">ferruginous</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, seemed to indicate that they had been thrown up by subterraneous fire. Two detached rocks <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> about a quarter of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MILE\">mile</a> off this point: one of them is singular on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of its shape, and represents a huge <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> or obelisk; and both these rocks were inhabited by multitudes of sea fowls. On landing and walking into the country, they found the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> covered with rocks and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> of all sizes, which appeared to have been exposed to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> fire, where they seemed to have acquired a black colour and porous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a>. Two or three flinty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of grasses grew among these stones, and in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> softened the desolate appearance of the country. The farther they advanced, the more ruinous the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the country seemed to be. The roads were intolerably rugged, and filled with heaps of volcanic stones, among which the Europeans could not make their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> but with the greatest difficulty; but the natives leaped from one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> to another with surprising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGILITY\">agility</a> and ease. As they went northward along the island, they found the ground still of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>; till at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> they met with a rock of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> black melted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LAVA\">lava</a>, which seemed to contain some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, and on which was neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> nor grass, nor any mark of vegetation. Notwithstanding this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> barrenness, however, there are several large tracts covered with cultivated soil, which produces potatoes of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> colour as sweet as carrots, plantains, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANES\">canes</a>. The soil is a dry hard clay: and the inhabitants use the grass which grows between the stones in other parts of the island as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANURE\">manure</a>, and for preserving their vegetables when young from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the sun.\n\nThe most remarkable curiosity belonging to this island is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of colossal statues; of which, however, very few remain entire. These statues are placed only on the sea <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>. On the east side of the island were seen the ruins of three platforms of stone <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, on each of which stood four of these large statues; but they were all fallen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> from two of them, and one from the third: they were broken or defaced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a>. Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a> measured one that had fallen, which was 15 feet in length, and six <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> over the shoulders: each statue had on its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> a large cylindrical stone of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> colour, wrought perfectly round. Others were found that measured near 27 feet, and upwards of eight feet over the shoulders; and a still larger one was seen standing, the shade of which was sufficient to shelter all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTY\">party</a>, consisting of near 30 persons, from the rays of the sun. The workmanship is rude, but not bad, nor are the features of the face ill formed; the ears are long, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTORTION\">distortion</a> practised in the country, and the bodies have hardly any thing of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> figure about them. How these islanders, wholly unacquainted with any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> power, could raise such stupendous figures, and afterwards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> the large cylindric stones upon their heads, is truly wonderful! The most probable conjecture seems to be, that the stone is fictitious; and that each figure was gradually erected, by forming a temporary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PLATFORM\">platform</a> round it, and raising it as the work advanced; but they are at any rate very strong proofs of the ingenuity and perseverance of the islanders in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> when they were built, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a> of the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> had been better days than their descendants enjoy. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> of this island is in general brackish, there being only one well that is perfectly fresh, which is at the east end of the island; and whenever the natives repair to it to flake their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THIRST\">thirst</a>, they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-WASH\">wash</a> themselves all over; and if there is a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>, the first leaps into the middle of the hole, drinks, and washes himself without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>; after which another takes his place, and so on in succession. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> was much disdained by their new friends, who stood greatly in need of this valuable article, and did not wish to have it contaminated by such ablutions.\n\nThe people are of a middle <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>. In general they are rather thin; go entirely naked; and have punctures on their bodies, a custom <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> to all the inhabitants of the South Sea islands. Their greatest singularity is the size of their ears, the lobe of which is stretched out so that it almost rests on their shoulder; and is pierced with a very large hole, capable of admitting four or five fingers with ease. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> ornaments for their ears are the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> down of feathers, and rings which they wear in the inside of the hole, made of the sugar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANE\">cane</a>, which is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a>, and for this purpose is rolled up like a watch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a>. Some were seen clothed in the same cloth used in the island of Otaheite, tinged of a bright <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a> colour with turmeric; and these our voyagers supposed to be chiefs. Their colour is a chestnut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>; their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> black, curling, and remarkably strong; and that on the head as well as the face is cut short. The women are small, and slender limbed: they have punctures on the face, resembling the patches sometimes used by European ladies; they paint their face all over with a reddish brown ruddle, and above this they lay a fine orange colour extracted from turmeric root; the whole is then variegated with streaks of white shell lime. But the most surprising circumstance of all with regard to these people, is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> scarcity of women among them. The nicest calculation that could be made, never brought the number of inhabitants in this island to above 700, and of these the females bore no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> in number to the males. Either they have but few females, or else their women were restrained from appearing during the stay of the ship; notwithstanding, the men showed no signs of a jealous disposition, or the women any scruples of appearing in public: in fact, they seemed to be neither revered nor chaste; and the large pointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a> which they wore gave them the appearance of professed wantons. But as all the women who were seen were liberal of their favours, it is more than probable that all the married and modest ones had concealed themselves from their impetuous visitants in some inextricable parts of the island; and what further strengthens this supposition is,\nthat heaps of stones were seen piled up into little hillocks, which had one steep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> side, where a hole went under ground.

A portion of the clear spirit was poured upon a larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of fine powdered mastic than it was judged could be taken up. This was occasionally agitated without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>; by which means the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> resin was for the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> gradually dissolved. One part of the oily solution was poured into a phial, and to this was added one part of the solution of mastic. No opacity <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> other change appeared. Four parts of strong caustic volatile alkali were then poured in, and immediately shaken. The fluid was of a dense opaque <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, affording a slight ruddy tinge when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> was seen through a thin portion of it. In a second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a>, four parts of the alkali were added to one of the solution of mastic; it appeared of a less dense and more yellowish white than the former mixture. More of the gum resinous solution was then poured in; but it still appeared less opaque than that mixture. It was ruddy by transmitted light. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> experiment was repeated with the oily solution instead of that of mastic. The white was much less dense than either of the foregoing compounds, and the requisite opacity was not given by augmenting the dose of the oily solution. No rudeness nor other remarkable appearance was seen by transmitted light. These mixtures were left at repose for two days; no separation appeared in either of the compounds containing mastic; the compound, consisting of the oily solution and alkali, became paler by the separation of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREAM\">cream</a> at the top.\n\nIt appears, therefore, that the first of these three mixtures, subject to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of the quantity of its ingredients, and the odorant additions which may be made, is a good eau de luce.\n\nIn a subsequent number of the same Journal, we have the following recipe by one of the author's correspondents, who had often proved its value by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>.\n\n\"Digest ten or twelve grains of the whitest pieces of mastic, selected for this purpose and powdered, in two ounces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALCOHOL\">alcohol</a>; and, when nearly dissolved, add twenty grains of elemi.

This opinion Origen himself seems to give into, in his book against Celsus, where he says that they called Ebionites, such among the Jews as believed that Jesus was truly the expected Messiah.\n\nIt might even be urged, with some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> Christians assumed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> themselves, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> to their profession. It is certain, Epiphanius observes, they valued themselves <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> being poor, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a> of the apostles. The same Epiphanius, however, is of opinion, that there had been a man of the name of Ebion, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> and founder of the sect of Ebionites, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPORARY\">contemporary</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NAZARENES\">Nazarenes</a> and Cerinthians. He gives a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> and exact <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the origin of the Ebionites, making them to have risen after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>, when the first Christians, called Nazarenes, went out of the same to live at Pella.\n\nThe Ebionites were little else than a branch of Nazarenes: only that they altered and corrupted in many things the purity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> held among those first adherents to Christianity. For this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> Origen distinguishes two kinds of Ebionites, in his answer to Celsus; the one believed that Jesus Christ was born of a virgin; and the other, that he was born after the manner of other men.\n\nThe first were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORTHODOX\">orthodox</a> in every thing, except that to the Christian doctrine they joined the ceremonies of the Jewish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, with the Jews, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SAMARITANS\">Samaritans</a>, and Nazarenes; together with the traditions of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHARISEES\">Pharisees</a>. They differed from the Nazarenes, however, in several things, chiefly as to what regards the authority of the sacred writings; for the Nazarenes received all for Scripture contained in the Jewish canon; whereas the Ebionites rejected all the prophets, and held the very names of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAIAH\">Isaiah</a>, Jeremiah, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EZEKIEL\">Ezekiel</a>, in abhorrence. They also rejected all St Paul's epistles, whom they treated with the utmost disrespect.\n\nThey received nothing of the Old <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TESTAMENT\">Testament</a> but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENTATEUCH\">Pentateuch</a>; which should intimate them to have descended rather from the Samaritans than from the Jews. They agreed with the Nazarenes in using the Hebrew <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOSPEL\">gospel</a> of St Matthew, otherwise called the Gospel of the Twelve Apostles; but they had corrupted their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> in abundance of places; and particularly, had left out the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENEALOGY\">genealogy</a> of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVIOUR\">Saviour</a>, which was preserved entire in that of the Nazarenes, and even in those used by the Cerinthians.\n\nSome, however, have made this gospel canonical, and of greater value than our present Greek gospel of St Matthew: See Nazarenes. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a>, whose sentiments, as to the birth of our Saviour, were the same with those of the Ebionites, built their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> on this very genealogy.\n\nBesides the Hebrew gospel of St Matthew, the Ebionites had adopted several other books, under the names of St James, John, and the other apostles: they also made use of the Travels of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a>, which are supposed to have been written by St Clement; but had altered them so, that there was scarce any thing of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> left in them. They even made that faint tell a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of falsehoods, the better to authorize their own practices. See St Epiphanius, who is very diffusive on the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a> of the Ebionites, Hier. 30. But his account deserves little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>, as, by his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFESSION\">confession</a>, he has confounded the other sects with the Ebionites, and has <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> them with errors to which the first adherents of this sect were utter strangers.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EBONY\">EBONY</a> OF <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRETE\">CRETE</a>.

By some of their descriptions, it should be a sort of palm tree; by others a cytus, &c. The most authentic of them is that of M. Falcourt, who resided many years in Madagascar as governor thereof; he affirms us, that it grows very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> and big, its bark being black, and its leaves resembling those of our myrtle, of a deep dusky green <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>.\n\nTavernier affirms us, that the islanders always take care to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> their trees, when cut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, to make them the blacker, and to prevent their splitting when wrought. F. Plumier mentions another black ebony tree, discovered by him at St Domingo, which he calls *portunum portulaceae foliis aculeatum ebeni materie*. Candia also bears a little shrub, known to the botanists under the name of *Ebenus Cretica*, above described.\n\nPliny and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DIOSCORIDES\">Dioscorides</a> say the best ebony comes from Ethiopia, and the worst from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>; but Theophratus prefers that of India. Black ebony is much preferred to that of other colours. The best is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JET\">jet</a> black, free of veins and rind, very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASSIVE\">massive</a>, astringent, and of an acrid pungent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a>. Its rind, infused in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, is said to purge pituita, and cure venereal disorders; whence Matthiolus took guaiacum for a sort of ebony. It yields an agreeable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFUME\">perfume</a> when laid on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> coals; when green, it readily takes fire from the abundance of its fat. If rubbed against a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, it becomes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>. The Indians make statues of their gods, and sceptres for their princes, of this wood. It was first brought to Rome by Pompey, after he subdued <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MITHRIDATES\">Mithridates</a>. It is now much less used among us than anciently, since the discovery of so many ways of giving other hard woods a black colour.\n\nAs to the green ebony, besides Madagascar and St Maurice, it likewise grows in the Antilles, and especially in the isle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TOBAGO\">Tobago</a>. The tree that yields it is very bushy; its leaves are smooth, and of a fine green colour.

This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of power was very advantageous to them both: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of the bishop added <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> and reverence to the sheriff's proceedings; and the authority of the sheriff was equally useful to the bishop, by enforcing obedience to his decrees in such refractory offenders as would otherwise have despised the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a> of mere ecclesiastical censures.\n\nBut so moderate and rational a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> was wholly inconsistent with those views of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a> that were then forming by the court of Rome. It soon became an established maxim in the papal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of policy, that all ecclesiastical persons, and all ecclesiastical causes, should be solely and entirely subject to ecclesiastical jurisdiction only: which jurisdiction was supposed to be lodged in the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> and immediately in the Pope, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> indefeasible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTITURE\">investiture</a> from Christ himself, and derived from the Pope to all inferior tribunals. Hence the canon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> lays it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> as a rule, that \"facere deos a regibus honorandi sunt, non judicandi;\" and places an emphatical reliance <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol8.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a> tale which it tells of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a> Constantine. That when some petitions were brought to him, imploring the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> of his authority against certain of his bishops accused of oppression and injustice; he caused, (says the holy canon) the petitions to be burnt in their presence, dismissing them with this valediction: \"Ite, et inter vos causae vestras discutite, quia dignum non est ut nos judicemus Deos.\"\n\nIt was not, however, till after the Norman conquest, that this doctrine was received in England; when William I. (whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> was warmly espoused by the monasteries which he liberally endowed, and by the foreign clergy whom he brought over in shoals from France and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, and planted in the best preferments of the English church) was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> prevailed upon to establish this fatal encroachment, and separate the ecclesiastical court from the civil: whether actuated by principles of bigotry, or by those of a more refined policy, in order to discountenance the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">King</a> Edward abounding with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of Saxon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>, is not altogether certain. But the latter, if not the cause, Ecclesiastical was undoubtedly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>, of this separation: for the Saxon laws were soon overborne by the Norman justiciaries, when the county court fell into disrepute by the bishop's withdrawing his presence, in obedience to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a> of the conqueror; which prohibited any spiritual cause from being tried in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECULAR\">secular</a> courts, and commanded the suitors to appear before the bishop only, whose decisions were directed to conform to the canon law.\n\nKing Henry I. at his accession, among other restorations of the laws of King Edward the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONFESSOR\">Confessor</a>, revived this of the union of the civil and ecclesiastical courts. Which was, according to Sir Edward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COKE\">Coke</a>, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the conquest was past, only a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESTITUTION\">restitution</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> law of England. This however was ill relished by the Popish clergy, who, under the guidance of that arrogant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRELATE\">prelate</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHBISHOP\">Archbishop</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANSELM\">Anselm</a>, very early disapproved of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> that put them on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with the profane laity, and subjected spiritual men and causes to the inspection of the secular magistrates: and therefore, in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYNOD\">synod</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a>, 3 Hen. I. they ordained, that no bishop should attend the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> of temporal causes; which soon dissolved this newly effected union. And, when upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of King Henry I. the usurper Stephen was brought in and supported by the clergy, we find one article of the oath which they imposed upon him was, that ecclesiastical persons and ecclesiastical causes should be subject only to the bishop's jurisdiction. And as it was about that time that the contest and emulation began between the laws of England and those of Rome, the temporal courts adhering to the former, and the spiritual adopting the latter, as their rule of proceeding; this widened the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> between them, and made a coalition afterwards impracticable; which probably would else have been effected at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> reformation of the church.\n\nEcclesiastical courts are various; as the Archdeacons', the Consistory, the court of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARCHES\">Arches</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PECULIARS\">Peculiars</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">Prerogative</a>, and the great court of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> in all ecclesiastical causes, viz. the Court of Delegates.

And, should any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> be attempted, great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> would probably arise, in overturning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> established forms, and new-modelling a course of proceedings that has now prevailed for seven centuries.\n\nThe establishment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CIVIL_LAW\">civil law</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> in all the ecclesiastical courts was indeed a masterpiece of papal dexterity, as it made a coalition impracticable between them and the national tribunals, without manifest inconvenience and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAZARD\">hazard</a>. And this consideration had undoubtedly its weight in causing this measure to be adopted, though many other causes concurred.

The word is formed from the Greek \u1f11\u03c7\u03ce, \u1f11\u03c7\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd, \u1f11\u03c7\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd, \u1f11\u03c7\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd.\n\nThe ancients being wholly unacquainted with the true cause of the echo, ascribed it to several causes sufficiently whimsical. The poets, who were not the worst of their philosophers, imagined it to be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> metamorphosed, and that the affected to take up her abode in particular places; for they found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, that she was not to be met with in all. (See below, Echo in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol8.html#article-FABULOUS\">Fabulous</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a>.) But the moderns, who know sound to consist in a certain tremor or vibration in the sonorous body communicated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and by that means to the ear, give a more consistent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of echo.\n\nFor a tremulous body, striking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> another solid body, it is evident, may be repelled without destroying or diminishing its tremor; and consequently a sound may be redoubled by the reflection of the tremulous body, or air.\n\nBut a simple reflection of the sonorous air is not enough to solve the echo: for then every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> surface of a solid hard body, as being fit to reflect a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> or sound, would redouble it; which we find does not hold.\n\nTo produce an echo, therefore, it should seem that a kind of concameration or vaulting were necessary, in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a>, and by collecting to heighten and increase, and afterwards reflect, the sound; as we find is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> in reflecting the rays of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>, where a concave mirror is required.\n\nIn effect, as often as a sound strikes perpendicularly on a wall, behind which is any thing of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VAULT\">vault</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a>, or even another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> wall, so often <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> it be reverberated in the same line, or other adjacent ones.\n\nFor an echo to be heard, therefore, it is necessary the ear be in the line of reflection: for the person who made the sound to hear its echo, it is necessary he be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> which reflects it; and for a manifold or tautological echo, it is necessary there be a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of walls, and vaults or cavities, either placed behind or fronting each other.\n\nA single arch or concavity, &c. can scarce ever stop and reflect all the sound; but if there be a convenient disposition behind it, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the sound propagated thither, being collected and reflected as before, will present another echo: or, if there be another concavity, opposed at a due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> to the former, the sound reflected from the one upon the other will be tossed back again by this latter, &c.\n\nMany of the phenomena of echoes are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> considered by the bishop of Leighs, &c. who remarks, that any sound, falling either directly or obliquely on any dense body of a smooth, whether plain or arched, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPERFICIES\">superficies</a>, is reflected, or echoes, more or less. The surface, says he, must be smooth; otherwise the air, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REVERBERATION\">reverberation</a>, will be put out of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, and the sound thereby broken and extinguished. He adds, that it echoes more or less, to show, that when all things are as before described, there is still an echoing, though it be not always heard, either because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> sound is too weak to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> quite back again to him that made it; or that it does return to him, but so weak, that it cannot be discerned; or that he stands in a wrong place to receive the reflected sound, which passes over his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a>, under his feet, or on one side of him; and which therefore may be heard by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> standing in the place where the reflected sound does come, provided no interposed body intercepts it, but not by him that first made it.\n\nEchoes may be produced with different circumstances. For, 1. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> obstacle reflects the sound back in its due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TONE\">tone</a> and loudness; allowance being made for the proportionable decrease of the sound, according to its distance.\n\n2. A convex obstacle reflects the sound somewhat smaller and somewhat quicker, though weaker, than otherwise it would be.\n\n3. A concave obstacle echoes back the sound, bigger, flower, and also <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a>; but never according to the order of words.\n\nNor does it seem possible to contrive any single echo, that shall invert the sound, and repeat backwards; because, in such case, the word <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> spoken, that is, which last occurs to the obstacle, must be repelled first; which cannot be. For where in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> should the first words hang and be concealed? or how, after such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAUSE\">pause</a>, be revived, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a> again into motion?\n\nFrom the determinate concavity or archness of the reflecting bodies, it may happen that some of them shall only echo back one determinate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>, and only from one place.\n\n4. The echoing body being removed farther off, it reflects more of the sound than when nearer; which is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> why some echoes repeat but one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYLLABLE\">syllable</a>, some one word, and some many.\n\n5. Echoing bodies may be so contrived and placed, as that reflecting the sound from one to the other, either directly and mutually, or obliquely and by succession, out of one sound, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULTIPLE\">multiple</a> echo or many echoes shall arise.\n\nAdd, that a multiple echo may be made, by so placing the echoing bodies at unequal distances, that they may reflect all one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, and not one on the other; by which means, a manifold successive sound will be heard; one clap of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, like many; one ha, like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAUGHTER\">laughter</a>; one single word, like many of the same tone and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCENT\">accent</a>; and so one viol, like many of the same kind, imitating each other.\n\nLastly, Echoing bodies may be so ordered, that from any one sound given, they shall produce many echoes different both as to tone and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a>. By which means a musical room may be so contrived, that not only one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> playing therein shall seem many of the same fort and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, but even a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONCERT\">concert</a> of different ones, only by placing certain echoing bodies so, that any note played shall be returned by them in 3ds, 6ths, and 8ths.\n\nEcho, is also used for the place where the repetition of the sound is produced or heard.\n\nEchoes are distinguished into divers kinds, viz.\n\n1. Single,\n1. Single, which return the voice but once. Whereof some are tonical, which only return a voice when modulated into some particular musical tone: Others, polyphallic, which return many syllables, words, and sentences. Of this last kind is that fine echo in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOODSTOCK\">Woodstock</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PARK\">park</a>, which Dr Plot affirms us, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> time, will return very distinctly seventeen syllables, and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> twenty.\n\n2. Multiple, or tautological; which return syllables and words the same oftentimes repeated.\n\nIn echoes, the place where the speaker stands is called the centrum phonicum, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> or place that returns the voice, the centrum phonoacanticum.\n\nAt the sepulchre of Metella, wife of Craflus, was an echo, which repeated what a man said five times. Authors mention a tower at Cyzicus, where the echo repeated seven times. One of the finest echoes we read of is that mentioned by Barthius, in his notes on Statius's Theba\u00efs, lib. vi. 90, which repeated the words a man uttered 17 times: it was on the banks of the Naha, between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COBLENZ\">Coblenz</a> and Bingen. Barthius affirms us, he had proved what he writes; and had told 17 repetitions. And whereas, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> echoes, the repetition is not heard till some time after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> the word spoke, or the notes sung; in this, the person who speaks or sings is scarce heard at all; but the repetition most clearly, and always in surprising varieties; the echo seeming sometimes to approach nearer, and sometimes to be further off. Sometimes the voice is heard very distinctly, and sometimes scarce at all. One hears only one voice, and another several; one hears the echo on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, and the other on the left, &c. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILAN\">Milan</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, is an echo which reiterates the report of a pistol 56 times; and if the report is very loud, upwards of 60 reiterations may be counted. The first 20 echoes are pretty distinct; but as the noise seems to fly away, and answer at a greater distance, the reiterations are so doubled, that they can scarce be counted.

It consists of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> parts; the first containing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> system of mythology, properly called the Edda; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> being a kind of art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, and called scalda or poetics. The most ancient Edda was compiled by Soemund Sigfusson, named the Learned, who was born in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ICELAND\">Iceland</a> about the year 1057. This was abridged, and rendered more easy and intelligible about 120 years afterwards, by Snorro Sturlefon, who was supreme judge of Iceland in the years 1215 and 1222; and it was published in the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIALOGUE\">dialogue</a>. He added also the second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> in the form of a dialogue, being a detail of different events transacted among the divinities. The only three pieces that are known to remain of the more ancient Edda of Soemund, are the Volupsa, the Havamal, and the Runic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a>. The Volupsa, or prophecy of Vola or Fola, appears to be the text, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> which the Edda is the comment. It contains, in two or three hundred lines, the whole system of mythology disclosed in the Edda, and may be compared to the Sibylline verses, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of its laconic yet bold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STYLE\">style</a>, and its imagery and obscurity. It is professedly a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVELATION\">revelation</a> of the decrees of the Father of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and the actions and operations of the gods. It describes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAOS\">chaos</a>, the formation of the world, with its various inhabitants, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUNCTION\">function</a> of the gods, their most signal adventures, their quarrels with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LOKE\">Loke</a> their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> adversary, and the vengeance that ensued; and concludes with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFLAGRATION\">conflagration</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> of the inferior deities and the evil beings, the renovation of the world, the happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> of the good, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> of the wicked. The Havamal, or Sublime Discourse, is attributed to the god <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ODIN\">Odin</a>, who is supposed to have given these precepts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a> to mankind; it is comprised in about 120 stanzas, and resembles the book of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-PROVERBS\">Proverbs</a>. Mr Mallet has given several extracts of this treatise on the Scandinavian ethics. The Runic chapter contains a short system of ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGIC\">magic</a>, and especially of the enchantments wrought by the operation of Runic characters, of which Mr Mallet has also given a specimen. A manuscript <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of the Edda of Snorro is preserved in the library of the university of Upsal; the first part of which hath been published with a Swedish and Latin version by M. Goranson. The Latin version is printed as a supplement to M. Mallet's Northern Antiquities. The first edition of the Edda was published by Reichenius, professor at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPENHAGEN\">Copenhagen</a>, in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> quarto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a>, in the year\nEdda year 1665; containing the text of the Edda, a Latin translation by an Icelandic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>, a Danish version, and various readings from different MSS. M. Mallet has also given an English translation of the first part, accompanied with remarks; from which we learn, that the Edda teaches the doctrine of the Supreme, called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">Universal</a> Father, and Odin, who lives for ever, governs all his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>, and directs the great things as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the small; who formed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, and gave him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a>, which shall live after the body shall have mouldered away; and then all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> shall dwell with him in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> Gimle or Vingolf, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> of friendship; but wicked men shall go to Hel, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, and from thence to Niflheim, or the abode of the wicked, which is below in the ninth world. It inculcates also the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> of several inferior gods and goddesses, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of whom is Frigg or Freia, i.e. lady, meaning hereby the earth, who was the spouse of Odin or the Supreme God; whence we may infer that, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of these ancient philosophers, this Odin was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> principle or soul of the world, which uniting itself with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, had thereby put it into a condition to produce the intelligences or inferior gods, and men and all other creatures. The Edda likewise teaches the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of an evil being called Loki, the calumniator of the gods, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICER\">artificer</a> of fraud, who surpasses all other beings in cunning and perfidy.

Thus, Edinburgh, lying on the very outskirts of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> which was most exposed to the ravages of the barbarians, became perpetually subject to wars and devastations; by means of which, the time of its first foundation cannot now be guessed at.\n\nThe castle is certainly very ancient. It <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> of the Saxons or English from the invasion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OETA\">Oeta</a> and Ebusa in the year 452 till the defeat of Egfrid king of Northumberland in 685 by the Picts, who then repopulated themselves of it. The Saxon kings of Northumberland reconquered it in the ninth century; and it was retained by their successors till the year 956, when it was given up to Indulphus king of Scotland. In 1093 it was unsuccessfully besieged by the usurper Donald <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANE\">Bane</a>. Whether the city was at that time founded or not is uncertain. Most probably it was: for as protection from violence was necessary in those barbarous ages, the castle of Edinburgh could not fail of being an inducement to many people to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> in its neighbourhood; and thus the city would gradually be founded and increase.\u2014In 1128, King <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> I. founded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBEY\">abbey</a> of Holyroodhouse, for certain canons <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a>; and granted them a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARTER\">charter</a>, in which he styled the town Burgo meo de Edwinesburgh, \"my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOROUGH\">borough</a> of Edinburgh.\" By the same charter he granted these canons 40 shillings yearly out of the town revenues; and likewise 48 shillings more, from the same, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of the failure of certain duties payable from the king's revenue; and likewise one half of the tallow, lard, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HIDES\">hides</a>, of all the beasts killed in Edinburgh.\n\nIn 1174, the castle of Edinburgh was surrendered to Castle fur Henry II. of England, in order to purchase the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> rendered to King William I. who had been defeated and taken the English prisoner by the English. But when William recovered his liberty, he entered into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> with Henry, and married his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUSIN\">cousin</a> Ermengarde; upon which the castle was restored as part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a>'s dower.\n\nIn 1215, this city was first distinguished by having a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYNOD\">synod</a> held in it.\u2014In 1206, the castle was besieged and taken by Edward I. of England; but was recovered in 1313 by Randolph <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Moray, who was afterwards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGENT\">regent</a> of Scotland during the minority of King David II. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> King Robert destroyed this fortress, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as all others in Scotland, lest they should afford shelter to the English in any of their after incursions into Scotland.\u2014It lay in ruins for a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of years; but was afterwards rebuilt by Edward III. of England, who placed a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARRISON\">garrison</a> in it.\n\nIn 1341 it was reduced by the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STRATAGEM\">stratagem</a>. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> pretending to be an English merchant, came to the governor, and told him that he had on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> his ship in the Firth some wine, beer, biscuits, &c., which he would sell him on very reasonable terms. A bargain being made, he promised to deliver the goods next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> at a very reasonable rate: but at the time appointed, twelve men, disguised in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of sailors, entered the castle with the goods and supposed merchant: and having instantly killed the porter and sentinels, Sir William Douglas, on a preconcerted signal, rushed in with a band of armed men, and quickly made himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, after having cut most of the garrison in pieces.\n\nThe year 1437 is remarkable for the execution of Cruel the earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHOL\">Athol</a> and his accomplices, who had a connection in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> of James I. The crime, it must be owned, was execrable; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> was altogether shocking to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>. For three days successively the afflains were tortured by putting on their heads <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> crowns heated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> hot, dilocating their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a>, pinching their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> with red hot pinchers, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> them in that dreadful situation through the streets upon hurdles. At last an end was put to their sufferings, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> them up alive, and sending the parts of their mangled bodies to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> towns of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>.\n\nAbout the end of the 14th century it was customary to consider Edinburgh as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of the kingdom. The town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LEITH\">Leith</a>, with its harbour and mills, had been bestowed upon it by Robert I. in 1329; and his grandson John earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRICK\">Carrick</a>, who afterwards ascended the throne by the name of Robert III., conferred upon all the burgesses the singular privilege of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>.\nEdinburgh-building houses in the castle, upon the sole condition that they should be persons of good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>; which we must undoubtedly consider as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that the number of these burgesses was at that time very small. In 1461, a very considerable privilege was conferred on the city by Henry VI. of England when in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol8.html#article-EXILE\">exile</a>; viz. that its inhabitants should have liberty to trade to all the English ports on the same terms with the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> privilege was bestowed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the kindness with which that king was treated in a visit to the Scottish monarch at Edinburgh; but as Henry was never restored, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> was not attended with any benefit to this city. From this time, however, its privileges continued to be increased from various causes. In 1482 the citizens had an opportunity of liberating King James from the oppression of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol15.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a>, by whom he had been imprisoned in the castle. On this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROVOST\">provost</a> was by that monarch made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a> within the city, an office which he continues still to enjoy. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> at the same time were invested with the power of making laws and statutes for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> of the city; and the trades, as a testimony of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> gratitude for their loyalty, received the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANNER\">banner</a> known by the name of the Blue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLANKET\">Blanket</a>; an ensign formerly capable of producing great commotions, but which has not now been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> for many years past. However, it still exists; and the convener of the trades has the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of keeping it.\n\nIt was not long after the discovery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a> that the venereal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a>, imported from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, made its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> to Edinburgh. As early as 1497, only five years after the voyage of Columbus we find it looked upon as a most dreadful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>; and the unhappy persons affected with it were separated as effectually as possible from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a>. The place of their exile was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol12.html#article-INCHKEITH\">Inchkeith</a>, a small island near the middle of the Forth; which, small as it is, has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> of fresh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, and now affords pasture to some sheep.\n\nBy the overthrow of James IV. at the battle of Flodden, the city of Edinburgh was overwhelmed with grief and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>, that monarch having been attended in his unfortunate expedition by the earl of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGUS\">Angus</a>, then provost, with the rest of the magistrates, and a number of the principal inhabitants, most of whom perished in the battle. After this disaster, the inhabitants being alarmed for the safety of their city, it was enacted that every fourth man should keep watch at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>; the fortifications of the town were renewed, the wall being also extended in such a manner as to enclose the Grassmarket, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> on which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERIOT\">Heriot</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITAL\">Hospital</a>, the Grey Friars <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">Church</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CHARITY\">Charity</a> Workhouse, stand. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> side it was made to enclose the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIRMARY\">Infirmary</a>, and High School; after which, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>, it met the old wall at the Netherbow port. After this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a> was over, the inhabitants were gradually relieved from the trouble of watching at night, and a certain number of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITIA\">militia</a> appointed to prevent disturbances; who continue to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, and are known by the name of the Town <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARD\">Guard</a>. Before these new enclosures, most of the principal people lived in the Cowgate without the wall; and the burying place was situated where the Parliament <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">Close</a> now is. In our days of peace, when Edinburgh no alarm of an enemy is at all probable, great part of the walls, with all the gates, have been taken <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>, and the city laid quite open, in order to afford more ready passage to the great concourse of people with whom the street is daily filled. But at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> we speak of, not only were the inhabitants much less numerous by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> of the small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of the city, but it was depopulated by a dreadful plague; so that, to stop if possible the progress of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFECTION\">infection</a>, all houses and shops were shut up for 14 days, and some where infected persons had died were pulled down altogether.\n\nIn 1504, the tract of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> called the Burrough of Muir was totally overgrown with wood, though now wooden it affords not the smallest vestige of having been in houses. Such a state. So great was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> at that time, however, that it was enacted by the town council, that whoever inclined to purchase as much wood as was sufficient to make a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, might extend it seven feet into the street. Thus the city was in a short time filled with houses of wood instead of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>; by which, besides the inconvenience of having the street narrowed 14 feet, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of the whole entirely marred, it became much more liable to accidents by fire; but almost all these are now pulled down; and in doing this a singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> in the masonry which supported them is said to have been discovered.\n\nIn 1542, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with England having commenced Edinburgh through the treachery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDINAL\">Cardinal</a> Beaton, an English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> of 200 sail entered the Forth; and having landed by the forces, quickly made themselves masters of the towns of Leith and Edinburgh. They next attacked the castle, but were repulsed from it with loss; and by this they were so enraged, that they not only destroyed the towns of Edinburgh and Leith, but laid waste the country for a great way round.\u2014These towns, however, speedily recovered from their ruinous state; and, in 1547, Leith was again burned by the English after the battle of Pinkney, but Edinburgh was spared.\n\nSeveral disturbances happened in this capital at the time of the Reformation, of which an account is given under the article Scotland; but none of these greatly affected the city till the year 1570, at which time there was a civil war on account of Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARY\">Mary</a>'s forced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESIGNATION\">resignation</a>. The regent, who was one of the contending parties, bought the castle from the perfidious governor (Balfour) for \u00a35000, and the priory of Pittenweem. He did not, however, long enjoy the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a> of this infamous bargain. Sir William Kirkaldy, the new governor, a man of great integrity and bravery, declared for the queen. The city in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time was sometimes in the hands of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> and sometimes of another; during which contentions, the inhabitants, as may easily be imagined, suffered extremely. In the Siege of the year 1570 above mentioned, Queen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELIZABETH\">Elizabeth</a> sent a castle in body of 1000 foot and 300 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, under the command of Sir William Drury, to assist the king's party. The castle was summoned to surrender; and several skirmishes happened during the space of two years, in which a kind of predatory war was carried on. At last a truce was agreed on till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a> 1573; and this opportunity the earl of Morton, now regent,\nEdinburgh regent, made use of to build two bulwarks across the high street, nearly opposite to the tolbooth, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> the city from the fire of the castle.\n\nOn the first of January, early in the morning, the governor began to cannonade the city. Some of the cannon were pointed against the fish-market, then held on the high street; and the bullets falling among the fishes, scattered them about in a surprising manner, and even drove them up so high in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, that they fell down upon the tops of the houses. This unusual spectacle having brought a number of people out of their houses, some of them were killed and others dangerously wounded. Some little time afterwards, several houses were set on fire by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> from the castle, and burned to the ground; which greatly enraged the people against the governor. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> was at last concluded between the leaders of the opposite factions; but Kirkaldy refused to be comprehended in it. The regent therefore solicited the affiance of Queen Elizabeth, and Sir William Drury was again sent into Scotland with 1500 foot and a train of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>. The castle was now besieged in form, and batteries raised against it in different places. The governor defended himself with great bravery for 33 days; but finding most of the fortifications demolished, the well choked up with rubbish, and all supplies of water cut off, he was obliged to surrender. The English <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a>, in the name of his mistress, promised him <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> treatment; but the queen of England shamefully gave him up to the regent, by whom he was hanged.\n\nSoon after this, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of fanaticism, which succeeded the Reformation, produced violent commotions, not only in Edinburgh, but through the whole kingdom. The foundation of these disturbances, and indeed of most others which have ever happened in Christendom on account of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, was that pernicious maxim of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POPERY\">Popery</a>, that the church is independent of the state. It is not to be supposed that this maxim was at all agreeable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a>; but such was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> of the people to the doctrines of the clergy, that King James found himself obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOUND\">compound</a> matters with them. This, however, answered the purpose but very indifferently; and at last a violent uproar was excited. The king was then sitting in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SESSION\">session</a>, which was held in the tolbooth, when a petition was presented to him by six persons, lamenting the dangers which threatened religion; and being treated with very little respect by one Bruce a minister, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">majesty</a> asked who they were that dared to convene against his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a>? He was answered by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Lindsay, that they dared to do more, and would not suffer religion to be overthrown. On this the king perceiving a number of people crowding into the room, withdrew into another without making any reply, ordering the door to be shut. By this the petitioners were so much enraged, that on their return to the church the most furious resolutions were taken; and had it not been for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> of Sir Alexander Home the provost, and Mr Watt the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEACON\">deacon</a> convener who assembled the crafts in his majesty's behalf, it is more than probable that the door would have been forced, and an end put to his life. This affront was so much resented by the king, that he thought proper to declare Edinburgh an unfit place of residence for the court or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMINISTRATION\">administration</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>. In consequence of this declaration, he commanded the college of justice, Edinburgh, the inferior judges, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> and barons, to retire from Edinburgh, and not to return without express <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LICENSE\">license</a>. This unexpected declaration threw the whole town into consternation, and brought back the magistrates and principal inhabitants to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a>. With the clergy it was far otherwise. They railed against the king in the most furious manner; and endeavouring to persuade the people to take up arms, the magistrates were ordered to imprison them; but they escaped by a timely flight. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTATION\">deputation</a> of the most respectable burgesses was then sent to the king at Linlithgow, with a view to mitigate his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a>. But he refused to be pacified; and on the last day of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1596 entered the town between two rows of his soldiers who lined the streets, while the citizens were commanded to keep within their houses. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVENTION\">convention</a> of the estates was held in the tolbooth, before whom the magistrates made the most abject submissions, but in vain. The convention declared one of the late tumults, in which an attack had been made upon the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>, to be high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a>; and ordained, that if the magistrates did not find out the authors, the city itself should be subjected to all the penalties due to that crime. It was even proposed to raze the town to the foundation, and erect a pillar on the spot where it had stood, as a monument of its crimes. The inhabitants were now reduced to the utmost despair; but Queen Elizabeth interposing in behalf of the city, the king thought proper to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABATE\">abate</a> somewhat of his rigour. A criminal prosecution, however, was commenced, and the town council were commanded to appear at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERTH\">Perth</a> by the first of February. On their petition, the time for their appearance was prolonged to the first of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a>; and the attendance of 13 of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> council was declared sufficient, provided they had a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a> from the rest. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> commenced on the 5th day of the month; and one of the number having failed in his attendance, the cause was immediately decided against the council; they were declared rebels, and their revenues forfeited.\n\nFor 15 days the city continued in the utmost confusion; but, at last, on their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARNEST\">earnest</a> supplication, and offering to submit entirely to the king's mercy, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a> were restored on the following conditions, which they had formerly proffered: That they should continue to make a most diligent search for the authors of the tumult in order to bring them to condign punishment; that none of the sedulous ministers should be allowed to return to their charges, and no others admitted without his majesty's consent; and that in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a> of their magistrates they should present a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of the candidates to the king and his lords of council and session, whom his majesty and their lordships might approve or reject at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. To these conditions the king now added some others; viz. that the houses which had been possessed by the ministers should be delivered up to the king; and that the clergymen should afterwards live dispersed through the town, every one in his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a>: That the town council house should be appointed for accommodating the court of exchequer; and that the town should become bound for the safety of the lords of session from any attempts of the burgesses, under a penalty of 40,000 merks; and, lastly,\nthat the town should immediately pay 20,000 merks to his majesty.\n\nUpon these terms a reconciliation took place; which appears to have been very complete, as the king not only allowed the degraded ministers to be replaced, but in 1610 conferred a mark of his favour on the town, by allowing the provost to have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> of state carried before him, and the magistrates to wear gowns on public occasions. In 1618 he paid his last visit to this city, when he was received with the most extravagant pomp and magnificence. See SCOTLAND.\n\nThe events which, during this period, regard the internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-POLICE\">police</a> of the city, were principally the following. After the unfortunate battle at Pinkney, the magistrates, probably apprehending that now their power was enlarged by reason of the present calamity, proceeded in some respects in a very arbitrary manner; forcing the inhabitants to furnish materials for the public works; enjoining merchants to bring home silver to be coined at the mint; and ordering lanterns to be hung out at proper places to burn till <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> at night, &c. Another invasion from England being apprehended in 1558, the city raised 1450 men for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a>, among whom there are said to have been 200 tailors, so that their profession seems to have been in a very flourishing state at that time. During the disturbances which happened at the Reformation, and of which a particular account is given under the article SCOTLAND, it was enacted, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of St Giles should be cut out of the town standard, and that of a thistle inserted in its place. It was likewise enacted, that none but those who professed the reformed religion should serve in any office whatever; and the better to preserve the extraordinary appearance of sanctity which was affected, a pillar was erected in the North Loch, for the purpose of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUCKING\">ducking</a> fornicators.\n\nIn 1595, the boys of the High School rose against their masters; and such was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARBARISM\">barbarism</a> of those days, that one of these striplings shot a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a> with a pistol, who had come along with the rest to reduce them to obedience. The reason of the uproar was, that they were in that year refused two vacations, which had been customary in former times; however, they were at last obliged to submit, and ever since have been allowed one for about six weeks in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a>. The same year the house of one of the bailies was assaulted by the tradesmen's sons, afflicting by journeymen who had not received the freedom of the town; he escaped with his life, but the offenders were banished the city for ever.\n\nIn the beginning of the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> I., a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARMONY\">harmony</a> seems to have subsisted between the court and the city of Edinburgh; for in 1627 King Charles I. presented the city with a new sword and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOWN\">gown</a> to be worn by the provost at the times appointed by his father James VI. Next year he paid a visit to this capital, and was received by the magistrates in a most pompous manner; but soon after this the disturbances arose which were not terminated but by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of that unfortunate monarch. These commenced on an attempt of Charles to introduce Episcopacy into the kingdom; and the first step towards this was the erection of the three Lothians and part of Berwick into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIOCESE\">diocese</a>, Edinburgh being the episcopal seat, and the church of St Giles the cathedral. An account of the disturbance occasioned by the first attempt to read the Edinburgh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRAYER\">prayer</a> book there, is given under the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">BRITAIN</a>; but though the attempt was given over, the minds of the people were not to be quieted. Next winter they resorted to town in such multitudes, that the privy-council thought proper to publish two acts; by one of which the people were commanded, under severe penalties, to leave the town in 24 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>; and by the other, the court of session was removed to Linlithgow. The populace and their leaders were so much enraged by the latter, that Lord Traquair and some of the bishops narrowly escaped with their lives; and next year (1638) matters became still more serious. For now, the king having provoked his subjects throughout all Scotland with the innovations he attempted in religion, Edinburgh was made the general place of rendezvous, and the most formidable associations took place; an account of which has already been given under the article BRITAIN. Each of the towns in Scotland had a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a>; and that which belonged to Edinburgh, crowded with 5000 names, is still preserved among the records of the city. Notwithstanding this disagreement, however, the king once more visited Edinburgh in 1641, and was entertained by the magistrates at an expense of 12,000l. Scots. It does not appear that after this the city was in any way particularly concerned with the disturbances which followed either throughout the remainder of the reign of Charles I., the commonwealth, or the reign of Charles II. In 1680 the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUKE\">duke</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YORK\">York</a> with his duchess, the princess <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>, and the whole court of Scotland, were entertained by the city in the Parliament House, at the expense of 15,000l. Scots. At this time it is said that the scheme of building the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a> over the North Loch was first projected by the duke.\n\nFrom the time that King James VI. paid his last visit to Edinburgh in 1618, till the time of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> made in 1707, a considerable number of private regulations were made by the magistrates; some of them evidently calculated for the good of the city, others strongly characteristic of that violent spirit of fanaticism which prevailed to much in the last century. Among the former was an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> passed in 1621, that the houses, instead of being covered with straw or boards, should have their roofs constructed of slate, tiles, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>. This act was renewed in 1667; and in 1668 an act was passed regulating their height also. By this they were restrained to five stories, and the thickness of the wall determined to be three feet at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>. In 1684 a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LANTERN\">lantern</a> with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> was ordered to be hung out on the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> of every house, in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> the streets at night; and there were two coaches with four horses each ordered to be bought for the use of the magistrates; but it does not appear how long they continued to be used. In 1681 the court of session discontinued its fittings in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>; but as this was found to be attended with inconvenience, an act was passed for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">restoration</a>, which has continued ever since. During the time of the civil war in 1649, the city was visited by the plague, which is the last time that dreadful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTEMPER\">distemper</a> hath made its appearance in this country. The infection was so violent, that the city was almost depopulated, the prisoners were discharged from the tolbooth, and an act was made for giving one Dr Joannes Politius a salary of 80l. Scots per month, for visiting\nIn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRADICTION\">contradiction</a> to these salutary acts, we may state those which show an extravagant desire of preserving the appearance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEX\">sex</a>, as if it had been possible for others to inspire them with virtuous notions if they had not imbibed them of themselves. In 1633 an act of council was passed, by which women were forbidden to wear plaids over their faces, under penalty of five pounds and the forfeiture of the plaid for the first fault. Banishment was the punishment of the third. The reason assigned for this act was, that matrons were not known from strumpets and loose women, while the plaid continued to be worn over the face. This act was renewed in 1637 and 1638. Succeeding town councils continued to show the same regard to these matters; and in 1665 they enacted, that no innkeeper, vintner, or alefeller, should for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> employ women as waiters or servants, under the penalty of five shillings <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a> for each.\n\nThe following anecdote may perhaps make the virtues of these legislators themselves wear a suspicious aspect. In 1649 the city having borrowed 40,000 Scots, in order to raise their quota of men for his majesty, the payment of it was absolutely refused by the town council when a demand was made for that purpose. That they might not, however, depend entirely upon their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of such importance, they took that of the General <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSEMBLY\">Assembly</a> upon the subject; and it was determined by these reverend divines, that they were not in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> bound to pay for an unlawful engagement which their predecessors had entered into. But in 1652, Cromwell's parliament, who pretended to no less sanctity than they, declared themselves of a very different opinion; and on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of one of the creditors, forced them to repay the sum.\n\nThe treatment which the brave <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARQUIS\">marquis</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTROSE\">Montrose</a> met with, likewise fixes an indelible stigma both upon the magistrates and clergy at that time. Having been put under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCOMMUNICATION\">excommunication</a>, no person was allowed to speak to him or do him the least office of friendship. Being met without the city by the magistrates and town guard, he was by them conducted in a kind of gloomy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESSION\">procession</a> through the streets bareheaded, and in an elevated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CART\">cart</a> made for the purpose; the other prisoners walking two and two before him. At the time of his execution he was attended by one of the ministers, who according to his own account, did not choose to return till he had seen him casten over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LADDER\">ladder</a>.\n\nThe union in 1707 had almost produced a war between the two kingdoms which it was designed to unite; and on that occasion Edinburgh became a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of the most violent disturbances, of which a particular account is given under the article BRITAIN. During the time the act was passing, it was found absolutely necessary for the guards and four regiments of foot to do duty in the city. The disturbances were augmented by the disagreement of the two members of parliament; and notwithstanding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a> gained at that time by the Edinburgh court party, Sir Patrick Johnston the provost, who voted for the union, was obliged afterwards to leave the country. In 1715 the city remained faithful to Loyalty of the royal cause, and proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> were taken for its city in defence. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> of safety was appointed, and city guard increased, and 400 men raised at the expense of the town. The trained bands likewise were ordered out, 100 of whom mounted guard every night; by which precautions the rebels were prevented from attempting the city; they however, made themselves master of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITADEL\">citadel</a> of Leith; but fearing an attack from the duke of Argyll, they abandoned it in the nighttime. A scheme was even laid for becoming masters of the castle of Edinburgh; for which purpose they bribed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERGEANT\">sergeant</a> to place their scaling ladders. Thus some of the rebels got up to the top of the walls before any alarm was given; but in the mean time the plot being discovered by the sergeant's wife, her husband was hanged over the place where he had attempted to introduce the rebels. The expense of the armament which the city had been at on this occasion amounted to about 1700l. which was repaid by government in the year 1721.\n\nThe loyalty of this city was still farther remarkable in the year 1725, when disturbances were excited in all parts of the kingdom, particularly in the city of Glasgow, concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCISE\">excise</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BILL\">bill</a>; for all remained quiet in Edinburgh, notwithstanding the violent outcries that were made elsewhere; and so remarkable was the tranquillity in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>, that government afterwards returned thanks to the magistrates for it. In 1736, however, the city had again the misfortune to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> under the royal displeasure, on the following account. Two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMUGGLERS\">smugglers</a> having been detected in stealing their own goods out of a customhouse, were condemned to be hanged. The crime was looked upon as trivial; and therefore a general murmur prevailed among the populace, which was no doubt heightened by the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a>. At that time it had been customary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Porteous for persons condemned to die to be carried each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUNDAY\">Sunday</a> to the church, called from that circumstance the Tolbooth church. The two prisoners <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned were conducted in the usual way, guarded by three soldiers, to prevent their making their escape: but having once gone thither a little before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONGREGATION\">congregation</a> met, one of the prisoners seized one of the guards in each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and the other in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, calling out to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a> to run; which he immediately did with such speed, that he soon got out of sight, and was never heard of afterwards. The person who had thus procured the life of his companion without regard to his own, would no doubt become a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPASSION\">compassion</a>; and of course, when led to the place of execution, the guard were feverishly pelted by the mob, and some of them, according to the testimony of the witnesses who were sworn on the occasion, pretty much wounded. By this Captain Porteous, who commanded the guard, was so much provoked, that he gave orders to fire, by which six people were killed and eleven wounded. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>, however, even of the fact that the orders to fire were given, appears not to have been altogether unexceptionable; nevertheless, on this he was tried and condemned to be executed. At that time the king was absent in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HANOVER\">Hanover</a>, having\nEdinburgh having left the regency in the hands of the queen; and the case of the unfortunate Porteous having been represented to her, she was pleased to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPRIEVE\">reprieve</a>; but such was the inveteracy of the people against him, that they determined not to allow him to avail himself of the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLEMENCY\">clemency</a>. On the night previous to the day that had been appointed for his execution, therefore, a number of people assembled, shut the gates of the city, and burnt the door of the prison, the same which the mob would formerly have broken open in order to murder King James. They then took out Porteous, whom it was found <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to refuse out of their hands, though every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> that the magistrates could take for that purpose in such a confusion was made use of. It was even proved, that the member of parliament went to the commander in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a>, and requested that he would send a party of soldiers to quell the disturbance, but was absolutely denied this request, because he could not produce a written order from the provost to this purpose; which, in the confusion then existing in the city, could neither have been expected to be given by the provost, nor would it have been safe for any person to have carried it about him. Thus the unhappy victim was left in the hands of his executioners; and being dragged by them to the place destined for receiving his fate, was hanged on a dyer's sign <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a>. As they had not brought a rope along with them, they broke open a shop where they knew they were to be had; and having taken out what they wanted, left the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>, and retired without committing any other disorder.\n\nSuch an atrocious insult on government could not but be highly resented. A royal proclamation was issued, offering a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> to any accomplice, and a reward of \u00a3500. to any person who would discover one of those concerned. The proclamation was ordered to be read from every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PULPIT\">pulpit</a> in Scotland the first Sunday of every month for a twelvemonth; but so divided were the people in their opinions about this matter, that many of the clergy hesitated exceedingly about complying with the royal order, by which they were brought in danger of being turned out of their livings; while those who complied were rendered unpopular, that their situation was rendered still worse, than the others. All the efforts of government, however, were insufficient to produce any discovery; by which, no doubt, the court were still more exasperated; and it was now determined to execute vengeance on the magistrates and city at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>. Alexander Wilson, the provost at that time, was imprisoned three weeks before he could be admitted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAIL\">bail</a>; after which, he and the four bailies, with the lords of justiciary, were ordered to attend the house of peers at London. On their arrival there, a debate ensued, whether the lords should attend in their robes or not? but at last it was agreed, that they should attend in their robes at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a>. This however, was refused by their lordships, who insisted that they should be examined within the bar; upon which the affair of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> was dropped altogether. A bill at last passed both houses, by which it was enacted, that the city of Edinburgh should be fined in \u00a32000. for the benefit of Porteous's widow (though she was prevailed upon to accept of \u00a3500. for the whole); and the provost was declared incapable of ever serving government again in any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> whatever. To prevent such catastrophes in future, the town council enacted, that, on the first appearance of an insurrection, the chief officers in the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> and corporations should repair to the council to receive the orders of the magistrates for the quelling of the tumult, under the penalty of \u00a31. 6s. 8d. for each omission.\n\nIn 1745, the city was invested by the Pretender's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a>; and on the 17th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a>, the Netherbow gate being opened to let a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COACH\">coach</a> pass, a party of highlanders, who had reached the gate undetected, rushed in, and took possession of the city. The inhabitants were commanded to deliver up their arms at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a> or Holyroodhouse; a certain quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> stores was required from the city, under pain of military execution; and an assessment of \u00a33. 6d. upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> was imposed upon the real rents within the city and liberties for defraying that expense.\n\nThe Pretender's army guarded all the avenues to the castle; but no signs of hostilities ensued till the 25th of the month, when the garrison being alarmed from some unknown cause, a number of cannon were discharged at the guard placed at the West Port, but with very little effect. This gave occasion to an order to the guard at the Weigh-house, to prevent all intercourse between the city and castle; and then the governor acquainted the provost by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>, that unless the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> was prevented, he would be obliged to dislodge the guard by means of artillery. A deputation was next sent to the Pretender; acquainting him with the danger the city was in, and entreating him to withdraw the guard. With this he refused to comply; and the highland centinels firing at some people who were carrying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> into the castle, a pretty smart cannonading ensued, which set on fire several houses, killed some people, and did other damage. The Pretender then consented to dismiss the guard, and the cannonading ceased. After the battle of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CULLODEN\">Culloden</a>, the provost of Edinburgh was obliged to stand a very long and severe trial, first at London and then at Edinburgh, for not defending the city against the rebels; which, from the situation and extent of the walls, every one must have seen to be impossible.\n\nDuring this trial a very uncommon circumstance happened; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JURY\">jury</a> having sat two days, insisted that they could fit no longer, and prayed for a short respite. As the urgency of the case was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>, and both parties agreed, the court, after long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> adjourned till the day following, taking the jury bound under a penalty of \u00a3500. each; when the court continued sitting two days longer, and the jury were one day enclosed. The event was, that the provost was exculpated.\n\nAfter the battle of Culloden the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CUMBERLAND\">Cumberland</a> caused fourteen of the rebel standards to be burned at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a>; that of the Pretender was carried by the common executioner, the others by chimney-sweepers; the heralds proclaiming the names of the commanders to whom they belonged as they were thrown into the fire. At this time the city of Edinburgh <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> a temporary inconvenience from the election of their magistrates not having taken place at the usual time; Government so that it became necessary to apply to his majesty for the restoration of the government of the city. This city reformation was readily granted, the burgesses being allowed a polled tax; after which an entire new set of magistrates was returned,\nEdinburgh returned, all of them friends to the house of Hanover; and soon after the freedom of the city in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> box was presented to the duke of Cumberland.\n\nWith these transactions all interferences betwixt government and the metropolis of Scotland were ended; the rest of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> therefore only consists of internal occurrences, the regulations made by its own magistrates for the benefit of the city, their applications to government for leave to improve it, or the execution of these improvements; of which we shall now give a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> detail.\n\nIn the year 1716, the city first bestowed a settled salary on the provost, in order to enable him to support the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> of the first magistrate. This was at first \u00a3300; but has since been augmented to \u00a3500, which his lordship still enjoys. In 1718 it was recommended to the magistrates to distinguish themselves by wearing coats of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELVET\">velvet</a>, for which they were allowed \u00a310, but this act being abrogated in 1754, gold chains were assigned as badges of their office, which they continue to wear. Provost Kincaid happened to die in office in the year 1777; which, being a very rare accident, perhaps the only one of the kind to be met with in the records of Edinburgh, he was buried with great solemnity, and a vast concourse of people attended.\n\nTumults have been frequent in Edinburgh, chiefly on account of the dearth of provisions. In 1740 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BELL\">Bell</a>'s mills were first attacked by the populace, and afterwards Leith mills; nor could the rioters be dispersed till the military had fired among them and wounded three, of whom one died; and it was found necessary to order some dragoons into the city in order to preserve tranquillity. In 1742, another violent tumult took place, owing to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of stealing dead bodies from their graves for anatomical purposes, which had then become common. The populace <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> to arms, threatened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> to the surgeons; and, in spite of the efforts of the magistrates, demolished the house of the beadle at St Cuthbert's. In 1756 new disturbances, which required the assistance of the military, took place: the cause at this time was the impressing of men for the war which was then commencing. A disturbance was likewise excited in 1760. This was occasioned by the footmen, who till then were allowed to follow their masters into the playhouse, and now took upon them to disturb the entertainment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>; the consequence of which was, that they were turned out, and have ever since been obliged to wait for their masters. In 1763 and 1765, the tumults on account of the price of provisions were renewed; many of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-MEAL\">meal</a>-mongers had their houses broken open and their shops destroyed. The magistrates, as usual, were obliged to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> in a party of dragoons to quell the disturbance; but at the same time, to put an effectual stop, as far as was in their power, to these proceedings for the future, they gave security, that people who brought grain or provision into the market should be secured in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>. Since that time there have been no tumults directly on the account of provisions; though in 1784 a terrible riot and attack of a distillery at Canonmills took place, on a supposition that the distillers enhanced the price of meal by using unmalted grain. The attack was repelled by the servants of the distillery; but the mob could not be quelled until the sheriff called the soldiers quartered in the castle to his assistance. The same night a party of rioters set out for Ford, a place ten miles to the southward, where there was likewise a large distillery; which, as there was none to make any opposition, they soon destroyed. One man was killed in this riot at Edinburgh by the fire of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> of the distillery, and several of the rioters were afterwards secured and punished.\n\nIn the years 1778 and 1779 two very alarming disturbances happened, which threatened a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of bloodshed, though happily they were terminated without any. The first was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTINY\">mutiny</a> of the earl of Seaforth's Highland <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGIMENT\">regiment</a>, who were at this time quartered in the castle. These having been ordered to embark, for some reason or other unanimously refused, and posted themselves on the top of Arthur's seat, where they continued for two days. Troops were collected to prevent their escape, and the inhabitants were ordered to keep within doors at the first toll of the great bell, which was to be a signal of violence about to take place; but fortunately all the fears, naturally arising from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of this event, were dissipated by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>. The other happened on account of the attempt to repeal the penal laws against the Papists; and was much more alarming than the other, as being the effect of a premeditated scheme and determined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> to oppose government. On the 2d of February 1779 a mob assembled in the evening, burned a Popish chapel, and plundered another. Next day they renewed their depredations; destroying and carrying off the books, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a>, &c. of several Popish priests and others of that persuasion. The riot continued all that day, though the assistance of the military was called in; but happily no lives were lost, nor was there any firing. The city was afterwards obliged to make good the damage sustained by the Catholics on this occasion, which was estimated at \u00a31500. This year also an unlucky accident happened at Leith. About 50 Highland recruits having refused to embark, a party of the South Fencibles was sent to take them prisoners. Unexpectedly, however, the Highlanders flooded upon their defence; then, after some words, a firing commenced on both sides, and about one half of the Highlanders were killed and wounded, the remainder being taken prisoners and carried to the castle. Captain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANSFIELD\">Mansfield</a> and two or three privates were killed in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFRAY\">affray</a>.\n\nWe shall close this history of Edinburgh with a general account of the improvements which have lately taken place in it, and of which a particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> afterwards be given. These began in the year 1753, when the foundation-stone of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCHANGE\">Exchange</a> was laid, at which time there was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> procession, and the greatest concourse of people ever known in Edinburgh. A triumphal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> was erected for the purpose, through which the procession passed, and medals were scattered among the populace. In 1756 the high street was cleared by the removal of the cros; though many regretted this, on account of its being a very ancient and elegant building. In the middle it had an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNICORN\">unicorn</a> placed on the top of a pillar 20 feet high; but this fine ornament was broken to pieces by the giving way of the tackle by which it was attempted to remove it. It is now again erected at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DRUM\">Drum</a>, a seat formerly belonging to Lord Somerville, about four miles\nIn 1763 the first stone of the North bridge was laid by Provost Drummond; and in 1767 an act of parliament was obtained for extending the royalty of the city over the fields to the northward, where the New Town is now situated. About the same time a spot of ground upon the south side of the town was purchased by a private person for \u00a3200, which being freed out for building, gave rise to the increase of the town on that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a>; and this proceeded more rapidly, as the houses built there were free from the dues imposed upon others subject to the royalty. In 1774 the foundation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGISTER\">Register</a> Office was laid. In 1784 the project for rendering the access to the town equally easy on both sides was begun to be put into execution by laying the foundation of the South bridge. At the same time a great improvement was made by reducing the height of the street several feet all the way from the place where the cross stood to the Netherbow; by which means the ascent is rendered more easy, not only for carriages, but also for persons who walk on foot. At the same time, the street was farther cleared by the removal of the town guard house, which had long been complained of as an encumbrance. Within these three years (1805) part of the Luckenbooths has been removed, and it is still farther in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a> to remove the whole with the prison. When this is accomplished, with other improvements by which it must necessarily be accompanied, it is to be questioned whether any city in Britain will be able to vie with Edinburgh in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a> and beauty.\n\nHaving thus given a concise history of the city from its earliest foundation, we shall now proceed to describe it in its most improved state.\n\nEdinburgh is situated upon a steep hill, rising from east to west, and terminating in a high and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INACCESSIBLE\">inaccessible</a> rock, upon which the castle stands. At the east end or lower extremity of this hill stands the abbey of Holyroodhouse, or king's palace, distant from the castle upwards of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>; and betwixt which, along the top of the ridge, and almost in a straight line, runs the high street. On each side, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to this ridge or hill, is another ridge of ground lower than that in the middle, and which does not extend so far to the east; that on the south being intercepted by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALISBURY\">Salisbury</a> rocks and Arthur's seat, a hill of about 800 feet of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> height; and that on the north by the Calton hill, considerably lower than Arthur's seat; so that the situation of this city is most singular and romantic; the east or lower part of the town lying between two hills; and the west or higher part rising up towards a third hill, little inferior in height to the highest of the other two, upon which, as has been observed, the castle is built, and overlooks the town.\n\nThe buildings of the town terminate at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of about 200 yards from the castle gate; which space affords a most delightful as well as convenient and healthful walk to the inhabitants. The prospect from this spot is perhaps the finest anywhere to be met with, for extent, beauty, and variety.\n\nIn the valley or hollow betwixt the mid and the south ridges, and nearly parallel to the high street, is another street called the Cowgate; and the town has now extended itself over most part of that fourth ridge also.\n\nBetwixt the mid and the north ridges was a loch, which, till very late, terminated the town on that side. From the high street towards the loch on the north, and Cowgate on the south, run narrow cross streets or lanes, called wynds and closes, which grow steeper and steeper the farther west or nearer the castle; so that, were it not for the clofens and great height of the buildings, this city, from its situation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>, might naturally be expected to be the best aired, as well as the cleanest, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. The former, notwithstanding these disadvantages, it enjoys in an eminent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>; but we cannot compliment it upon the latter, notwithstanding every possible means has been used by the magistrates for that purpose.\n\nThe steepness of the ascent makes the access to the high street from the north and south very difficult; which no doubt greatly retarded the enlargement of the city. To remedy this inconvenience on the north, and with a view to extend the town on that quarter, a most elegant bridge has been thrown over the North Loch, which joins the north ridge to the middle of the high street, by so easy an ascent as one in fifteen; and in pursuance of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, a plan of a new town to the north was fixed upon, and is now nearly finished, with an elegance and taste that does <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> to this country. In like manner, to facilitate the access from the south side, a bridge has been thrown over the valley through which the Cowgate runs; which, if not equally elegant with the North bridge, is certainly as convenient.\n\nThe gradual increase of the city of Edinburgh may account of in some degree be understood from the traces of its ancient walls that still remain. James II. in 1490, first bestowed on the community the privilege of fortifying the city with a wall, and empowered them to levy a tax upon the inhabitants for defraying the expense. When the city was first fortified, the wall reached no further than the present water-house, or reservoir, on the castle hill: from thence to the foot of Halkerton's wynd, just below the new bridge, the city was defended by the North Loch; an inconsiderable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORASS\">morass</a>, which, being formerly overflowed, formed a small lake that hath since been drained. From this place to the foot of Leith wynd, it does not appear how the city was fortified; but from the foot of Leith wynd to the Nether-bow port it was defended only by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of houses; and when these had become ruinous, a wall was built in their place. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> wall of Edinburgh, therefore, began at the foot of the north-east rock of the castle. Here it was strengthened by a small fortress, the ruins of which are still to be seen, and are called the Wellhouse Tower, from their having a spring in their neighbourhood. When the wall came opposite to the reservoir, it was carried quite across the hill, having a gate on the top for making a communication between the town and castle. In going down the hill, it went slanting in an oblique <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> to the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> in going down the Well-bow, where was a gate named the Upper-bow Port, one of the hooks of which still remains. Thence it proceeded eastward in such a manner, as would have cut off not only all the Cowgate, but some part of the parliament house; and being continued as far as the Mint close, it turned to the north-east, and connected itself with the buildings on the north.\nEdinburgh, north side of the high street, where was the original Nether-bow Port, about 50 yards west from that which afterwards went by the same name.\n\nSoon after the building of this wall, a new street was formed on the outside of it, named the Cowgate, which in the 16th century became the residence of the nobility, the senators of the college of justice, and other persons of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>. After the fatal battle of Flodden, however, the inhabitants of the Cowgate became very anxious to have themselves defended by a wall as well as the rest. The wall of the city was therefore extended to its present limits. This new wall begins on the south-east side of the rock on which the castle is built, and to which the town wall comes quite close. From thence it descends obliquely to the West Port; then ascends part of a hill on the other side, called the High Riggs; after which, it runs eastward with but little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in its course, to the Britto and Potter-row ports, and from thence to the Pleasance. Here it takes a northerly direction, which it keeps from thence to the Cowgate port; after which the enclosure is completed to the Nether-bow by the houses of St Mary's wynd. The original Nether-bow port being found not well adapted for defence was pulled down, and a new one built in 1571 by the adherents of Queen Mary. In 1606, the late handsome building was erected about 50 yards below the place where the former stood. It was two stories high, and had an elegant spire in the middle; but being thought to encumber the street, and the whole building being in a crazy situation, it was pulled down by order of the magistrates in 1764.\n\nIn the original wall of Edinburgh there was, as has been already observed, a port on the Cattle hill. On the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the wall, after building the houses in the Cowgate, this gate was pulled down. That in the upper or West-bow stood for a much longer time, and was pulled down within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of some persons lately or perhaps still living. Besides these, there was a third, about 50 yards above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the Canongate; but whether there were any more, is uncertain.\n\nThe ports or gates of the new walls were, 1. The West Port, situated at the extremity of the Grass Market; beyond which lies a suburb of the town and a borough of regality, called Portsburgh. Next to this is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WICKET\">wicket</a>, struck out of the town wall in 1744, for the purpose of making an easier communication between the town and the public walks in the meadows, than by Britto port. The next to this was Britto Port, built in 1575; beyond which lies a suburb called Britto Street. At a small distance from Britto was the Potter-row Port, which took this name from a manufactory of earthen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WARE\">ware</a> in the neighbourhood. Formerly it was called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KIRK\">Kirk</a> of Field Port. Between this and the Cowgate port stood another, called St Mary's Wynd Port, which extended from east to west across the foot of the Pleasance, and which was demolished only since the middle of the last century. Close to the middle of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a> the Cowgate Port; which opened a communication between the Cowgate and St Mary's wynd, and the Pleasance. The Nether-bow Port has been already spoken of. At the foot of Leith wynd was another gate, known by the name of Leith Wynd Port; and within it was a wicket giving access to the church of Trinity College, and which still remains. At the foot of Halkerston's wynd was another, which, as well as the former, was built about the year 1560. Both of these were pulled down some years ago, and all the rest in 1785. Another still remains at the foot of the Canongate, known by the name of the Water-gate.\n\nFor 250 years the city of Edinburgh occupied the same space of ground, and it is but very lately that its limits have been so considerably enlarged. In the middle of the 16th century, it is described as extending in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> about an Italian mile, and about half as much in breadth; which answers very nearly to its present limits, the late enlargements only excepted. This space of ground, however, was not at that time occupied in the manner it is at present. The houses were neither so high nor so crowded upon each other as they are now. This was a consequence of the number of inhabitants increasing, which has occasioned the raising of the houses to such a height as is perhaps not to be paralleled in any other part of the world. Till the time of the Reformation, the burying ground of the city extended over all the space occupied by the Parliament <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, and from thence to the Cowgate. The lands lying to the southward of the Cowgate were chiefly laid out in gardens belonging to the convent of Black friars, and the church of St Mary in the Field. These extended almost from the Pleasance to the Potterrow port. From the Britto to the West port the ground was laid out in gardens belonging to the Gray friars. The magistrates, on their application to Queen Mary, obtained a grant of the Gray friars gardens for a burying place; for which it was given as a reason, that they were somewhat distant from the town. Here, however, it must be understood, that these gardens were distant from the houses, and not without the walls; for they had been inclosed by them long before. In the time of James I. the houses within the walls seem to have been in general, if not universally, covered with thatch or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROOM\">broom</a>; and not above 20 feet high. Even in the year 1621, these roofs were so common, that they were prohibited by act of parliament, in order to prevent accidents from fire. In the middle of the last century, there were neither courts nor squares in Edinburgh. The Parliament close or square is the oldest of this kind in the city. Miln's square, James's court, &c. were built long after; and Argyll's and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROWN\">Brown</a>'s squares about the years 1750 or 1760.\n\nThe New Town was projected in the year 1752; but as the magistrates could not then procure an extension of the royalty, the execution of the design was suspended for some time. In 1767, an act was obtained, by which the royalty was extended over the fields to the northward of the city; upon which advertisements were published by the magistrates, defining proper plans to be given in. Plans were given in accordingly, and that designed by Mr James Craig <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a> was adopted. Immediately afterwards, people were invited to purchase lots from the town council; and such as purchased became bound to conform to the rules of the plan. In the mean time, however, the town council had secretly referred to themselves a privilege of departing from their own plan; which they afterwards made use of in such a manner as produced a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a>. According to the plan held forth to the purchasers, a canal was to be made through that place.\nplace where the North Loch had been, and the bank on the north side of it laid out in terraces; but instead of this, by an act of council, liberty was referred to the town to build upon this spot; and therefore, when many gentlemen had built genteel houses in the new town on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> of the plan, they were surprised to find the spot appointed for terraces and a canal, beginning to be covered with mean <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> buildings, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> houses for tradesmen. This deviation was immediately complained of; but as the magistrates showed no inclination to grant any redress, a prosecution was commenced against them before the Lords of Session. In that court the cause was given against the pursuers, who thereupon appealed to the House of Lords. Here the sentence of the Court of Session was reversed, and the cause remitted to the consideration of their Lordships. At last, after an expensive contest, matters were accommodated. The principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of accommodation was, that some part of the ground was to be laid out in terraces and a canal; but the time of disposing it in that manner, was referred to the Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-PRESIDENT\">President</a> of the Court of Session and the Lord Chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARON\">Baron</a> of the Exchequer. The fall of part of the bridge, hereafter mentioned, proved a very considerable disadvantage to the New Town; as it necessarily induced a suspicion that the passage, by means of the bridge, could never be rendered safe. An oversight of the magistrates proved of more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> detriment. A piece of ground lay to the southward of the Old Town, in a situation very proper for building. This the magistrates had an opportunity of purchasing for \u00a32000; which, however, they neglected, and it was bought by a private person, who immediately freed it out in lots for building, as has been already mentioned. The magistrates then began to see the consequence, namely, that this spot being free from the duties to which the royalty of Edinburgh is subject, people would choose to reside there rather than in the New Town. Upon this they offered the purchaser \u00a33000, for the ground for which he had paid \u00a32000; but as he demanded \u00a320,000, the bargain did not take place. Notwithstanding these discouragements, the New Town is now almost finished; and from the advantages of its situation, and its being built according to a regular plan, it hath undoubtedly a superiority over any city in Britain. By its situation, however, it is remarkably exposed to storms of wind, which, at Edinburgh, sometimes rage with uncommon violence.\n\nIt has three streets, almost a mile in length, running from east to west, intersected with cross streets at proper distances. The most northerly, called Queen's Street, till lately that Heriot row was built, is 100 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, and commands an extensive prospect of the Forth, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of Fife, and the shipping in the river. That called George's Street, which is in the middle, is no less than 115 feet wide. It is terminated at each end by two very elegant and extensive squares; that on the east end is called St Andrew's Square; the other, which is not yet finished, is called Charlotte's Square. Prince's street is the most southerly; and extends from the northern extremity of the bridge, quite to the west end of the town. It has only been finished this year (1805). From the west end of Prince's street, a spacious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> has been lately opened to join the two roads to Glasgow by Airdrie and Whitburn. This has greatly improved the approach to the town from the west.\n\nThe most remarkable public buildings in Edinburgh are\u2014\n\n1. The Castle. This stands on a high rock, accessible only on the east side. On all others it is very steep, and buildings in some places perpendicular. It is about 300 feet high from its base; so that, before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of artillery, it might well have been deemed impregnable; though the event showed that it was not. The entry to this fortress is defended by an outer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARRIER\">barrier</a> of palliadoes; within this is a dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DITCH\">ditch</a>, draw-bridge, and gate, defended by two batteries which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLANK\">flank</a> it; and the whole is commanded by a half-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOON\">moon</a> mounted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> cannon, carrying balls of 12 pounds. Beyond these are two gate-ways, the first of which is very strong, and has two portcullises. Immediately beyond the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> gate way, on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> hand, is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BATTERY\">battery</a> mounted with brass cannon, carrying balls of 12 and 18 pounds <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>. On the north side are a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a> and some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GUN\">gun</a> batteries. The upper part of the castle contains a half-moon battery, a chapel, a parade for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a>, and a number of houses in the form of a square, which are laid out in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARRACKS\">barracks</a> for the officers. Besides these there are other barracks sufficient to contain 1000 men; a powder <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGAZINE\">magazine</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOMB\">bomb</a> proof; a grand arsenal, capable of containing 8000 stand of arms; and other apartments for the same use, which can contain 22,000 more; so that 30,000 stand of arms may be conveniently lodged in this castle. On the east side of the square above mentioned, were formerly royal apartments; in one of which King James VI. was born, and which is still shown to those who visit the castle. In another, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGALIA\">regalia</a> of Scotland were deposited on the 26th of March 1707; but as they were never shown to any body, a suspicion has arisen that they were carried to London, perhaps during the rebellions 1715 or 1745. This apartment was opened in 1794 by an order from government, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of the first civil officers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a>, as the lord president of the court of session, the lord justice clerk, &c., but no part of the regalia was found.\n\nThe governor of the castle is generally a nobleman, whose place is worth about \u00a31000 a-year; and that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a> governor, \u00a3500. This last resides in the house appointed for the governor, as the latter never inhabits it. There is also a fort-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJOR\">major</a>, a store-keeper, master gunner, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CHAPLAIN\">chaplain</a>; but as this last does not reside in the castle, worship is seldom performed in the chapel. The parliament house was formerly included in the great square on the top, and the royal gardens were on the marsh afterwards called the North Loch; the king's stables being on the south side, where the houses still retain the name, and the place where the barns were still retain the name of Cattle barns.\n\nThe castle is defended by a company of invalids, and four or five hundred men belonging to some marching regiment, though it can accommodate 1000, as above mentioned; and this number has been sometimes kept in it. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> strength of situation was not sufficient to render it impregnable, even before the invention of artillery, as we have already observed; much less would it be capable of securing it against the attacks of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> army well provided with cannon. It could not, in\nEdinburgh\u2014all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, withstand, even for a few hours, a well-directed bombardment: for no part but the powder magazine is capable of resisting these destructive machines; and the splinters from the rock on which the castle is built, could not fail to render them still more formidable. Besides, the water of the well, which is very bad, and drawn up from a depth of 100 feet, is apt to subside on the continued discharge of artillery, which produces a conciliation in the rock.\n\n2. The Palace of Holyroodhouse. This, though much neglected, is the only royal habitation in Scotland that is not entirely in ruins. It is a handsome square of 230 feet in the inside, surrounded with piazzas. The front, facing the west, consists of two double towers joined by a beautiful low building, adorned with a double <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol4.html#article-BALUSTRADE\">balustrade</a> above. The gate-way in the middle is decorated with double stone columns, supporting a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUPOLA\">cupola</a> in the middle, representing an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">imperial</a> crown, with a clock underneath. On the right hand is the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAIRCASE\">staircase</a> which leads to the council chamber and the royal apartments. These are large and spacious, but unfurnished: in one of them the Scotch peers meet to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECT\">elect</a> 16 of their number to represent them in parliament. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GALLERY\">gallery</a> is on the left hand, and measures 150 feet by 27\u00bd. It is adorned with the supposed portraits of all the kings of Scotland. In the apartments of the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAMILTON\">Hamilton</a>, which he possesses as hereditary keeper of the palace, Queen Mary's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of crimson damask, bordered with green fringes and tassels, is still to be seen, but almost reduced to rags. Here also strangers are shown a piece of wainscot hung upon hinges, which opens to a trap stair <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> with the apartments below. Through this passage Darnley and the other conspirators rushed in to murder the unhappy Rizzio. Towards the outward door of these apartments are large dusty spots on the floor, said to be occasioned by Rizzio's blood, which could never be washed out. In the lodgings assigned to Lord Dunmore is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> by Van Dyke, esteemed a masterly performance, of King Charles I. and his queen going a-hunting. There are likewise the portraits of their present majesties at full length by Ranlay. The lodgings above the royal apartments are occupied by the duke of Argyll as heritable master of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSEHOLD\">household</a>.\n\nThe front of this palace is two stories high; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> flat; but at each end the front projects, and is ornamented with circular towers at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>. Here the building is much higher, and the rest of the palace is three stories in height. The north-west towers were built by James V. for his own residence: his name is still to be seen below a niche in one of these towers. During the minority of Queen Mary, this palace was burned by the English; but soon after repaired and enlarged beyond its present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>. At that time it consisted of five courts, the most westerly of which was the largest. It was bounded on the east by the front of the palace, which occupied the same space it does at present; but the building itself extended further to the south. At the north-west corner was a strong gate with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOTHIC\">Gothic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILLARS\">pillars</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a>, and towers, part of which was not long ago pulled down. Great part of the palace was burnt by Cromwell's soldiers; but it was repaired and altered into the present form after the Restoration. The fabric was planned by Sir William Bruce a celebrated architect, and executed Edinburgh by Robert Mylne mason. The environs of the palace afford an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSOLVENT\">insolvent</a> debtors; and adjoining to it is an extensive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PARK\">park</a>, all of which is a sanctuary.\n\nThe abbey church was formerly called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONASTERY\">monastery</a> of Holyroodhouse, and built by King David I. in 1128. He gave it the name of Holyroodhouse, in memory, as is said of his deliverance from an enraged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HART\">hart</a>, by the miraculous interposition of a crois from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>. This monastery he gave to the canons regular of St Augustine; on whom he also bestowed the church of Edinburgh cattle, with those of St Cuthbert's, Corforphorn, and Liberton, in the shire of Mid Lothian, and of Airth in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STIRLINGSHIRE\">Stirlingshire</a>; the priories of St Mary's Isle in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GALLOWAY\">Galloway</a>, of Blantyre in Clydesdale, of Rowadill in Roos, and three others in the Western Isles. To them he also granted the privilege of erecting a borough between the town of Edinburgh and the church of Holyroodhouse. From these canons it had the name of the Canongate, which it still retains. In this new borough they had a right to hold markets. They had also portions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a> in different parts, with a most extensive jurisdiction, and right of trial by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUEL\">duel</a>, and fire and water ordeal. They had also certain revenues payable out of the exchequer and other funds, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FISHERIES\">fisheries</a>, and the privilege of erecting mills on the water of Leith, which still retain the name of Canon mills. Other grants and privileges were bestowed by succeeding sovereigns; so that it was deemed the richest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> foundation in Scotland. At the Reformation, its annual revenues were 442 bolls of wheat, 640 bolls of bear, 560 bolls of oats, 550 capons, two dozen of hens, as many salmon, 12 loads of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>; besides a great number of swine, and about 250l. sterling in money. At the Reformation, the superiority of North Leith, part of the Pleasance, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARONY\">barony</a> of Broughton, and the Canongate, were veiled in the earl of Roxburgh; and were purchased from him by the town council of Edinburgh in 1636. In 1644, the church suffered considerably by the invasion of the English; but was speedily repaired. At the Restoration, King Charles II. ordered the church to be set apart as a chapel royal, and prohibited its use as a common parish church for the future. It was then fitted up in a very elegant manner. A throne was erected for the sovereign, and 12 stalls for the knights of the order of the thistle; but as masts had been celebrated in it in the reign of James VII., and it had an organ, with a spire, and a fine chime of bells on the west side, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESBYTERIANS\">Presbyterians</a> at the Revolution entirely destroyed its ornaments, and left nothing but the bare walls.\u2014Through time, the roof of the church became ruinous; on which the duke of Hamilton represented its condition to the barons of exchequer, and craved that it might be repaired. This request was complied with; but the architect and mason who were employed, covered the roof with thick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAG\">flag</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, which soon impaired the fabric; and on the 2d of December 1768, the roof fell in. Since that time, no attempt has been made to repair it, and it is now entirely fallen to ruin.\n\nThe ruins of this church, however, are still sufficient to discover the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-EXCELLENCY\">excellency</a> of the workmanship. Here some of the kings of Scotland are interred; and an odd\nEdinburgh: odd kind of curiosity has been the occasion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> said to be those of Lord Darnley and a countess of Roxburgh who died several hundred years ago. Those said to belong to the former were very large, and the latter had some flesh dried upon them. The chapel was fitted up in the elegant manner above mentioned by James VII, but such was the enthusiasm of the mob, that they not only destroyed the ornaments, but tore up even the pavement, which was of marble.\n\nTo the eastward of the palace is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOWLING\">bowling</a> green, now entirely in disorder; and behind it is a field called St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol3.html#article-ANN\">Ann</a>'s Yards. Beyond this is a piece of ground called the King's Park; which undoubtedly was formerly overgrown with wood, though now there is not a single tree in it. It is about three miles in circumference; and was first enclosed by James V. It contains the rocky hills of Arthur's Seat and Salisbury Craigs, which last afford an inexhaustible stone <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARRY\">quarry</a>; and upon the north side of the hill stands an old ruined chapel, dedicated to St Anthony. The stones are used in building, as well as for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PAVING\">paving</a> the streets and highways. The park was mortgaged to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HADDINGTON\">Haddington</a> for a debt due to them; and by the present earl has been divided into a number of enclosures by stone dykes raised at a considerable expense. A good number of sheep and some black cattle are fed upon it; and it is now rented at \u00a3500 annually.\n\n3. St Giles's Church, is a beautiful Gothic building, measuring in length 206 feet. At the west end, its breadth is 110; in the middle, 129; and at the east end, 76 feet. It has a very elevated situation, and is adorned with a lofty square tower; from the sides and corners of which rise arches of figured stone work: these meeting with each other in the middle, complete the figure of an imperial crown, the top of which terminates in a pointed spire. The whole height of this tower is 161 feet.\n\nThis is the most ancient church in Edinburgh. From a passage in an old author called Simeon Dunelmensis, some conjecture it to have been built before the year 854; but we do not find express mention made of it before 1359. The tutelar saint of this church, and of Edinburgh, was St Giles, a native of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>. He lived in the sixth century, and was descended of an illustrious family. On the death of his parents, he gave all his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>; and travelled into France, where he retired into a wilderness near the confluence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RHONE\">Rhone</a> with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, and continued there three years. Having obtained the reputation of extraordinary sanctity, various miracles were attributed to him; and he founded a monastery in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol9.html#article-LANGUEDOC\">Languedoc</a>, known long after by the name of St Giles's.\u2014In the reign of James II. Mr Preston of Gorton, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> whose descendants still possess an estate in the county of Edinburgh, got possession of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> of this saint; which relic he bequeathed to the church of Edinburgh. In gratitude for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DONATION\">donation</a>, the magistrates granted a charter in favour of Mr Preston's heirs, by which the nearest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> of the name of Preston was entitled to carry it in all processions. At the same time, the magistrates obliged themselves to found an altar in the church of St Giles's, and appoint a chaplain for celebrating an annual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUL\">soul</a> of Mr Preston; and likewise, that a tablet, containing his arms, and an account of his pious donation, should be put up in the chapel.\u2014St Giles's was first simply a parish church, of which the bishop of Lindisfarne or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOLY_ISLAND\">Holy Island</a>, in the county of Northumberland, was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a>. He was succeeded in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PATRONAGE\">patronage</a> by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABBOT\">abbot</a> and canons of Dunfermline, and they by the magistrates of Edinburgh. In 1466, it was erected into a collegiate church by James III. At the Reformation, the church was, for the greater convenience, divided into several parts. The four principal ones are appropriated to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> worship, the lesser ones to other purposes. At the same time the religious utensils belonging to this church were seized by the magistrates. They were,\u2014St Giles's arm, enshrined in silver, weighing five pounds three ounces and a half; a silver chalice, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNION\">communion</a> cup, weighing 23 ounces; the great eucharist or communion cup, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WREATH\">wreath</a> and stones; two cruets of 25 ounces; a golden bell, with a heart, of four ounces and a half; a golden unicorn; a golden pix, to keep the holy; a small golden heart, with two pearls; a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMOND\">diamond</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a>; a silver chalice, paten, and spoon, of 32 ounces and a half; a communion table cloth of gold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BROCADE\">brocade</a>; St Giles's coat, with a little piece of red velvet which hung at his feet; a round silver eucharist; two silver censers, of three pounds fifteen ounces; a silver ship for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCENSE\">incense</a>; a large silver cross, with its base, weighing sixteen pounds thirteen ounces and a half; a triangular silver <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>; two silver candlesticks, of seven pounds three ounces; other two, of eight pounds thirteen ounces; a silver chalice gilt, of 20\u00bd ounces; a silver chalice and cross, of 7\u00bd ounces; besides the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a>'s robes, and other vestments, of gold brocade, crimson velvet embroidered with gold, and green damask.\u2014These were all sold, and part of the money applied to the repairs of the church; the rest was added to the funds of the corporation.\n\nIn the steeple of St Giles's church are three large bells brought from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a> in 1621; the biggest weighing 2000lb, the second 700, and the third 500. There are also a set of music bells, which play every day between one and two o'clock, or at any time in the case of rejoicings. The cathedral is divided by partition walls; and the principal apartments are used as four separate churches, which are distinguished by the names of the New or High Church, the Old Church, the Tolbooth Church, which is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> to the prison, and the Little Church, or Haddow's Hole Church, which derives its latter name from a gentleman who had been confined in it. The principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> is called the High Church, which has been elegantly repaired and new seated. There is a very elegant and finely ornamented seat for his majesty, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANOPY\">canopy</a> supported by four Corinthian pillars decorated in high taffeta. This seat is used by the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSIONER\">commissioner</a> during the time the General Assembly sits. On the right hand is a seat for the lord high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTABLE\">constable</a> of Scotland, whose office it is to keep the peace within doors in his majesty's presence; it being the duty of the earl marshal to do the same without. The seats belonging to the lords of council and session are on the right of the lord high constable; and on the left of the throne was a seat for the lord high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> of Scotland; but that office being now abolished, the seat is occupied by others. On the left of this fit the barons of exchequer; and, to the left of them, the lord provost, magistrates,\nThe pulpit, king's seat, and galleries, are covered with crimson velvet with gold and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> fringes.\n\nThe aisle of St Giles's church is fitted up with seats for the general assembly who meet here; and there is a throne for his majesty's commissioner with a canopy of crimson silk damask, having the king's arms embroidered with gold, presented by the late Lord Cathcart to his successor in office. In this church is a monument dedicated to the memory of Lord Napier, baron of Merchiston, well known as the inventor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOGARITHMS\">logarithms</a>; a second to the earl of Murray, regent of Scotland during the minority of James VI.; and a third to the great marquis of Montrose.\n\n4. The Parliament House, in the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HALL\">hall</a> of which the Scottish parliament used to assemble, is a magnificent building. The hall is 123 feet long and 42 broad, with a fine arched roof of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAK\">oak</a>, painted and gilded. In this the lawyers and agents now attend the courts, and single judges sit to determine causes in the first instance, or to prepare them for the whole court, who fit in an inner room formerly appropriated to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-PRIVY_COUNCIL\">privy council</a>. This inner apartment has been lately repaired and very commodiously fitted up. In a niche of the wall is placed a fine marble statue of President Forbes, erected at the expense of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACULTY\">faculty</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol1.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a>. There are also full-length portraits of King William III., Queen Mary his consort, and Queen Anne, all done by Sir Godfrey Kneller; also of George I., John duke of Argyll and Archibald duke of Argyll, by Mr Aikman of Cairney.\n\nAbove stairs were formerly the court of exchequer and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a> chamber, with the different offices belonging to that department; but these were removed in 1803 to the apartments in the royal exchange occupied by the customhouse; and below is one of the most valuable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LIBRARIES\">libraries</a> in Great Britain, belonging to the faculty of advocates. Besides 30,000 printed volumes, there are many scarce and valuable manuscripts, medals, and coins: here is also an entire mummy in its original case, presented to the faculty (at the expense of 300l.) by the earl of Morton, late president to the Royal Society. As these rooms are immediately below the hall where the parliament sat, they are subject to a search by the lord high constable of Scotland ever since the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a> plot; and this is specified in the gift from the city to the faculty. This library was founded, in the year 1682, by Sir George Mackenzie lord advocate. Among other privileges, it is entitled to a copy of every book entered in Stationers' hall. Before the great door is a noble equestrian statue of Charles II., the proportions of which are reckoned exceedingly just. Over the entrance are the arms of Scotland, with Mercy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">Truth</a> on each side for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SUPPORTERS\">supporters</a>.\n\nThe court of session, the supreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIBUNAL\">tribunal</a> in Scotland, consists of 15 judges, who sit on a circular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENCH\">bench</a>, clothed in purple robes turned up with crimson velvet. Six of these are lords of the judiciary, and go the circuit twice a-year; but, in that capacity, they wear scarlet robes turned up with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> satin.\n\n5. The Tolbooth was erected in 1561, not for the purposes merely of a prison, but likewise for the accommodation of the parliament and other courts; but it has since become so very unfit for any of these purposes, that it is now proposed to pull it down, and rebuild it in some other place, especially as it is very inconvenient in its present situation on account of its encumbering the street. The provost is captain of the tolbooth, with a gaoler under him; and the latter has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONOPOLY\">monopoly</a> of all the provisions for the prisoners; a circumstance which must certainly be considered as a grievous oppression, those who are least able to purchase them being thus obliged to do so at the highest price. There is a chaplain who has a salary of 30l. a-year.\n\n6. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BRIDEWELL\">Bridewell</a>. \"On the Calton-hill, to be seen from the North Bridge, is a correction-house or Bridewell, built within these few years. It is a strong stone fabric. The principal part of the building is in the form of the letter D, with a house for the governor at some distance opposite to the northern or rectangular part of it. The whole is surrounded by lofty walls, between which and the house is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-AREA\">area</a> laid out as a garden.\n\n\"This is said to be one of the most complete buildings of the kind in Britain. It consists of five stories; the uppermost of which is used as a hospital for sick prisoners and for store-rooms, &c. The other four stories are laid out in the following manner: A passage goes along the middle of the semicircular part of the building with apartments on each hand. The apartments on the outward side of the curvature are smaller than those on the inner side. They are double the number, and are used as separate bed-chambers for each of the persons confined. The apartments on the inner side of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a>, of which there are thirteen in each story, are allotted for labour. They have a grate in front, and look into the inner court. Opposite to them, in the flat side of the building, is a dark apartment with narrow windows, from which, without being seen, the governor can see how the prisoners in the apartments for work are employed. The court, or space in the middle between the flat and semicircular part of the building, is roofed in at the top; and a great part of it is covered with glass, so as to light the whole. On the floor of the area is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STOVE\">stove</a>, which during winter heats the whole apartments allotted to labour. There is also a pulpit, from which a chaplain preaches on Sundays; and the prisoners come into the front apartments to attend the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>.\n\n\"The bed-chambers, looking outwards to the country, are lighted by a long narrow window in each. The window is glazed. The frame in which the glass is fixed is of iron. It turns on pivots fixed at the top and bottom, so as to be opened and shut at pleasure. Each bed-chamber, which is about eight feet long by seven broad, is furnished with a bed and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIBLE\">bible</a>. The frame of the bed is of iron, the bed consists of a straw mattress of the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. The whole floors and partitions of the building are of stone. No wood is used excepting for the doors of the apartments. There are cells, however, for solitary confinement for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> criminals, in which the frames of the beds are of wood, left, by breaking them, tools or weapons of a dangerous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> should be obtained. Large cisterns, supplied with water from the city's reservoir, are placed at the top of the house, from which the water is distributed to the different stories, and to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a>, washing house, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BATHS\">baths</a>, on the ground floor.\n\n\"The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> is managed with great care. Besides being superintended by the magistrates of Edinburgh,\nEdinburgh: the sheriff of the county once each month visits every corner of it. It is kept in a state of the most perfect cleanliness. The prisoners, when first received, are clothed in a uniform belonging to the place; and their own clothes, after being cleaned, are preferred for them till their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a>. They remain during the day in the apartments allotted to labour, from which they are always dismissed as soon as it becomes dark to their bed-chambers. The women spin, and the men pick oakum. Their food consists of oatmeal porridge with small beer for breakfast and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>; and for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DINNER\">dinner</a>, of broth made of fat and vegetables, resembling what in Scotland is called \"bears' broth.\" Those that exert any tolerable industry are allowed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a> to their broth, and also a larger portion of porridge. Only one death has occurred in the house during the last four years; and in that case the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> who died had come into Bridewell under a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-COMPLICATION\">complication</a> of difficulties. In truth, the food, clothing, good air, and comfortable lodging, which are enjoyed in this place, are far superior to what the greater number of inhabitants can expect to obtain on their return to the world at large. To reside here, therefore, is a punishment from moral and not from physical causes; that is to say, because it is attended with the loss of freedom and of society, and because it is a place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFAMY\">infamy</a>.\"\n\n7. There is a hall in the Writers Court belonging to the clerks to his majesty's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIGNET\">signet</a>, where there is also an office for the business of the signet. The office of keeper of the signet is very lucrative, and he is allowed a deputy and clerks under him. Before any one enters into this society he must attend the college for two years, and serve five years as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPRENTICE\">apprentice</a> to one of the society. There is a very excellent library belonging to this hall, which is rapidly increasing, as every one who enters must pay \u00a310 towards it. He pays also \u00a3100 of apprentice fee, and \u00a3100 when he enters.\n\n8. The Exchange is a large and elegant building, with a court of about 90 feet square in the middle. On the north side are piazzas where people can walk under cover, the other three sides being laid out in shops; but the merchants have never made use of it to meet in, still standing in the street as formerly. The back part of the building formerly used for the general customhouse of Scotland, where the commissioners met to transact business, is now occupied by the offices connected with the Exchequer. They had above 20 offices for the different departments, to which the access is by a hanging stair 60 feet in height. In looking over the window before he ascends this stair, a stranger is surprised to find himself already 40 feet from the ground, which is owing to the declivity on which the Exchange is built. The fine mansion of Bellevue north of the New Town is now converted into apartments for the customhouse.\n\nThe Trustees Office for the improvement of fisheries and manufactures in Scotland is in the south-west corner of the Exchange; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> under their management being part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> money given to Scotland at the Union. This is distributed in premiums amongst those who appear to have made any considerable improvement in the arts.\n\n9. The North Bridge, which forms the main passage of communication between the Old and New Towns, was founded, as has already been observed, in 1763 by Provost Drummond; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> for building it was not signed till August 21, 1765. The architect was Mr William Mylne, who agreed with the town council of Edinburgh to finish the work for \u00a31,400, and to uphold it for 10 years. It was also to be finished before Martinmas 1769; but on the 3d of August that year, when the work was nearly completed, the vaults and side walls on the south fell down, and five people were buried in the ruins. This misfortune was occasioned by the foundation having been laid, not upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, but upon the rubbish of the houses which had long before been built on the north side of the High Street, and which had been thrown out into the hollow to the northward. Of this rubbish there were no less than eight feet between the foundation of the bridge and the solid earth. Besides this deficiency in the foundation, an immense load of earth which had been laid over the vaults and arches in order to raise the bridge to a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>, had no doubt contributed to produce the catastrophe above mentioned.\u2014The bridge was repaired, by pulling down some parts of the side walls, and afterwards rebuilding them; strengthening them in others with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> bars; removing the quantity of earth laid upon the vaults, and supplying its place with hollow arches, &c. The whole was supported at the south end by very strong buttresses and counterforts on each side; but on the north it has only a single support.\u2014The whole length of the bridge, from the High Street in the Old Town to Prince's Street in the New, is 1125 feet; the total length of the piers and arches is 310 feet. The width of the three great arches is 72 feet each; of the piers, 13\u00bd feet; and of the small arches, each 20 feet. The height of the great arches, from the top of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARAPET\">parapet</a> to the base, is 68 feet; the breadth of the bridge within the wall over the arches is 40 feet, and the breadth at each end 50 feet.\u2014On the southern extremity of this bridge stands the General Post Office for Scotland; a neat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> building, with a proper number of apartments for the business, and a house for the secretary.","sp":124,"ep":137},{"h":"EDINBURGHSHIRE","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> MIDLOTHIAN, is bounded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> by the frith of Forth and the river Amond, which divides it from Westlothian or Linlithgow; on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HADDINGTONSHIRE\">Haddingtonshire</a>; on the south by the counties of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LANARK\">Lanark</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PEEBLES\">Peebles</a>, and Berwick; and at the west corner by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a> of Linlithgow, Edinburghshire. It extends about 30 miles in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, and its breadth varies from 16 to 20; containing in all about 360 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> miles, or 230,400 English acres. The surface of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> is pleasant, having much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, interspersed with some hills, watered with many agreeable streams, and sheltered and decorated with woods. The arable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, which may be calculated about one third of the whole, is in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> cultivation, and affords excellent crops. The two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> ridges of hills which pass through the county, called the Moorfoot and the Pentland hills, afford pasture; the former is far superior in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> to the latter: in these hills it is generally remarked that the north side of the hill is the finest and best pasture, contrary to what we should be apt, a priori, to imagine. Like the other parts of the country, this district experiences the consequences of an insulated situation; being subject to that instability and uncertainty, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> exhibits the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> of every season of the year; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> easterly winds in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> are exceedingly detrimental to fruit, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> or mists from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, are apt to whiten and wither the corns before they are ripe. The immediate vicinity of many of the farms to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> affords the opportunity of procuring street dung easily, and has been of material advantage in improving the land; it has this disadvantage, however, that by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> continuance the fields become very full of weeds, particularly the fleawort or wild mustard; it is imagined that this would be obviated by throwing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> out in pasture for a few years, and afterwards liming it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> before ploughing. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> rivers of the county of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDINBURGH\">Edinburgh</a>, are the North and South Esk, which, uniting, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into the frith of Forth at the town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MUSSELBURGH\">Musselburgh</a>; the Amond, which falls into the same frith at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRAMOND\">Cramond</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LEITH\">Leith</a>, which forms the harbour of that town: all of these abound with trout. The islands of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol12.html#article-INCHKEITH\">Inchkeith</a> and Cramond, and of Inchmickery, also belong to this county.

In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a> of Raths is found a fine species of whetstone or hone; and in the parish of Duddingston, at Brickfield, is found clay, fit for making earthen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WARE\">ware</a>. The hills are composed of porphyry and basaltic whinstone, which in many places, particularly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARTHUR\">Arthur</a>'s Seat and Craig-Lockhart, exhibit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> forms. Near Glencroft, and in the Braid-hills, are found great veins of the heavy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SPAR\">spar</a>, or barites, which is often an attendant on metallic veins, especially of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>.

The power of instinctive affection is often, though not always, so strong as to compel them to preserve and nurture the fruit of their embraces. But even when their wants are not so urgent, nor their hearts so destitute of feeling as to prompt them to abandon their new-born <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol11.html#article-INFANTS\">infants</a> to the ferocity of wild beasts or the severity of the elements, yet still their uncomfortable and precarious situation, their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of the laws of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, their deficiency of moral and religious principles, and their want of dexterity or skill in any of the arts of life; all these together must render them unable to regulate the education of their children with much attention and sagacity. They may relate to them the wild.\nEducation <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> inculcate tales, in which all their notions concerning superior beings, and all their knowledge of the circumstances and transactions of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>, are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>; they may teach them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> the bow, to point their arrows, to hollow the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> of a tree into a canoe, and to trace the almost imperceptible path of an enemy or a wild <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a> over dreary mountains or through intricate forests; but they cannot impress their minds with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> concerning their social relations, or concerning their obligations to a Supreme Being, the framer and upholder of nature; they teach them not to repress their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> appetites, not to restrain the fancies of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> when they exceed just bounds or are improperly directed; nor can they inform their understandings with very accurate or extensive views of the phenomena of nature. Besides, they know not how far implicit obedience to his parents' commands is to be required of the boy or youth, nor how far he ought to be left to the guidance of his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a>. Among savages the influence of parental authority soon expires, nor is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> solicitous to maintain it. As the eagle expels his young from his lofty nest as soon as they become able to support themselves in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; so the savage generally ceases to care for his child, or assume any power over him, as soon as he becomes capable of procuring the means necessary for his own subsistence. Savages being scarce connected by any social ties, being unacquainted with the restraint of civil laws, and being unable to contribute in any great degree to the maintenance or protection of one another; each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> among them, as soon as he attains that degree of strength and dexterity which may enable him to procure the necessaries of life, stands single and alone, independent on others, and forming to submit to their commands. The parent, conscious of his inability to confer any important benefits on his child, after he has advanced even a very short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> towards manhood, no longer endeavors to control his actions; and the child proud of his independence, scarce submits to ask his parents advice. And even before his reaching this period of independence, so few are the benefits which parents can bestow (being confined to supplying the necessaries of life, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> the knowledge of a very few of the rudest simplest arts), that children regard them with little deference, nor do they always insist on implicit submission. Want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> affection, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONSCIOUSNESS\">consciousness</a> of superior strength, often prompt the parent to abuse the weakness of his child. Yet though small the skill with which the savage can cultivate the understanding or form the dispositions of his child, though few the arts which he can teach him, and though not very respectful or submissive the obedience or deferences which he requires: yet there is one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of mind which the savage is more careful to inspire than those parents who are directed in educating their children by all the lights of civilized society. That quality indeed is absolutely necessary to fit the savage for his situation; without it, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> on which he ceased to enjoy the protection of his parents would most probably be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> day of his life: That quality is Fortitude. We may perhaps think, that the hardships to which the young savage is from the period of his birth unavoidably exposed, might be enough to inspire him with fortitude; but as if these were insufficient, other means are applied to inspire him with Education, what the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOICS\">Stoics</a> have regarded as the first of virtues. He is compelled to submit to many hardships unnecessary, but from a view to this. Children are therefore called to emulate each other in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> the severest torments. Charlevoix relates, that he has seen a boy and girl bind their arms together, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> coal between them, and try who could longest endure without thinking the pain to which they thus exposed themselves.\n\nStill, however, the young savage owes his education rather to nature and to the circumstances in which he is placed, and the accidents which befell him, than to nature and the kindness or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> of his parents. Nature has circumstantially endowed him with certain powers of understanding, for his sentiments, sensations, and bodily organs; he has been educated, placed in certain circumstances, and is exposed to a certain train of events; and by these means chiefly, not by the watchful industry of instructors, does he become such as he appears when he has reached the years of maturity.\n\nBut <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> was not designed by his wife and beneficent Creator to remain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> in a savage state; the principles of his nature incline him to social life. Reason, state of distinguishing the superior advantages to be enjoyed in society, concurs with the social principle in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, in prompting him to seek the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> of others of the human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>. When men enter into society, they always unite their powers and talents, in a certain degree, for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> advantage of the social body. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this, laws come in time to be instituted; new arts are invented; progress is made in the knowledge of nature; moral duties are better understood and defined; juster ideas are gradually acquired of all our social relations; friendship, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILIAL\">filial</a>, parental, and conjugal affection, all are heightened and refined. All these advantages do not instantly result from men's entering into a social state; the improvement of the human mind, and the civilization of society, are gradual and progressive: But as it is natural for men to unite in a social state, so it is no less natural for society to be gradually improved and civilized till it attain a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a> and refinement.\n\nWhen men have attained to such knowledge and improvement as to be entitled to a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> appellation than that of savages, one part of their improvements generally confers in their becoming more judicious and attentive in directing the education of their youth. They have now acquired ideas of dependence and subordination; they have arts to teach, and knowledge to communicate; they have moral principles to instil; and have formed notions of their relation and obligations to superior powers, which they are desirous that their children should also entertain. Their affection to their offspring is now also more tender and constant. We observe at present in that state of society in which we live, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> who can scarce earn for themselves and their children the necessaries of life, are generally less susceptible of parental affection, in all its anxious tenderness, than the rich, or those whom <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">Providence</a> hath placed in easy circumstances; and we may make use of this fact in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> concerning the different degrees of the same affection <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> by the savage and the member of a civilized socie-\nThe savage may be considered as the poor man, who with difficulty procures the necessaries of life even for himself; the other, as the man in affluent circumstances, who is more at leisure to listen to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> of tender and generous affection.\n\nIn this improved state of society, the education of youth is viewed as an object of highest importance. The child is dearer to his parent; and the parent is now more capable of cultivating the understanding and rectifying the dispositions of his child. His knowledge of nature, and his dexterity in the arts of life, give him more authority over a child than what the savage can possess. Obedience is now enforced, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of education is adopted; by means of which the parent attempts to form his child for acting a part in social life. Perhaps the legislature interferes; the education of the youth is regarded as highly worthy of public concern: it is considered that the foolish fondness or the unnatural caprice of parents may, in the rising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BLAST\">blast</a> the hopes of the state.\n\nIn reviewing ancient history, we find that this actually took place in several of the most celebrated governments of antiquity. The Persians, the Cretans, and the Lacedemonians, were all of them too anxious to form their youth for discharging the duties of citizens to intrust the education of the children solely to the parents. Public establishments were formed among those nations, and a series of institutions enacted, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> on and regulating the education of their youths: Not such as our European <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a>, in which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> knowledge being the sole object of pursuit, the student is maintained solely at his parents expense, and attends only if his parents think proper to send him; but of a very different nature, and on a much more enlarged <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a>.\n\nThe Persians, according to the elegant and accurate account delivered by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-XENOPHON\">Xenophon</a> in the beginning of his Cyropaedia, divided the whole body of their citizens into four orders; the boys, the youth, the full-grown men, and those who were advanced beyond that period of life during which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> was required. For each of these orders particular halls were appropriated. Each of them was subjected to the inspection of twelve rulers. The adults and the superannuated were required to employ themselves in the performance of particular duties, suitable to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, their abilities, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>; while the boys and the youth were engaged in such a course of education as seemed likely to render them worthy and useful citizens.\n\nThe boys were not employed, in their places of instruction, in acquiring literary accomplishments; for to such the Persians were strangers. They went thither to learn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEMPERANCE\">temperance</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a>; to shoot the bow, and to launch the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JAVELIN\">javelin</a>. The virtues and the bodily exercises were what the Persians laboured to teach their children. These were the direct, and not subordinate, purposes of their system of education. The matters used to spend the greatest part of the day in dispensing justice to their scholars; who carried before them actions for thefts, robberies, frauds, and other such grounds of complaint against one another.\u2014Such were the means by which the Persians endeavoured to instil, even in early youth, a regard for the laws of natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EQUITY\">equity</a>, and for the institutions of their country.\n\nTill the age of 16 or 17, the boys were baffled in acquiring those parts of education. At that period they ceased to be considered as boys, and were raised to the order of the youths. After they entered this order, the same views were still attended to in the carrying on of their education. They were still inured to bodily labour. They were to attend the magistrates, and to be always ready to execute their commands. They were led out frequently to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a>; and on such expeditions they were always headed by the king, as in time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>. Here they were taught to expose themselves fearlessly to danger; to suffer, without repining or complaint, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HUNGER\">hunger</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THIRST\">thirst</a>, and fatigue; and to content themselves with the coarsest, simplest fare, for relieving the necessities of nature. In short, whether at home or out on some hunting expedition, they were constantly employed in acquiring new skill and dexterity in military exercises, new vigour of mind and body, and confirmed habits of temperance, fortitude, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTINENCE\">abstinence</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PATRIOTISM\">patriotism</a>, and noble integrity.\n\nAfter spending ten years in this manner, their course of education was completed; they were admitted into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> of the adults, and were deemed qualified for public offices. It must not escape our notice, that the citizens were not compelled to send their children to pass through this course of education in the public halls; but none except such as passed through this course of education were capable of civil power, or admitted to participate in public offices or public honours.\n\nSuch are the outlines of that system of education which Xenophon represents as publicly established among the Persians. Were we able to preserve in a translation all the manly and graceful simplicity of that enchanting author, we would have offered to the perusal of our readers the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">picture</a> in which he has described it: but conscious of being inadequate to that task, we have presumed only to extract the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> which it contains.\n\nPerhaps, however, this system of education did not sufficiently satisfy as the eloquent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCRATES\">Socrates</a> describes it among that rude and simple people. On other occasions he has commemorated such instances of their barbarity, as would tempt us to think them incapable of so much order and so much <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>. Perhaps, as the discoverers of the new world have sometimes conferred on the inhabitants of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEMISPHERE\">hemisphere</a>, in the accounts of them with which they entertained their friends in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, amazing degrees of moral and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> wisdom, of skill and dexterity in the arts, of industry and valour, which those uncivilized children of nature were afterwards found not to possess; so the Athenian philosopher has also ascribed to the Persians prudence and attention in regulating the education of their youth beyond what people in so rude a state can possibly exert.\n\nBut if we examine into the principles on which this system of education proceeds, without concerning ourselves whether it once actually prevailed among the Persians, or is the production of the fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> of Xenophon, we will find it peculiarly suitable for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> just emerging from the rudeness and ignorance of barbarity to a knowledge of social and civil relations, and of the duties connected with such relations. They have sacrificed their independence to obtain the comfort\nEducation, comfort and security of a social state. They now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> in the appellation of citizens, and are desirous to discharge the duties <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITIZEN\">citizen</a>. They must inform their children in the nature of their social relations, and impress them with habits of discharging their social duties; otherwise the society will soon be dissolved, and their posterity will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> back into the same wild miserable state from which they have emerged. But perhaps the circumstances, or abilities, or dispositions of individuals, render them unequal to this weighty task. It becomes therefore naturally an object of public care. The whole social body find it necessary to deliberate on the most proper means for discharging it aright. A plan of education is then formed; the great object of which is, to fit the youth for discharging the duties of citizens. Arts and sciences are hitherto almost wholly unknown; and all that can be communicated to the youth is only a skill in such exercises as are necessary for their procuring subsistence, or defending themselves against human enemies or beasts of prey; and habits of performing those duties, the neglect of which must be fatal to the society or the individual.\n\nSuch is the system of education which we have surveyed as established among the Persians; and perhaps we may now be less suspicious than before of Xenophon's veracity. It appears natural for a people who have reached that degree of civilization in which they are described, and have not yet advanced farther, to institute such an establishment. Some such establishment also appears necessary to prevent the society from falling back into their former barbarity. It will prevent their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> and valour from decaying, though it may perhaps at the same time prevent them from making any very rapid progress in civilization and refinement. Yet the industry, the valour, the integrity, and the patriotism which it inspires, must necessarily produce some favourable change in their circumstances; and that change in their circumstances will be followed by a change in their system of education.\n\nThe Cretans, too, the wisdom of whose laws is so much celebrated in the records of antiquity, had a public establishment for the education of their youth. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINOS\">Minos</a>, whom they revered as their great legislator, was also the founder of that establishment. Its tendency was similar to that of the course of education pursued among the Persians,\u2014to form the soldier and the citizen. We cannot present our readers with a very particular or accurate account of it; but such as we have been able to procure from the best authorities we think it our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> to lay before them.\n\nThe Cretans were divided into three classes; the boys, the youth, and the adults. Between seven and seventeen years of age, the boy was employed in learning to shoot the bow, and in acquiring the knowledge of his duties as a man and a citizen, by listening to the conversation of the old men in the public halls, and observing their conduct. At the age of seven, he was conducted to the public halls to enter on this course of education. He was taught to expose himself boldly to danger and fatigue; to aspire after skill and dexterity in the use of arms and in the gymnastic exercises; to repeat the laws and hymns in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of the gods. At the age of seventeen he was enrolled among the youth. Here his education was still continued on the same plan. He was to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> himself among his equals in hunting, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRESTLING\">wrestling</a>, and the military exercises; and while thus engaged, his spirits were roused and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a> by strains of martial music played on such instruments as were then in use among the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRETE\">Crete</a>. One part of the education of the Cretan youth, in which they were particularly desirous to excel, was the Pyrrhic dance; which was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of a Cretan, and consisted of various military evolutions performed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> of instruments.\n\nSuch were the principles and arts in which the Cretan legislature directed the youth to be instructed. This course of education could not be directed or superintended by the parent. It was public, and carried on with a view to fit the boy for discharging the duties of a citizen when he should attain to manhood.\n\nIt is easy to see, that such a system of education must have been instituted in the infancy of society, before many arts had been invented, or the distinctions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> had arisen; at a time when men subsisted in a considerable degree by hunting, and when the intercourse of nations was on such a footing, that war, instead of being occasional, was the great business of life. Such a system of life would then naturally take place, even through no sage legislator had arisen to regulate and enforce it.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LYCURGUS\">Lycurgus</a>, the celebrated lawgiver of Lacedemonians, thought it necessary to direct the education of youth in a particular manner, in order to prepare them for paying a strict obedience to his laws. He regarded children as belonging more properly to the state than to their parents, and wished that patriotism should be still more carefully cherished in their breasts than filial affection. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of his system of education was pretty similar to that of those which we have just viewed as subsisting among the Persians and the Cretans.\n\nAs soon as a boy was born, he was submitted to the inspection of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELDERS\">elders</a> of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a> to which his parents belonged. If he was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> shaped, strong, and vigorous, they directed him to be brought up, and assigned a certain portion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a> for his maintenance. If he was deformed, weak, and sickly, they condemned him to be exposed, as not being likely ever to become a useful citizen. If the boy appeared worthy of being brought up, he was intrusted to the care of his parents till he attained the age of seven years; but his parents were strictly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> not to spoil either his mind or his bodily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> by foolish tenderness. Probably, too, the state of their manners was at that time such as not to render the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INJUNCTION\">injunction</a> peculiarly necessary.\n\nAt the age of seven, however, he was introduced to a public class, consisting of all the boys of the same age. Their education was committed to masters appointed by the state; and what was chiefly inculcated on them in the course of it, was submissive obedience and respect to their superiors; quickness and brevity in their conversation, and replies to such questions as were put to them; dexterity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> in performing what was commanded them; and firmness and patience in bearing every pain or hardship to which they might be exposed. One of the means used to form them to habits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> and address, was to permit,\nEducation, nay, to direct them to commit little acts of theft; which, if they performed them so dexterously as to avoid detection, they might afterwards boast of as noble exploits: but if detected in such enterprises, the awkward artless boy was exposed both to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> and disgrace. To avoid the punishment and disgrace incurred by being detected in an act of theft, the Spartan boy would often suffer with unshrinking fortitude the severest torments. It is related of one of them, that rather than be discovered with a young fox under his cloak, which he had stolen, he suffered the little animal to tear open his bowels. Not content with beholding the children suffer by submitting voluntarily to such hardships, the Spartans also endeavoured to form them to fortitude, by whipping them on their religious festivals, sometimes with such severity that they expired under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LASH\">lash</a>. The Lacedemonian youth were also taught such bodily exercises, and the use of such warlike weapons, as were necessary to render them expert and skilful soldiers.\n\nThey too, as well as the Cretans and Persians, among whom we have seen similar modes of education adopted, were to be citizens and soldiers; not husbandmen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>, artists, merchants, &c. Their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of education, therefore, was simple and uniform. Its aim was, to make them acquainted with the nature of their social duties, and to form them to such vigour of body and such firmness of mind as might render them fit for the station in which they were to be placed, and adequate to the part which they were to act. This establishment for education was perfectly consistent with the other parts of that legislature which was instituted by Lycurgus. Youth educated among the Lacedemonians could hardly fail to become worthy members of that singular republic. Let us not however regard the Spartans as singularly inhumane in their treatment of youth. Let us recollect, in imagination, to that period in the progress of society from rudeness to refinement, which they had reached when Lycurgus arose among them. What were then their circumstances, their arts and manners, their moral principles, and military <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a>? Not very different from those which the laws of Lycurgus rendered so long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a> among them. He, no doubt, rectified some abuses, and introduced greater order and equality. But man is not to be so easily metamorphosed into a new form. As you cannot, at once, raise an acorn to a venerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OAK\">oak</a>; so neither will you be able to change the savage at once, into the citizen. All the art or wisdom of Lycurgus, even though assisted by all the influence of the prophetic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOLLO\">Apollo</a>, could never have established his laws among his countrymen, had not their character and circumstances previously disposed them to receive them. But, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> this, and you must, of consequence, allow, that, what to us may appear cruel and inhumane, must have affected their feelings in a different manner. The change introduced in the treatment of youth by the establishment of this system of education was probably recommended by its being more humane than what before prevailed. Corrupted as are our manners, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFEMINATE\">effeminate</a> our modes of education; yet we would not perhaps act wisely in laying them aside, to adopt in their stead those of ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-SPARTA\">Sparta</a>. But the Spartan education was peculiarly well fitted to form citizens for the republic of Lycurgus; it was happily adapted to Education, the state of society in which it was introduced. And, if we should inquire by what means Lycurgus was enabled to fix the arts, the manners, and in short the civilization of his country, for so long a period, in a stationary state; we would perhaps find reason to ascribe that effect to the public establishment which he instituted for the education of youth; to his confining the Spartan citizens to the profession of arms, and affixing all servile offices to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HELOTS\">Helots</a>; and to his prohibiting the use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> and silver. Among these however his establishment for education occupies the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> place. Never was any state adorned with more patriotic citizens than those of Sparta. With them every private affection seemed to be swallowed up by the amor patriae: the love of their country was at least their ruling passion. Pedestrians being rejected when he offered himself a candidate for a seat among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of three hundred, returned home, rejoicing that there were in Sparta no fewer than three hundred whom his countrymen found reason to regard as better citizens than himself. This was not a seeming joy, assumed to conceal the pain which he suffered from the disappointment; it was heartfelt and sincere. Such were the effects of their system of education.\n\nWhen we turn our eyes from the Persians, the Cretans, and the Spartans, to the other nations of antiquity; we nowhere behold so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> a system of public education. Among the Athenians and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>, the laws did not descend to regulate in so particular a manner the management of the youth. These nations gradually emerged from a state of the rudest barbarity, to that polished, enlightened, and civilized state which rendered them the glory and the wonder of the heathen world: but in no part of their progress from the one state to the other do we find any such establishment subsisting among them. So various, however, are the circumstances which form and diversify the character of nations, that we cannot reasonably conclude, because no such establishments existed among the Athenians and Romans, that therefore their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> was unnatural among those nations who possessed them. But though the education of youth was managed in a different manner among these and most other nations in the ancient world, than by public establishments, which detached children from the care of their parents; yet still it was everywhere regarded as an object of the highest importance. As the manners of mankind gradually improved to a state of refinement; as the invention of arts, and the discovery of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, gradually introduced opulence and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a>; connubial, parental, and filial affection gradually acquired greater strength and tenderness. Of consequence, children experienced more of their parents' care; and that care was directed to form them for acting a becoming part in life. According to the circumstances of each nation, the arts which they cultivated, and the form of government under which they lived; the knowledge which they sought to communicate to their children, and the habits which they endeavoured to impress upon them, were different from those of other nations: And again, according to the different circumstances, tempers, abilities, and dispositions of parents, even the children of each family were brought up in a manner different from that\nThe Athenians, the Romans, the Carthaginians, conducted each of them the education of their youth in a different manner, because they had each different objects in view. But having considered the most singular establishments for education which prevailed in the ancient world, it seems unnecessary for us to descend to a particular account of the manner which every nation, or fantastic individual, thought proper to pursue in bringing up their youth. It will probably be more useful and entertaining to our readers, if we next present them with a view of some of the most judicious or fanciful plans of education which have been proposed by the writers on that subject.\n\nOne of the most respectable writers on education among the ancients is the celebrated Quintilian. He taught <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RHETORIC\">rhetoric</a> in Rome during the reign of Domitian, and under several of the other emperors. When he retired from the exercise of his employment as a teacher of rhetoric, he spent his leisure in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of a treatise, not merely on rhetoric, but on the most proper means for educating a boy so as to render him both an eloquent orator and a good man.\n\nIn that valuable treatise, he enters into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> detail of all that appears to him most likely to conduce to those important ends.\n\nAs soon as the boy enters the world, he would have the greatest care to be used in selecting those who are to be placed about him. Let his nurse have no impediment of speech. It will be happy for him, if his parents be persons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> and learning. Let his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a>, at least, possess these qualifications. As soon as he attains the distinct use of his organs of speech, let him be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INITIATED\">initiated</a> in the first elements of literature. For as he is capable of distinguishing and remembering at a very early age; so his faculties cannot possibly be employed in a more advantageous manner. And even at this early period of life, let maxims of prudence and the first principles of morals be inculcated upon his mind by the books which are put into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, and even by the lines which he copies in learning the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>. The Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> was to the Romans in the days of Quintilian, what the Latin and Greek and French are to us at present, an acquisition held indispensably necessary to those who aspired to a liberal education; and Quintilian judges it proper that the boy should begin his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> to letters with the Greek language in preference to his mother tongue.\n\nThis judicious writer next examines a question which has been often agitated. Whether a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> or a public education is liable to the fewest inconveniences, and likely to be attended with the greatest advantages? And he is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that in a domestic education the boy is in danger of being corrupted by injudicious fondness and evil example; is not roused by the spur of emulation; and is deprived of proper opportunities for acquiring a just idea of his own power, or that activity and dexterity which he will afterwards find so necessary when he comes to act a part in life: While in a public education, which was preferred by some of the most renowned nations of antiquity, the morals are not greatly exposed to corruption, emulation is roused, friendships are formed, all the powers of the mind are called forth to act with new vigour, and the youth is prepared for performing his part on the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEATRE\">theatre</a> of the world. Quintilian, therefore, wishes that parents would place their children in public seminaries of education.\n\nWhen a boy is committed to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>'s care, the master's attention must be first directed to discover his dispositions and the extent of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a>. Of his capacity he will form a favourable judgment, not from his sprightliness, nor even from his quickness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>, but from his modesty, docility, and virtuous dispositions. If the boy possesses these last qualifications, the master will rejoice in him, as likely to give him satisfaction and do him honour. According to his temper and dispositions, let the boy be treated with mildness or severity; but never let severity extend to blows. Let the boy be allured and led, by the most artful and insinuating treatment, to do his duty; there will then be no occasion to punish him for neglecting it.\n\nAs Quintilian's professed object was, not merely to give <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> directions for forming the heart and cultivating the understanding, but to form a particular character in life, the scholar and the orator; he finds it necessary to enter into minute details concerning the manner in which the boy is to be instructed in speaking, writing, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a>, and composition; of which it does not appear necessary for us to take particular notice in this place. Music and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">geometry</a>, he thinks, ought to make a part of the young orator's studies; as being useful to render him accurate in reasoning, and capable of relishing the beauties of the poets. He is also of opinion, that the boy should not be confined to one branch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>, without being allowed to attempt others till he have made himself master of that. Let several parts of literature engage his attention by turns: let him dedicate a considerable portion of his time to them. He may thus acquire habits of industrious application which will remain with him through life.\n\nWith the tender attention of a good man, this sensible and elegant writer still accompanies his pupil through the course of his studies; anxiously insists that he be placed under a master distinguished for purity of morals, and for no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> abilities in his profession; directs his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> to be stored with the noblest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> of the poets, orators, and historians; and carefully diffuses and refutes those opinions which represent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> as above industry. The remaining part of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> being employed on the principles of rhetoric, without containing any thing on the subject of education in general, it is not necessary that we should here present an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of it to our readers. But since Quintilian was so distinguished, not only as a rhetorician, but as an instructor of youth, and displays so much good sense and so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> a judgment, formed on long experience, in whatever he advances on the subject of education; we could not, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> negligence, omit taking notice of him under this article, and affording our readers an opportunity of being instructed by listening to his sentiments on this head.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of John <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a> is so much revered in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, that his sentiments on any subject are interesting. Treatise on Britons. His life was dedicated to study: During a part of it, he was employed in the task of instructing youth;\nEducation; and among his other works we find a treatise on education. He had himself been educated according to that plan which has long been established in the English universities; but with that mode of education he was not satisfied. The object of his directions is chiefly to form a scholar. He considered himself as qualified to exhibit a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of \"a better education, in extent and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPREHENSION\">comprehension</a> far more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>, and yet of time far shorter, and of attainment far more certain, than any that had yet been in practice.\" The following is the substance of his treatise.\n\nAs the end of learning is to cultivate our understandings, and to rectify our dispositions; therefore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of our applying to the study of languages cannot be merely that we may commit to memory the words of which they consist, or that we may acquire a knowledge of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> and structure; but that we may enrich our minds with the treasures of wisdom which they contain. But in the present modes of education this design does not appear to be kept in view. The learner of Latin is burdened with rules, and themes, and verses, and orations; but no care is taken to make him master of the valuable knowledge which the classics contain. And when he advances a little farther, he is driven into the thorny paths of logic and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METAPHYSICS\">metaphysics</a>. So, when his studies are completed, and he is considered as having received a liberal education, he is almost as destitute of real knowledge as when he first entered a school.\n\nBut to render learning truly beneficial, instead of the school and university education which youth at present receive, let the place of both school and university be supplied by an academy, in which they may acquire all that is taught at either, except <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> and physic. Let the academy afford <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> for 150 persons; 20 of whom may be servants and attendants. As many academies as are necessary may be afterwards erected on the model of this one. Let the youth who are introduced into this academy begin their studies with learning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> rules of grammar from some good elementary book. In their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRONUNCIATION\">pronunciation</a> of Latin, let them be taught to follow the pronunciation of the Italians; so that the English is indistinct, and unfavourable to the genius of the language. Next, read to them some entertaining book on education; such as, the three first books of Quintilian in Latin, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CEBES\">Cebes</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-PLUTARCH\">Plutarch</a>, or some other of the Socratic discourses, in Greek; and be careful to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> every opportunity of inspiring them, by reasonable lectures and explanations, with love for learning, admiration of great and virtuous characters, and a disposition to cheerful obedience. At the same time, but at a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a> of the day, let them be instructed in the rules of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a> and the elements of geometry. Between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a> and bedtime, instruct them in the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a> and the sacred history. From the writers on education let your pupils pass to the authors on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>, to Cato, Varro, and Columella. Before half these authors be read, they cannot but be pretty well qualified to read most of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROSE\">prose</a> authors in the Latin language; and they may now, with great propriety, learn the use of the globes, and make themselves acquainted with the ancient and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> maps. Let them, about the same time, begin the study of the Greek tongue, and proceed in it as in the Latin; they will not fail to overcome, in a short time, all the difficulties of grammar; after which they will have access to all the treasures of natural knowledge to be found in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-THEOPHRASTUS\">Theophrastus</a>. In the same manner they may make themselves acquainted with Vitruvius, Seneca, Mela, Cellus, Pliny, and Solinus. And having thus passed through the principles of arithmetic, geometry, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, and geography, with a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> of physics; let them next turn their attention to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>, in which they may begin with the practical branch of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIGONOMETRY\">trigonometry</a>, which will serve as an introduction to fortification, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHITECTURE\">architecture</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVIGATION\">navigation</a>. To teach them the knowledge of nature, and instruct them in the arts of life, let them have the affluence and instructions, not merely of masters who are acquainted only with books, but of men whose skill has been obtained by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> practice, even of artists and mechanics. Next, let the poets obtain their attention; and they will now read them with ease and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. From the poets let your pupils proceed to the moralists; and, after acquainting themselves with them, they may be allowed the entertainment of some of the best Greek, Latin, and Italian dramatic compositions. From these let them proceed to politics; let them here study the law of Moses, the admirable remains of the ancient lawgivers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>, the Roman tables, edicts, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PANDECTS\">pandects</a>, concluding with the institutions of their mother-country. Now let them be more particularly instructed in the principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-THEOLOGY\">theology</a>; for by this time they may have acquired the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEBREW\">Hebrew</a> language, together with the Chaldee and the Syriac <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DIALECT\">dialect</a>, and may therefore read the Scriptures in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> language. When their minds are thus furnished, they will be able to enter into the spirit of the noblest historians and poets. To get by heart, and repeat in a proper manner, passages from the writings of some of these, will have the happiest effects in elevating their genius. Let this stately edifice be crowned with logic and rhetoric. Far different would be the effects of such a course of education, from those produced by any which is at present pursued. We should then see abler writers, more eloquent speakers, and wiser statesmen. Similar to this, probably, was the course taught in the famous schools of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYTHAGORAS\">Pythagoras</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a>, Ifocrates, and Aristotle. This would unite the advantages of an Athenian and a Spartan education: for our pupils should be taught the exercises of wrestling and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FENCING\">fencing</a>, and the whole military discipline.\n\nSuch are the ideas of our admired Milton on the subject of education. An enthusiastic admirer of the sciences, arts, and institutions of Greece and Rome; from his religious and political principles, no friend to the universities; it was natural for a man of his learning and ingenuity, in an age of innovation, and influenced by such prejudices, to form such a project as that which we have surveyed. He seems not to have reflected, that it is necessary for children to be long occupied in obtaining a familiar acquaintance with words, before they can <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> from books any knowledge of things; overlooking this circumstance, and perceiving plainly that the mode of education which then prevailed confined the attention of youth almost wholly to words, he could not but regard the scheme which he proposed as likely to produce very happy effects.\nEducation effects. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>, that the appearances of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> nature are among the first objects which attract the attention of youth, which he communicates by directing his pupils to peruse the writers on agriculture and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural history</a> as near the beginning of their studies as possible; if not altogether just, yet must be allowed to be nearly so. Perhaps human actions and passions, and the series of events which happen around us, are, by the time at which we begin our application to learning, the objects which most frequently and strongly engage our attention: But the appearances of external nature are at least the next object of our regard.\n\nMr Locke, whose abilities and noble design to be useful to the world his country is so much indebted, has written, among other things, on the education of youth. He was capable of thinking for himself; but more desirous of rendering himself useful, than of being admired for singularity. He is therefore an author to whom we ought to listen, at least, with respectful attention. If Quintilian and Milton had been employed as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEACHERS\">teachers</a> of youth, Mr Locke had been conversant with the world, had inquired into the principles of human nature, and had no doubt endeavoured to examine without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> the effects of those modes of education which he disapproves. When we consider, that, to render himself useful to the rising generation, he could descend from the heights of science to translate the fables of \u00c6sop, and to perform other humble tasks in literature, which a philosopher of less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> and virtue would have disdained; we cannot but look with veneration and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> on so exalted a character. In his Treatise on Education, the two great objects which Mr Locke keeps in view are, 1st, To preserve and strengthen the bodily constitution; 2dly, To inform the understanding with useful knowledge, and to cherish good dispositions in the heart.\n\nIn his directions on the first of these heads, he seems extremely anxious to prevent parents and others in whose hands children are placed, from injuring them by ill-directed tenderness. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">Plain</a> fare, simple and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> clothing, abstinence from physic and from strong liquors, he earnestly recommends as the most judicious means for preserving and confirming the health of the child. In all his gratifications let the strictest moderation be observed. If you permit him to indulge pretty freely in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>, at least cause him to get up at an early hour in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>. In one thing, however, few parents will be willing to comply with Mr Locke's advice. He not only directs that the child's feet be frequently bathed in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, but even expresses a wish, that his shoes were always kept in such a condition as to admit water freely. This he thinks likely to fortify the constitution of the body in such a manner, as to render him less liable, in the course of life, to such diseases as arise from any unusual exposure to wetness or cold, than others whose feet have been more carefully kept dry. Though he had prosecuted his studies with a design to enter into the profession of physic, yet an unfavourable opinion did he entertain of the effects produced by medical preparations on the human constitution, that he earnestly insists on the parent to beware of administering any of them to his child. From the desire which Mr Locke discovers to have children exposed to hardships, and restrained from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol12.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a>, in order to confirm the health and invigorate the constitution, we may conjecture him to have been an admirer of that severe mode of education which usually prevails in the earlier periods of the existence of society. He seems to have thought, that if a boy be brought up like a Huron or a Spartan, he must necessarily become robust and healthy; without reflecting, that of those children who are subjected to such a course of education, too great a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> are unable to survive it: such is the natural delicacy of the human frame.\n\nWhen he turns his attention to the cultivating of the understanding, and the forming of the dispositions of the powers of the mind, Mr Locke still deferentially claims the regard of the parent and the preceptor. With a virtuous indignation he reproaches that negligence and folly by which we generally corrupt the heart and spoil the temper of children, even in that period of infancy; so as to render them incorrigible when they advance farther in life. Their appetites are pampered, all their desires are gratified: and if we are at any time disposed to refuse what they ask, they have an all-powerful engine to compel our compliance with their wishes. They afflict us with tears; and we then yield to their requests, however hurtful to themselves or inconvenient to us. We often studiously instruct them in vicious tricks, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> forth their evil passions. At so early an age, their rage or cunning can scarcely injure us; and we reflect not that habits of peevishness and deceit must be peculiarly hurtful to themselves.\n\nBut though all the foolish desires of children ought not to be gratified, and though we should carefully avoid leading them into any bad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a>; yet it is not necessary nor prudent to treat them with harshness or severity. Let them be formed to obedience from their earliest years; let them be accustomed to submit implicitly to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of those on whom they depend. But beware of fouling their temper and depressing their spirits by harshness: and, on the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, remember that it is no less improper to give the boy a habit of neglecting his duty, except when he is allured to it by the hopes of reward. As he advances towards manhood, and attains the use of reason, you may admit him to greater familiarity, and allow him to follow his own inclinations more than at an earlier period: and if, instead of indulging all his freaks in childhood, you have carefully accustomed him to obedience and submission, without enforcing these by improper means, he will now be able to regulate his conduct with some degree of prudence.\n\nBut while caution is to be used in bestowing rewards and inflicting punishments, still rewards and punishments are indissolubly necessary in the management of the child. Inspire your boy with a sense of shame, and with a generous thirst for praise. Caress and honour him when he does well: treat him with neglect when he acts amiss. This conduct will produce much better effects than if you were at one time to chide and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEAT\">beat</a> him; at another, to reward him with a profusion of sweetmeats and playthings.\n\nThink not that children are to be taught propriety of conduct by loading their memory with rules, dir-\nEducation, rectifying them how to act on every particular occasion.\n\nBurden them not with rules, but imparts them with habits.\n\nBe not desirous of forming them at too early an age, to all that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITENESS\">politeness</a> and propriety of manners which you wish to distinguish them when they become men. Let them be taught an easy, graceful carriage of body; but give yourself no concern, though they now and then blunder against the prejudices of good breeding; time will correct their awkwardnesses.\n\nWith regard to that important question, whether children ought to be sent to a public school, or are likely to be better trained up in a domestic education? so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> is it for one master to extend his attention to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of boys, and so likely is the contagion of vice to be caught among the crowd of a public school, that a private seems more favourable than a public education to virtue, and scarce less favourable to learning.\n\nWhen you resolve to give your son a domestic education, be careful to regulate that domestic education in a judicious manner. Keep him at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from evil example: choose the most favourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LESSONS\">lessons</a> for communicating instruction: strictly enforce obedience; but never by blows, except in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of obstinacy which you find otherwise incurable. If his engagements in life prevent the parent from superintending and directing his son's education personally, let him commit him to the care of a virtuous and judicious tutor. Let the tutor be rather a man of experience in the world than of profound learning; for it is more necessary that the pupil be formed for conducting himself with prudence in the world, and be fortified against those temptations to which he will be exposed when he enters upon active life, than that his head be stuffed with Latin and logic.\n\nHere Mr Locke, notwithstanding that his own mind was stored with the treasures of Grecian and Roman literature, takes occasion to declare himself pretty freely against that application to ancient learning, which was then indispensably required in the education of youth. He considers languages and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> as rather having a tendency to render the youth unfit for acting a prudent and becoming part in life than forming for it; and he therefore infers that these should be but in a subordinate degree the objects of his attention.\n\nLet the tutor encourage the child under his care to a certain degree of familiarity; let the pupil be accustomed to give his opinion on matters relative to himself: let him be taught justice, by finding injustice to others prejudicial to himself; let him be taught liberality, by finding it advantageous; let him be rendered superior to teasing his parents or tutor with complaints, by finding his complaints unfavourably received. That you may teach him to restrain every foolish or irregular desire, be sure never to indulge his wishes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> when you find the indulgence proper for him, and convenient for yourself. Curiosity, however, is a principle which ought to be industriously roused in the breast of the child, and cherished there by meeting always the readiest gratification. However you may oppose the boy's inclinations in other things, yet refuse him not a proper portion of recreation: let him indulge in play, while he continues to play with keenness and activity; but suffer him not to loiter about in littlest indolence. To restrain your child from fooling, Education, hardy courage, point out to him the dangers to which it exposes him: to raise him above timorous cowardice, and inspire him with manly fortitude, accustom him from the earliest period of life to an acquaintance with such things as he is most likely to be afraid of: subject him now and then to pain, and expose him to danger; but let such trials be judiciously conducted.\n\nIdleness or curiosity sometimes leads children to cruelty in their treatment of such animals as are placed within their power. Dogs, cats, birds, and butterflies, often suffer from their inhumanity. But when they seem inclined to such cruelty, let them be carefully watched, and let every means be used to awake their hearts to generous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>. Allow them to keep tame birds, dogs, &c., only on condition of their using them with tenderness. Perhaps this unhappy disposition to cruelty is occasioned, or at least fostered, by people's laughing when they behold the impotent efforts of children to do mischief; and often going so far as even to encourage them in maltreating those creatures which are within their reach. We entertain them, too, with stories of fighting and battles; and represent characters distinguished for atrocious acts of inhumanity as great and illustrious. But let such practice be carefully refrained from, if you wish to inspire your child with generous and humane sentiments. Teach him gentleness and tenderness, not only to brute animals, but also to servants and companions.\n\nCuriosity is to be roused and cherished in the breast of the child: but by what means? Answer his inquiries readily: though his questions be put in awkward language, let not that hinder you from attending to the objects of them. Curiosity is natural to the human mind; and if you repress not the curiosity of the child, he will often be moved by its impulse to the pursuit of knowledge. Let him find his engenders in the pursuit of knowledge, a source of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLAUSE\">applause</a> and esteem. Avoid the folly of those who sport with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDULITY\">credulity</a> of children, by answering their questions in a ludicrous or deceitful manner.\n\nYou must, however, not only listen with obliging attention to his questions, and strive to gratify his curiosity; but even whenever he attempts to reason on such subjects as are offered to his observation, be careful to encourage him: praise him if he reasons with any degree of plausibility; even if he blunders, beware of ridiculing or laughing at him. With regard to the boy's playthings: while you indulge him freely in innocent diversions, give him such playthings as may be necessary in the amusements in which he engages, provided they be such as he cannot make himself; but it will be still better for him to exercise his dexterity and ingenuity in making them himself.\n\nAfter throwing out these things concerning the general principles on which education should be carried on, Mr Locke next proceeds to those particular parts of knowledge in which he thinks every young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> ought to be instructed. In virtue, wisdom, breeding, and learning, he comprehends all that is necessary to enable his pupil to act a respectable part in life.\n\nIn forming the boy to virtue, the first thing to be done is to inform him of the relation subsisting between human creatures and a supreme independent Being, their creator, preserver, and governor; and to teach him,\nEducation, that obedience and worship are due to that Being. But when you inform the child of the existence of an invisible Being, beware of impressing his mind with any notions concerning spirits or goblins, which may render him incapable of bearing darkness or solitude. In infancy our minds are, by the indiscrimination of those about us, generally impressed with such prejudices concerning a thousand frightful forms, ever ready to assail or haunt us under the shade of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, that we become incapable of manly fortitude during the course of life: the folder who will boldly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACE\">face</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>, shall perhaps tremble and take to flight at the rustling of a few leaves, or the grunting of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HOG\">hog</a> in the dark. But were the imaginations of children not crazed with wild stories concerning spirits and hobgoblins, darkness would be no more alarming to them than light. After informing the child of the existence of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>, and teaching him to pray to him; next labour to impress his mind with a veneration for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, and habituate him to a strict adherence to it on every occasion.

His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a>, who was eminent both for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> and skill in the languages, treated him with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> kindness; but about the middle of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPRENTICESHIP\">apprenticeship</a>, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a> happened which totally put a stop to the hopes of young Edwards's advancing himself in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of trade. Dr Nicolas, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> in the physical world, and a relation of his master's, happened to die. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a>'s books were removed to an apartment occupied by Edwards, who eagerly employed all his leisure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, both in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> and great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, in perusing those which treated of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SCULPTURE\">sculpture</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASTRONOMY\">astronomy</a>, and antiquities. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> of these books entirely deprived him of any inclination for mercantile business he might have formerly had, and he resolved to travel into foreign countries. In 1716, he visited most of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> towns in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, and in about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> returned to England. Two years after, he took a voyage to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWAY\">Norway</a>, at the invitation of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> who was disposed to be his friend, and who was nephew to the master of the ship in which he embarked. At this time <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> XII. was besieging Fredericksburg; by which means our young naturalist was hindered from making such excursions into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> as otherwise he would have done, for the Swedes were very careful to confine such strangers as could not give\ngive a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of themselves. But notwithstanding all his precaution, he was confined by the Danish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a>, who supposed him to be a spy employed by the enemy to get intelligence of their designs. However, by obtaining testimonials of his innocence, a release was granted. In 1718 he returned to England, and next year visited <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> by the way of Dieppe. During his stay in this country he made two journeys of 100 miles each; the first to Chalons in Champagne, in May 1720; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> on foot, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORLEANS\">Orleans</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLOIS\">Blois</a>; but an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDICT\">edict</a> happening at that time to be issued for securing vagrants, in order to transport them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMERICA\">America</a>, as the banks of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MISSISSIPPI\">Mississippi</a> wanted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a>; our author narrowly escaped a western voyage. On his arrival in England, Mr Edwards closely pursued his favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a> of natural history, applying himself to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> and colouring such animals as fell under his notice. A strict <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to natural, more than picturesque <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, claimed his earliest care; birds first engaged his particular attention; and having purchased some of the best pictures of these subjects, he was induced to make a few drawings of his own; which were admired by the curious, who encouraged our young naturalist to proceed, by paying a good price for his early labours. Among his first patrons and benefactors may be mentioned James Theobalds, Esq. of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAMBETH\">Lambeth</a>; a gentleman zealous for the promotion of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>. Our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol3.html#article-ARTIST\">artist</a>, thus unexpectedly encouraged, increased in skill and affluence; and procured, by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> to his favourite pursuit, a decent subsistence and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> acquaintance. However, he remitted his industry in 1731; when, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> with two of his relations, he made an excursion to Holland and Brabant, where he collected several scarce books and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol17.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a>, and had an opportunity of examining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> pictures of several great masters at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTWERP\">Antwerp</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRUSSELS\">Brussels</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UTRECHT\">Utrecht</a>, and other cities. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1733, by the recommendation of the great Sir Hans Sloane, Bart. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">College</a> of Physicians, he was chosen librarian, and had apartments in the college. This office was peculiarly agreeable to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and inclination, as he had the opportunity of a constant recourse to a valuable library, filled with scarce and curious books on the subject of natural history, which he studied assiduously. By degrees he became one of the most eminent ornithologists in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> any other country. His merit is so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> known in this respect, as to render any eulogium on his performances unnecessary; but it may be observed, that he never trusted to others what he could perform himself; and often found it so difficult to give satisfaction to his own mind, that he frequently made three or four drawings to delineate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> in its most lively character, attitude, and representation. In 1743, the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the History of Birds was published in quarto. His subscribers exceeding even his most sanguine expectations, a second volume appeared in 1747. The third volume was published in 1750. In 1751, the fourth volume came from the press. This volume being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> he intended to publish at that time, he seems to have considered it as the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> of his productions in natural history; and therefore devoutly offered it up to the great God of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, in humble <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> for all the good things he had received from him in this world. Our author, in 1758, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> his labours under a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>, viz. Gleanings of Natural History. A second volume of the Gleanings was published in 1760. The third part, which made the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a> and last volume of his works, appeared in 1764. Thus our author, after a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of years, the most studious application, and the most extensive correspondence to every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of the world, concluded a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> which contains engravings and descriptions of more than 600 subjects in natural history, not before described or delineated. He likewise added a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> index in French and English; which was afterwards perfected, with the Linnaean names, by that great naturalist Linnaeus himself, who frequently honoured him with his friendship and correspondence. Some time after Mr Edwards had been appointed library keeper to the Royal College of Physicians, he was, on St Andrew's day, in the year 1750, presented with an honorary compliment by the president and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of the Royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> medal, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DONATION\">donation</a> of Sir Godfrey Copley, Bart. annually given on that day to the author of any new discovery in art or nature, in consideration of his natural history <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> then completed. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of this medal he had afterwards engraved, and placed under the title in the first volume of his history. He was a few years afterwards elected fellow of the Royal Society, and of the Society of Antiquaries, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>; and also a member of many of the academies of sciences and learning in different parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. In compliment to these honorary distinctions from such learned bodies, he presented elegant coloured copies of all his works to the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal Society, and Society of Antiquarians, and to the British <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">museum</a>; also to the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, from whom he received the most polite and obliging <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> of thanks by their then secretary Monsieur Detouchy. His collection of drawings, which amounted to upwards of 900, were purchased by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Bute. They contain a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of British as well as foreign birds, and other animals hitherto not accurately delineated or described. After the publication of the last work, being arrived at his 70th year, he found his sight begin to fail, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> lost its wonted steadiness. He retired from public employment to a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> which he purchased at Plaistow; previous to which, he dispensed of all the copies, as well as plates, of his works. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> of a few select friends, and the perusal of a few select books, were the amusement of the evening of his life; and now and then he made an excursion to some of the principal cities in England, particularly to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRISTOL\">Bristol</a>, Bath, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXETER\">Exeter</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWICH\">Norwich</a>. Some years before his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>, the alarming depredation of a cancer, which baffled all the efforts of medical skill, deprived him of the sight of one of his eyes; he also suffered much from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, to which at different periods of his life he had been subject. But in the feverish paroxysms of pain, he was scarcely known to utter a single complaint. Having completed his 80th year, emaciated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> and sickness, he died, deservedly lamented, on the 23rd of July 1773.","sp":192,"ep":193},{"h":"EDYSTONE","t":"a lighthouse in the British channel, built <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> rocks of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a>, which are supposed to have got this appellation from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> variety of contrary sets of the current among them, both upon the tide of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a> and the tide of ebb.

He had at his house at Littlebury a set of contrivances, such as the following:\u2014Being taken into one particular room of his house, and there observing an old flipper carelessly lying on the middle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>,\u2014if, as was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a>, you gave it a kick with your foot, up started a ghost before you: If you sat down in a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol5.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a>, a couple of arms would immediately clasp you in, so as to render it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to disentangle yourself till your attendant set you at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>: And if you sat down in a certain arbour by the side of a canal, you was forthwith sent out afloat to the middle of the canal, from whence it was impossible for you to escape till the manager returned you to your former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>.\u2014Whether those things were thrown to strangers at his house for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, or were done by way of amusement to those that came to visit the place, is uncertain; as Mr Winstanley is said to have been a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>: but it is at least certain, that he established a place of public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> at Hyde <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PARK\">park</a> corner, called Winstanley's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WATER_WORKS\">water-works</a>; which were thrown at stated times at one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SHILLING\">shilling</a> each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>. The particulars of those water-works are not now known; but, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> of the times, we must naturally suppose a great variety of jets d'eau, &c. (a).\n\n\"The lighthouse Mr Winstanley built was begun in the year 1696, and was more than four years in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>; not, (says the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a>), for the greatness of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, but for the difficulty and danger in getting backwards and forwards to the place. The difficulties were many, and the dangers not less. At length, in the third year, all the work was raised, which to the vane was eighty feet. Being all finished, with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LANTERN\">lantern</a>, and all the rooms that were in it, they ventured to lodge there soon after midsummer, for the greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISPATCH\">dispatch</a> of the work. But the first night the weather came bad, and so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, that it was eleven days before any boats could come near them again, and not being acquainted with the height of the sea rising, they were almost all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> drowned with wet, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> in as bad a condition, though they worked night and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> to make shelter for themselves. In this storm they lost some of their materials, although they did what they could to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> them; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOAT\">boat</a> then returning, they all left the house to be refreshed on shore; and as soon as the weather permitted, they returned again and finished all, and put up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> on the 14th of November 1698; which being so late in the year, it was three days before Christmas before they had relief to get on shore again, and were almost at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> extremity for want of provisions; but by good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">providence</a>, then two boats came with provisions, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> that was to take care of the light.\n\n\"The fourth year, finding in the winter the effects the sea had upon the house, and burying the lantern at times, although more than 60 feet high; Mr Winstanley early in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> encompassed the building with a new work of four feet thickness from the foundation, making all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> near 20 feet high; and taking down the upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the first building, and enlarging every part in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a>, he raised it forty feet higher than it was at first; and yet the sea, in time of storms, flew up in appearance 100 feet (b) above the vane; and at times covered half the side of the house and the lantern as if they were under water.\n\n\"On the finishing this building, it was generally said, that in the time of hard weather, such was the height of\n\n(a) It appears that the exhibition of these water-works continued some years after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Mr Winstanley, as they were existing in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> 1709, being mentioned in the Tatler of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>.\n\n(b) Mr Smeaton says this is short of its real height 50 feet.\nof the seas, that it was very possible for a six-oared boat to be lifted up upon a wave, and driven through the open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GALLERY\">gallery</a> of the lighthouse.\n\n\"In November 1703, the fabric wanted some repairs, and Mr Winstanley went down to Plymouth to superintend the performance of them. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of the common people was, that the building would not be of long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>. Mr Winstanley, however, held different sentiments. Being amongst his friends previous to his going off with his workmen on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of those reparations, the danger was intimated to him; and it was said, that one day or other the lighthouse would certainly be overflown. To this he replied, 'He was so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> assured of the strength of his building, he should only wish to be there in the greatest storm that ever blew under the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the heavens, that he might see what effect it would have upon the structure.'\n\n\"In this wish he was soon gratified; for while he was there with his workmen and light-keepers, that dreadful storm began which raged the most violently upon the 26th November 1703, in the night; and of all the accounts of the kind which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> furnishes as with, we have none that has exceeded this in Great Britain, or was more injurious or extensive in its devastation.\n\n\"The next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, when the storm was abated, nothing of the lighthouse was to be seen. The following account of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> was printed at the time, by Daniel Defoe in a book entitled *The Storm*.\"\n\n\"The loss of the lighthouse called the Edystone, at Plymouth, is another article of which we never heard any particulars, other than this, that at night it was standing, and in the morning all the upper part of the gallery was blown down, and all the people in it perished, and, by a particular misfortune, Mr Winstanley the contriver of it; a person whose loss is very much regretted by such as knew him, as a very useful man to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. The loss of that lighthouse is also a considerable damage, as it is very doubtful whether it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> ever be attempted again; and it was a great security to the sailors, many a good ship having been lost there in former times.\n\n\"It was very remarkable, that as we are informed, at the same time the lighthouse aforesaid was blown down, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> of it in Mr Winstanley's house at Littlebury in Essex, above 200 miles from the lighthouse, fell down and was broke to pieces.\n\n\"At Plymouth they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> a full proportion of the storm in its utmost fury. The Edystone has been already mentioned; but it was a double loss, in that the lighthouse had not been long down when the Winchelsea, a homeward-bound <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGINIA\">Virginia</a>-man, was split upon the rock where that building stood, and most of her men drowned.\"\n\n\"The great utility of Mr Winstanley's lighthouse had been sufficiently evident to those for whose use it was erected; and the loss of the Winchelsea Virginia-man, before-mentioned, proved a powerful incentive to such as were interested, to exert themselves in order for its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">restoration</a>. It was not, however, begun too soon as might have been expected. In spring of the year 1706, an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARLIAMENT\">parliament</a> passed enabling the Trinity house to rebuild, but it was no earlier than July that it was begun. The undertaker was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Lovell or Lovett, who took it for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of ninety <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> years, commencing from the day that a light should be exhibited.\n\n\"To enable him to fulfil his undertaking, Captain Lovett engaged Mr John Rudyerd to be his engineer or architect; and his choice, though Mr Rudyerd does not appear to have been bred to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> buildings or scientific profession, was not ill made. He at that time kept a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>-draper's shop upon Ludgate-hill. His want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, however, was in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> assisted by Mr Smith and Mr Notcutt, both shipwrights from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-YARD\">yard</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOLWICH\">Woolwich</a>, who worked with him the whole time he was building the lighthouse.\n\n\"It is not very material in what way this gentleman became qualified for the execution of the work: it is sufficient that he directed the performance thereof in a masterly manner, and so perfectly to answer the end for which it was intended. He <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the errors in the former building, and avoided them: instead of a polygon, he chose a circle for the outline of his building, and carried up the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> in that form. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> aim appears to have been use and simplicity; and indeed, in a building so situated, the former could hardly be acquired in its full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> without the latter. He seems to have adopted <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> the very reverse of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREDECESSOR\">predecessor</a>; for all the unwieldy ornaments at top, the open gallery, the projecting cranes, and other contrivances, more for ornament and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> than use, Mr Rudyerd laid totally aside: he saw, that how beautiful those ornaments might be in themselves, yet when they are improperly applied, and out of place, they shew a bad taste, and betray <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of its first principle, judgment.\n\n\"The building was begun in July 1706, a light was put up in it the 28th July 1708, and it was completely finished in 1709. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of materials expended in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>, was 500 tons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>, 1200 tons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIMBER\">timber</a>, 80 tons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, and 35 tons of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>; of timbers, screws, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACK\">rack</a>-bolts 2500 each.\n\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOUIS\">Louis</a> XIV. being at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with England during the proceeding with this building, a French privateer took the men at work upon it, together with their tools, and carried them to France; and the captain was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPECTATION\">expectation</a> of a reward for the achievement. While the captives lay in prison, the transaction reached the ears of that monarch. He immediately ordered them to be released, and the captors to be put in their place; declaring, that though he was at war with England, he was not at war with mankind; he therefore directed the men to be sent back to their work with presents; observing, that the Edystone light-house was so situated, as to be of equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> to all nations having occasion to navigate the channel that divides France from England.\n\n\"In the year 1715 Captain Lovett being dead, his property in the Edystone lighthouse was sold before a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHANCERY\">chancery</a> to Robert Welton, Esq.; Noyes, Esq. of Gray's-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INN\">Inn</a>; and \u2014\u2014 Cheetham, Esq., an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALDERMAN\">alderman</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUBLIN\">Dublin</a>, who divided the same into eight shares. After a few years some repairs were found wanting; and in 1723, Mr Rudyerd being, we suppose, then dead, Mr John <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, foreman shipwright in the dockyard at Plymouth, became overseer and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTOR\">director</a> of the necessary reparations; which office he again executed in 1734.\"\n\"The catastrophe of this lighthouse took place on the 21st <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1755, when the light-keeper upon watch, about two o'clock in the morning, went into the lantern as usual to sniff the candles; he found the whole in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>; and upon opening the door of the lantern into the balcony, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> instantly burst from the inside of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUPOLA\">cupola</a>: he immediately endeavoured to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a> his companions; but they being in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BED\">bed</a>, and asleep, were not ready in coming to his assistance as the occasion required. As there were always some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> buckets kept in the house, and a tub of water in the lantern, he attempted to extinguish the fire by throwing water from the balcony upon the outside cover of lead. By this time his companions arriving, he encouraged them to fetch up water with the buckets from the sea; but the height of the place, added to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFLAGRATION\">conflagration</a> which must attend such an unexpected event, rendered their efforts fruitless. The flames gathered strength every moment; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> man with every exertion, having the water to throw four yards higher than himself, found himself unable to stop the progress of the conflagration, and was obliged to desist.\n\n\"As he was looking upward with the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> to see the effect of the water thrown, a position which, phsyognomists tell us, occasions the mouth naturally to be a little open, a quantity of lead dissolved by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the flames suddenly rushed like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a> from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a>, and fell upon his head, face, and shoulders, and burnt him in a dreadful manner: from this moment he had a violent internal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>, and imagined that a quantity of this lead had passed his throat, and got into his body. Under this violence of pain and anxiety, as every attempt had proved ineffectual, and the rage of the flames was increasing, it is not to be wondered that the terror and dismay of the three men increased in proportion; so that they all found themselves intimidated, and glad to make their retreat from the immediate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> of horror into one of the rooms below. They therefore defended as the fire approached, with no other prospect than that of securing their immediate safety, with scarcely any hopes of being saved from destruction.\n\n\"How soon the flames were seen on the shore is uncertain; but early in the morning they were perceived by some of the Cawsand fishermen, and intelligence thereof given to Mr Edwards, of Rame, in that neighbourhood, a gentleman of some fortune, and more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>, who immediately sent out a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a>-boat and men to the relief of the distressed objects in the lighthouse (d).\n\n\"The boat and men got thither about ten o'clock, after the fire had been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> full eight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>; in which time the three light-keepers were not only driven from all the rooms and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAIRCASE\">staircase</a>, but, to avoid the falling of the timber and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>-hot bolts, &c. upon them, they were found fitting in the hole or cave on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> side of the rock under the iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LADDER\">ladder</a>, almost in a state of stupification; it being then low water.\n\n\"With much difficulty they were taken off; when finding it impossible to do any further service, they hastened to Plymouth. No sooner were they let on shore, than one of the men ran away, and was never afterwards heard of. This circumstance, though it might lead to suspicions unfavourable to the man, Mr Smeaton is of opinion ought not to weigh anything against him, as he supposes it to have arisen from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PANIC\">panic</a> which sometimes seizes weak minds, and prevents their acting agreeable to the dictates of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>.\n\n\"It was not long before the dreadful news arrived at Plymouth. Alderman Tolcher and his son immediately went to sea, but found it impossible to do anything with effect. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRAL\">Admiral</a> West also, who then lay in Plymouth sound, sent a flotilla properly armed, with a boat and an engine therein, which also carried out Mr Jessop the surveyor. This vessel arrived early in the day. Many attempts were made to play the engine, but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a> of the sea prevented it from being employed with success. On the succeeding days the fire still continued, and about the 7th the destruction of the whole was completed.\n\n\"The man who has been mentioned already was named Henry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a>, of Stonehouse, near Plymouth, and though aged 94 years, being of a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a>, was remarkably <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a>, considering his time of life. He invariably told the surgeon who attended him, Mr Spry (now Dr Spry) of Plymouth, that if he would do anything effectual to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a>, he must relieve his stomach from the lead which he was sure was within him; and this he not only told Dr Spry, but all those about him, though in a very hoarse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>, and the same attention he made to Mr Jessop.\u2014The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> of the afflicting, however, then incredible to Dr Spry, who could scarcely suppose it possible that any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> being could exist after receiving melted lead into the stomach; much less that he should afterwards be able to bear towing through the sea from the rock, and also the fatigue and inconvenience from the length of time he was in getting on shore before any remedies could be applied. The man, however, did not show any symptoms of being much worse or better until the fifth day after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a>, when he was thought to mend: he constantly took his medicines, and swallowed many things both liquid and solid, till the tenth or eleventh day; after which he suddenly grew worse; and on the twelfth, being seized with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> sweats and spasms, he soon after expired.\n\n\"His body was opened by Dr Spry, and in the stomach was found a solid piece of lead of a flat oval form, which weighed 7 ounces and 5 drachms. So <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> a circumstance appearing to deserve the notice of the philosophical world, an account of it was sent to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>, and printed in the 49th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of their transactions, p. 477.\n\n\"The Lighthouse being thus demolished, the proprietors immediately turned their thoughts to the rebuilding of it. They had in it a term of near half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, but some shares being settled by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> of one of the parties, some impediments arose which could not be overcome without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> of parliament, which was soon obtained. To one of the partners, Robert Weston, Esq. the management of the business was committed,\n\n(d) This benevolent gentleman caught a cold on this occasion which cost him his life.\ncommitted, and he thought it requisite to apply to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Macclesfield, then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> of the Royal Society, to recommend a proper person to superintend the work. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of his visit, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Macclesfield told him, that there was one of the Royal Society whom he would venture to recommend to the business; yet that the most material part of what he knew of him was, his having within the compass of the last seven years recommended himself to the Society by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> of several mechanical inventions and improvements; and though he had at first made it his business to execute things in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> way (without having been bred to the trade) yet on account of the merit of his performances, he had been chosen a member of the Society, and that for about three years past, having found the business of a philosophical instrument-maker not likely to afford an adequate recompence, he had wholly applied himself to such branches of mechanics as were wanted by the proprietors; that he was then somewhere in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> of England, executing a work: and that as he had always satisfied his employers, he would not be likely to undertake what he could not perform.\n\n\"The person thus described was Mr Smeaton, who was written to by Mr Benjamin Wilson the painter, laconically informing him, that he was the person fixed upon to rebuild the Edystone lighthouse. But this intimation conveying to his mind no more than a mere notice that he might, in common with others, deliver in proposals to repair it, not knowing then that it was entirely destroyed, it afforded but little satisfaction, and he returned only a cool answer. Mr Wilson's reply was still more laconic: That the demolition was total, and that as Nathan said unto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a>, 'Thou art the man.'\n\n\"Mr Smeaton immediately divested himself of his engagements in the north, and arrived in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> the 23rd of February 1756, and had an interview next day with the principal proprietor. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of rebuilding then became the subject of their deliberations, which at length ended in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> to rebuild it with stone.\n\n\"On the 5th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> Mr Smeaton first set his foot on the Edystone rock. He immediately began to take his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> for proceeding on the work. He made all the necessary inquiries on the spot, and in the neighbourhood. He considered the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the stone proper to be used, and from whence it might be obtained at the best and cheapest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATES\">rates</a>. He visited the quarries at Beare in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEVONSHIRE\">Devonshire</a>, and the Isle of Portland, and from the latter of these places he at length determined to be supplied with his materials.\n\n\"Having proceeded thus far, he returned to London, and had a meeting with the proprietors, who, for reasons highly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> to them, confirmed their determination to rebuild with stone. He accordingly prepared his models and designs, which were approved by his employers, and directed to be exhibited to the lords of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRALTY\">Admiralty</a>, and the masters of the Trinity house. To the former they were shewn; but the latter having fixed their time for viewing them at so distant a day as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAZARD\">hazard</a> the progress of the work, he determined to set off for Plymouth without their inspection.\n\n\"He arrived at Plymouth the 23rd of July, 1756, and immediately began his operations. He appointed his assistants, hired his men, settled their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a>, and drew up rules for their conduct. He also hired a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> for a work-yard. On the 3rd of August they went off to the rock, and continued to work as long as the weather would permit. The next winter Mr Smeaton determined to continue at Plymouth, to go through a course of experiments on cements. On the 3rd of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> 1757, the works were resumed, and on the 12th the first stone was fixed. From this time the erection proceeded with regularity and dispatch, and with no other interruptions than what might be expected from the nature of the work, until the 9th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a> 1759, when, after innumerable difficulties and dangers, a happy event was put to the undertaking, without the loss of life or limb to any one concerned in it, or accident by which the work could be said to be materially retarded.\n\n\"It now remained only to wait for a storm to try the durability of the building. The hard weather of 1759, 1760, and 1761, appeared to make no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a>. The year 1762 was ushered in by a tempest of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a>, the rage of which was so great, that one of those who had been used to predict its downfall was heard to say, \"If the Edystone lighthouse is now standing, it will stand to the day of judgment;\" and in reality, from this time its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> has been so entirely laid out of men's minds, that whatever storms have happened since, no inquiry has ever been made concerning it. So confident was a very intelligent friend of Mr Smeaton's of its durability, that he wrote to him, that he might for ever rid himself of any uneasy thought of the house as to its danger from wind and sea.\n\n\"The lighthouse is attended by three men, who receive \u00a35l. a-year each, with an occasional absence in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>. Formerly there were only two, who watched alternately four hours and four hours; but one being taken ill and dying, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of an additional <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a>. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DILEMMA\">dilemma</a>, the living man found himself in an awkward situation. Being apprehensive if he tumbled the dead body into the sea, which was the only way in his power to dispose of it, he might be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a>, he was induced for some time to let the dead body lie, in hopes that the boat might be able to land, and relieve him from the distress he was in. By degrees the body became offensive, that it was not in his power to get quit of it without help; for it was near a month before the attending boat could effect a landing; and then it was not without the greatest difficulty that it could be done, when they did land. To such a degree was the whole building filled with the stench of the corpse, that it was all they could do to get the dead body disposed of and thrown into the sea, and it was some time after that before the rooms could be freed from the noisome stench that was left.\n\n\"It is said, that while two light-keepers only were employed, on some difficulty they forbore to speak to each other. A person observing to one of them how happy they might live in their state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RETIREMENT\">retirement</a>, \"Yes,\" says the man, \"very comfortably, if we could have the use of our tongues; but it is now a full month since my partner and I have spoke to each other.\"\n\n\"To these anecdotes we shall add one more, and con-\nclude. A shoemaker was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> out to the lighthoufe in order to be light-keeper. In their way, says the skipper to him, \"How happens it, friend <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACOB\">Jacob</a>, that you should choose to go out to be a light-keeper, when you can on shore (as I am told) earn half-a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> and three shillings a-day in making leather hose (leather pipes so called); whereas the light-keeper's salary is but \u00a31 a-year, which is scarce ten shillings a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>.\" Says the shoemaker, \"I go to be a light-keeper, because I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DON\">don</a>'t like confinement.\" After this answer had produced its share of merriment, he at last explained himself by saying, that he did not like to be confined to work.\n\n\"The whole time between the first stroke upon the rock and leaving the lighthouse complete, was three years nine weeks and three days; from the 5th of December 1755, to exhibiting the light October 1759, was three years ten months and fifteen days; and the whole time of working on the rock 111 days 10 hours\" (e).\n\n**EEL.** See Mur\u00e6na, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ICHTHYOLOGY\">Ichthyology</a> Index.\n\n**Eel-Fishing.** See Bobbing and Sniggling.\n\nThe silver eel may be caught with several sorts of baits, as powdered beef, garden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>, minnows, hens' guts, fish garbage, &c.

In new laid eggs this follicle appears very little, but becomes larger when the egg is kept.\n\nWithin this are contained the albumen or white, and the vitellus or yolk; each of which have their different virtues.\n\nThe albumen is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, viscid, white liquor in the egg, different in consistence in its different parts. It is observed, that there are two distinct albumens, each of which is enclosed in its proper membrane. Of these one is very thin and liquid; the other is more dense and viscous, and of a somewhat whiter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>; but, in old and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STALE\">stale</a> eggs, after some days <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUBATION\">incubation</a>, inclining to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>. As this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> albumen covers the yolk <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> all sides, so it is itself surrounded by the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> liquid. The albumen of a fecundated egg is as sweet and free from corruption, during all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of incubation, as it is in new laid eggs; as is also the vitellus. As the eggs of hens consist of two liquors separated one from another, and distinguished by two branches of umbilical veins, one of which goes to the vitellus, and the other to the albumen; so it is very probable that they are of different natures, and consequently appointed for different purposes.\n\nWhen the vitellus grows warm with incubation, it becomes more humid, and like melting wax or fat; whence it takes up more space. For as the fetus increases, the albumen insensibly wastes away and condenses; the vitellus, on the contrary, seems to lose little or nothing of its bulk when the fetus is perfected, and only appears more liquid and humid when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABDOMEN\">abdomen</a> of the fetus begins to be formed.\n\nThe chick in the egg is first nourished by the albumen; and when this is consumed, by the vitellus, as with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>. If we compare the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHALAZA\">chalaza</a> to the extremities of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a> passing through the vitellus, which is of a spherical form, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> be composed of two unequal portions, its axis not passing through its centre; consequently, since it is heavier than the white, its smaller portion must always be uppermost in all positions of the egg.\n\nThe yellowish white round spot, called cicatricula, is placed on the middle of the smaller portion of the yolk; and therefore, from what has been said in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PARAGRAPH\">paragraph</a>, must always appear on the superior part of the vitellus.\n\nNot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCLUSION\">exclusion</a> of the chick, the whole yolk is taken into its abdomen; and the shell, at the obtuse end of the egg, frequently appears cracked some time before the exclusion of the chick. The chick is sometimes observed to perforate the shell with its\nits beak. After exclusion, the yolk is gradually wasted, being conveyed into the small guts by a small duct.\n\nEggs differ very much according to the birds that lay them, as to their colour, form, bigness, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>, and the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of dressing them: those most used in food are hens eggs; of which, such as are new laid are best.\n\nAs to the preservation of eggs, it is observed that the egg is always quite full when it is first laid by the hen; but from that time it gradually becomes less and less so, to its decay: and however <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPACT\">compact</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> its shell may appear, it is nevertheless perforated with a multitude of small holes, though too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> for the discernment of our eyes, the effect of which is a daily decrease of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> within the egg, from the time of its being laid; and the perspiration is much quicker in hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> than in cold.\n\nTo preserve the egg fresh, there needs no more than to preserve it full, and stop its transpiration; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of doing which is, by stopping up those pores with matter which is not soluble in watery fluids: and on this principle it is, that all kinds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a>, prepared with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of wine, will preserve eggs fresh for a long time, if they are carefully rubbed all over the shell: tallow, or mutton fat, is also good for this purpose; for such as are rubbed over with this, will keep as long as those coated over with varnish.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">Artificial</a> Method of Hatching Eggs.

In scripture, we find it most generally named Mizraim; though in the Psalms it is styled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a> of Ham.\u2014To us it is best known by the name Egypt, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETYMOLOGY\">etymology</a> of which is more uncertain.\u2014Some derive it from Aegyptus, a supposed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a> of the country: others say it signifies no more than \"the land of the Copts;\" Aia in Greek signifying a country, and Aicoptos being easily softened into Aegyptus.\u2014The most probable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, however, seems to be, that it received its name from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACKNESS\">blackness</a> of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a>, and the dark <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> both of its river and inhabitants; for such a blackish colour is by the Greeks called aegyptios from aepys, and aegyps \"a vulture;\" and by the Latins, fulvuslurius. For the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, other names of a similar import have been given to this country by the Greeks; such as Aeria and Melambolus; the river itself was called Melo or Melas; by the Hebrews, Shiloh; and by the Europeans, Siris; all of which signify \"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>.\"\n\nAncient Egypt is by some divided into two parts, the Upper and Lower Egypt: by others into three, the Upper Egypt, properly so called, or Thebais; the Middle Egypt, or Heptanomes; and the Lower Egypt, the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of which was the Delta, or that space encompassed by the branches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a>. See THEBAIS, &c.\n\nThe Egyptians, like the Chinese, pretend to an extensive antiquity, pretending to have records for ten, twenty, or even fifty thousand years. Thus their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> is so much involved in obscurity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a>, that for many ages it must be passed over in silence.\u2014The first mortal king whom the Egyptians own to have reigned in that country, was Menes or Memar. At what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> he reigned, it would be to a very little purpose to inquire. He had been preceded, however, by a set of immortals, who it seems left him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> in a very bad situation: for the whole country, except Thebais, was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORASS\">morass</a>; the people also were entirely destitute of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>, and every kind of knowledge which could render their life comfortable and happy. Menes diverted the course of the Nile, which before that time had washed the foot of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> mountain near the borders of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBYA\">Libya</a>, built the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMPHIS\">Memphis</a>, instructed his subjects, and did other things of a similar kind which are usually attributed to the founders of kingdoms.\n\nFrom the time of Menes, the Egyptian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRONOLOGY\">chronology</a> is filled with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIST\">list</a> of 330 kings, who reigned 1500000 years, but did nothing worthy of notice.\u2014The first distinct piece of history we find concerning Egypt, is\nthe irruption of the Shepherds, by whom the country was subdued; but whether this revolution happened during the vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of indolence above mentioned, or before or after, cannot be known. The affair is thus related by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANETHO\">Manetho</a>. It happened, in the reign of Timaus king of Egypt, that God being displeased with the Egyptians, they suffered a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> revolution: for a multitude of men, ignoble in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>, took courage, and, pouring from the east into Egypt, made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a> with the inhabitants; who submitted to them without resistance. The shepherds, however, behaved with the greatest cruelty; burnt the cities, threw <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the temples of the gods; and put to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> the inhabitants, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> the women and children into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVITY\">captivity</a>. This people came from Arabia, and were called Hyksos, or king-of-shepherds. They held Egypt in subjection for 259 years; at the end of which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a>, they were obliged by a king of Upper Egypt, named Amosis, or Thothmes, to leave the country. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCE\">prince</a>'s father had, it seems, gained great advantages over them, and flung them up in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> called Avaris, or Avaris, containing 10,000 acres of land. Here they were closely besieged by Amosis, with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> of 400,000 men; but at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> the king, finding himself unable to reduce them by force, proposed an agreement, which was readily accepted. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of this agreement, the shepherds withdrew from Egypt with their families, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of 240,000; and, taking the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a>, entered <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>: but fearing the Assyrians, who were then very powerful, and masters of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, they entered the land of Judaea; and built there a city capable of holding so great a multitude, and called it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a>.\n\nAccording to Mr Bruce, the shepherds who invaded Egypt were no other than the inhabitants of Barabra. They were, he says, carriers to the Cuthites who lived farther to the south. The latter had built the many stately temples in Thebes and other cities of Egypt; though, according to him, they had no dwelling places but holes or caves in the rocks. Being a commercial people, they remained at home collecting and preparing their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a>, which were dispersed by the barabers or shepherds already mentioned. These, from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> of their employment, lived in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> habitations, as the Tartars do at this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>. By the Hebrews, he tells us, they were called phut, but shepherds by every other people; and from the name baraber, the word Barabra is derived. By their employment, which was the dispersing the Arabian and African goods all over the continent, they had become a great and powerful people; and from their opposite dispositions and manners, became very frequently enemies to the Egyptians. To one Salatis our author ascribes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of Thebes in Upper Egypt, so much celebrated by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a> for its magnificence. But this certainly cannot be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>; for Homer wrote <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> after the time of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOSEPH\">Joseph</a>: and we find that even then the Egyptians had the shepherds in abhorrence, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> because they had been grievously oppressed by them. Mr Bruce counts three invasions of these people; the first that of Salatis already mentioned, who overthrew the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-DYNASTY\">dynasty</a> of Egyptian kings from Menes, and destroyed Thebes; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> was that of Sabaco or So; for according to him this was not the name of a single prince, but of a people, and figured as shepherds; and the third, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a> of Memphis, where 240,000 of them were besieged as above mentioned. But accounts of this kind are evidently inconsistent in the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>; for how is it possible that the third invasion, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ANTECEDENT\">antecedent</a> to the building of Jerusalem, could be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POSTERIOR\">posterior</a> to the second, if the latter happened only in the days of Hezekiah?\n\nIn these early ages, however, it would seem that the kingdom of Egypt had been very powerful and its dominion very widely extended; since we find it said, that the Ba'rians revolted from Olymndyas, another Egyptian king of very high antiquity, and of whose wealth the most marvellous accounts are given.\n\nAfter an unknown interval of time from this monarch, reigned Sefotris. He was the first great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a> whose conquests are recorded with any degree of distinctness. In what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of the world he lived, is uncertain. Some chronologers, among whom is Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton, are of opinion, that he is the Sefac or Shihak, who took Jerusalem in the reign of Rehoboam the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLOMON\">Solomon</a>. Others, however, place him much earlier; and Mr Whitton <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> have him to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHARAOH\">Pharaoh</a> who refused to part with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISRAELITES\">Israelites</a>, and was at last drowned in the Red sea. Mr Bryant endeavours to prove that no such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> ever existed; but that in his history as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as that of many ancient heroes, we have an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol2.html#article-ABRIDGMENT\">abridgment</a> of that of the Cuthites or Babylonians, who spread themselves over great part of the then known world, and everywhere brought the people in subjection to them. His reign is reckoned the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> part of the Egyptian history; and the following seems to be the least <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol8.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> that can be got of it. The father of Sefotris was told in a dream, by the god <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VULCAN\">Vulcan</a>, that his son, who was then newly born, or perhaps still unborn, should be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> of the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>. His father, upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> of this vision, got together all the males in the land of Egypt that were born on the same day with Sefotris; appointed nurses and proper persons to take care of them, and had them treated like his own child; being persuaded that they who had been the constant companions of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a> would prove the most faithful ministers and soldiers. As they grew up, they were inured to laborious exercises; and, in particular, were never permitted to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> any food till they had performed a course of 180 furlongs, upwards of 22 of our miles. When the old king imagined they were sufficiently educated in the martial way he designed them to follow, they were sent by way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> of their abilities against the Arabians. In this expedition Sefotris proved successful, and in the end subdued that people who had never before been conquered. He was sent to the westward, and conquered the greatest part of Africa; nor could he be stopped in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CAREER\">career</a> till he arrived at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATLANTIC_OCEAN\">Atlantic <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>. Whilst he was on this expedition, his father died; and then Sefotris resolved to fulfil the prediction of Vulcan, by actually conquering the whole world. As he knew that this must take up a long time, he prepared for his journey in the best manner possible. The kingdom he divided into 36 provinces, and endeavoured to secure the affections of the people by gifts both of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> and land. He forgave all who had been guilty of offences, and discharged the debts of all his soldiers. He then constituted his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROTHER\">brother</a> Armah\nthe supreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGENT\">regent</a>; but forbade him to use the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DIADEM\">diadem</a>, and commanded him to offer no injury to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> or her children, and to abstain from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> concubines. His army consisted of 600,000 foot, 24,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, and 27,000 chariots. Besides these land forces, he had at sea two mighty fleets; one, according to Diodorus, of 400 sail. Of these fleets, one was designed to make conquests in the west, and the other in the east; and therefore the one was built on the Mediterranean and the other on the Red Sea. The first of these conquered Cyprus, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of Phoenicia, and several of the islands called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-CYCLADES\">Cyclades</a>; the other conquered all the coasts of the Red Sea; but its progress was stopped by shoals and difficult places which the navigators could not pass, so that he seems not to have made many conquests by sea.\n\nWith the land forces <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SESOSTRIS\">Sesostris</a> marched against the Ethiopians and Troglodytes; whom he overcame, and obliged them to pay him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUTE\">tribute</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EBONY\">ebony</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-IVORY\">ivory</a>. From thence he proceeded as far as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMONTORY\">promontory</a> of Diru, which lay near the straits of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BABELMANDEL\">Babelmandel</a>, where he set up a pillar with an inscription in sacred characters. He then marched on to the country where <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CINNAMON\">cinnamon</a> grows, or at least to some country where cinnamon at that time was brought, probably some place in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>; and here he in like manner set up <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILLARS\">pillars</a>, which were to be seen for many ages after. As to his farther conquests, it is agreed by almost all authors of antiquity, that he overran and pillaged the whole continent of Asia, and some part of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. He crossed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-GANGES\">Ganges</a>, and erected pillars on its banks; and from thence he is said to have marched eastward to the very extremity of the Asiatic continent. Returning from thence, he invaded the Scythians and Thracians; but all authors do not agree that he conquered them. Some even affirm, that he was overthrown by them with great slaughter, and obliged to abandon a great part of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOOTY\">booty</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> stores. But whether he had good or bad success in these parts, it is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> opinion that he settled a colony in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLCHIS\">Colchis</a>. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a>, however, who gives the most particular account of the conquests of this monarch, does not say whether the colony was desirably planted by Sesostris: or whether part of his army loitered behind the rest, and took up their residence in that region. From his own knowledge, he affirms, that the inhabitants of that country were undoubtedly of Egyptian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>. This was evident from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> resemblance they bore to the Egyptians, who were swarthy complexioned and frizzle haired; but more especially from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFORMITY\">conformity</a> of their customs, particularly circumcision.\n\nThe utmost boundary of this mighty monarch's conquests, however, was in the country of Thrace; for beyond this country his pillars were nowhere to be seen. These pillars he was accustomed to set up in every country which he conquered, with the following inscription, or one to the same purpose: \"Sesostris, kings of kings, and lord of lords, subdued this country by the power of his arms.\" Besides these, he left also statues of himself; two of which, according to Herodotus, were to be seen in his time; the one on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> between Ephesus and Phocaea, and the other between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMYRNA\">Smyrna</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SARDIS\">Sardis</a>: they were armed after the Ethiopian and Egyptian manner; holding a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JAVELIN\">javelin</a> in one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> and a bow in the other. Across the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> they had a line drawn from one shoulder to the other, with the following inscription: \"This region I obtained by these my shoulders.\" They were mistaken for images of Memnon.\n\nThe reasons given by Sesostris for his returning into Egypt from Thrace, and thus leaving the conquest of Egypt, the world unfinished, were the want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> for his army, and the difficulty of the passes. Most probably, however, his return was hastened by the intelligence he received from the high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> of Egypt, concerning the rebellious proceedings of his brothers; who, encouraged by his long absence, had assumed the diadem, violated the queen, and also the royal concubines. On receiving this news, Sesostris hastened from Thrace; and at the end of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> years came to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PELUSIUM\">Pelusium</a> in Egypt, attended by an innumerable multitude of captives taken from many different nations, and loaded with the spoils of Asia. The treacherous brother met him at this city; and it is said, with very little probability, that Sesostris accepted of an invitation to an entertainment from him. At this he drank freely, together with the queen and the rest of the royal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>. During the continuance of the entertainment, Armais caused a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of dried reeds to be laid round the apartment where they were to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SLEEP\">sleep</a>; and as soon as they were retired to rest set fire to the reeds. Sesostris perceiving the danger he was in, and that his guards, overcharged with liquor, were incapable of afflicting him, rushed through the flames, and was followed by his wife and children. In thanksgiving for this wonderful deliverance, he made several donations to the gods, particularly to Vulcan the god of fire. He then took vengeance on his brother Armais, said to be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DANAUS\">Danaus</a> of the Greeks, who, being on this occasion driven out of Egypt, withdrew into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a>.\n\nSesostris now laid aside all thoughts of war, and applied himself wholly to such works as might tend to the public good, and his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> reputation. In order to prevent the incursions of the Syrians and Arabians, he fortified the east side of Egypt with a wall which ran from Pelusium through the desert to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HELIOPOLIS\">Heliopolis</a>, for 187\u00bd miles. He raised also an incredible number of vast and lofty mounts of earth, to which he removed such towns as had before been situated too low, in order to secure them from the inundations of the Nile. All the way from Memphis to the sea he dug canals which branched out from the Nile; and not only made an easier <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> between different places, but rendered the country in a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> impalpable to an enemy. He erected a temple in every city in Egypt, and dedicated it to the supreme <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">deity</a> of the place; but in the course of such a great undertaking as this necessarily must have been, he took care not to employ any of his Egyptian subjects. Thus he secured their affection, and employed the vast multitude of captives he had brought along with him; and to perpetuate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> of a transaction so remarkable, he caused to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSCRIBED\">inscribed</a> on all these temples, \"No one native laboured herein.\" In the city of Memphis, before the temple of Vulcan, he raised five gigantic statues, each of one store. Two of them were 30 cubits high, representing himself and his wife; the other four were 20 cubits each, and represented his\nfour sons. These he dedicated to Vulcan in memory of his above-mentioned deliverance. He raised also two obelisks of marble 120 cubits high, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> them with inscriptions, denoting the greatness of his power, his revenues, &c.\n\nThe captives taken by Sesostris are said to have been treated with the greatest barbarity; so that at last they resolved at all events to deliver themselves from a ferocity so intolerable. The Babylonians particularly were concerned in this revolt, and laid waste the country to some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>; but being offered a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARDON\">pardon</a> and a place to dwell in, they were pacified, and built for themselves a city, which they called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLON\">Babylon</a>. Towards the conquered princes who waited on him with their tribute the Egyptian monarch behaved with unparalleled insolence. On certain occasions he is said to have unharnessed his horses, and, yoking kings together, made them draw his chariot. One day, however, observing one of the kings who drew his chariot to look back upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> with great earnestness, he asked what made him look so attentively at them? The unhappy prince replied, \"O king, the going round of the wheel puts me in mind of the vicissitudes of fortune: for as every part of the wheel is uppermost and lowermost by turns, so it is with men; who one day sit on a throne, and on the next are reduced to the vilest degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>.\" This answer brought the insulting conqueror to his senses; so that he gave over the practice, and thenceforth treated his captives with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a>.\n\nAt length this mighty monarch lost his flight, and laid violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> on himself.\n\nAfter the death of Sesostris, we meet with another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDETERMINATE\">indeterminate</a> length in the Egyptian history. It concludes with the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMASIS\">Amasis</a> or Ammonis; who being a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a>, his subjects joined Aethiopias the king of Ethiopia to drive him out.\u2014Thus Aethiopias became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of the kingdom; and after his death follows another chain in the history, during which the empire is said to have been in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANARCHY\">anarchy</a> for five generations.\u2014This period brings us down to the times of the Trojan war. The reigning prince in Egypt was at that time called Cetes; by the Greeks, Proteus. The priests reported that he was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGICIAN\">magician</a>; and that he could assume any shape he pleased, even that of fire. This fable, as told by the Greeks, drew its origin from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> among the Egyptians, perhaps introduced by Proteus. They were used to adorn and distinguish the heads of their kings with the representations of animals or vegetables, or even with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCENSE\">incense</a>, in order to strike the beholders with the greater awe. Whilst Proteus reigned, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> or Alexander, the son of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIAM\">Priam</a> king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TROY\">Troy</a>, was driven by a storm on the coast of Egypt, with Helen, whom he was carrying off from her husband. But when the Egyptian monarch heard of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSPITALITY\">hospitality</a> committed by Paris, he seized him, his mistress, and companions, with all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> he had brought away with him from Greece. He detained Helen, with all the effects belonging to Menelaus her husband, promising to restore them to the injured <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> whenever they were demanded; but commanded Paris and his companions to depart out of his dominions in three days, on pain of being treated as enemies. In what manner Paris afterwards prevailed upon Proteus to restore his mistress, we are not told; neither do we know anything further of the transactions of this prince's reign nor of his successors, except what has entirely the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> of fable, till the days of Sabbaco the Ethiopian, who again conquered this kingdom. He began his reign with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of great cruelty, causing Sabbaco, the conquered prince to be burnt alive; nevertheless, he no sooner <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> himself firmly established on the throne of Egypt, than he became a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>; so that he is highly extolled for his mercy, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLEMENCY\">clemency</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>. He is thought to have been the So mentioned in Scripture, and who entered into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> with Hophra king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISRAEL\">Israel</a> against Shalmaneser king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASSYRIA\">Assyria</a>. He is said to have been excited to the invasion of Egypt by a dream or vision, in which he was assured that he should hold that kingdom for 50 years. Accordingly, he conquered Egypt, as had been foretold; and at the expiration of the time above mentioned, he had another dream, in which the tutelar god of Thebes acquainted him, that he could no longer hold the kingdom of Egypt with safety and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>, unless he massacred the priests as he passed through them with his guards. Being haunted with this vision, and at the same time abhorring to hold the kingdom on such terms, he sent for the priests, and acquainted them with what seemed to be the will of the gods. Upon this it was concluded, that it was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of the Deity that Sabbaco should remain no longer in Egypt; and therefore he immediately quitted that kingdom, and returned to Ethiopia.\n\nOf Anytias, who was Sabbaco's immediate successor, we have no particulars worth notice. After him reigned one Sethon, who was both king and priest of Vulcan. He gave himself up to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTEMPLATION\">contemplation</a>; and not only neglected the military arts, but deprived them of their lands. At this they were so much incensed, that they entered into an agreement not to bear arms under him; and in this state of affairs Sennacherib king of Assyria arrived before Pelusium with a mighty army. Sethon now applied to his soldiers, but in vain; they unanimously persisted in refusing to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">march</a> under his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANNER\">banner</a>. Being therefore destitute of all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a>, he applied to the god Vulcan, and requested him to deliver him from his enemies. Whilst he was yet in the temple of that god, it is said he fell into a deep sleep; during which he saw Vulcan standing at his side, and exhorting him to take courage. He promised, that if Sethon would but go out against the Assyrians, he should obtain a complete <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a> over them. Encouraged by this assurance, the king assembled a body of artificers, shop-keepers, and labourers; and, with this undisciplined rabble, marched towards Pelusium. He had no occasion, however, to fight; for the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> after his arrival at Pelusium, an innumerable multitude of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a> rats entering the enemies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>, gnawed to pieces the quivers, bowstrings, and shield straps. Next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a>, when Sethon found the enemy disarmed, and on that account beginning to fly, he pursued them to a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>, making a terrible slaughter. In memory of this extraordinary event, a statue of Sethon was erected in the temple of Vulcan, holding in one hand a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-RAT\">rat</a>, and delivering these words; \"Whoever beholds me let him be pious.\"\n\nSoon after the death of Sethon, the form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a> in Egypt was totally changed. The kingdom was divided into twelve parts, over which as many of\nthe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> presided. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a>, however, subsisted but for a short time. Pianmitichus, one of the twelve, dethroned all the rest, 15 years after the division had been made. The history now begins to be divested of fable; and from this time may be accounted equally certain with that of any other nation. The vast conquests of Sefotris were now no longer known; for Pianmitichus possessed no more than the country of Egypt itself. It appears, indeed, that none of the successors of Sefotris, or even that monarch himself, had made use of any means to keep in subjection the countries he had once conquered. Perhaps, indeed, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> originally was rather to pillage than to conquer; and therefore, on his return, his vast empire vanished at once. Pianmitichus, however, endeavoured to extend his dominions by making war on his neighbours; but by putting more confidence in foreign auxiliaries than in his own subjects, the latter were so much offended, that upwards of 200,000 fighting men emigrated in a body, and took up their residence in Ethiopia. To repair this loss, Pianmitichus earnestly applied himself to the advancement of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>; and opened his port to all strangers, whom he greatly caressed, contrary to the cruel maxims of his predecessors, who refused to admit them into the country. He also laid siege to the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AZOTUS\">Azotus</a> in Syria, which held out for 29 years against the whole strength of the kingdom; from which we may gather, that, as a warrior, Pianmitichus was by no means remarkable. He is reported to have been the first king of Egypt that drank wine. He also sent to discover the springs of the Nile; and is said to have attempted to discover the most ancient nation in the world by the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a>. Having procured two newly born children, he caused them to be brought up in such a manner that they never heard a human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a>. He imagined that these children would naturally speak the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> language of mankind: therefore, when, at two years of age, they pronounced the Phrygian word becos (or some found resembling it), which signifies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>, he concluded that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHRYGIANS\">Phrygians</a> were the most ancient people in the world.\n\nNechus, the son and successor of Pianmitichus, is the Pharaoh-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECHO\">Necho</a> of Scripture, and was a prince of an enterprising and warlike <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a>. In the beginning of his reign, he attempted to cut through the isthmus of Suez, between the Red sea and the Mediterranean; but, through the invincible obstructions which nature has thrown in the way of such undertakings, he was obliged to abandon the enterprise, after having lost 120,000 men in the attempt. After this he sent a flotilla, manned with some expert Phoenician mariners, on a voyage to explore the coasts of Africa. Accordingly, they performed the voyage; sailed round the continent of Africa; and after three years returned to Egypt, where their relation was deemed incredible.\n\nThe most remarkable wars in which this king was engaged are recorded in the sacred writings. He went out against the king of Assyria, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> command, as he himself told Jotham; but being opposed by the king of Judea, he defeated and killed him at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEGIDDO\">Megiddo</a>; after which he set up, in that country, King Jehoiakim, and imposed on him an annual tribute of 100 talents of silver and one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TALENT\">talent</a> of gold. He then proceeded against the king of Assyria; and weakened him so much, that the empire was soon after dissolved. Thus he became master of Syria and Phoenicia; but in a short time, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol16.html#article-NEBUCHADNEZZAR\">Nebuchadnezzar</a> king of Babylon came against him with a mighty army. The Egyptian monarch, not daunted by the formidable appearance of his antagonist, boldly ventured a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>; but was overthrown with prodigious slaughter, and Nebuchadnezzar became master of all the country to the very gates of Pelusium.\n\nThe reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIES\">Apries</a>, the Pharaoh-Hophra of Scripture, presents us with a new revolution in the Egyptian affairs. He is represented as a martial prince, successful and in the beginning of his reign very successful. He took by storm the rich city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIDON\">Sidon</a>; and having overcome the Cypriots and Phoenicians in a sea fight, returned to Egypt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a> with spoil. This success probably incited Zedekiah king of Judaea to enter into an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> with him against Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. The bad success of this alliance was foretold by the prophet Jeremiah; and accordingly it happened. For Nebuchadnezzar having fat down with his army before Jerusalem, Apries marched from Egypt with a design to relieve the city; but no sooner did he perceive the Babylonians <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> him, than he retreated as fast as he could, leaving the Jews exposed to the rage of their merciless enemies; who were thereupon treated as Jeremiah had foretold; and by this step Apries brought upon himself the vengeance denounced by the same prophet. The manner in which God confirmed these predictions was as follows: The Cyreneans, a colony of the Greeks, being greatly strengthened by a numerous supply of their countrymen under Zedekiah, their third king Batus styled the Happy, and encouraged by the Pythian oracle, began to drive out their Libyan neighbours, and shared their possessions among themselves. Hereupon Andica king of Libya sent a submissive embassy to Apries, and implored his protection against the Cyreneans. Apries complied with his request, and sent a powerful army to his relief. The Egyptians were defeated with great slaughter; and those who returned complained that the army had been sent off by Apries in order to be destroyed, and that he might tyrannize without control over the remainder of his subjects. This thought catching the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> of the giddy multitude, an almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> defection ensued. Apries sent one Amasis, a particular friend, in whom he thought he could confide, to bring back his people to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a>. But by this friend he was betrayed; for Amasis, taking the opportunity of the present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FERMENT\">ferment</a>, caused himself to be proclaimed king. Apries then despatched one Patarbemis, with orders to take Amasis, and bring him alive before him. This he found <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a>, and therefore returned without his prisoner; at which the king was so enraged, that he commanded Patarbemis's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOSE\">nose</a> and ears to be cut off. This piece of cruelty completed his ruin; for when the rest of the Egyptians who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> faithful to Apries beheld the inhuman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MUTILATION\">mutilation</a> of so worthy and noble a person as Patarbemis was, they to a man deserted Apries, and went over to Amasis.\n\nBoth parties now prepared for war; the usurper having under his command the whole body of native Egyptians; and Apries only those Ionians, Carians, and other mercenaries whom he could engage in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a>.\nvice. The army of Apries amounted only to 30,000; but, though greatly inferior in number to the troops of his rival, as he well knew that the Greeks were much superior in valour, he did not doubt of victory. Nay, so far was Apries puffed up with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a>, that he did not believe it was in the power even of any god to deprive him of his kingdom. The two armies soon met, and drew up in order of battle near Memphis. A bloody engagement ensued; in which, though the army of Apries behaved with the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a>, they were at last overpowered with numbers, and utterly defeated, the king himself being taken prisoner. Amasis now took possession of the throne without opposition. He confined Apries in one of his palaces, but treated him with great care and respect. The people, however, were implacable, and could not be satisfied while he enjoyed his life. Amasis, therefore, at last found himself obliged to deliver him into their hands. Thus the prediction received its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> completion: Apries was delivered up to those who fought his life; and who no sooner had him in their power, than they strangled him, and laid his body in the sepulchre of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>.\n\nDuring these intestine broils, which must have greatly weakened the kingdom, it is probable that Nebuchadnezzar invaded Egypt. He had been for 13 years before this employed in besieging <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRE\">Tyre</a>, and at last had nothing but an empty city for his pains. To make himself some amends, therefore, he entered Egypt, miserably harassed the country, killed and carried away great numbers of the inhabitants, so that the country did not recover from the effects of this incursion for a long time after. In this expedition, however, he seems not to have aimed at any permanent conquest, but to have been induced to it merely by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a> of plunder, and of this he carried with him an immense quantity to Babylon.\n\nDuring the reign of Amasis, Egypt is said to have been perfectly happy, and to have contained 20,000 populous cities. That good order might be kept among such vast numbers of people, Amasis enacted a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>, by which every Egyptian was bound once a-year to inform the governor of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> by what means he gained his livelihood; and if he failed of this, to put him to death. The same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> he decreed to those who could not give a satisfactory account of themselves.\n\nThis monarch was a great favourer of the Greeks, and married a woman of Grecian extract. To many Greek cities, as well as particular persons, he made considerable presents. Besides these, he gave leave to the Greeks in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> to come into Egypt, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> either in the city of Naucratis, or carry on their trade upon the sea coasts; granting them also temples, and places where they might erect temples to their own deities. He received also a visit from Solon the celebrated Athenian lawgiver, and reduced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a> of Cyprus under his subjection.\n\nThis great prosperity, however, ended with the death of Amasis, or indeed before it. The Egyptian monarch had some how or other incensed Cambyses king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a>. The cause of the quarrel is uncertain; but whatever it was, the Persian monarch vowed the destruction of Amasis. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time Phanes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HALICARNASSUS\">Halicarnassus</a>, commander of the Grecian auxiliaries in the pay of Amasis, took some private disgust; and leaving Egypt, embarked for Persia. He was a wise and able general, perfectly well acquainted with everything that related to Egypt; and had great credit with the Greeks in that country. Amasis was immediately sensible how great the loss of this man would be to him, and therefore sent after him a trusty eunuch with a swift <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GALLEY\">galley</a>. Phanes was accordingly overtaken in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LYCIA\">Lycia</a>, but not brought back; for making his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> drunk, he continued his journey to Persia, and presented himself before Cambyses, as he was meditating the destruction of the Egyptian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>.\n\nAt this dangerous crisis also, the Egyptian monarch imprudently made Polycrates the tyrant of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAMOS\">Samos</a> his nearest enemy. This man had been the most remarkable perhaps of any recorded in history, for an uninterrupted course of success, without the intervention of one single unfortunate event. Amasis, who was at this time in strict alliance with Polycrates, wrote him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>, in which, after congratulating him on his prosperity, he told him that he was afraid lest his successes were too many, and he might be suddenly thrown down into the greatest misery. For this reason he advised him voluntarily to take away something from his own happiness; and to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> away that which would grieve him most if he was accidentally to lose it. Polycrates followed his advice, and threw into the sea a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIGNET\">signet</a> of inestimable value. This, however, did not answer the intended purpose. The signet happened to be swallowed by a fish, which was taken a few days afterwards, and thus was restored to Polycrates. Of this Amasis was no sooner informed, than, considering Polycrates as really unhappy, and already on the brink of destruction, he resolved to put an end to the friendship which subsisted between them. For this purpose he despatched a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HERALD\">herald</a> to Samos, commanding him to acquaint Polycrates, that he renounced his alliance, and all the obligations between them; that he might not mourn his misfortunes with the sorrow of a friend. Thus Amasis left Polycrates at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a> to act against him, if he chose to do so; and accordingly he offered to assist Cambyses with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> of ships in his Egyptian expedition.\n\nAmasis had not, however, the misfortune to see the calamities of his country. He died about 525 years before Christ, after a reign of 44 years; and left the kingdom to his son Pflamenitus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as Cambyses was approaching the frontiers of the kingdom. The new vaded by prince was scarce seated on the throne, when the Persians appeared. Pflamenitus drew together what forces he could, in order to prevent them from entering the kingdom. Cambyses, however, immediately laid siege to Pelusium, and made himself master of it by the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STRATAGEM\">stratagem</a>: he placed in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> of his army a great number of cats, dogs, and other animals that were deemed sacred by the Egyptians. He then attacked the city, and took it without opposition; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARRISON\">garrison</a>, which consisted entirely of Egyptians, not daring to throw a dart or shoot an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARROW\">arrow</a> against their enemies, lest they should kill some of the holy animals.\n\nCambyses had scarce taken possession of the city, when Pflamenitus advanced against him with a numerous army. But before the engagement, the Greeks who served under Pflamenitus, to show their indignation,\nnation against their treacherous countryman Phanes, brought his children into the camp, killed them in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of their father and of the two armies, and then drank their blood. The Persians enraged at so cruel a sight, fell upon the Egyptians with the utmost fury, sent them to flight, and cut the greatest part of them in pieces. Those who escaped fled to Memphis, where they were soon after guilty of a horrid outrage. Cambyes sent a herald to them in a ship from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MITYLENE\">Mitylene</a>; but no sooner did they see her come into the port, than they flocked down to the shore, destroyed the ship, and tore to pieces the herald and all the crew; afterwards carrying their mangled limbs into the city, in a kind of barbarous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a>. Not long after, they were obliged to surrender; and thus Plamenitus fell into the hands of his inveterate enemy, who was now enraged beyond measure at the cruelties exercised upon the children of Phanes, the herald, and the Mitylenian sailors.\n\nThe rapid success of the Persians struck with such terror the Libyans, Cyreneans, Barceans, and other dependents or allies of the Egyptian monarch, that they immediately submitted. Nothing now remained but to dispose of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVE\">captive</a> king, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> on him and his subjects the cruelties which they had committed. This the merciless victor executed in the severest manner. On the 15th day after Memphis had been taken, Plamenitus and the chief of the Egyptian nobility were ignominiously sent into one of the suburbs of that city. The king being there seated in a proper place, saw his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> coming along in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> slave with a pitcher to fetch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> from the river, and followed by the daughters of the greatest families in Egypt, all in the same miserable garb, with pitchers in their hands, drowned in tears, and loudly bemoaning their miserable situation. When the fathers saw their daughters in this distress, they burst into tears, all but Plamenitus, who only cast his eyes on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> and kept them fixed there. After the young women came the son of Plamenitus, with 2000 of the young nobility, all of them with bits in their mouths and halters round their necks, led to execution. This was done to expiate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> of the Persian herald and the Mitylenian sailors; for Cambyes caused ten Egyptians of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> to be publicly executed for every one of those that had been slain. Plamenitus, however, observed the same conduct as before, keeping his eyes steadfastly fixed on the ground, though all the Egyptians around him made the loudest lamentations. A little after this he saw an intimate friend and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>, now advanced in years, who having been plundered of all he had, was begging his bread from door to door in the suburbs. As soon as he saw this man, Plamenitus wept bitterly; and calling out to him by his name, struck himself on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> as if he had been frantic. Of this the spies who had been set over him to observe his behaviour, gave immediate notice to Cambyes, who thereupon sent a messenger to inquire the cause of such immoderate grief. Plamenitus answered, That the calamities of his own family confounded him, and were too great to be lamented by any outwards signs of grief; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> distress of a bosom friend gave more room for reflection, and therefore extorted tears from him. With this answer Cambyes was so affected, that he sent orders to prevent the execution of the king's son; but these came too late, for the young prince had been put to death before any of the rest. Plamenitus himself was then sent into the city, and restored to his liberty; and had he not showed a desire of revenge, might perhaps have been trusted with the government of Egypt; but being discovered hatching schemes against the government, he was seized, and condemned to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRINK\">drink</a> bull's blood.\n\nThe Egyptians were now reduced to the lowest degree of slavery. Their country became a province of the Persian empire; the body of Amasis, their late king, province of the Persian, was taken out of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAVE\">grave</a>; and after being mangled and afterward in a shocking manner was finally burnt. But what wards of feigned more grievous than all the rest, their god <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APIS\">Apis</a> the Grecian was slain, and his priests ignominiously scourged; and empire, this inspired the whole nation with such a hatred to the Persians, that they could never afterwards be reconciled to them. As long as the Persian empire subsisted, the Egyptians could never shake off their yoke. They frequently revolted indeed, but were always overthrown with prodigious loss. At last they submitted, without opposition, to Alexander the Great; after his death, Egypt again became a powerful kingdom; though since the conquest of it by Cambyes to the present time it hath never been governed but by foreign princes, agreeable to the prophecy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EZEKIEL\">Ezekiel</a>, \"There shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt.\"\n\nOn the death of Alexander the Great, Egypt, together with Libya, and that part of Arabia which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a> borders on Egypt, were assigned to Ptolemy Lagus as Lagus, who was named the governor under Alexander's son by Roxana, who was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of but newly born. Nothing was farther from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a> of this governor, than to keep the provinces in trust for another. He did not, however, assume the title of king, till he perceived his authority so firmly established that it could not be shaken, and this did not happen till 19 years after the death of Alexander, when Antigonus and Demetrius had unsuccessfully attempted the conquest of Egypt.\n\nFrom the time of his first establishment on the throne, Ptolemy, who had assumed the title of Soter, reigned 20 years; which added to the former 19, make up the 39 years which historians commonly allow him to have reigned alone.\u2014In the 39th year of his reign, he made one of his sons, named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PHILADELPHUS\">Philadelphus</a>, partner to the empire; declaring him his successor, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> of his eldest son named Ceraunus; being excited thereto by his violent love for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BERENICE\">Berenice</a> Philadelphus's mother. When the succession was thus settled, Ceraunus immediately quitted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>; and fled at last into Syria, where he was received with open arms by Seleucus Nicator, whom he afterwards murdered.\n\nThe most remarkable transaction of this reign was the embellishing of the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRIA\">Alexandria</a>, which Ptolemy made the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> of his new kingdom, and of which an account is given under the article Alexandria. About 284 years before Christ, died Ptolemy Soter, in the 41st year of his reign, and 84th of his age. He was the best prince of his race; and left behind him an example of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>, justice, and clemency which few of his successors chose to follow. Besides the provinces originally assigned to him, he added to his empire those of Coelo-Syria, Ethiopia, Pamphylia, Lycia,\nEgypt, Lycia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARIA\">Caria</a>, and some of the Cyclades. His successor, Ptolemy Philadelphus, added nothing to the extent of the empire; nor did he perform anything worthy of notice except embellishing further the city of Alexandria, and entering into an alliance with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>. In his time, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-MAGAS\">Magas</a>, the governor of Libya and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CYRENE\">Cyrene</a>, revolted; and held these provinces as an independent prince, notwithstanding the utmost efforts of Ptolemy to reduce him. At last an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a> took place; and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a> was proposed between Berenice, the only daughter of Magas, and Ptolemy's eldest son. The young princess was to receive all her father's dominions by way of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWRY\">dowry</a>, and thus they would again be brought under the dominion of Ptolemy's family. But before this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> could be put in execution, Magas died; and then Apamea, the princess's mother, did all she could to prevent the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MATCH\">match</a>. This, however, she was not able to do; though her efforts for that purpose produced a destructive war of four years continuance with Antiochus Theus king of Syria, and the acting of a cruel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAGEDY\">tragedy</a> in the family of the latter. See Syria.\n\nAbout 246 years before Christ, Ptolemy Philadelphus died; and was succeeded by his eldest son Ptolemy, who had been married to Berenice, the daughter of Magas as above related. In the beginning of his reign, he found himself engaged in a war with Antiochus Theus king of Syria. From this he returned victorious, and brought with him 2500 statues and pictures, among which were many of the ancient Egyptian idols, which had been carried away by Cambyses into Persia. These were restored by Ptolemy to their ancient temples; in memory of which favour, the Egyptians gave him the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SURNAME\">surname</a> of Euergetes, or the Beneficent. In this expedition he greatly enlarged his dominions, making himself master of all the countries that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> between Mount Taurus and the confines of India. An account of these conquests was given by himself, inscribed on a monument, to the following effect. \"Ptolemy Euergetes, having received from his father the sovereignty of Egypt, Libya, Syria, Phoenice, Cyprus, Lydia, Caria, and the other Cyclades, assembled a mighty army of horse and foot, with a great fleet, and elephants, out of Troglodytia and Ethiopia; some of which had been taken by his father, and the rest by himself, and brought from thence, and trained up for war; with this great force he sailed into Asia; and having conquered all the provinces which lie on this side the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EUPHRATES\">Euphrates</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CILICIA\">Cilicia</a>, Pamphylia, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IONIA\">Ionia</a>, the Hellespont, and Thrace, he crossed that river with all the forces of the conquered countries, and the kings of those nations, and reduced <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MESOPOTAMIA\">Mesopotamia</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BABYLONIA\">Babylonia</a>, Susiana, Persia, Media, and all the country as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACTRIA\">Bactria</a>.\"\n\nOn the king's return from this expedition, he passed through Jerusalem, where he offered many sacrifices to the God of Israel, and ever afterwards expressed a great favour for the Jewish nation. At this time, the Jews were tributaries to the Egyptian monarchs, and paid them annually 20 talents of silver. This tribute, however, Onias, who was then high priest, being of a very covetous disposition, had for a long time neglected to pay, so that the arrears amounted to a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> sum. Soon after his return, therefore, Ptolemy sent one of his courtiers named Athenion to demand the money, and desired him to acquaint the Jews that he would make war upon them in case of refusal. A young man, however, named Joseph, nephew to Onias, not only found means to avert the king's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGER\">anger</a>, but even got himself chosen his receiver general, and by his faithful discharge of that important trust, continued in high favour with Ptolemy as long as he lived.\n\nPtolemy Euergetes having at last concluded a peace with Seleucus the successor of Antiochus Theus king of Syria, attempted the enlargement of his dominions on the south side. In this he was attended with such success, that he made himself master of all the coasts of the Red sea, both on the Arabian and Ethiopian sides, quite down to the straits of Babelmandel. On his return he was met by ambassadors from the Achaeans, imploring his assistance against the Eolians and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MACEDONIANS\">Macedonians</a>. This the king readily promised them; but they having in the mean time engaged Antigonus king of Macedon to support them, Ptolemy was so much offended, that he sent powerful succours to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-CLEOMENES\">Cleomenes</a> king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-SPARTA\">Sparta</a>; hoping, by that means, to humble both the Achaeans and their new ally Antigonus. In this, however, he was disappointed; for Cleomenes, after having gained very considerable advantages over the enemy, was at last entirely defeated in the battle of Sellafia, and obliged to take refuge in Egypt. Ptolemy's dominions. He was received by the Egyptian monarch with the greatest demonstrations of kindness; a yearly pension of 24 talents was assigned him, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> of restoring him to the Spartan throne; but before this could be accomplished, the king of Egypt died, in the 27th year of his reign, and was succeeded by his son Ptolemy Philopater.\n\nThus we have seen the Egyptian empire brought to a very great height of power; and had the succeeding monarchs been careful to preserve that strength of empire transmitted to them by Euergetes, it is very probable that Egypt might have been capable of holding the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> against Rome, and after the destruction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTHAGE\">Carthage</a> prevented that haughty city from becoming mistress of the world. But after the death of Ptolemy Euergetes, the Egyptian empire, being governed only by weak or vicious monarchs, quickly declined, and from that time makes no conspicuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> in history.\n\nPtolemy Philopater began his reign with the murder of his brother; after which, giving himself up to all manner of licentiousness, the kingdom fell into a kind of anarchy. Cleomenes the Spartan king still resided at court; and being now unable to bear the dissolute manners which prevailed there, he pressed Philopater to give him the assistance he had promised for restoring him to the throne of Sparta. This he the rather insisted upon, because he had received advice that Antigonus king of Macedon was dead, that the Achaeans were engaged in a war with the Eolians, and that the Macedonians had joined the latter against the Achaeans and Macedonians. Ptolemy, when afraid of his brother Magas, had indeed promised to assist the king of Sparta with a powerful fleet, hoping by this means to attach him to his own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a>; but now when Magas was out of the way, it was determined by the king, or rather his ministers, that Cleomenes should not be assisted, nor even allowed to leave the kingdom; and this extravagant resolution produced the desperate attempt.\ntempt of Cleomenes, of which an account is given in the history of Sparta.\n\nOf the disorders which now ensued in the government, Antiochus king of Syria, furnishing the Great, took the advantage, and attempted to wrest from Ptolemy the provinces of Coelo-Syria and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a>. But in this he was finally disappointed; and might easily have been totally driven out of Syria, had not Ptolemy been too much taken up with his debaucheries to think of carrying on the war. The discontent occasioned by this piece of negligence soon produced a civil war in his dominions, and the whole kingdom continued in the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> till his death, which happened in the 17th year of his reign and 37th of his age.\n\nDuring the reign of Philopater happened a very extraordinary event with regard to the Jews, which is mentioned in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MACCABEES\">Maccabees</a>*. The king of Egypt, while on his Syrian expedition, had attempted to enter the temple of Jerusalem; but being hindered by the Jews, he was filled with the utmost rage against the whole nation. On his return to Alexandria, he resolved to make those who dwelt in that city feel the first effects of his vengeance. He began with publishing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a>, which he caused to be engraved on a pillar erected for that purpose at the gate of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>, excluding all those who did not sacrifice to the gods worshipped by the king. By this means the Jews were debarred from suing to him for justice, or obtaining his protection when they happened to stand in need of it. By the favour of Alexander the Great, Ptolemy Soter, and Euergetes, the Jews enjoyed at Alexandria the same privileges with the Macedonians. In that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a> the inhabitants were divided into three ranks or classes. In the first were the Macedonians, or original founders of the city, and along with them were enrolled the Jews; in the second were the mercenaries who had served under Alexander; and in the third the native Egyptians. Ptolemy now, to be revenged of the Jews, ordered, by another decree, that they should be degraded from the first rank, and enrolled among the native Egyptians. By the same decree it was enacted, that all of that nation should appear at an appointed time before the proper officers, in order to be enrolled among the common people; that at the time of their enrollment they should have the mark of an ivy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>, the badge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACCHUS\">Bacchus</a>, impressed with a hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> on their faces; that all who were thus marked should be made slaves; and, lastly, that if any one should stand out against this decree, he should be immediately put to death. That he might not, however, seem an enemy to the whole nation, he declared, that those who sacrificed to their gods should enjoy their former privileges, and remain in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>. Yet notwithstanding this tempting offer, 300 only out of many thousand Jews who lived in Alexandria could be prevailed upon to abandon their religion in order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> themselves from slavery.\n\nThe apostates were immediately excommunicated by their brethren; and this their enemies construed as done in opposition to the king's order; which threw the tyrant into such a rage, that he resolved to extirpate the whole nation, beginning with the Jews who lived in Alexandria and other cities of Egypt, and proceeding from thence to Judaea and Jerusalem itself. In consequence of this cruel resolution, he commanded all the Jews that lived in any part of Egypt to be brought in chains to Alexandria, and there to be shut up in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HIPPODROME\">Hippodrome</a>, which was a very spacious place without the city, where the people used to assemble to see horse races and other public diversions. He then sent for Herman master of the elephants; and commanded him to have 500 of these animals ready against the next day, to let loose upon the Jews in the Hippodrome. But when the elephants were prepared for the execution, and the people were assembled in great crowds to see it, they were for that day disappointed by the king's absence. For, having been late up the night before with some of his debauched companions, he did not awake till the time for the show was over, and the spectators returned home. He therefore ordered one of his servants to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> him early on the following day, that the people might not meet with a second disappointment. But when the person awakened him according to his order, the king was not yet returned to his senses; having withdrawn, exceedingly drunk, only a short time before. As he did not remember the order, he therefore fell into a violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a>, and threatened with death the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> who had awakened him; and this caused the show to be put off till the third day. At last the king came to the Hippodrome attended with a vast multitude of spectators; but when the elephants were let loose, instead of falling upon the Jews, they turned their rage against the spectators and soldiers, and destroyed great numbers of them. At the same time, some frightful appearances which were seen in the air so terrified the king, that he commanded the Jews to be immediately set at liberty, and restored them to their former privileges. No sooner were they delivered from this danger than they demanded leave to put to death such of their nation as had abandoned their religion; and this being granted, they despatched the apostates without excepting a single man.\n\nPhilopater was succeeded by Ptolemy Epiphanes; Ptolemy and he, after a reign of 24 years, by Ptolemy Philo-Philometor. In the beginning of his reign, a war commenced with the king of Syria, who had seized on the provinces of Coelo-Syria and Palestine in the preceding reign. In the course of this war, Philometer was either voluntarily delivered up to Antiochus or taken prisoner. But however this was, the Alexandrians despising of his ever being able to recover his liberty, raised to the throne his brother Ptolemy, who took the name of Euergetes II. but was afterwards called Phykon or \"the great-bellied,\" on account of the prominent belly which by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLUTTONY\">gluttony</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> he had acquired. He was scarce seated on the throne, however, when Antiochus Epiphanes, returning into Egypt, drove out Phykon, and restored the whole kingdom except Pelusium, to Philometor. His design was to kindle a war betwixt the two brothers, so that he might have an opportunity of seizing the kingdom for himself. For this reason he kept to himself the city of Pelusium; which being the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KEY\">key</a> of Egypt, he might at his pleasure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-enter the country. But Philometor, apprised of his design, invited his brother Phykon to an accommodation; which was happily effected by their sister <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLEOPATRA\">Cleopatra</a>. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of this agreement, the brothers were to reign jointly, and to oppose to the utmost of their power Antiochus, whom they considered as a common\ncommon enemy. On this the king of Syria invaded Egypt with a mighty army, but was prevented by the Romans from conquering it.\n\nThe two brothers were no sooner freed from the apprehensions of a foreign enemy than they began to quarrel with each other. Their differences soon came to such a height, that the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> interposed. But before the ambassadors employed to inquire into the merits of the cause could arrive in Egypt, Physon had driven Philometor from the throne, and obliged him to quit the kingdom. On this the dethroned prince fled to Rome, where he appeared meanly dressed, and without attendants. He was very kindly received by the senate; who were so well satisfied of the injustice done him, that they immediately decreed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">restoration</a>. He was reconducted accordingly; and, on the arrival of the ambassadors in Egypt, an accommodation between the two brothers was negotiated. By this agreement, Physon was put in possession of Libya and Cyrene, and Philometor of all Egypt and the island of Cyprus; each of them being declared independent of the other in the dominion allotted to them. The treaty, as usual, was confirmed with oaths and sacrifices, and was broken almost as soon as made. Physon was dissatisfied with his share of the dominions; and therefore sent ambassadors to Rome, deiring that the island of Cyprus might be added to his other possessions. This could not be obtained by the ambassadors; and therefore Physon went to Rome in person. His demand was evidently unjust; but the Romans, considering that it was their interest to weaken the power of Egypt as much as possible, without further <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a> adjudged the island to him.\n\nPhyson set out from Rome with two ambassadors; and arriving in Greece on his way to Cyprus, he raised there a great number of mercenaries, with a design to sail immediately to that island and conquer it. But the Roman ambassadors telling him, that they were commanded to put him in possession of it by fair means and not by force, he dismissed his army, and returned to Libya, while one of the ambassadors proceeded to Alexandria. Their design was to bring the two brothers to an interview on the frontiers of their dominions, and there to settle matters in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMICABLE\">amicable</a> manner. But the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> who went to Alexandria, found Philometor very averse from compliance with the decree of the senate. He put off the ambassador so long, that Physon sent the other also to Alexandria, hoping that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> persuasions of the two would induce Philometor to comply. But the king, after entertaining them at an immense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> for 40 days, at last plainly refused to submit, and told the ambassadors that he was resolved to adhere to the first treaty. With this answer the Roman ambassadors departed, and were followed by others from the two brothers. The senate, however, not only confirmed their decree in favour of Physon, but renounced their alliance with Philometor, and commanded his ambassador to leave the city in five days.\n\nIn the meantime, the inhabitants of Cyrene having heard unfavourable accounts of Physon's behaviour during the short time he reigned in Alexandria, conceived so strong an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-AVERSION\">aversion</a> against him, that they resolved to keep him out of their country by force of arms. On receiving intelligence of this resolution, Physon dropped all thoughts of Cyprus for the present; and hastened with all his forces to Cyrene, where he soon got the better of his rebellious subjects, and established himself in the kingdom. His vicious and tyrannical conduct, however, soon estranged from him the minds of his subjects, in such a manner, that some of them entering into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSPIRACY\">conspiracy</a> against him, fell upon him one night as he was returning to his palace, wounded him in several places, and left him for dead on the spot. This he laid to the charge of his brother Philometor; and as soon as he was recovered, took another voyage to Rome. Here he made his complaints to the senate, and showed them the scars of his wounds, accusing his brother of having employed the assassins from whom he received them. Though Philometor was known to be a man of most humane and mild disposition, and therefore very unlikely to have been concerned in so black an attempt; yet the senate, being offended at his refusing to submit to their decree concerning the island of Cyprus, heartened to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUSATION\">accusation</a>; and carried their prejudice so far, that they not only refused to hear what his ambassadors had to say, but ordered them immediately to depart from the city. At the same time, they appointed five commissioners to conduct Physon to Cyprus, and put him in possession of that island, enjoining all their allies in those parts to supply him with forces for that purpose.","sp":200,"ep":209},{"h":"EHRHARTA","t":"a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENUS\">genus</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> belonging to the hexandria clas.

Of this kind are all the aerial fluids without exception, and all kinds of fumes raised by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> whether from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> fluid bodies.\n\nOf these, some retain their elasticity only when a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of heat is applied to them or the substance which produces them; while others remain elastic in every degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, either natural or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a>, that has yet been observed. Of the former kind are the vapours of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of wine, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a>, sal ammoniac, and all kinds of sublimable salts; of the latter, those of muriatic acid gas, hydrogen gas, nitrous gas, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> air, &c.\n\nThe elastic force with which any one of these fluids is endowed has not yet been calculated, as being ultimately greater than any obstacle we can put in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>. Thus, if we compress the atmospherical air, we shall find that for some little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> easily yield to the force we apply; but every succeeding moment the resistance will become stronger, and a greater and greater force must be applied in order to compress it further. As the compression goes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a>, the vessel containing the air becomes hot; but no power whatever has yet been able to destroy the elasticity of the contained fluid in any degree; for upon removing the pressure, it is always found to occupy the very same space that it did before. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is the same with aqueous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a>, to which a sufficient heat is applied to keep it from condensing into water. This will yield to a certain degree; but every moment the resistance becomes greater, until at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> it will overcome any obstacles whatever. An example of the power of this kind of steam we have every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> in the steam engine; and the vapours of other matters, both solid and fluid, have frequently manifested themselves to be endowed with an equal force. Thus the force of the vapours of spirit of wine has occasioned terrible accidents when the worm has been stopped, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the still absurdly tied <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> to prevent an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a>; the vapours of mercury have burnt an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> box; and those of sal ammoniac, volatile salts, nitrous acid, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> acid, phosphorus, &c., have all been known to burst the chemical vessels which confined them with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> force, in such a manner as to endanger those who stood near them. In short, from innumerable observations, it may be laid down as an undoubted fact, that there is no substance whatever capable of being reduced into a state of vapour, but what in that state is endowed with an elastic force ultimately superior to any obstacle we can throw in its way.\n\nIt hath been a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DESIDERATUM\">desideratum</a> among philosophers to give a satisfactory <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> for this astonishing\nElastic vapours, being power of elasticity in vapour, seemingly so little capable of accomplishing any great purpose when in an unconfined state. As air is that fluid in which, from the many experiments made upon it by the air-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a> and otherwise, the elastic property has most frequently been observed, the researches of philosophers were at first principally directed towards it. The causes they assigned, however, were very inadequate; being founded upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a> concerning the form of the particles of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> itself, which they supposed to be either rolled up like the springs of watches, or that they consisted of a kind of elastic flakes. This was followed by another hypothesis concerning their substance, which was imagined to be perfectly elastic, and so strong that they could not be broken by any mechanical power whatever; and thus they thought the phenomenon of the elasticity of the air might be explained. But an insuperable difficulty still attended their scheme, notwithstanding both these suppositions; for it was observed, that the elastic power of the air was augmented not only in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of pressure it was made to endure, but in proportion to the degree of heat applied to it at the time. Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton was aware of this difficulty; and justly concluded, that the phenomena of the air's elasticity could not be solved on any other supposition but that of a repulsive power diffused all around each of its particles, which became stronger as they approached, and weaker as they removed from each other. Hence the common phenomena of the air-pump and condensing-engine received a satisfactory explanation; but still it remained to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> for the power shown in the present case by heat, as it could not be denied that this element had a very great share in augmenting the elasticity of the atmosphere, and seemed to be the only cause of elasticity in other vapours. It does not appear that Sir Isaac entered into this question, but contented himself with attributing to heat the property of increasing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPULSION\">repulsion</a>, and ascribing this to another unexplored property called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a>. Thus matters stood till the great discovery made by Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a>, that some bodies have the power of absorbing in an unknown manner the element in question, and parting with it afterwards, so that it flows out of the body which had absorbed it with the very same properties that it had before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a>. Hence many phenomena of heat, vapour, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>, were explained in a manner much more satisfactory than had ever been attempted or even expected before. One of these was that remarkable property of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METALS\">metals</a> becoming hot by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAMMERING\">hammering</a>; during which operation, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, the element of heat is squeezed out from between the particles of the metal, as water is from the pores of a sponge by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PRESSING\">pressing</a> it between the fingers. Of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> is the phenomenon above-mentioned, that air when violently compressed becomes hot, by reason of the quantity of more subtle element squeezed out from among the particles. In this manner it appears that heat and the repulsive power of Sir Isaac Newton are the very same; that by diminishing the heat of any quantity of air, its elasticity is effectually diminished, and it will of itself shrink into a smaller space as effectually as by mechanical pressure. In one case we have what may be called ocular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEMONSTRATION\">demonstration</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of this doctrine, viz. that by throwing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a> of a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENS\">lens</a> upon a small quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a> in vacuo, the whole will be converted into inflammable air, having even a greater power of elasticity than common air in an equal degree of heat. Here there is nothing else but heat or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> to produce the elastic power, or cause the particles of charcoal which before attracted now to repel each other. In another case we have <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> equally strong, that the element of heat by itself, without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of that of light, is capable of producing the same effect. Thus when a phial of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a> is put into the receiver of an air pump, and surrounded by a small vessel of water, the ether boils violently, and is distilled in vapour, while the water freezes, and is cooled to a great degree. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a> of this vapour shows that it has an elastic force; and the absorption of the heat from the water shows, that this element not only produces the elasticity, but actually enters into the substance of the vapour itself; so that we have not the least reason to conclude that there is any other repulsive power by which the particles are kept at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from one another than the substance of the heat itself. In what manner it acts, we cannot pretend exactly to explain, without making hypotheses concerning the form of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> particles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, which must always be very uncertain. All known phenomena, however, concur in rendering the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> now laid down extremely probable. The elasticity of the steam of water is exactly proportioned to the degree of heat which flows into it from without; and if this be kept up to a sufficient degree, there is no mechanical pressure which can reduce it into the state of water. This, however, may very easily be done by abstracting a certain portion of the latent heat it contains; when the elastic vapour will become a dense and heavy fluid. The same thing may be done in various ways with the permanently elastic fluids. Thus the purest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPHLOGISTICATED\">dephlogisticated</a> air, when made to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> with its latent heat by burning with iron, is converted into a gravitating substance of an unknown nature, which adheres strongly to the metal. If the decomposition is performed by means of inflammable air, both together unite into a heavy, aqueous, or acid fluid: if by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> with nitrous air, still the heat is discernible, though less violent than in the two former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>. The decomposition indeed is slower, but equally complete, and the dephlogisticated air becomes part of the nitrous acid, from which it may be again expelled by proper means: but of these means heat must always be one; for thus only the elasticity can be restored, and the air be recovered in its proper state. The same thing takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> in fixed air, and all other permanently elastic fluids capable of being absorbed by others. The conclusion therefore which we can only draw from what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DATA\">data</a> we have concerning the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> of elastic vapours is, that all of them are formed of a terrestrial substance, united with the element of heat in such a manner that part of the latter may be squeezed out from among the terrestrial particles; but in such a manner, that as soon as the pressure is taken off, the surrounding fluid rushes in, and expands them to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> bulk: and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> or tendency to it will be increased in proportion to the degree of heat, just as the expansion of a sponge would be exceedingly augmented, if we could contrive to convey a stream of water into\nElasticity into the heart of it, and make the liquid flow out with violence through every pore in the circumference. In this case, it is evident that the water would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> as a power of repulsion among the particles of the sponge, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as the fire does among the particles of the water, charcoal, or whatever other substance is employed. Thus far we may reason from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a>; but in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> the internal and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a> of these vapors will forever remain unknown. Their obvious properties, as well as some of their more latent operations in many cases, are treated of under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a>.\n\nIt has been imagined by some, that the artificial elastic fluids have not the same mechanical property with common air, viz. that of occupying a space inversely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the weights with which they are pressed; but this is found to be a mistake. All of them likewise have been found to be non-conductors of electricity, though probably not all in the same degree. Even aqueous vapor, when intimately mingled with any permanently elastic fluid, refuses to conduct this fluid, as is evident from the highly electrical state of the atmosphere in very dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, when we are certain that aqueous vapor must abound very much, and be intimately mixed with it. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of the electric spark, though it may be made visible in all kinds of permanently elastic vapors, is very different in different fluids. Thus in inflammable and alkaline air it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> or purple, but in fixed air it appears <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>.","sp":247,"ep":249},{"h":"ELASTICITY","t":"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">Elastic</a> Force, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of bodies wherewith they restore themselves to their former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, after any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> pressure.\n\nThe cause or principle of this important property elasticity, or springiness, is variously assigned. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARTESIANS\">Cartesians</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> for it from the materia subtilis making an effort to pass through pores that are too narrow for it. Thus, say they, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a>, or compressing, a hard elastic body, e.g., a bow, its parts recede from each other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the convex side, and approach on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCAVE\">concave</a>; consequently the pores are contracted or tightened on the concave side; and if they were before round, are now, for instance, oval; so that the materia subtilis, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> element, endeavouring to pass out of those pores thus tightened, must make an effort, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, to restore the body to the state it was in when the pores were more patent and round, i.e., before the bow was bent; and in this consists its elasticity.\n\nOther later and more wary philosophers account for elasticity much after the same manner as the Cartesians; with this only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a>, that in lieu of the subtle matter of the Cartesians, these substitute <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETHER\">Ether</a>, or a fine ethereal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> that pervades all bodies.\n\nOthers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> aside the precarious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a> of a materia subtilis, account for elasticity from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a>, or the cause of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> of the parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> and firm bodies. Thus, say they, when a hard body is struck or bent, so that the component parts are moved a little from each other, but not quite disjointed or broke off, or separated so far as to be out of the power of that attractive force whereby they cohere; they must certainly, on the cessation of the external violence, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> back to their former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> state.\n\nOthers resolve elasticity into the pressure of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>; for a violent tension or compression, though not so great as to separate the constituent particles of bodies far enough to let in any foreign matter, must yet occasion many little vacuums between the separated surfaces; so that upon the removal of the force they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> again by the pressure of the aerial fluid upon the external parts. See Atmosphere.\n\nLastly, others <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> the elasticity of all hard bodies to the power of reflection in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> included within them; and so makes the elastic force of the air the principle of elasticity in all other bodies.\n\nThe Elasticity of Fluids is accounted for from their particles being all endowed with a centrifugal force; when Sir <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> Newton, prop. 23, lib. 2, demonstrates, that particles, which naturally avoid or fly off from one another by such forces as are reciprocally proportioned to the distances of their centre, will compose an elastic fluid, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a> shall be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to its compression; and vice versa, if any fluid be composed of particles that fly off and avoid one another, and hath its density proportional to its compression, then the centrifugal forces of those particles will be reciprocally as the distances of their centres.\n\nElasticity of the Air, is the force wherewith that element dilates itself, upon removing the force whereby it was before compressed. See Air and Atmosphere.\n\nThe elasticity or spring of the air was first discovered by Galileo. Its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> is proved by this experiment of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a>: An <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of air being intruded by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYRINGE\">syringe</a> into a glass or metal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>, till such time as the ball, with this accession of air, weighs considerably more in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> than it did before; upon opening the mouth thereof, the air rushes out, till the ball sinks to its former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a>. From hence we argue, that there is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> as much air gone out, as compressed air had been crowded in. Air, therefore, returns to its former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a>, upon removing the force that compressed or resisted its expansion; consequently it is endowed with an elastic force. It must be added, that as the air is found to rush out in every situation or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of the orifice, the elastic force acts every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, or in every direction.\n\nThe elasticity of the air makes a considerable article in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PNEUMATICS\">Pneumatics</a>.\n\nThe cause of the elasticity of the atmosphere hath been commonly ascribed to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPULSION\">repulsion</a> between its particles; but this can give us only a very slight idea of the nature of its elasticity. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> repulsion, like that of attraction, requires to be defined; and in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> will be found in most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> to be the effect of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of some other fluid. Thus, we find, that the elasticity of the atmosphere is very considerably affected by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a>. Supposing a quantity of air heated to such a degree as is sufficient to raise Fahrenheit's thermometer to 212\u00b0, it will then occupy a considerable space. If it is cooled to such a degree as to sink the thermometer to 0\u00b0, it will shrink up into less than half the former bulk. The quantity of repulsive power\npower therefore acquired by the air, while passing from one of these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> to the other, is evidently owing to the heat added or taken away from it.

This sect was divided into two parties, which may be denominated metaphysical and physical, the one rejecting, and the other approving, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a> to fact and experiment. Of the former kind were Xenophanes, Parmenides, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MELISSUS\">Melissus</a>, and Zeno of Elea. They are supposed to have maintained principles not very unlike those of Spinoza; they held the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETERNITY\">eternity</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMUTABILITY\">immutability</a> of the world; that whatever existed was only one being; that there was neither any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> nor corruption; that this one being was immoveable and immutable, and was the true God; and whatever changes seemed to happen in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>, they considered as mere appearances and illusions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>. However, some learned men have supposed, that Xenophanes and his followers, speaking metaphysically, understood by the universe, or the one being, not the material world, but the originating principle of\nof all things, or the true God, whom they expressly affirm to be incorporeal. Thus Simplicius represents them as merely metaphysical writers, who distinguished between things <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> and supernatural; and who made the former to be compounded of different principles. Accordingly, Xenophanes maintained, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> consisted of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> and fire; that all things were produced out of the earth, and the sun and stars out of clouds, and that there were four elements. Parmenides also distinguished between the doctrine concerning metaphysical objects, called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, and that concerning physical or corporeal things, called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>; with respect to the former there was one immoveable principle, but in the latter two that were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a>, viz. fire and earth, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>; in which particulars Zeno agreed with him.

In all democracies, therefore, it is of the utmost importance to regulate by whom, and in what manner, the suffrages are to be given. And the Athenians were so justly jealous of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREROGATIVE\">prerogative</a>, that a stranger, who interfered in the assemblies of the people, was punished by their laws with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a>; because such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> was deemed guilty of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREASON\">treason</a>, by usurping those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> of sovereignty to which he had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a>. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, where the people do not debate in a collective body, but by representation, the exercise of this sovereignty consists in the choice of representatives. The laws have therefore very strictly guarded against <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-USURPATION\">usurpation</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> abuse of this power, by many salutary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a>; which may be reduced to these three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a>,\n\n1. The qualifications of the electors.\n2. The qualifications of the elected.\n3. The proceedings at elections.\n\n(1.) As to the qualifications of the electors. The true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> of requiring any qualification, with regard to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, in voters, is to exclude such persons as are in so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> a situation, that they are esteemed to have no will of their own. If these persons had votes, they would be tempted to dispose of them under some undue influence or other. This would give a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a>, an artful, or a wealthy man, a larger share in elections than is consistent with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>. If it were probable that every man would give his vote freely, and without influence of any kind; then, upon the true <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> and genuine principles of liberty, every member of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>, however <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>, should have a vote in electing those delegates to whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> is committed the disposal of his property, his liberty, and his life. But since that can hardly be expected in persons of indigent fortunes, or such as are under the immediate dominion of others, all popular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> have been obliged to establish certain qualifications; whereby some, who are suspected to have no will of their own, are excluded from voting, in order to let other individuals, whose will may be supposed independent, more thoroughly upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with each other.\n\nAnd this constitution of suffrages is framed upon a wiser principle with us, than either of the methods of voting, by centuries, or by tribes, among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a>. In the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> by centuries, instituted by Servius Tullius, it was principally property, and not numbers, that turned the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>: in the method by tribes, gradually introduced by the tribunes of the people, numbers only were regarded, and property entirely overlooked. Hence the laws passed by the former method had usually too great a tendency to aggrandize the patricians or rich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol15.html#article-NOBLES\">nobles</a>; and those by the latter had too much of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LEVELLING\">levelling</a> principle. Our constitution fleers between the two extremes. Only such are entirely excluded as can have no will of their own; there is hardly a free <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> to be found, but what is intitled to a vote in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> or other in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>. Nor is comparative wealth, or property, entirely disregarded in elections; for though the richest man has only one vote at one place, yet, if his property be at all diffused, he has probably a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to vote at more places than one, and therefore has many representatives. This is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of our constitution; not that we assert it is in fact quite so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> as we have endeavoured to describe it; for if any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> might be wished or suggested in the present form of parliaments, it should be in favour of a more complete representation of the people.\n\nBut to return to the qualifications; and first those of electors for knights of the shire. 1. By statute 8 Hen. VI. c. 7, and 10 Hen. VI. c. 2. (amended by 14 Geo. III. c. 58.) the knights of the shire shall be chosen of people, whereof every man shall have freehold to the value of forty shillings by the year within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTY\">county</a>; which (by subsequent statutes) is to be clear of all charges and deductions, except parliamentary and parochial taxes. The knights of shires are the representatives of the landholders, or landed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> of the kingdom: their electors must therefore have estates in lands or tenements within the county represented.\nElection. fented. These estates must be freehold, that is, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> of life at least; because beneficial leases for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> terms of years were not in use at the making of these statutes, and copyholders were then little better than villains, absolutely dependent upon their lords. This freehold must be of 40 shillings annual value; because that sum would then, with proper industry, furnish all the necessaries of life, and render the freeholder, if he pleased, an independent man: For Bishop Fleetwood, in his Chronicon Precisum, written at the beginning of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, has fully proved 40 shillings in the reign of Henry VI. to have been equal to 12 pounds per annum in the reign of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">Queen</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANNE\">Anne</a>; and, as the value of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> is very considerably lowered since the bishop wrote, we may fairly conclude, from this and other circumstances, that what was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to 12 pounds in his days, is equivalent to 20 at present. The other less important qualifications of the electors for counties in England and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WALES\">Wales</a> may be collected from the statutes cited below (a); which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a>, 1. That no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> under 21 years of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> shall be capable of voting for any member. This extends to all sorts of members as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> for boroughs as counties; as does also the next, viz. 3. That no person convicted of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PERJURY\">perjury</a>, or subornation of perjury, shall be capable of voting in any election. 4. That no person shall vote in right of any freehold, granted to him fraudulently, to qualify him to vote. Fraudulent grants are such as contain an agreement to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-convey, or to defeat the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a> granted; which agreements are made void, and the estate is absolutely vested in the person to whom it is so granted. And, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> the better against such frauds, it is further provided, 5. That every voter shall have been in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> possession, or receipt of the profits, of his freehold to his own use for 12 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALENDAR\">calendar</a> months before; except it came to him by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, marriage settlement, will, or promotion to a benefice or office. 6. That no person shall vote in respect of an annuity or rent-charge, unless registered with the clerk of the peace 12 calendar months before. 7. That in mortgaged or trust estates, the person in possession, under the above-mentioned restrictions, shall have the vote. 8. That only one person shall be admitted to vote for any one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a> or tenement, to prevent the splitting of freeholds. 9. That no estate shall qualify a voter, unless the estate has been affected to some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND_TAX\"><a class</a>=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a>-tax <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a>, at least 12 months before the election. 10. That no tenant by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COURT\">court</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROLL\">roll</a> shall be permitted to vote as a freeholder. Thus much for the electors in counties.\n\nAs for the electors of citizens and burgesses, these are supposed to be the mercantile part or trading interest of this kingdom. But as trade is of a fluctuating <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, and seldom long fixed in a place, it was formerly left to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> to summon, pro re nata, the most flourishing towns to send representatives to parliament. So that as towns increased in trade, and grew populous, they were admitted to a share in the legislature. But the misfortune is, that the deserted boroughs <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> to be summoned, as well as those to whom their trade and inhabitants were transferred; except a few which petitioned to be eased of the expense, then usual, of maintaining their members: four shillings a-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> being allowed for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a> of the shire, and two shillings for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITIZEN\">citizen</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BURGESS\">burgess</a>; which was the rate of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a> established in the reign of Edward III. Hence the members for boroughs now bear above a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPLE\">quadruple</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to those for counties; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of parliament men is increased since Fortescue's times, in the reign of Henry VI. from 300 to upwards of 500, exclusive of those for Scotland. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a> were, in general, not empowered to send burgesses to parliament; though once, in 28 Edw. I. when a parliament was summoned to consider of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s right to Scotland, there were issued writs, which required the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OXFORD\">Oxford</a> to send up four or five, and that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMBRIDGE\">Cambridge</a> two or three, of their most discreet and learned lawyers for that purpose. But it was King James I. who indulged them with the permanent privilege to send constantly two of their own body; to serve for those students who, though useful members of the community, were neither concerned in the landed nor the trading interest; and to protect in the legislature the rights of the republic of letters. The right of election in boroughs is various, depending entirely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the several charters, customs, and constitutions of the respective places; which has occasioned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFINITE\">infinite</a> dilutes; though now, by statute 2 Geo. II. c. 24, the right of voting for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> shall be allowed according to the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> of the house of commons concerning it; and, by statute 3 Geo. III. c. 15, no freeman of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOROUGH\">borough</a> (other than such as claim by birth, marriage, or servitude) shall be entitled to vote therein, unless he hath been admitted to his freedom 12 calendar months before.\n\n(2.) Next, as to the qualifications of persons to be elected members of the house of commons. Some of these depend upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> of parliaments, declared by the house of commons; others upon certain statutes. And from these it appears, 1. That they must not be aliens born or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINORS\">minors</a>. 2. That they must not be any of the 12 judges, because they fit in the lords' house; nor of the clergy, for they fit in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVOCATION\">convocation</a>; nor persons attainted of treason, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FELONY\">felony</a>, for they are unfit to sit anywhere. 3. That sheriffs of counties, and mayors and bailiffs of boroughs, are not eligible in their respective jurisdictions, as being returning officers; but that sheriffs of one county are eligible to be knights of another. 4. That, in strictness, all members ought to have been inhabitants of the places for which they are chosen; but this, having been long disregarded, was at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> entirely repealed by statute 14 Geo. III. c. 58. 5. That no persons concerned in the management of any duties or taxes created since 1692, except the commissioners of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>, nor any of the officers following (viz. commissioners of prizes, transports, sick and wounded, wine licenses, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAVY\">navy</a>, and victualling; secretaries or receivers of prizes; controllers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> accounts; agents for regiments; governors of plantations, and their\n\n(a) 7 and 8 Will. III. c. 25. 10 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol3.html#article-ANN\">Ann</a>. c. 23. 2 Geo. II. c. 21. 18 Geo. II. c. 18. 31 Geo. II. c. 14. 3 Geo. III. c. 24.\nElection. their deputies; officers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINORCA\">Minorca</a> or Gibraltar; officers of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCISE\">excise</a> and customs; clerks or deputies in the several offices of the treasury, exchequer, navy, victualling, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRALTY\">admiralty</a>, pay of the army or navy, secretaries of state, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a>, stamps, appeals, wine-licenses, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HACKNEY\">hackney</a>-coaches, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HAWKERS\">hawkers</a>, and pedlars), nor any persons that hold any new office under the crown created since 1705, are capable of being elected or fitting as members. 6. That no person having a pension under the crown during <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, or for any term of years, is capable of being elected or fitting. 7. That if any member accepts an office under the crown, except an officer in the army or navy accepting a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>, his seat is void; but such member is capable of being re-elected. 8. That all knights of the shire shall be actual knights, or such notable esquires and gentlemen as have estates sufficient to be knights, and by no means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of yeomen. This is reduced to a still greater certainty, by ordaining, 9. That every knight of a shire shall have a clear estate of freehold or copyhold to the value of \u00a3600 per annum, and every citizen and burgess to the value of \u00a3300; except the eldest sons of peers and of persons qualified to be knights of shires, and except the members for the two universities; which somewhat balances the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASCENDANT\">ascendant</a> which the boroughs have gained over the counties, by obliging the trading interest to make choice of landed men: and of this qualification the member must make oath, and give in the particulars in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> of his taking his seat. But, subject to these standing restrictions and disqualifications, every subject of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REALM\">realm</a> is eligible of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> right: though there are instances, wherein persons in particular circumstances have forfeited that common right, and have been declared ineligible for that parliament, by a vote of the house of commons, or for ever, by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> of the legislature. But it was an unconstitutional prohibition, which was grounded on an ordinance of the house of lords, and inserted in the king's writs, for the parliament held at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COVENTRY\">Coventry</a>, 6 Hen. IV. that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPRENTICE\">apprentice</a> or other man of the law should be elected a knight for the shire therein; in return for which, our lawbooks and historians have branded this parliament with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of parliamentum indocilem, or the lack-learning parliament; and Sir Edward <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COKE\">Coke</a> observes with some spleen, that there was never a good law made thereat.\n\n(3.) The third point, regarding elections, is the method of proceeding therein. This is also regulated by the law of parliament, and the several statutes referred to in the margin below (b); all which we shall blend together, and extract out of them a summary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the method of proceeding to elections.\n\nAs soon as the parliament is summoned, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LORD\">lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CHANCELLOR\">chancellor</a> (or if a vacancy happens during the sitting of parliament, the speaker, by order of the house, and without such order if a vacancy happens by death in the time of a recess for upwards of 20 days) sends his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARRANT\">warrant</a> to the clerk of the crown in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHANCERY\">chancery</a>; who thereupon issues out writs to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SHERIFF\">sheriff</a> of every county, for the election of all the members to serve for that county, and every city and borough therein. Within three days after the receipt of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRIT\">writ</a>, the sheriff is to send his precept, under his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEAL\">seal</a>, to the proper returning officers of the cities and boroughs, commanding them to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECT\">elect</a> their members; and the said returning officers are to proceed to election within eight days from the receipt of the precept, giving four days notice of the same; and to return the persons chosen, together with the precept, to the sheriff.\n\nBut elections of knights of the shire must be proceeded to by the sheriffs themselves in person, at the next county-court that shall happen after the delivery of the writ. The county court is a court held every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> or oftener by the sheriff, intended to try little causes not exceeding the value of 40s. in what part of the county he pleases to appoint for that purpose: but for the election of knights of the shire, it must be held at the most usual place. If the county-court falls upon the day of delivering the writ, or within six days after, the sheriff may adjourn the court and election to some other convenient time, not longer than 16 days, nor shorter than 10: but he cannot alter the place, without the consent of all the candidates; and, in all such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, 10 days public notice must be given of the time and place of the election.\n\nAnd, as it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> to the very being of parliament that elections should be absolutely free, therefore all undue influences upon the electors are illegal, and strongly prohibited. For Mr Locke ranks it among those breaches of trust in the executive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGISTRATE\">magistrate</a>, which, according to his notions, amount to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISSOLUTION\">dissolution</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, \"if he employs the force, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a>, and offices of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> to corrupt the representatives, or openly to pre-engage the electors, and prescribe what manner of persons shall be chosen: For thus to regulate candidates and electors, and new-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> the ways of election, what is it (says he) but to cut up the government by the roots and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POISON\">poison</a> the very fountain of public security?\" As soon, therefore, as the time and place of election, either in counties or boroughs, are fixed, all soldiers quartered in the place are to remove, at least one day before the election, to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of two miles or more; and not to return till one day after the poll is ended. Riots likewise have been frequently determined to make an election void. By vote also of the house of commons, to whom alone belongs the power of determining contested elections, no lord of parliament, or lord-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a> of a county, hath any right to interfere in the election of commoners; and, by statute, the lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARDEN\">warden</a> of the cinque-ports shall not recommend any members there. If any officer of the excise, customs, stamps, or certain other branches of the revenue, presume to intermeddle in elections, by persuading any voter or diffusing him, he forfeits 100l. and is disabled to hold any office.\n\nThus\n\n(b) 7 Hen. IV. c. 15. 8 Hen. VI. c. 7. 23 Hen. VI. c. 14. 1 W. & M. st. 1. c. 2. 2 W. & M. st. 1. c. 7. 5 and 6 W. & M. c. 20. 7 W. III. c. 4. 7 and 8 W. III. c. 7. and c. 25. 10 & 11 W. III. c. 7. 12 and 13 W. III. c. 10. 6 Ann. c. 23. 9 Ann. c. 5. 10 Ann. c. 19. and c. 33. 2 Geo. II. c. 24. 8 Geo. II. c. 30. 18 Geo. II. c. 18. 19 Geo. II. c. 28. 10 Geo. III. c. 16. 11 Geo. III. c. 42. 14 Geo. III. c. 15.\nThus are the electors of one branch of the legislature secured from any undue influence from either of the other two, and from all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> violence and compulsion. But the greatest danger is that in which themselves co-operate, by the infamous practice of bribery and corruption. To prevent which it is enacted, that no candidate shall, after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> (usually called the tele) of the writs, or after the vacancy, give any money or entertainment to his electors, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> to give any, either to particular persons, or to the place in general, in order to his being elected; on pain of being incapable to serve for that place in parliament. And if any money, gift, office, employment, or reward be given, or promised to be given, to any voter, at any time, in order to influence him to give or withhold his vote, as well he that takes as he that offers such bribe forfeits 500l. and is for ever disabled from voting and holding any office in any corporation; unless, before <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVICTION\">conviction</a>, he will discover some other offender of the same kind, and then he is indemnified for his own offence. The first instance that occurs of election bribery, was so early as 13 Eliz. when one Thomas Longe (being a simple man, and of small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> to serve in parliament) acknowledged that he had given the returning officer and others of the borough for which he was chosen four pounds to be returned member, and was for that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREMIUM\">premium</a> elected. But for this offence the borough was amerced, the member was removed, and the officer fined and imprisoned. But as this practice hath since taken much deeper and more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> root, it hath occasioned the making of these wholesome statutes; to complete the efficacy of which, there is nothing wanting but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> and integrity to put them in strict execution.\n\nUndue influence being thus guarded against, the election is to be proceeded to on the day appointed; the sheriff or other returning officer first taking an oath against bribery, and for the due execution of his office. The candidates likewise, if required, must swear to their qualification, and the electors in counties to theirs; and the electors both in counties and boroughs are also compelled to take the oath of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ABJURATION\">abjuration</a>, and that against bribery and corruption. And it might not be amiss, if the members elected were bound to take the latter oath as well as the former; which, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, would be much more effectual than administering it only to the electors.\n\nThe election being closed, the returning officer in boroughs returns his precept to the sheriff, with the persons elected by the majority; and the sheriff returns the whole, together with the writ for the county and the knights elected thereupon, to the clerk of the crown in chancery; before the day of meeting, if it be a new parliament, or within 14 days after the election, if it be an occasional vacancy; and this under penalty of 500l. If the sheriff does not return such knights only as are duly elected, he forfeits, by the old statutes of Henry VI. 100l.; and the returning officer in boroughs, for a like <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> return, 40l.; and they are besides liable to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a>, in which double damages shall be recovered, by the later statutes of King William: and any person bribing the returning officer shall also forfeit 300l. But the members returned by him are the fitting members, until the house of commons, upon petition, shall adjudge the return to be false and illegal. The form and manner of proceeding upon such petition are now regulated by statute 1 Geo. III. c. 16. (amended by 11 Geo. III. c. 42. and made perpetual by 14 Geo. III. c. 15.), which directs the method of choosing by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a> a select <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMITTEE\">committee</a> of 15 members, who are sworn well and truly to try the same, and a true judgment to give, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>.\n\nElection of Scots Peers.

II. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>. 14. If any persons, that have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> in elections, take any reward for an election in any church, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLEGE\">college</a>, school, &c. the election shall be void. And if any persons of such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETIES\">societies</a> resign their places to others for reward, they incur a forfeiture of double the sum; and both the parties are rendered incapable of the place. Stat. 31 Eliz. cap. 6.\n\nElection of a Verderor of the Forest (electione viridariorum forelic), in Law, a writ that lies for the choice of a verderor, where any of the verderors of the forest are dead, or removed from their offices.

And thus particular nations were elected to the participation of the outward blessings of Christianity.\n\nElection also, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> of some divines, signifies a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREDETERMINATION\">predetermination</a> to grace and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a>, and sometimes to glory only.

In 1692, a ninth electorate was created, by the emperor Leopold, in favour of the duke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HANOVER\">Hanover</a>, of the house of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRUNSWICK\">Brunswick</a>-L\u00fcneburg.\n\nThere is this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the secular and ecclesiastical electors, that the first have an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSIVE\">passive</a> voice, that is, may choose and be chosen; the last, an active only.

Thus if a metallic rod or wire pointed at one end and rounded at the other, be attached by the pointed extremity to an excited electric, or even placed very near this, the rounded extremity will attract light bodies, and emit sparks. As these substances are found to convey or conduct the electric power to any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, they are called conductors.\n\nIt is found that all bodies in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> are either electrics or conductors. Neither of these classes of bodies are, however, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> electrics or conductors, as there are few electrics which may not under some circumstances be made to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> as conductors, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the other hand, many conductors may be so far excited as to become in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> electrics per se (b). The following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> exhibits the electrics and conductors arranged according to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of electrical or conducting power.\n\n**Electrics.**\n\n- Glass and all vitrifications, even the metallic vitrifications.\n- All precious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, of which the most transparent are the best.\n- Amber.\n- Sulphur.\n- All resinous substances.\n- Wax.\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">Silk</a>.\n- Cotton.\n- Several dry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> animal substances, as feathers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>, &c.\n- Paper.\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">White</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, and sugar-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDY\">candy</a>.\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">Air</a>, and other permanently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> fluids.\n- Oils.\n- Dry and complete oxides of metallic substances.\n- The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASHES\">ashes</a> of animal and vegetable substances.\n- Dry vegetable substances.\n- Most hard stones, of which the hardest are the best.\n\n**Conductors.**\n\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">Gold</a>.\n- Silver.\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">Copper</a>.\n- Platina.\n- Brasses.\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">Iron</a>.\n- Tin.\n- Quicksilver.\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">Lead</a>.\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SEMI\">Semi</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>, more or less.\n- Metallic ores, more or less.\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARCOAL\">Charcoal</a>, either of animal or of vegetable substances.\n- The fluids of an animal body.\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">Water</a> (especially <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> water), and all fluids, excepting the aerial, and oils.\n- The effluvia of flaming bodies.\n- Congealed water, viz. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ICE\">ice</a> or snow.\n- Most saline substances, of which the metallic salts are the best.\n- Several earthy or stony substances.\n- <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">Smoke</a>.\n- The vapour of hot water.\n- Electricity pervades also such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a>, or absence of air, as is caused by the best air-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>; but not the perfect absence of air, or the torricellian vacuum, formed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> the quicksilver in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a> tube.\n\nMany of the substances given in the above table are found to change their nature under certain circumstances. Thus, among the electrics, glass heated to redness, melted resins, baked wood when very hot, and heated air, are tolerably good conductors; and glass, which is usually the best electric, is sometimes from causes which have not been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> ascertained a very bad electric. The excitability of glass vessels is found to differ according to the degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a> of the included air; when this is rarefied as much as possible, the external surface of the vessel cannot be excited, while the internal surface exhibits strong marks of electric power; but when the included air is considerably condensed, the internal surface shows no marks of electric power, while the external is much more excitable than usual.\n\nAmong the conductors, the conducting power of charcoal varies in proportion to the degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> to which it has been exposed in the making, as, when imperfectly burned, it is a bad conductor. Indeed it is worth remarking here, that wood is capable of being made an electric or a conductor several times alternately according to its state. When fresh cut, it is a good conductor; thoroughly dried by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAKING\">baking</a>, it becomes, as we have seen an electric; burned to charcoal, it is again a conductor; but when reduced to ashes, it is once more made an electric.\n\nIce (c) is placed among the conductors: but in an experiment of M. Acharde, it appeared that when distilled water was gradually frozen, so that one side of the vessel retained its fluid, and therefore permitted the air to escape, the ice thus produced would not conduct, but on the contrary became a very good electric, and was employed as such. Snow is a much worse conductor than ice. Water is a conductor, and so are the secondary salts; it is found that when water is impregnated with a salt, its conducting power is much increased.\n\nWe have, after Mr Cavallo, placed the salts among conductors; but in strict propriety, this conducting power must be confined to salts in the state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CRYSTALS\">crystals</a>, as it has been proved by decisive experiments, that salts,\n\n(b) The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between electrics and conductors was first observed by Mr Stephen Grey in 1759, but the terms conductor and electric per se, were first employed in this present <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a> by Dr Defaguliers.\n\n(c) The conducting power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> ice was first shown by M. Jallabert, professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENEVA\">Geneva</a>; there seem, however, to have been various opinions respecting this fact till it was fully ascertained by Dr Priestley. Vid. Priestley's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of Electricity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">Part</a> viii. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">sect</a>. 4.\nGeneral salts, when deprived of their water of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRYSTALLIZATION\">crystallization</a>, become non-conductors. The conducting power of crystallized salts is therefore probably owing to the water which they contain.\n\nElectricities are called non-conductors, as they do not readily transmit electric power; they may hence be employed to check the passage of this power, or to confine its influence. When a body communicates with a conducting substance, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, a table, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> body, &c., the electric power easily passes off; but when it is supported by an electric, the power may be retained for a considerable time. In this latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> the body is said to be inflamed.\n\nWe have seen (1, 3), that fire or light appears to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> from an excited electric; and, this appearance is stronger in proportion to the size of the electric, and the degree of friction which it has undergone. When a rounded body, as the knuckle or a metallic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a>, is presented to the excited electric, the fire appears to dart from it in a spark; but if the presented body be pointed, the fire will appear to issue in a stream composed of luminous rays. These rays will take a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, according to the substance with which the electric is rubbed, and other circumstances which will be explained hereafter. In the case of the glass tube rubbed with the hand, when a pointed body, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a>, or wire, is presented to the tube, the luminous rays will appear like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a> around the point. The same appearance will take <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> on presenting a point to a stick of sealing-wax rubbed with any metallic body, as a piece of tin foil; but when the sealing-wax is rubbed with a piece of woollen cloth, the rays will appear to issue from the point in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> diverging towards the wax. In some experiments which will afterwards be described, the stream of fire appears in an evident current in a direction from the electric in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, as in the tube excited as above, and towards the electric in others, as in the wax rubbed with the woollen cloth.\n\nPositive and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> electricity, when glass is rubbed with most substances, positive electricity is excited, and negative when resinous bodies are rubbed with most substances, the former is often called vitreous, and the latter resinous electricity.\n\nThe difference of these two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of the electric power may be further illustrated by the following simple experiment.\n\nLet a piece of glass (A, B, fig. 1.) be fixed in a wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEDESTAL\">pedestal</a> C. Through the upper extremity A, pass a wire A, D, with a rounded end at D, and from this end suspend two very fine silk threads a, b. These threads in the usual state of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> will hang in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> position a, b, but if the end of the wire to which they are attached be presented to the excited tube, the threads will diverge from each other, and take a position as at c, d. If in this diverging state they are presented to an excited stick of sealing-wax, they will collapse into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> position. Again, the threads presented first to the excited sealing-wax will diverge, but presented in this state to the excited tube will collapse, thus showing that these two states are opposite to each other, each destroying the effect produced by the other.\n\nThe following table shows what kind of electricity will be excited by rubbing various electrics with different bodies.\n\n| Substance          | Positive | Negative |\n|--------------------|----------|----------|\n| Every substance    |          |          |\n| with which         |          |          |\n| it has been        |          |          |\n| hitherto tried     |          |          |\n| Smooth glass       | Positive |          |\n| Rough glass        | Positive |          |\n| Tourmalin          | Positive |          |\n| Hare's skin        | Positive |          |\n| White silk         | Positive |          |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">Black</a> silk         | Positive |          |\n| Sealing-wax        | Positive |          |\n| Baked wood         | Positive |          |\n\nIt appears from (3) that the power of producing electrified electrical appearances may be communicated from any bodies excited electric to a conductor. The more perfect the conductor, the more easily does it receive the electric power. Electrics may also be made to receive this power from excited electrics, but it is communicated to these with more difficulty than to conductors. When any body, whether electric or conductor, is made to exhibit electrical phenomena, either by being excited, or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a>, it is said to be electrified.\nPART I.\n\nGeneral Phenomena.\n\nIt had been observed by Mr Hawkesbee, that on shaking <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> in a glass vessel, in the dark, a considerable light was produced, and that this was much more remarkable when the air in the vessel was considerably rarefied. He called the light which he conceived to be emitted from the mercury, mercurial phosphorus.\n\nMr Cavallo found that, by shaking mercury in a glass tube hermetically sealed, and in which the air was pretty much rarefied, the tube was sensibly electrified on the outside; but the electricity produced was not constant, nor in proportion to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGITATION\">agitation</a>. From this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> he was led to make some experiments, the results of which are very curious.\n\nHe prepared several tubes such as are represented at fig. 2, Plate CLXXXVII., about 3 inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, and with glass tubes.\n\nThey were closed at one end, and contained each three fourths of an ounce of mercury, which being made to boil, the air within the tube was rarefied and the open end was then hermetically sealed. Having made the tube clean and a little warm, he caused the mercury to flow from the one end to the other, by gently elevating and depressing either end, alternately, while the tube was held nearly in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> position. The tube was thus rendered electrical, so that the end where the mercury stood was electrified positively (p) and all the remaining part of the tube negatively. If the mercury was made to flow from the positive end to the negative, by elevating the former, the end to which it flowed became positive, while the rest of the tube acquired a negative electricity; but if in elevating the positive end where the mercury stood, that end were not touched with the hand, it became negative only in a slight degree, and if the mercury was made to flow back to it, and again retire from it, still without touching it, it became positive; whereas by touching it while elevating it, it was rendered strongly negative. The electric power was always strongest at the positive end. The electric power at either end was made much more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> by coating each end for about two inches with tin foil, as represented in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>, so that the tubes would sometimes emit sparks on being brought near a conductor.\n\nWe have seen (6) that when an electric is once excited, it retains the electric power for some time. Glass is one of the most remarkable electrics in this respect.\n\nMr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTON\">Canton</a> procured some very thin glass balls, about an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> and a half in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, with slender tubular stems of eight or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> inches in length. He electrified these balls in the inside, or semi-positive, and then sealed the stems hermetically. On examining them after some time, he found that they showed no signs of electricity; but on holding them at a small distance from the fire, they became strongly electrical, and still more so as they cooled. On repeatedly heating them, he found that the electric power diminished, but it was not impaired by keeping them for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> under water. One of them which he had heated several times before immersing it in water, and again several times after lying for a week in water, still retained a considerable degree of electric power at the end of above a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a>; and even at the end of six years they had not entirely lost it.\n\nMr Henley having electrified a small bottle, observed that it showed signs of electricity seventy days after, though it had stood all that time in a cupboard.\n\nOn the 5th February he excited a glass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>; and from that time till the 10th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">March</a> following, various methods were employed to destroy its electricity. These always succeeded at the time, and the cylinder lost all signs of electricity; but these signs returned again without any fresh excitation, and on the 10th of March the cylinder still retained considerable electric power. The marks of electricity sometimes became stronger or weaker, or even quite disappeared and returned without any evident cause. The electricity was generally strongest when the wind was northerly, or when it had returned after having been destroyed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>; it was generally weakest when there was a fire in the room where it was kept, or when the door was left open. He repeated the excitation, but not always with the same success; for some times the cylinder would lose all signs of electricity in a fortnight, and at others in twelve <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, till it was again excited.\n\n*Phil. Trans. lxvii.\n\nChap. II. Of the Phenomena produced by excited Silk.\n\nSilk was first discovered to be an electric in the year 1729 by Mr Stephen Grey, while making experiments with his friend Mr Wheeler. These gentlemen attempted to conduct the electric power to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> distance by means of silk lines, as Mr Grey had done before by means of packthread; but they were disappointed, as they found that the silk refused to conduct.\n\n(d) The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of distinguishing between positive and negative electricity will be more fully explained hereafter, as well as the modes in which either may be produced at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>. But it may be proper here to show a simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of distinguishing these two states of the electric power, which may be done by means of the instrument described in (8). The electricity shown by excited polished glass was said to be positive; and it appeared that the threads of the instrument separated when brought near an excited tube, as also when brought near excited sealing wax, the electricity of which is negative. If, therefore, when the threads are made to diverge by excited glass, they diverge still farther, or remain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a> on being made to approach any other electrified body, the electricity of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> is positive; but if they collapse, it is negative. Again if the threads, when made to diverge by excited sealing wax, diverge still farther, or remain stationary on being made to approach another electrified body, the electricity of this is negative; but if they collapse, it is positive.\nGeneral but seemed rather to retain the electric power; no experiments of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> were however made on this subject, till 1759, when Mr Symmer presented to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of observations which he had made on silk stockings.\n\nHe had been accustomed to wear two pairs of silk stockings; a black and a white. When these were put off both together, no signs of electricity appeared; but on pulling off the black ones from the white, he heard a snapping or cracking noise, and in the dark perceived sparks of fire between them. To produce this and the following appearances in great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>, it was only necessary to draw his hand several times backward and forward over his leg with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOCKING\">stocking</a> upon it.\n\nWhen the stockings were separated and held at a distance from each other, both of them appeared to be highly excited; the white stocking positively, and the black negatively. While they were kept at a distance from each other, both of them appeared inflated to such a degree, that they exhibited the entire shape of the leg. When two black or two white stockings were held in one hand, they would repel one another with considerable force, making an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> seemingly of 30 or 35 degrees. When a white and black stocking were presented to each other, they were mutually attracted; and if permitted, would rush together with surprising violence. As they approached, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFLATION\">inflation</a> gradually subsided, and their attraction of foreign objects diminished, but their attraction of one another increased; when they actually met, they became flat, and joined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> together like as many folds of silk. When separated again, their electric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> did not seem to be in the least impaired for having once met; and the same appearances would be exhibited by them for a considerable time. When the experiment was made with two black stockings in one hand, and two white ones in the other, they were thrown into a strange agitation, owing to the attraction between those of different colours, and the repulsion between those of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of attractions and repulsions made the stockings <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CATCH\">catch</a> at each other at greater distances than otherwise they would have done, and afforded a very curious spectacle.\n\nWhen the stockings were suffered to meet; they stuck together with considerable force. At first Mr Symmer found they required from one to 12 ounces to separate them. Another time they raised 17 ounces, which was 20 times the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of the stocking that supported them; and this in a direction parallel to its surface. When one of the stockings was turned inside out, and put within the other, it required 20 ounces to separate them; though at that time ten ounces were sufficient when applied externally. Getting the black stockings new dyed, and the white ones washed, and whitened in the fumes of sulphur, and then putting them one within the other, with the rough sides together, it required three pounds three ounces to separate them. With stockings of a more substantial make, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-COHESION\">cohesion</a> was still greater. When the white stocking was put within the black one, so that the outside of the white was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> to the inside of the black, they raised nine pounds wanting a few ounces; and when the two rough surfaces were contiguous, they raised 15 pounds one pennyweight and a half. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">Cutting</a> off the ends of the thread and the tufts of silk which had been left in the inside of the stockings, was found to be very unfavourable to these experiments.\n\nMr Symmer also observed, that pieces of white and black silk, when highly electrified, not only cohered with each other, but would also adhere to bodies with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> and even polished surfaces, though these bodies were not electrified. This he discovered accidentally; having, without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, thrown a stocking out of his hand, which stuck to the paper-hangings of the room. He repeated the experiment, and found it would continue hanging near an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>. Having stuck up the black and white stockings in this manner, he came with another pair highly electrified; and applying the white to the black, and the black to the white, he carried them off from the wall, each of them hanging to that which had been brought to it. The same experiments held with the painted boards of the room, and likewise with the looking-glass, to the smooth surface of which both the white and the black silk appeared to adhere more tenaciously than to either of the former.\n\nSimilar experiments, but with a greater variety of circumstances, were afterwards made by Mr Cigna on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURIN\">Turin</a>, upon white and black ribbons. He took two white silk ribbons <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> dried at the fire, and extended them upon a smooth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, whether a conducting or electric substance was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> of indifference. He then drew over them the sharp edge of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-IVORY\">ivory</a> ruler, and found that both ribbons had acquired electricity enough to adhere to the plain; though while they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> there, they showed no other sign of it. When taken up separately, they were both negatively electrified, and would repel each other. In their separation, electric sparks were perceived between them; but when again put on the plain, or forced together, no light was perceived without another friction. When by the operation just now mentioned they had acquired the negative electricity, if they were placed, not upon the smooth body on which they had been rubbed, but on a rough conducting substance, they would, on their separation, show contrary electricities, which would again disappear on their being joined together. If they had been made to repel each other, and were afterwards forced together, and placed on the rough surface above mentioned, they would in a few minutes be mutually attracted; the lowermost being positively and the uppermost negatively electrified.\n\nIf the two white ribbons received their friction upon the rough surface, they always acquired contrary electricities. The upper one was negatively, and the lower one positively electrified, in whatever manner they were taken off. The same change was instantaneously produced by any pointed conductor. If two ribbons, for instance, were made to repel, and the point of a needle drawn opposite to one of them along its whole length, they would immediately rush together.\n\nPrinciples of Electricity illustrated by experiment.\n\nElectricity at some distance from the other plate. Then cut some small figures of men or other objects in paper, or what is better, form them out of the dry pitch of elder, or of rushes, and lay them on the lower plate. On working the machine the figures will rise from the lower plate, and move perpetually from the one plate to the other as represented in the figure.\n\nExper. 3.\u2014Let a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> rod of glass, as a, fig. 21, be made to pass through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BELL\">bell</a> b, perforated for the purpose, and let one end of the rod be fixed in a wooden foot, while the other supports two metallic arms, c d e f, crooking each other, and knobbled at their extremities. From each extremity let a small bell without a clapper be suspended by a metallic wire, and from each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a>, at a little distance from the extremities, let the clappers of these bells be suspended by filken threads. On connecting the top of the stand with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIME\">prime</a> conductor, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> the machine in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, the clappers will begin to move between the central bell and the other four so as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a> the whole five.\n\nHere the bells receive the electric power from the prime conductor, and being electrified, attract and repel the clappers which hang freely between them.\n\nExper. 4.\u2014Tie a small body, as for instance a light piece of cork, to a silk thread about eight inches long, and holding the thread by its end, let the small body hang at the distance of about eight inches from the side of the prime conductor electrified. This small body, if the electrification of the conductor is not strong, will not be attracted. But if a finger or any conducting substance be presented to that side of the small body which is farthest from the prime conductor, then the small body will immediately move toward the prime conductor; and when this body has touched the prime conductor, it will be instantly repelled from it, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the repulsion existing between bodies possessed of the same kind of electricity.\n\nIndeed, if this insulated body be very near to the prime conductor, or the prime conductor strongly electrified, then the small body will be attracted without presenting to it any conducting substance; or the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> fluid belonging to that body will be all crowded on that side of it which is nearest to the prime conductor.\n\nIf this small body, instead of the silk, be suspended by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> thread, it will be attracted at a much greater distance, than in the other case.\n\nBodies in the same state of electricity, i.e., which are all electrified positively, or all negatively, have a tendency to repel each other.\n\nExper. 1.\u2014Stick a downy feather into one of the holes of the prime conductor. When the cylinder is moved the feather will begin to swell, and its plumes will separate to a considerable distance from each other.\n\nThis experiment may be varied, by placing the representation of a human <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> upon the prime conductor. When the cylinder is moved, the hair of the head will bristle up and stand erect as represented in Plate CLXXXVII fig. 22.\n\nExper. 2.\u2014Let small balls made of cork or the pith of elder well dried, be suspended from the prime conductor by threads of an equal length. While the cylinder continues at rest, the balls will touch each other, but as soon as the machine is set in motion they will repel each other to a greater or less distance, according as the electric power produced is stronger or weaker.\n\nIt is not necessary that the threads be in contact with the prime conductor, for if the balls be brought near the conductor while the machine is in motion, they will recede from each other as before.\n\nThe same effect will be produced whether the balls are hung from the positive or the negative conductor.\n\nFrom the circumstance observed in the above experiments we deduce the following important corollary.\n\nObjects brought near an electrified body are electrified Corollary by position.\n\nThe communication of electricity from an electrified body, to another which is not in contact with it, but is only in its vicinity, may for the present be conceived by remarking that these bodies are surrounded with air. Air, although an electric, is not a very perfect electric, but is more or less also a conductor, especially when it is moist. When a body is electrified it communicates to the air in contact with it a portion of its electric power, and thus the air becomes electrified, and of course imparts to the bodies, which are surrounded by it a degree of electricity; and this the more easily as it is in a better conducting state.\n\nThe apparent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the air in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> electricity to a body which is surrounded by it, may be illustrated by the following experiments.\n\nInflate in a horizontal position a metallic rod about two feet long, having blunt ends, and at one of its ends suspend an electrometer, like that represented in fig. 116; then bring within three or four inches distance of its other end an excited glass tube. On the approach of the tube, the balls of the electrometer will open, and if you present towards them a body positively electrified, you will perceive that they diverge with positive electricity. If the tube be removed, the balls come together again, and no electricity remains in them, or in the metallic rod. But if while the tube is near one end of the rod, and the balls diverge with positive electricity, the other end of the rod, viz. that from which the electrometer hangs, be touched with some conductor, the cork balls will come immediately together, and they will remain so when the conductor has been removed\u2014remove now the excited glass tube, and the balls will immediately diverge with negative electricity\u2014which shows that the rod remains electrified negatively.\n\nIf the above experiment be made with an electric negatively electrified (for instance, a rod of sealing-wax instead of the excited glass tube) then the apparent electricities in the rod will be just the reverse of what they were before; for in this case, that end of the rod to which the electric has been presented, will be positive, and the opposite end negative; which opposite end, if touched in this state with some conducting substance, will acquire some electric power from that substance; and when, after that substance has been removed, the excited electric is also removed, the rod will remain positive.\n\nIn making this experiment, care must be taken that the end of the rod be very blunt, and that the electric be not very powerfully excited; otherwise a spark may pass from this to the rod, which renders the experiment precarious.\nTake two rods of metal, each about a foot long, furnished with knobs at both ends; and, either by silk lines or by inflating stools, inflate them, so that they may stand horizontally in one direction, and about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of an inch distance from one another. To the middle of each of these rods hang an electrometer, like that represented in fig. 16. This done, take an excited glass tube, and bring it to about three inches distance from the knob of one of the rods; on doing which, the electrometers of both rods will appear electrified: keep the tube in that situation for about two seconds, then remove it. The rods now will remain electrified, as appears by the electrometers; the first, viz. that to which the excited tube had been presented, remaining negative, and the other positive.\n\nIn this experiment, if, instead of the glass tube, an electric, negatively excited, be brought near the end of one rod, then that rod will be electrified positively, and the other negatively.\n\nThis is all that we can properly explain at present with respect to the agency of the air in the production of electrical phenomena. We shall take occasion to consider this subject more fully in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> part of this article, when we shall see that a variety in the state of the air produces considerable diversity in the phenomena.\n\nOn the principle of electric repulsion and the above corollary depend the action of several instruments which are of great use in electrical experiments, and which we shall now describe.\n\nInstruments which are employed to ascertain the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of electricity are called electroscopes. As they are generally employed to measure the degree of electricity produced, they are also called electrometers, and by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> we shall in future distinguish them.\n\nThe first electrometer appears to have been constructed by the abbe Nollet; it consisted of two threads of silk, which, as has been shown, recede from each other on the approach of an electrified body. He observed the angle of their divergency by its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> placed behind them. Mr Watzlitz this electrometer by appending small weights to the threads.\n\nMr Canton contrived an electrometer which is the foundation of those which are now in common use. He got a pair of balls turned in a lathe out of the dry pith of elder; these he hung by threads of the finest linen, and kept them in a narrow box with a sliding cover, where they were disposed that the threads could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> straight. When he was to use it, he held the box by the extremity of the cover, and allowed the balls to hang freely from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> to which they were fixed.\n\nFig. 15 represents a stand supporting the electrometers DD, CC. B is the basis of it, made of common wood. A is a pillar of wax, glass, or baked wood. To the top of the pillar, if it be of wax or glass, a circular piece of wood is fixed; but if the pillar be of baked wood, that may constitute the whole. From this circular piece of wood proceed four arms of glass, or baked wood, suspending at their ends four electrometers, two of which, DD, are silk threads about eight inches long, suspending each a small downy feather at its end. The other two electrometers, CC, are those with very small balls of cork, or of the pith of elder; and they are constructed in the following manner:\u2014\n\nA stick of glass about six inches long, covered with sealing-wax, and shaped at top in a ring: from the lower extremity of this stick of glass proceed two fine linen threads (m) cc, about five inches long, each suspending a cork or pith-ball d, about one-eighth of an inch in diameter. When this electrometer is not electrified, the threads cc hang parallel to each other, and the cork-balls are in contact; but when electrified, they repel one another, as represented in the figure. The glass stick ab serves for an insulating handle, by which the electrometer may be supported, when it is used without the stand AB.\n\nAnother <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of the above electrometer is represented in fig. 16; which consists of a linen thread, having at each end a small cork-ball. The electrometer is suspended by the middle of the thread on any conductor proper for the purpose, and serves to show the kind and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of its electricity.\n\nFig. 17 represents the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a> electrometer of Mr Henly, one of the most useful instruments of the kind yet discovered, as well for measuring the degree of electricity of any body, as to ascertain the quantity of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> before an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a>; and to discover the exact time the electricity of a jar changes, when without making an explosion, it is discharged by giving it a quantity of the contrary electricity. The pillar LM is generally made of wood, the graduated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a> NOP of ivory, the rod RS is made of very light wood, with a pith ball at the extremity; it turns upon the centre of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEMICIRCLE\">semicircle</a>, so as always to keep near its surface; the extremity of the stem LM may either be fitted to the conductor or the knob of a jar. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> is electrified, the rod is repelled by the stem, and moves along the graduated arch of the semicircle, so as to mark the degree to which the conductor is electrified, or the height to which the charge of the jar is advanced.\n\nBeccaria recommends fixing the index between two semicircles, because when it is placed over one only, the electricity of this repels and counteracts the motion of the index. Other improvements and variations have been made in this instrument, which will be described hereafter.\n\nThe first account of Mr Henly's electrometer was given in the Phil. Trans. vol. lxiii. by Dr Priestley, who speaks of it in very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> terms in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Dr Franklin. He considers it as a perfect instrument for measuring degrees of electricity, but it will appear hereafter that this is not the case.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> in Mr Henly's quadrant is divided into equal parts; but M. Achard has already shewn that when this is the case, the angle at which the index is suspended by the electric repulsion is not a true measure of the repulsive force; to estimate which truly, scale he demonstrates that the arc of the electrometer should\n\n(m) These threads should be wetted in a weak solution of salt.\nPrinciples of Electricity illustrated by experiment.\n\nThe balls of the ordinary electrometer may be made of pith or cork, but the latter must be very smooth and well polished. They are best made in a turner's lathe. They may be made of any shape, provided they are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> and free from edges. A very convenient electrometer is made of two long, slender pieces of ruff pith, made and appended to short threads of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAX\">flax</a>. These may easily be hung parallel to each other, whereas in the usual ball-electrometers the threads to which the balls are hung form an angle with each other. This parallelism of the threads is of advantage, and was considered of so much consequence by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> Stanhope (better known to electricians by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> of Lord <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAHON\">Mahon</a>) that he was at great pains to suspend his balls in a parallel position.\n\nOf all the instruments by which it has been attempted to measure electricity, none have been found to answer the purpose better than that invented by Mr Benet, and which is represented in fig. 18. It consists of two slips of gold <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>, a a, suspended in a glass cylinder b. The foot, c, may be made of wood or metal, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>, d, should be of metal; the latter being made flat at top for the convenience of putting anything upon it that is to be electrified. The cap is about an inch wider than the diameter of the glass, and its rim about three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of an inch broad, hanging parallel to the glass to keep it sufficiently inflated, and to turn off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a>, when the instrument is employed in experiments on atmospheric electricity. Within this is another circular rim about half as broad as the former, lined with silk or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELVET\">velvet</a>, so that it may be made to fit the outside of the glass exactly, while the cap may be easily taken off to repair any damage done to the gold leaf. From the centre of the cap hangs a thin tube somewhat longer than the depth of the inner rim, in which a small peg, f, is placed, which may be taken out occasionally. To this peg, which is rounded at one end and flat at the other, two slips of gold leaf are fastened with paste, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GUM\">gum</a> water, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a>. They are about a fifth part of an inch broad and two inches long, and are generally made tapering to a point. In one side of the cap is a small tube, g, to place wires in; h, h, are two long pieces of tin-foil fastened with varnish on opposite sides of the internal surface of the glass, where the slips of gold leaf may be expected to strike, and in connexion with the foot of the instrument. The upper end of the glass is covered and lined with sealing-wax as low as the outer rim, in order to make the insulation more complete.\n\nAn improvement on this electrometer is to make the cylinder pretty long, and to have a small additional tube of gum lac on the end of it. The slips of tinfoil reach almost to the edge of the outer rim, and are sharply pointed at the top, widening in the middle and decreasing in breadth again as they descend.\n\nThe great advantage of this instrument over the electrometers which we have described above is its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a>, which will appear from the following examples.\n\n1. On putting powdered chalk into a pair of bellows and blowing it upon the cap, this was electrified positively when the nozzle of the bellows was about six inches from it; but at the distance of three feet from the nozzle, the same stream electrified the cap negatively. Thus it appears that the electricity may be changed from positive to negative merely from the circumstance of this stream of chalk being more widely diffused in the air. It may also be changed by placing a bunch of fine wire, silk, or feathers, in the nozzle of the bellows: and it is likewise negative when the air is blown from a pair of bellows wanting the iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIPE\">pipe</a>, so that it may come out in a larger stream; but this last experiment succeeded best when the air was damp. There is likewise a remarkable difference between the experiments in which the electricity is positive and that in which it is negative; the former being communicated to the cap with some degree of permanency, so that the slips of gold leaf continue for some time to diverge; but the latter being only momentary, and the slips collapsing as soon as the cloud of chalk is dispersed. The greater permanency of the electricity in the former case is owing to some of the chalk sticking to the cap when the nozzle of the bellows is very near it.\n\n2. A piece of chalk drawn over a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>, or powdered chalk put into the brush, and projected upon the cap, electrifies it negatively; but its electricity is not communicated.\n\n3. Powdered chalk blown with the mouth or bellows from a metal plate placed upon the cap, communicates to the cap a permanent positive electricity. If the chalk is blown from the plate either insulated or not so, that the powder may pass over the cap, if not too far off, the electricity communicated is also positive; or if a brush be placed upon the cap and a piece of chalk be drawn over it, the slips of gold-leaf when the hand is withdrawn gradually open with positive electricity as the cloud of chalk disperses.\n\n4. Powdered chalk falling from one plate to another placed upon the instrument electrifies it negatively.\n\nOther methods of producing electricity with chalk and other powders have been tried; as projecting chalk from a goose wing, chalking the edges of books and clapping the leaves of the book suddenly together, afflicting the powder upon the cap, all which electrified it negatively; but the instrument being placed in a dusty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, and the dust struck up with a stick near it, electrified it positively. Breaking the glass-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEARL\">pearl</a> upon a book electrified it negatively, but when broken in water it did not electrify it.\n\nWheat <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLOUR\">flour</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> lead produced a strong negative electricity in all cases where the chalk produced a positive electricity. The following powders were like chalk: red ochre, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> rosin, coal ashes, powdered crocus metallorum, aurum molaicum, black-lead, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>-black (which was only sensible in the two first methods), powdered quick-lime, umber, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LAPIS\">lapis</a> calaminaris, Spanish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>, powdered sulphur, flowers of sulphur, iron filings, rust of iron, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a>. Rosin and chalk, separately alike, were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> by mixture; this was often tried in dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, but did not succeed in damp; white-lead also sometimes produced positive and sometimes negative electricity when blown from a plate.\n\nIf a metal cup be placed upon the cap with a red hot coal in it, and a spoonful of water be thrown in, it electrifies it negatively; and if a bent wire be placed in the cap, with a piece of paper fastened to it to increase its surface, the positive electricity of the ascending\nPrinciples of electricity may be tried by introducing the paper into it.\n\nThe sensibility of this electrometer may be considerably increased by placing a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> on the cap. By this means, a cloud of chalk, which in the other case only just opens the gold-leaf, will cause it to strike the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIDES\">fides</a> for a long time together; and the electricity which was not before communicated, now passes into the electrometer, causing the gold-leaf to repel after it is carried away. Even sealing-wax by this means communicates its electricity at the distance of 12 inches at least, which it would scarcely otherwise do by rubbing upon the cap.\n\nA cloud of chalk or wheat flour may be made in one room, and the electrometer with its candle be afterwards leisurely brought from another room, and the cloud will electrify it before it comes very near. The air of a room adjoining to that wherein the electrical machine was used, was very sensibly electrified, which was perceived by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> the instrument through it with its candle.\n\nNo sensible electricity is produced by blowing pure air, by projecting water, by smoke, flame, or explosions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GUN\">gun</a>-powder.\n\nA book was placed upon the cap, and struck with silk, linen, woollen, cotton, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARCHMENT\">parchment</a>, and paper, all which produced negative repulsion; but when the other side of the book was struck with silk, it became positive; this side, struck at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> with the former, was again negative; and by continuing the strokes which produced positive, it changed to negative for a little while; and by flopping again, became positive. No other book would do the same, though the sides were scraped and chalked, upon a supposition that altering the surface would produce it. At last, one side of a book was moistened, which changed it; whence it was concluded, that one edge of the book had lain in a damp place; which conjecture was farther confirmed by all the books becoming positive in damp weather, and one of them being dried at the fire again became negative.\n\nWhen the cap is approached with excited sealing-wax, the gold-leaf may be made to strike the fides of the glass more than twelve times; and as the sealing-wax recedes, it strikes nearly as often; but if it approaches much quicker than it recedes, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> will sometimes be greater.\n\nThe quantity of electricity necessary to cause a repulsion of the gold-leaf is so small, that the sharpest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> or edges do not draw it off without touching; hence it is unnecessary to avoid points or edges in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of this instrument.\n\nTo the experiments on blowing powders from a pair of bellows, it may be added, that if the powder is blown at about the distance of three inches upon a plate which is moistened or oiled, its electricity is contrary to that produced by blowing upon a dry plate. This shows that the electricity of the streams of powder rising out of the bellows is only contrary to the more expanded part, because it is within the influence of its own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>; for when this is destroyed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADHESION\">adhesion</a> of the powder to the moistened place, it is negative when the bellows are positive, as it was before positive when the more expanded cloud was negative.\n\nThis instrument is also free from an inconvenience which attends the electrometers in which cork or pith balls are employed. In these, when the balls are electrified, they are very apt to adhere together for some time before the repulsion takes place, and then they often separate with a jerk so as to recede from each other farther than they ought to do, and thus make the electricity produced appear greater than it really is; whereas the flips of gold-leaf in Bennet's electrometer do not adhere together, and separate equally and gradually.\n\nThis instrument is, however, not without its defects, as the delicate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a> of the gold-leaf renders it very difficult to fasten the flips, so as to keep them entire, and also prevent the instrument from being easily removed from one place to another. Mr Cavalli proposes poles to remedy these defects in the following manner: When the flips are cut and are lying upon paper, or on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSHION\">cushion</a> upon which they are cut, make them equal in length, by measuring them with a pair of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPASSES\">compasses</a>, and cutting off a suitable portion from the longest; then cut two bits of very fine gilt paper, each about half an inch long, and a quarter of an inch broad, and by means of a little wax, stick one of them to one extremity of each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol9.html#article-FLIP\">flip</a> of gold-leaf, so as to form a kind of letter T. This done, hold up in the fingers of one hand, one of those pieces of paper with gold-leaf suspended to it, and hold the other with the fingers of the other hand; then bringing them near to each other, and having adjusted them properly, viz. so as to let them hang parallel and smooth, force the pieces of paper which now touch each other, between the two sides of a fort of pincers made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> wire, or of very thin and hammered brass plate, which pincers are fastened to the under part of that piece which forms the top or cover of the glass vessel. As these gold flips are very apt to be spoiled, we should keep several of them ready cut in a book, each having a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> piece of paper fastened to one extremity, so that in case of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a>, a new pair of gold flips may be soon put between the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a> of the above-described pincers; and by this means the electrometer is rendered, in a certain manner, portable.\n\nMr Cavalli describes an electrometer which is nearly as sensible as Mr Bennet's, and is not liable to the inconveniences above mentioned. It is represented at fig. 19.\n\nThe case or handle of this electrometer is formed by a glass tube, about three inches long, and three-tenths of an inch in diameter, half of which is covered with sealing-wax. From one extremity of this tube, i.e. that without sealing wax, a small loop of silk proceeds, which serves occasionally to hang the electrometer on a pin, &c. To the other extremity of this tube a cork is adapted, which, being cut tapering on both ends, can fit the mouth of the tube with either end. From one extremity of this cork, two linen threads proceed, a little shorter than the length of the tube, suspending each a little cone of pith of elder. When this electrometer is to be used, that end of the cork which is opposite to the threads is pushed into the mouth of the tube; then the tube forms the insulated handle of the pith electrometer, as represented fig. 19, c. But when the electrometer is to be carried in the pocket, then the threads are put into the tube, and the cork stops it, as represented at b. The peculiar advantages\nPrinciples of stages of this electrometer are, its convenient small size, Electricity its great sensibility, and its continuing longer in good order than any other we have yet seen.\n\nRepresents a case to carry the above-described electrometer in. This case is like a common tooth-pick case, except that it has a piece of amber fixed on one extremity A, which may occasionally serve to electrify the electrometer negatively, and on the other extremity it has a piece of ivory fastened upon a piece of amber BC. This amber BC serves only to inflate the ivory, which, when inflated, and rubbed against woollen cloths, acquires a positive electricity; and it is therefore useful to electrify the electrometer positively.\n\nThere are many other electrometers employed by electricians; but these cannot properly be described at present, as they are constructed on principles which have not yet been explained. They will be noticed in their proper place.\n\nThe electric power forces a fluid to flow in a stream through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> tube, through which, when not electrified, it would only pass in drops.\n\nExper. 1.\u2014Suspend a small metallic bucket full of water from the prime conductor, and place in the water a glass syphon, the diameter of whose tube is so small that the water will only drop from it. Now set the cylinder of a machine in motion, and the water will begin to flow in a full stream from the end of the syphon. The stream will sometimes be subdivided, and if the experiment is made in the dark, the water will appear luminous.\n\nExper. 2.\u2014Dip a sponge in water, and suspend it from the prime conductor. The water which before only dropped from the sponge, will now flow very fast, and appears in the dark like fiery rain.\n\nThe effect of electricity on water flowing through capillary tubes, was first observed by M. Boze, but was more accurately investigated by the Abb\u00e9 Nollet. He found that the stream of water through a capillary tube, was accelerated in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERSE\">inverse</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> of the diameter of the tube; but that if the diameter of the tube, was less than a line; the stream was not sensibly accelerated. The important <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> which the able thought he could make of this experiment will be seen hereafter.\n\nWhen an inflated vessel is electrified, and an inflated body, such as a ball-electrometer, is suspended within the cavity of the vessel, the body shows no signs of electrical attraction or repulsion.\n\nThe experiment by which this principle is to be illustrated, is called the electrical well, and is thus described by Mr Cavallo.\n\n\"Place upon an electric stool a metal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUART\">quart</a> mug, or some other conducting body nearly of the same form and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMENSION\">dimension</a>; then tie a short cork-ball electrometer, of the kind represented fig. 16. (x), at the end of a silk thread proceeding from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CEILING\">ceiling</a> of the room, or from any other proper support, so that the electrometer may be suspended within the mug, and no part of it may be above the mouth; this done, electrify the mug, by giving it a spark with an excited electric or otherwise, and you will see that the electrometer, whilst it remains in that inflated situation, even if it be made to touch the sides of the mug, is not attracted by it, nor does it acquire any electricity; but if, whilst it stands suspended within the mug, a conductor standing out of the mug be made to communicate with, or only presented to it, then the electrometer acquires an electricity contrary to that of the mug, and a quantity of it, which is proportionable to the body with which it has been made to communicate; and it is then immediately attracted by the mug.\n\nIf, by raising the silk thread a little, part of the electrometer, i.e. of its linen threads, be lifted just above the mouth of the mug, the balls will be immediately attracted; for then, by the action of the electricity of the mug, it will acquire a contrary electricity, by giving to, or receiving the electric power from, the air above the cavity of the mug.\"\n\nThis experiment may be made in greater perfection by employing a globular glass vessel, with a narrow neck just sufficient to admit the electrometer, which should be fastened to a crooked glass rod, so that it may be presented to any part of the cavity. The outside of the vessel should be smeared with some clammy substance, as syrup or treacle, and may be inflated by placing it on a wine glass. The balls presented to the outside when the vessel is electrified, will be repelled, but presented to any part of the inside, they will show no signs of electricity, unless touched with some substance, as a wire, while within the cavity; when, on being taken out, they will repel each other.\n\nThis experiment was invented by Dr Franklin, and is called by him the electrical cup.\n\nCHAP. II. Of the diversities exhibited by the electric power in its passage from pointed surfaces, and from obtuse surfaces.\n\nWhen the electric power passes between an electrified body and a pointed conductor, a luminous stream is produced, attended with a current of air from the point.\n\nExper. 1.\u2014Fix a metallic point in the prime conductor, and let the machine in motion. No crackling, but rather a hissing noise, will be heard, and a light will appear as if issuing from the point, and on holding the hand near it, a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BLAST\">blast</a> of air will be found to proceed from it. On holding another point at the distance of about half an inch from the point in the prime conductor, a stream of light will be seen passing between them, attended with a crackling noise. This current of air will be sufficiently strong to turn any light bodies which are freely suspended, and in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> the following pleasing experiments may be made.\n\nExper. 2.\u2014Cut a round flat piece of cork, with the edges very smooth, and stick a number of small crow quills into the circumference, with the feather ends as represented in fig. 23.; pass a needle through the centre of the cork, and suspend this needle by a small magnet m; on holding the cork near the point\n\n(N) Instead of the electrometer, there may be used any other kind of small conducting body; but that seems best adapted to such experiments.\nChap. II.\n\nPrinciples of point, the current of air will make it move round with great swiftness.\n\nExper. 3.\u2014Let four arms of wire, with their extremities pointed and turned all in the same direction, be stuck in the circumference of a small circular piece of light wood, supported on a pointed wire, as represented in fig. 24. On bringing the wires near the point in the conductor, while the machine is in motion, they will move swiftly round as before, and in the dark, a beautiful circle of fire will be produced by the light issuing from the points. If figures of dogs, horses, &c. formed of elder pith, be stuck on the points, they will appear as if pursuing each other, thus forming what Mr Kinnerley called the electrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a>.\n\nExper. 4.\u2014Fix eight bells near the edge of a circular board supported on four feet, as represented fig. 25, having a glass pillar e in the centre, terminated by a point g. On this point place the pointed wires used in the last experiment, hanging from one of them as d, a small glass clapper by a filken thread; and connecting the apparatus by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> h, proceeding from the prime conductor. On setting the machine in motion, the wire will move round, and the clapper ring the bells.\n\nExper. 5.\u2014By this motion of circulating points we may in some measure imitate the revolutions of the heavenly bodies, forming what is called the electrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORRERY\">orrery</a>. Let a single wire, with the extremities pointed and turned as before, be nicely balanced on a point; fix a small glass ball over its centre, as a, fig. 26, to represent the sun. At one extremity of the wire, let a small wire be soldered perpendicularly, and on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> another small wire with its ends pointed and turned, and having a small pith ball w in its centre to represent the earth, and a smaller ball of the same kind at one of the angles for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>. Let the whole be supported upon a glass pillar, and be conducted by a chain proceeding from the prime conductor to the wire supporting the glass ball. Now, when the machine is put in motion, the wires will turn round, so that the ball representing the earth will move round the central ball, and the little ball at the angle of the smaller wire will at the same time revolve about the earth.\n\nExper. 6.\u2014The power exerted by electricity upon points, may under some circumstances be made to counteract the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAVITATION\">gravitation</a>. Let an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCLINED_PLANE\">inclined <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> be formed of two parallel wires fastened by their extremities to four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILLARS\">pillars</a> of solid glass, M, N, O, P, fig. 27, fixed in a board so that the two at one end shall be higher than the other two. Then fix a wire with its ends pointed and turned in the same direction, at right angles upon a wire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a>. When this axis is laid upon the inclined plane, it will of course <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROLL\">roll</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a>, but if, when it has nearly arrived there, the machine be put in motion, the wire will return up the plane, revolving on its axis.\n\nExper. 7.\u2014Take a small lock of cotton, extended in every direction as much as can conveniently be done, and by a linen thread about five or six inches long, or by a thread drawn out of the same cotton, tie it to the end of the prime conductor; then set the machine in motion, and the lock of cotton on being electrified, will immediately swell, by repelling its filaments from one another, and will stretch itself towards the nearest conductor. In this situation let the cylinder be kept in motion, and present the end of your finger, or the knob of a wire, towards the lock of cotton, which will then immediately move towards the finger, and endeavour to touch it; but take with the other hand a pointed needle, and present its point towards the cotton, a little above the end of the finger, and the cotton will be observed immediately to shrink upwards, and move towards the prime conductor. Remove the needle, and the cotton will come again towards the finger. Present the needle, and the cotton will shrink again.\n\nWhen the electric power passes between an electrified body and a conductor whose surface is obtuse, a luminous spark is produced, attended with an explosion, and these appearances are more or less strong in proportion as the surfaces are more or less obtuse.\n\nExper. 1.\u2014When the prime conductor is situated in its proper place, and electrified by whirling the sparks cylinder, if a metallic wire with a ball at its extremity, or the knuckle of a finger, be presented to the prime conductor, a spark will be seen to issue between them, which will be more vivid, and will be attended with a greater or less explosion, according as the ball is larger. The strongest and most vivid sparks are drawn from that end or side of the prime conductor, which is farthest from the cylinder. The sparks have the same appearance whether they be taken from the positive or the negative conductor; they sometimes appear like a long line of fire reaching from the prime conductor to the opposed body, and often (particularly when the spark is long, and different conducting substances in the line of its direction) it will have the appearance of being bent to sharp angles in different places, exactly resembling a flash of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>.\n\nThe figure of the spark varies with the superficial dimensions of the part from which it is taken. If it be drawn from a ball of two or three inches in diameter, it will have the appearance of a straight line; but if the ball from which it is drawn be much smaller, as half an inch in diameter, it will assume the zig-zag appearance above mentioned.\n\nWe have just seen that when the electric power passes from a point to a point, there are no sparks, but a luminous stream appears; but if the point be obliterated, by being thrust back so as to be on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with the surface of the conductor, by being held between the fingers &c., the sparks will appear as before.\n\nThe length of the spark, or the distance through the length of air which it strikes from the conductor, depends on several circumstances; as, the length and diameter of the conductor; the termination of the surface from which, or to which, the spark passes; the dimensions of the cylinder; and the position of the conductor.\n\n1. If the conducting body be increased in length only, the distance of the spark will be shortened. This fact was very early observed by Dr Priestley. He found that a spark from the end of a wire several yards in length, and about one fourth of an inch in diameter, was not longer than one taken from a conductor two feet in length, and two inches in diameter. Signor Volta found, that when he connected several rods, eight feet long, and half an inch in diameter, suspended at the distance of eight inches from each other, the spark drawn from them was not so long as one drawn from a conductor of the same length, but of twelve inches diameter.\nMr. Brook of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWICH\">Norwich</a> connected nearly twenty rods of wood covered with tin-foil, near seven feet long, and three-fourths of an inch in diameter, at about a foot from each other, so that the whole apparatus resembled a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> gridiron, which was suspended from the ceiling by glass rods. From so large an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of conducting surface no spark exceeding six inches could be drawn; whereas from a conductor eight feet long, and five inches in diameter, sparks may often be drawn above nine inches long, with the same cylinder.\n\n2. If the diameter of the conductor be increased in proportion to its length, the spark is not so long as when it is shortened, while the diameter is increased. A conductor twelve feet long, and eight inches in diameter, does not yield a spark above half the length that may be drawn from a conductor of the same diameter, only six feet long.\n\n3. The spark will strike to a greater distance, according as the cylinder is smaller in proportion to the conductor. A much longer and more violent spark was drawn from Mr. Brook's gridiron conductor with a cylinder only four inches in diameter than from a conductor five feet long, and five inches in diameter, with the same cylinder.\n\n4. The length of the spark is greater from a ball of moderate dimensions than from the surface of the prime conductor.\n\n5. The spark will be longer when the conductor is placed parallel to the cylinder, than when it is at right angles with the cylinder.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> of the spark varies according as the surfaces between which it strikes are more or less obtuse. It is louder when the spark is taken from the prime conductor, than when taken from a ball annexed to it; and it is loudest of all when the spark strikes from one flat surface to another: a straight spark is always louder than one of the zig-zag appearance. If the spark be made to pass from one end of a glass tube (clothed at both ends and very dry) to the other, the sound is entirely hushed.\n\nWhen the spark is received by the knuckle it produces a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a> which is, more or less painful. It is more pungent when received from the prime conductor than from a ball attached to it. The spark produces a more painful sensation in proportion as it is shorter.\n\nThe most remarkable circumstance attending the electric spark is the light (60) produced in its passage through the air. The sparks which usually pass between the rubber of the negative conductor, through the cylinder to the points of the positive conductor, are of a beautiful light blue colour; but when the spark passes between the prime conductor and a ball of the diameter of an inch, its edges are purplish, and from these diverge several ramifications of a purple or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a> colour. If the balls between which the spark passes are not more than half an inch distance from each other, a continued stream of the most brilliant light will be produced, attended with a whizzing noise. If the distance of the balls from each other be increased, sparks equally brilliant will be produced; but their succession will be less quick, and no continued stream will appear.\n\nThe light emitted from electrified conductors is more copious and brilliant in proportion as their surfaces are more extended. If a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> standing on an inflating stool, and connected with the prime conductor of a machine in motion, hold a flat plate of metal, as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEWTER\">pewter</a> plate, while another person standing on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> holds another plate, large flames of vivid light will appear between the plates, so as to illuminate a dark room.\n\nSoon after the cylinder is set in motion, and sparks begin to issue, a peculiar odour may be perceived; and if the machine acts well, this is very powerful. It is difficult to describe this odour, but it seems to resemble that of phosphorus.\n\nCHAP. III. Of charging and discharging the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a> Phial; with directions for the construction of Jars and Batteries.\n\nThe electric power is communicated to electric vessels with difficulty, unless their surfaces be covered with some conducting substance; but it may be accumulated on them in a much greater degree than on conductors.\n\nExper. 1.\u2014Take a common tumbler or glass dancing jar, and having placed a brass ball in one of the holes of the prime conductor, let the machine in motion, and let the balls touch the inside of the tumbler; while the ball touches only one point, no more of the surface of the glass will be electrified, but by moving the tumblers about so as to make the ball touch many points successively, all these points will be electrified, as will appear by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the tumbler over a number of pith or cork balls placed on a table. These balls will immediately begin to fly about, thus showing the electric attraction and repulsion illustrated in (61). This experiment is commonly called the experiment of the dancing balls, and is represented at fig. 28.\n\nExper. 2.\u2014Let a glass jar, either cylindrical, such as is represented at fig. 12, Plate CLXXXVII., or with the mouth as wide a mouth as possible, be covered on both its inside and outside surfaces to within two inches of the top, with tin foil fastened on by means of gum water. The jar is then said to be coated. Fit to the mouth of the jar a piece of baked wood, through the centre of which pass a wire, whose lower extremity is terminated by a number of other wires, which must be made to touch the inside coating, while its upper extremity projects an inch or two above the mouth of the jar, and terminates in a metallic ball a. This ball should be perforated so as to receive a wire supporting a quadrant electrometer.\n\nThe jar being thus prepared, let the knob a communicate with the prime conductor, and let it remain charging while the cylinder is in motion till the ball c of the electrometer stands nearly horizontal; the jar is then said to be charged. It may be removed from the conductor.\n\n(o) The first person who seems to have observed the electric light was Otto Guericke. He appears indeed only to have had a glimpse of it; and the first who perceived it in any great degree was Dr Wall, on rubbing a pretty large piece of amber. Vid. Philos. Trans. abridged, vol. ii.\nLet there be provided a curved brass rod, terminating at each end in a knob, and furnished with a glass handle, such as Def; if now one of the knobs, as e, be made to approach the ball a of the jar, while the other knob f touches the outside coating, a considerable explosion will take place, and the jar will lose its electricity, as will appear by the ball of the electroscope falling into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> situation.\n\nThe jar is then said to be discharged, and the rod Def is called a discharging rod.\n\nA jar or phial of glass thus constructed is, for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> which will presently appear, called a Leyden jar or phial.\n\nIn this experiment, the jar is not charged to its utmost height. If, instead of stopping when the index of the quadrant is nearly at right angles, we persist in charging, there will soon appear several luminous streams passing from the prime conductor across the cylinder to the cushion. Presently an explosion will take place from the phial, and this is called its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> discharge. If the phial is not very strong, it will probably either be broken, or on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> will be found perforated in some part. If the glass be very thin, a spontaneous discharge will soon take place, attended with a harsh cracking noise, and the phial will certainly be cracked. A spontaneous discharge happens much more readily when the neck of the phial is very small, and consequently the wire comes very near the uncoated part of the glass.\n\nIf the uncoated part of the glass be moist or dusty, the jar will not receive a charge, so that it is necessary to be very careful in cleaning the jar before using it. When the uncoated part is made very hot, the spontaneous discharge is much accelerated.\n\nThe appearance of the uncoated part of the jar, when the discharge is made in the dark, is very curious. A great number of luminous streams will be seen pouring over the edge of the jar from the inside to the outside.\n\nThe force of the explosion depends very much on the termination of the extremity of the discharging rod. If this be terminated by a large ball, the noise will be much greater than when the ball is small; if it be terminated by a small obtuse surface, a hissing noise is heard before the explosion, and this is faint. But if the rod terminate in a point, no explosion will take place, but the jar will be silently discharged.\n\nIn the above experiment the jar is charged positively, it having been in contact with the positive conductor; but if it be connected with the negative conductor, the jar will be charged negatively. This will be more fully illustrated by and by.\n\nAs the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a> of the electric power by means of coated jars forms one of the most important discoveries which have been made in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, we shall here relate the method in which the discovery was made.\n\nThis discovery was accidental, and was the result of an experiment made in the end of the year 1745 by M. Van Kleift, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAN\">dean</a> of the cathedral in Cammin, who sent the following account of it to Dr Leibekuhn at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BERLIN\">Berlin</a>.\n\nWhen a nail or a piece of thick brass-wire, &c., is put into a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APOTHECARY\">apothecary</a>'s phial, and electrified, remarkable effects follow; but the phial must be very dry or warm. I commonly rub it once before hand with a finger, on which I put some pounded chalk. If a little mercury, or a few drops of spirits of wine, be put into it, the experiment succeeds the better. As soon as this phial and nail are removed from the electrifying glass, or the prime conductor to which it has been exposed, is taken away, is taken away, it throws out a pencil of flame so long, that with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> machine in my hand, I have taken above sixty steps in walking about my room. When it is electrified strongly, I can take it into another room, and there fire spirits of wine with it. If, while it is electrifying, I put my finger, or a piece of gold, which I hold in my hand, to the nail, I receive a shock which stuns my arms and shoulders.\n\nA tin tube, or a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> placed upon electrics, is electrified much stronger by this means than in the common way. When I present this phial and nail to a tin tube, which I have, fifteen feet long, nothing but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> can make a person believe how strongly it is electrified. Two thin glasses have been broken by the shock of it. It appears to me <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a>, that when this phial and nail are in contact with either conducting or non-conducting matter, the strong shock does not follow. I have cemented it to wood, metal, glass, sealing-wax, &c., when I have electrified without any great effect.\n\nM. Van Kleift communicated this experiment to several of his acquaintances, but they all for some time failed in their attempts to repeat it.\n\nAn experiment of a similar kind was soon after made at Leyden by Mr Cuneus. Making an attempt to communicate the electric power to water, contained in a phial, in which was a nail, happening to hold his glass in one hand, while he disengaged it from the prime conductor with the other, when he imagined that the water had received as much electricity as it was capable of acquiring, he was surprised with a sudden shock in his arms and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>, which he had not in the least expected.\n\nThis experiment was afterwards repeated in the presence of M. M. Allamand and Muffchenbroeck with similar results; and as it was at Leyden that the experiment was made with the greatest success, and afterwards improved, it obtained the name of the Leyden experiment, and a phial so constructed as to exhibit similar phenomena, has been ever since called a Leyden phial.\n\nIndeed the philosophers of Leyden seem to have views of some merit in this discovery, which with them does which led not appear to have been merely accidental. The views to this discovery, which are said to have led to it were as follows:\n\nProfessor Muffchenbroeck and his friends, observing that electrified bodies, exposed to the common atmosphere, which is always replete with conducting particles of various kinds, soon lost their electricity, and were capable of retaining but a small quantity of it, imagined, that were the electric bodies terminated on all sides by original electrics, they might be capable of receiving a stronger power, and retaining it a longer time. Glass being the most convenient electric for this purpose, and water the most convenient non-electric, they first made progressive improvements with water in close bottles.\n\nFor a long time water and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of wine were the only conductors employed in this experiment; but it was\n\nPrinciples of was soon found by Dr Watson, that the experiment succeeded better when the outside of the glass was coated with some metallic leaf, as sheet-lead, or tin-foil, while the phial contained some water within; and after this there was a natural transition to the use of an internal as well as external metallic coating, and thus the Leyden phial was completed in its present form (p).\n\nA number of coated jars having their internal coatings connected together by metallic wires, constitute what is called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BATTERY\">battery</a>. Fig. 14. represents an electrical battery of the most approved form, containing nine jars. The bottom of the box is covered with tin-foil to connect the exterior coatings; the inside coatings of the jars are connected by the wires \\(a b c, d e f, g h i\\), which meet in the large ball \\(A\\); a ball \\(B\\) proceeds from the inside, by which the circuit may be conveniently completed. In one side of the box, near the bottom, is a hole through which a brass hook passes, and which communicates with the metallic lining of the box, and consequently with the outside coating of the jars. To this wire or chain is occasionally connected when a discharge is made; and for the more convenient making of this discharge, a ball and wire, \\(B\\), proceed to a convenient distance from the centre of the ball \\(A\\). When the whole force of the battery is not required, one, two, or three jars may be removed, only by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PRESSING\">pressing</a> down the wires belonging to them, until their extremities can slip out of their respective holes in the brass ball, and then turning them into such a posture that they cannot have any communication with the battery. The number of jars represented in this figure is rather small for some purposes; but it is better to join two or three small batteries, rather than have a single large one, which is inconvenient on account of its weight and unwieldiness.\n\nAs coated jars form one of the most expensive parts of an electrical apparatus, it is of consequence that the electrician should himself be able to adjust them for experiment, and repair the coating, &c., when injured. We shall therefore give particular directions for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREPARATION\">preparation</a> of jars and batteries. The circumstances necessary to be attended to, respect principally the form of the coated electric, the substance employed as an electric, and the conductor employed as a coating.\n\nFor most experiments the best form is that of a cylindrical jar, in which the mouth is large enough to admit the introduction of the hand. A phial of this form is much more easily coated, cleaned, or repaired, than one of any other form. Mr Cuthbertson used to make his jars entirely cylindrical, but now he is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> that it is better to have the mouth a little contracted, and he has of late always made his jars of this latter form. For illustrating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of coated electrics, as we shall see hereafter, plates are the most convenient, and they are also useful in some experiments. Dr Robison prefers bottles of a globular form to any other, and he commonly employed the balloons used in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a>, which he says make excellent jars. The principles of bottles employed for holding mineral <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a> also make electricity very good jars, but they are rather inferior to the bottles illustrated, as having very thick bottoms. For ordinary purposes, where a glass-bottle is at a great distance, common green glass bottles or apothecary's phials with the mouths as wide as possible, will answer very well.\n\nWith respect to the electric employed for this purpose, glass is to be preferred on many accounts, and of employed this the best kind, as flint or crystal; but the expense here becomes a very considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a>, especially as the jars of a battery are very apt to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> by reason of the inequality of their strength; for it should seem that the force of the electric power in a battery is equally distributed among all the bottles, without any regard to their capacities of receiving a charge singly considered. Thus if we express the quantity of charge which one jar can easily receive, by the number 10, we ought not to connect such a jar in a battery with one whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> is only 8; because the whole force of electricity expressed by 10 will be directed also against that whose capacity is only 8, so that the latter will be in danger of being broken. It will be proper, therefore, to compare the bottles with one another in this respect before putting them together in a battery. Besides the consideration of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> capacity which each bottle has of receiving a charge, the time which is taken up in charging it must also be attended to, and the jars of a battery ought to be as equal as possible in this respect as well as the former. The thinner a glass is, the more readily it receives a charge, and vice versa; but it does not follow from thence, as was formerly imagined, that on account of its thinness it is capable of containing a greater charge than a thicker one. The reverse is actually the case; and though a thick glass cannot be charged in such a short time as a thin one, it is nevertheless capable of containing a greater degree of electric power. In fact, if the glass be thinner than one-eighth of an inch, the phial will not bear any considerable charge. If the thickness of the glass be very great, no charge can indeed be given it; but experiments have not yet determined how great the thickness must be which will prevent any charge. Indeed it is observed, that though a thick glass cannot be charged by a weak electrical machine, it may be by a more powerful one, whence it seems reasonable to suppose that there is no real <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a> of this kind; but that if a machine could be made sufficiently powerful, glasses of any thickness might be charged.\n\nGlass is attended with one considerable inconvenience; that it is very apt to attract moisture, and therefore the jars acquire perpetual care in wiping before they are used; and this, when a large battery is employed, becomes a very troublesome operation. It is the uncoated part of the jar which is injured by the moisture, for it is found, that if the coating be moist, the jar is more easily and more completely charged.\n\nElectricians\n\n(p) Dr Watson was indebted for the hint of a metallic coating to Dr Bevis, who was also the first electrician that employed a plate of glass coated on both sides in performing the experiments with coated electrics. Hence the coated plate is often called, especially by the continental electricians, Bevis's plate, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, le carreau de Bevis.\nElectricians have often endeavoured to find some other electric which might answer better than glass for this purpose, at least be cheaper; but except Father Beccaria's method, which may be used very well, no remarkable discovery has been made relating to this point. He took equal quantities of very pure colophonium and powder of marble fitted exceeding fine, and kept them in a hot place a considerable time, where they became perfectly free from moisture; he then mixed them, and melted the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> in a proper vessel over the fire, and when melted, poured it upon a table, upon which he had previously stuck a piece of tin-foil, within two or three inches of the edge of the table. This done, he endeavoured with a hot iron to spread the mixture as equally as possible, and to the thickness of one-tenth of an inch all over the table; he afterwards coated it with another piece of tin-foil, reaching within about two inches of the edge of the mixture; in short he coated a plate of this mixture as he would a plate of glass. This coated plate seems, from what he says, to have had a greater power than a glass plate of the same dimensions: even when the weather was not very dry, and if it is not liable to be easily broken by a spontaneous discharge, it may be conveniently employed in place of glass; for it does not very readily attract moisture, and consequently may hold a charge better and longer than glass, besides when broken, it may be again repaired by means of a hot iron, whereas a broken plate or vessel of glass can seldom be employed again.\n\nTalc, or Muscovy glass, is one of the most convenient electrics for the purposes of coating. It is not very apt to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> moisture, and will retain a charge for a very considerable time.\n\nA very convenient portable phial may be constructed of sealing wax in the following manner: Procure a phial made of tin-plate, or white-iron (as it is called in Scotland), with a long neck; cover the outside of this phial with sealing wax as far as the neck, and coat the sealing wax to within a little of the neck with tin-foil. In this phial it is evident that the sealing wax is the electric, of which the tin-foil forms the outer and the tin-plate the inner coating.\n\nWhen plates or jars having a sufficiently large opening are to be coated, the best method is to coat them with tin-foil on both sides, which may be fixed upon the glass with varnish, gum water, bees wax, &c.; but in case the jars have not an aperture wide enough to admit the tin-foil, and an instrument to adapt it to the surface of the glass, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRADS\">brads</a> filings, such as are sold by the pin-makers, may be advantageously used; and these may be stuck on with gum water, bees wax, &c., but not with varnish, for this is apt to be set on fire by the discharge. Care must be taken that the coating do not come very near the mouth of the jar, for that will cause the jar to discharge itself. If the coating is about two inches below the top, it will in general do very well; but there are some kinds of glass, especially ringed glass, that when coated and charged have the property of discharging themselves more easily than others, even when the coating is five or six inches below the edge.\n\nIt is much more difficult to coat vessels of a globular form than plates or cylindrical jars; but the former may be coated with tolerable ease by attending to the method of cutting the tin-foil. This should be cut into the form of guillets as in covering a globe or in making a balloon; and they should be patted on, so as to overlap each other about half an inch. After having coated the sides of a balloon in this manner, the bottom is to be covered with a circular piece of tin-foil. The thinner the foil, the better it is adapted for the inside coating; and it may readily be applied by first patting it upon paper, and then patting either the paper or the foil next the glass.\n\nIn coating plates of glass it is better to cut the tin-foil into circular pieces, as it is found that a circular space is capable of giving as great a charge to the glass, as a square coating of the same breadth, and a spontaneous discharge does not so readily take place from the circular edge, as from the edges of a square coating.\n\nMr Brooke discovered, that when jars were coated with tin-foil first patted upon paper, they were rendered much less liable to be broken by the discharge. As coating, the trials which led to this discovery afford a useful lesson to the young electrician, we shall relate them in his own words.\n\n\"In making electrical experiments, and in particular those in which the Leyden phial is concerned, a method of preserving the bottles or jars from being struck through by the electric power, is very desirable; but I do not know that it has hitherto been accomplished. The number of them that have been destroyed in many of my experiments, have led me to various conjectures to preserve them: at the same time I have been obliged to make use of bottles instead of open-mouthed jars. And as coating the former withinside is very troublesome, it has put me on thinking of some method more easy, quicker, and equally firm and good, as with tin-foil. With respect to the new method of coating, I failed; though something else presented itself rather in favour of the former: therefore, introducing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> here will not be of very great use; unless in saving another the trouble of making use of the same method, or giving a hint towards the former so as to succeed with certainty. My aim was to find something that should be quick and clean, and not easy to come off with the rubbing of wires against it, and yet a good conductor. My first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSAY\">essay</a> was with a cement of pitch, rosin, and wax, melted together; into which, to make it a good conductor, I put a large proportion of finely fitted brass filings. When this mixture was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, I put broken pieces of it into the bottle, and warmed the bottle till it was hot enough to melt the cement in it so as to run, and cover the bottle withinside; then I coated the outside with tin-foil, as is commonly done, and now it was fit for use or ready to be charged, to which I next proceeded; and I believe I had not made more than four or five turns of the winch, before it spontaneously struck through the glass with a very small charge. I then took off the outside coating, and flopped the fracture with some of my common cement, after which I put the coating on again; and in as little time as before, it was struck through again in a different place; and thus I did with this bottle five or six times; sometimes it struck through the glass in four different places. This made me consider what it might be that facilitated the spontaneous striking through the glass, and likewise what might retard it. I had, long before,\nPrinciples of before, thought that jars or bottles appeared to be struck through with a much less charge, just after their being coated, or before they were dry, than when they had been coated long enough for the moisture to be evaporated from the paste, with which I mostly lay on the tin-foil, and could only consider the dry paste as a kind of mediator between the tin-foil and the glass, or in other words, that the moisture in the paste was a better conductor and more in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> contact with the glass than the paste itself when dry. And the coating the bottles with the heated cement, though long afterward, did not alter my former idea; for it appeared as if the hot cement, with the conducting substance in it, might be still more in actual contact with the glass than the moisture in the paste. On these probabilities I had to consider what might act as a kind of mediator more effectually than the dry paste, between the glass and the tin-foil. It occurred, that common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> paper, as being neither a good conductor nor insulator, might be serviceable by being first pasted smoothly to the tin-foil, and left to dry. The paper then being pasted on one side, having the tin-foil on the other, I put them on the glass together with the tin-foil outward, and rubbed them down smooth. This succeeded so well that I have never since had any struck through that were thus done, either common phials or large bottles, which contain near three gallons each, though some of the latter have stood in the battery in common use with the others for a long time. And as I have never had one struck through that has been prepared in this way, I am much less able at present to tell how great a charge they will bear before they are struck through, or whether they will be struck through at all.*\n\nThe mineral acids serve very well for an inside coating to jars; but their use is attended with some risk, from their corrosive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>.\n\nThe wire through which the charge is made, should not be less than the fourth of an inch in diameter; it should be terminated by a metallic ball, at least one inch in diameter.\n\nIf the phials be intended to be frequently removed from one place to another, the charging wire must be fastened so as to be always steady in the centre of the phial. For this purpose, some employ a piece of wood, to fit the mouth of the phial like a lid, but the length of insulation which separates the coating from the phial is thus diminished, and consequently, as we shall see hereafter, the phial is more liable to a gradual spontaneous discharge, so that it is much more difficult to charge it. The wire is best fastened below the edge of the inner coating, and in this way Mr Cuthbertson constructed his jars, the mouth being left entirely open.\n\nWhen the phial is not to be removed from the situation in which it is charged, the wire may be fastened to the conductor.\n\nBatteries may be formed either of plates or jars. A very commodious battery may be made in the following manner. Select a number of plates of the best <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> glass that are very flat and thin; coat them on each side with a circular piece of tin-foil patted in the middle of the plate, so as to leave a margin sufficiently wide to prevent a spontaneous discharge; let a narrow lip of tin-foil pass from the circumference of the coating on each side, and lay the plates upon each other so that these lips may coincide. Let the lips be connected at their ends by a wire which touches them all; then if one of these lips is connected with the prime conductor, and the other with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, the whole may be charged or discharged together. If we wish to have a number of these plates connected so as to form a perpetual battery, they may be cemented by covering the tin-coated margins with melted pitch, and pressing the plates down on each other while the pitch is soft till the coatings touch each other. But if we desire to make use only of a few of the plates at a time, and to vary their number, they may be placed upon their edges in an open frame; and when we wish to make a break in the chain of plates, this may easily be done by placing one of them at right angles to the rest.\n\nA very convenient battery may be formed in this way with coated plates of Mucovoy glass; but great caution is necessary in the use of such plates, as they are very easily broken by a spontaneous discharge, and it is not easy to discover where the crack has happened.\n\nMr Brooke of Norwich, constructed his batteries, which appear to have been very powerful, of green Brooke's glass bottles. Some of them, like that represented in mode of the figure, had only nine of these bottles; but when a greater power was wanted, more were added. Jarseries would have been preferred to bottles, on account of their being more easily coated by reason of their wide mouths; but being less easily procured, he was content to put up with this inconvenience. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> size of these bottles was about eight inches in diameter; they were coated ten inches high, and made of the thickest and strongest glass that could be procured, weighing from five pounds and a half to seven pounds each. In the construction of a battery of twenty-seven bottles, he disposed of them in three rows; nine of the stoutest and best composing the first row, nine of the next in strength being disposed in the second, and the third containing the nine weakest. All of these were of green glass, but not of the same kind. Some of those which stood in the foremost row, were composed of a kind very much like that of which Frontignac wine bottles are made; and our author remarks, that this kind of glass seems to be by much the best, as being both harder and stronger, and less liable to break by a high charge. The second and third rows of the battery consisted of bottles whose diameter was from six and a half to ten inches, and which were coated from eight and a half to eleven inches high; none of their mouths being larger than an inch and a half, nor less than three quarters of an inch.\n\nAll the bottles of this battery, as well as the single ones which he commonly made use of in his experiments, were coated both on the inside and outside with lips of tin-foil from three-eighths to three-fourths of an inch wide, laid on with paste of flour and water, at the distance of about a flip between each.\n\nMr G. Morgan lays down the following requisites as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> in the construction of a battery.\n\n1. Its connecting wires should be perfectly free from all points and edges.\n\n2. The connecting wires should be easily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a>, so that when accident has lessened the number of phials,\nPrinciples of the number of wires may be reduced so as to correspond with the remaining quantity of glass.\n\n3. The phials should not be crowded; for in such a case, if <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> should oblige us to employ phials of different heights or sizes, the tin-foil of the higher ones, being in contact with the uncoated glass of the lower ones, the inflation will thus be rendered less complete.\n\n4. The size of the phials should not be large; for though an increase of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> lessens the trouble of cleaning, it at the same time increases the expense of repairing damages which frequently occur.\n\n5. The several wires should be fixed very steadily, or in such a manner as not to admit of any shaking.\n\n6. The battery should take up the least possible room; for as it increases in size, so is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> increased of its being exposed to the influence of surrounding conductors.\n\nThe first electrical battery appears to have been constructed in the year 1746 by Mr Gralath, a German. Dr Franklin constructed a battery consisting of eleven plates of common window glass, and with this he made most of the experiments which will be mentioned hereafter. The construction of the battery was greatly improved by Dr Priestley, who formed them of considerable size and power. In his history he describes and figures one consisting of sixty-four jars, each ten inches high, and two inches and a half in diameter, and the whole battery containing 32 square feet of coated surface.\n\nBut the most complete electrical batteries are those made by Mr Cuthbertson for Teyler's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUSEUM\">museum</a> at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAARLEM\">Haarlem</a>. Of these batteries there are two, differing in their magnitude and mode of construction, but allowed to be equally perfect. The first was completed in the year 1784, and is composed of 135 jars in nine boxes, which may be used separately or combined, as the nature of the experiment requires. Each box is a separate battery of itself; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of one box will be sufficient for explaining its construction and use. Each box contains 15 jars; each jar is 11 inches high, and six inches in diameter, contracted at the mouth to four inches, and coated so as to contain 140 square inches; and thus the whole battery will contain about 132 square feet of coated surface. Each box is divided into 15 partitions, five of which are in the length and three in the breadth; the height of the sides of the box being somewhat lower than the coating of the jars, as are also the partitions in which they stand. The lid of the box is made without hinges, for the convenience of releasing it from the box, that it may be removed while experiments are performed. It is taken off by lifting it upwards. The outside coatings of the jars are connected by means of crofs wires passing under the bottom of each jar; and those on the inside by means of a brass frame, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> 15 brass balls, fixed upon the frame above the centre of each jar. All these balls, excepting the four at the corners, have wires screwed to them and hanging downwards into the inside of each jar; but the wires of the four corner jars are screwed to a foot, which is cemented to the bottom of each in the inside. Upon these wires the whole frame rests, and is kept in its proper position. The four corner balls have holes, which receive the ends of the wires, and terminate at a proper height from the jars. By this contrivance the inside connecting frame may at any time be easily removed. It is according to the above principles of construction that Mr Cuthbertson forms his present batteries, excepting that he has increased the size of the jars, so as to make one battery contain about 17 square feet; and he engages to prove by experiment, that the batteries of his construction are far superior to any others. Teyler's second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> battery was finished by Mr Cuthbertson in 1789. This is the largest and most complete battery that was ever made. It consists of 100 jars of the same shape with that of those already described, only that they are so enlarged in size, that each of them contains 5\u00bd square feet of coated surface, instead of 140 inches, and the whole battery contains 550 square feet of coating; and for convenience, it is put into four separate cases, each containing 25 jars in the form of a square, five on each side. The boxes are lined with lead on the inside for forming the outside communication; each jar has a perpendicular stand resting upon its bottom, and supported from falling sideways by three stays on the inside. Upon the top is screwed a three-inch brass globe, from which proceeds a brass tube about one inch in diameter, to a large brass globe, supported by the middle jar at a proper height, so as to keep the inside communication properly arranged.\n\nVarious expedients have been thought of to repair Method of jars when cracked, and enable them to bear another charging charge, but they seem to have been attended with very little success. Mr Brooke found that when any of his bottles was broken by the discharge, it might be conveniently mended and made serviceable in the following manner. \"Take of Spanish white, eight ounces; heat it very hot in an iron ladle, to evaporate all the moisture; and when cool sift it through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LAWN\">lawn</a> sieve; and three ounces of pitch, three quarters of an ounce of rosin, and half an ounce of bees wax; heat them all together over a gentle fire, stirring the whole frequently for near an hour; then take it off the fire, and continue the stirring till it is cold and fit for use.\" The bottles cemented with this composition, however, were not judged to be sufficiently strong to stand in their original place, but were removed to the second or third row, as it was apprehended they could best sustain the charge.\n\nIn relating the experiment of charging and discharging a Leyden phial, we have briefly described the discharging charging rod. Discharging rods are made of various rod forms and dimensions; fig. 13 represents one of the most common forms. It is convenient that the legs should move upon a hinge, so that the balls may be placed at a greater or lesser distance as occasion may require; the extremities of the legs should terminate in points, and the balls be made to screw on and off at pleasure.\n\nFig. 29. represents Mr Henry's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> discharger; Mr Henry's instrument of very extensive use in forming communications between jars, or directing the shock through any particular substance. AB is a flat board fifteen inches long, four broad, and one thick, and forming the basis of the instrument. DC are two glass pillars cemented in two holes upon the board AB, and furnished at their tops with brass caps; each of which has a turning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a>, and supports a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> tube, through which the wires EF and ET slide. Each of these caps is composed of three pieces of brass, connected with each other in such a manner, that the wire EF, besides its\nPrinciples of its sliding through the socket, has two other motions, viz. a horizontal one, and a vertical one. Each of the wires is furnished with an open ring at one end, and at the other has a brass ball; which, by a short spring socket, is slipped upon its pointed extremity, and may be removed from it at pleasure. HG is a circular piece of wood five inches diameter, having a lip of ivory inlaid on its surface, and furnished with a strong cylindrical foot, which fits the cavity of the socket I. This socket is fixed in the middle of the bottom board, and has a screw at K; by which the foot of the circular board is made fast at any required height.\n\nFig. 30. is a small press belonging to this instrument. It consists of two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> pieces of wood, which are forced together by the two screws, a, a. The lower end has a circular foot equal to that of the circular table H. When this press is to be used, it must be fixed into the socket I, in place of the circular board HG; which in that case is to be removed.\n\nMr G. Morgan gives the following rules for the construction and use of discharging instruments.\n\n1. They should be constructed so as to allow no other passage to the electric power, than that of the intended circuit.\n\n2. The conducting wires of the instrument should be made to come into contact with the inner surface of the coated electric as speedily as possible; for when approached gradually part of the charge is taken off previous to the explosion, the power of which is thus greatly diminished.\n\n3. The operator should not be within the atmosphere of the conductor at the time of making the discharge.\n\n4. The discharging instrument and the inside of the charged surface should be separated as rapidly as they were connected.\n\nOn these principles the instrument employed by Mr Morgan, in his experiments on the conducting power of various substances, is constructed, and is thus described by him.\n\nA and B, fig. 31. are two brass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a>, whose diameter is four or five inches; they are connected by an axis, which is made to turn easily in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLAR\">collar</a>, fixed upon the glass stem DM. The wires DC, and EF, are screwed into the circumference of the wheels, but on sides directly opposite to each other. The length of these wires is regulated by the distances at which the discharging rod is fixed from the conducting body, and their direction is perpendicular to the axis of the wheels. Two other wires are to be fixed perpendicularly to the planes of the wheels, to the circumference of which they are screwed as nearly as possible, but at opposite points, so that they may strike objects lying in the same line, parallel to the axis at the distance of half a revolution from each other. The length of these last wires is regulated by the distances at which they join the metallic or other connection that is formed with the outside of the coated phial.\n\nThe mode of using this discharging rod is as follows. When C is brought into contact with the conductor, it receives the electric power, and conveys it through G into the outside of the coated surface. The motion of C is not stopped by the contact, but the continuance of it brings E into the same contact by which the residue of the jar is conveyed through K to the outside. The glass stem should penetrate deeply into each of the caps, for the whole apparatus will be otherwise loosened and put out of order, by the necessary rapidity of the motion and the conglomeration of parts attending it.\n\nIf C, in its circumvolutions, strike against an immoveable body in connexion with the conductor, it is frequently stopped, and then its ball is injured, or a change unfavourable to the accuracy of the experiment takes place.\n\nTo prevent these inconveniences, C, fig. 32. strikes the ball A which is connected with the brass tube that penetrates into the conducting substance, with an elastic wire bent into the form of a spring. The points and edges of this instrument are rendered impotent by fattening a box to the brass tube, so that the ball A may move backwards and forwards in the hollow of it, when struck by C. The box should be made of hard wood, and its edge carefully turned and well polished.\n\nWhen a coated jar has been discharged, either spontaneously, or by a discharger, there is still a portion of the charge remaining, sufficient to give a slight shock, as will be found by grasping the outside with one hand, and with the other touching the ball of the wire. As this remaining charge, especially in large jars or batteries, is often so considerable as to give a pretty severe shock, it is therefore proper to caution the experimenter, not to touch the outside of the jar or battery, or any conductor which communicates with the inside at the same time.\n\nEvery machine will not charge jars equally well, but the power of charging will depend much on the goodness of the cylinder.\n\nIn a battery it sometimes happens, that one or more of the jars is more apt than the rest to undergo a spontaneous discharge, and in this case, the whole of the battery will be discharged at the same time, although the other jars, without this accident, would have contained a much higher charge.\n\nTo remedy the inconvenience of some of the jars in Mr Nairne's battery bursting at the time of the discharge, Mr Nairne proposed that the discharge should not be made through a perfect conductor of a shorter circuit than a battery five feet; and this method he found so effectual, that from being after he adapted it, he was able to discharge a battery broken by for a hundred times without breaking a single jar, a discharge which before was continually happening. It must be observed, however, as will appear soon, that when the circuit through which the discharge is made, is considerably lengthened, the force of the discharge is also proportionally diminished. Hence in many experiments, where it is necessary to employ the highest possible charge, this method of diminishing the risk of breaking the jars is inadmissible.\n\nIf a Leyden phial, or any other coated electric, be insulated or placed so that its external coating has no communication with conducting bodies, it cannot be charged. Place a Leyden phial on the insulating stool, or on a wine glass turned mouth downwards; connect the knob of the jar, or its outside coating, with the prime conductor, by means of a chain, and let the machine in motion. It will then be observed that the quadrant electrometer on the knob will soon rise to 90\u00b0, seeming to indicate that the jar is charged. On taking off the connection between the jar and the prime conductor, and endeavouring to discharge the jar by means of the discharging rod, or by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, it will however appear\nIf now the outside of the jar, still standing on the inflator, be connected with the floor, table, &c., by a chain, and then charged, the result will be very different as the jar will then receive its usual charge.\n\nIf a jar be inflated, and one side of it, instead of being connected with the earth, be connected with the insulated rubber, while the other side communicates with the prime conductor, the jar will be charged, and perhaps in a more expeditious manner.\n\nTo make the above experiment in a clearer and more satisfactory manner, place the jar upon the stool as before, and with its wire not in contact, but at about half an inch distance from the prime conductor; hold the knob of another wire at such a distance from the outside coating of the jar, as the knob of the jar is from the prime conductor, then let the winch of the machine be turned, and it will be observed, that whenever a spark comes from the prime conductor to the wire of the jar, another spark passes from the outside coating of the jar to the knob of the wire presented towards it. In this manner the jar becomes charged.\n\nIf instead of the knobbed wire, a pointed wire be presented to the outside of the jar, the point will appear illuminated with a star; and if instead of presenting any wire to the jar, a point be connected with its coating, the point will appear illuminated with a brush of rays which will last as long as the jar is charging.\n\nIf the knob of another jar be presented to the outside coating of the inflated jar in the above experiment, it will also be charged.\n\nThe charge of a coated jar, or any coated electric, resides in the jar, or electric, and not in the coating.\n\nTake an uncoated phial, and, for a coating on the outside, stick a piece of tinfoil with a little tallow or bees wax, so that it can just adhere to the glass; and for an inside coating put into the jar a quantity of small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a> or of mercury; stop the mouth of the jar with a perforated cork, through which insert a knobbed wire, so as to communicate with the shot or the mercury. Then hold the phial thus coated, by its outside coating, and charge it by presenting the knob of the wire to the prime conductor. When it is charged, turn it upside down, so that the wire, and the mercury or shot within the jar, may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> into a dry glass vessel; then remove also the outside coating. During this operation the phial does not lose its charge; and if the shot or mercury be examined, it will be found that they are not more electrified than would happen to any other inflated body of equal conducting power, after having been in contact with the prime conductor. Now replace the outside coating on the phial, and pour into it the shot or mercury; then touch with one hand the outside coating, and with the other introduce a knobbed wire within the phial so as to touch the inside non-electric, and you will feel a shock, which will prove that the jar has lost very little of its charge by removing the coatings.\n\nThe same experiment may be more conveniently made by laying a pane of glass upon a metal plate, and covering an equal part of the upper surface with tin foil, having a silk thread fastened to one of its sides, by which it may be easily taken off when the glass is charged, and as easily replaced when required.\n\nThis important fact, that the charge in a coated electric resides in the electric and not in the coating, was ascertained by Dr Franklin.\n\nWhen he first began his experiments upon the Leyden phial, he imagined that the electric power was all accumulated in the substance of the non-electric in contact with the glass; but he afterwards found by the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANALYSIS\">analysis</a> of the bottle, that the power of giving a shock lay in the glass itself, and not in the coating.\n\nIn order to find where the strength of the charged bottle lay, he placed it upon glass; then first took out the cork and the wire, and finding the virtue was not in them, he touched the outside coating with one hand, and put the finger of the other into the mouth of the bottle, when the shock was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> quite as strong as if the cork and the wire had been in it. He then charged the phial again, and pouring out the water into an empty bottle inflated, expected that if the force resided in the water it would give the shock, but he found it gave none. He then judged that the electric fire must either have been lost in decanting, or must remain in the bottle, and the latter he found to be true; for filling the charged bottle with fresh water, he found the shock, and was satisfied that the power of giving it resided in the glass itself.\n\nHe made the same experiment with panes of glass, laying the coating on lightly, and charging it as he had before charged the water in the bottle, and the result was the same in both. This experiment is more satisfactory than the former; because when the water is poured out of the phial, there still remains a thin coating of the fluid, which might be thought to contain the power of giving a shock.\n\nA charged jar may be gradually discharged by making a conducting body communicate alternately with the outside and the inside coating.\n\nExperiment 1.\u2014Fig. 33 represents an electric jar having a wire, CDE, fastened on its outside, which is fixed so as to have its knob E as high as the knob A. Plate B is the figure of a spider formed out of a piece of cork slightly burned, with a few short threads run through it to represent its legs. This spider is to be fastened at the end of a silk thread, proceeding from the ceiling of the room, or any other support, so that the spider may hang midway between the two knobs AE, when the jar is not charged. Let the place of the jar upon the table be marked; then charge the jar, by bringing its knob A in contact with the prime conductor, and replace it in its marked place. The spider will now begin to move from knob to knob, and continue this motion for a considerable time, sometimes for several hours.\n\nThis experiment is one of the earliest that were made by Dr Franklin and his friends, and is described by Dr Franklin in one of his letters to Collinson.\n\nExperiment 2.\u2014Let a coated jar be inflated by passing it through a ring fixed upon a glass stand, as represented at fig. 34.

In the course of his experiments on air, he found that by means of the electric spark, he could <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERT\">convert</a> the blue <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of a vegetable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFUSION\">infusion</a> into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a>. The instrument used in this experiment, was a glass tube about four or five inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, and one or two tenths of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a> in the gases, the inside; a piece of wire was put into one end of the tube, and fixed there with cement; a brass ball was fixed on the top of this wire; the lower part of the tube Dr Priestley was filled with water, tinged blue with a piece of turnery\u2014fole or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIL\">archil</a>. This was easily effected by fitting the tube in a vessel of the tinged water, then placing it under a receiver on the plate of an air-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>; exhausting the receiver in part, and then, on letting in the air, the tinged liquor rose in the tube, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a> would be in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the accuracy of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a>; now taking the tube and vessel from under the receiver, he threw strong sparks on the brass ball from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIME\">prime</a> conductor.\n\nWhen Dr Priestley made this experiment, he perceived, that after the electric sparks had been passed between the wire and the liquor for about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, the upper part of the liquor began to look red; in two minutes it was manifestly fo, and the red part did not readily mix with the rest of the liquor. If the tube was inclined where the sparks were passed through it, the redness extended twice as far on the lower side as on the upper. In proportion as the liquor became red, it advanced nearer to the wire, so that the air through which the sparks were passed, was diminished; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> amounted to about one fifth of the whole space; after which a continuation of the electric sparks produced no sensible effect.\n\nTo determine the cause of the change of colour, Dr Priestley expanded the air in the tube by means of an air-pump, till it expelled all the liquor, and admitted fresh blue colour in its place; but after this, electricity produced no sensible effect on the air or on the liquor; so that it was clear, that the air had been decomposed, and something of an acid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> had been produced. The result was the same with wires of different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>. It was also the same, when by means of a bent tube, the sparks were made to pass from the liquor in one leg of the tube to the liquor in the other. The air thus diminished, was in the highest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> noxious.\n\nIn passing the electric spark through different gases, it appears of different colours. In carbonic acid gas, the spark is very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a>; in hydrogenous gas, and ammoniacal gas, it appears of a purple or red colour.\n\nDr Priestley found that the electric spark passed through any kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, produced an inflammable gas. He tried it with oil of olives, oil of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TURPENTINE\">turpentine</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> oil of mint. The electric spark when passed through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a>, produces the same effect.\n\nHe found that the electric spark when passed through ammoniacal gas, increases the bulk of this gas; so that, by making about two hundred shocks pass through a given quantity of it, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> quantity was sometimes increased one fourth. If water was admitted to this gas, it absorbed the original quantity, and left about as much gas as was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> by the electricity, and this was a strongly inflammable gas.\nDr Priestley found, that on passing slight electric shocks for about an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, through an inch of carbonic acid gas, confined in a glass tube one-tenth of an inch in diameter, when water was admitted to it, only one fourth of the air was absorbed.\n\nHe likewise found, when the electric spark was passed through carbonated hydrogen gas, that the inside of the tube in which the gas was confined, was covered with a blackish substance.\n\nDr Priestley took the simple electric spark from a conductor of moderate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>, for the space of five minutes without interruption, in a quantity of carbonated hydrogen gas, without producing any change in the inside of the glass; when immediately after, passing through it only two shocks of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> jar, each of which might be produced in less than a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of a minute with the same machine in the same state, the whole of the inside of the tube was completely covered with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>.\n\nA large phial, about an inch and a half wide, being filled with this gas, the explosions of a very large jar containing more than two feet of coated surface, had no effect upon it; from which it seems, that in these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> the force of the shock was not able to decompose the gas.\n\nSeveral valuable experiments were made by the Hon. Henry Cavendish, of which he gave an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> in the 73rd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Phil. Trans.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> used in making the experiments was as follows. The air, through which the spark was intended to be passed, was confined in a glass tube M, bent at an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>, as in fig. 51, which, after being filled with quicksilver, was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a> into two glasses of the same fluid, as in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>. The air to be tried, was then introduced by means of a small tube, such as is used for thermometers, bent in the manner represented by ABC, fig. 52, the bent end of which, after being previously filled with quicksilver, was introduced, as in the figure, under the glass DEF, inverted into water, and filled with the proper kind of air, the end C of the tube being kept stopped by the finger; then, on removing the finger from C, the quicksilver in the tube descended in the leg BC, and its place was supplied with air from the glass DEF. Having thus got the proper quantity of air into the tube ABC, it was held with the end C uppermost, and stopped with the finger; and the end A, made smaller for that purpose, being introduced into one end of the bent tube M, fig. 51, the air, on removing the finger from C, was forced into that tube by the pressure of the quicksilver in the leg BC. By these means he was enabled to introduce the exact quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOAP\">soap</a>-lees, or any other liquor which he wanted to be in contact with the air.\n\nIn one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, however, in which he wanted to introduce air into the tube many times in the same experiment, he used the apparatus represented in fig. 53, consisting of a tube AB of a small bore, a ball C, and a tube DE of a larger bore. This apparatus was first filled with quicksilver, and then, the ball C and the tube AB were filled with air, by introducing the end A under a glass inverted into water, which contained the proper kind of air, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> out the quicksilver from the leg ED by a siphon. After being thus furnished with air, the apparatus was weighed, and the end A introduced into one end of the tube M, and kept there during the experiment; the way of forcing air out of this apparatus into the tube, being by thrusting down the tube ED a wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CYLINDER\">cylinder</a>, of such a size as almost to fill up the whole bore, and by occasionally pouring quicksilver into the same tube, to supply the place of that pushed into the ball C. After the experiment was finished, the apparatus was weighed again, which showed exactly how much air had been forced into the tube M, during the whole experiment; it being equal in bulk to a quantity of quicksilver, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> was equal to the increase of weight of the apparatus.\n\nThe bore of the tube M used in most of the following experiments, was about one-tenth of an inch; and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of air, occupying the upper part of the tube, was in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> from one and a half to three-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of an inch.\n\nIn order to force an electrical spark through the tube, it was necessary, not to make a communication between the tube and the conductor, but to place an inflated ball at such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from the conductor, as to receive a spark from it, and to make a communication between that ball and the quicksilver in one of the glasses, while the quicksilver in the other glass communicated with the ground.\n\nWhen the electric spark was made to pass through common air, included between short columns of a solution of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LITMUS\">litmus</a>, the solution acquired a red colour, and the air was diminished conformably to what was observed by Dr Priestley. When lime-water was used instead of the solution of litmus, and the spark was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> till the air could be no farther diminished, not the least cloud could be perceived in the lime-water; but the air was reduced to two thirds of its original bulk; which is a greater diminution than it could have suffered by mere phlogistication, as that is very little more than one-fifth of the whole.\n\nThe experiment was next repeated with some impure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a> gas. The gas was very much diminished, but without the least cloud being produced in the lime-water, nor was any cloud produced when carbonic acid gas was let up to it; but on the further addition of a little caustic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol2.html#article-AMMONIA\">ammonia</a>, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> sediment was immediately perceived.\n\nHence we may conclude that the lime-water was saturated by some acid formed during the operation; as in this case it is evident that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> could have been precipitated by the carbonic acid gas alone, but that the caustic ammonia, on being added, would unite with the carbonic acid, and thus becoming a carbonate would precipitate the lime by double <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFFINITY\">affinity</a>; whereas, if the lime had not been saturated with an acid, it would have been precipitated on the addition of carbonic acid gas. As to the brown colour of the sediment, it was probably owing to some of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> having been dissolved.\n\nWhen the impure oxygen gas was confined by soap lees, the diminution proceeded rather faster than when it was confined by lime-water; for which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a>, as well as on account of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIXIVIUM\">lixivium</a> containing a large quantity of alkali in proportion to its bulk, it seemed better adapted than lime-water for experiments designed to investigate the nature of the acid produced. Accordingly some experiments were made to determine of what degree of purity the oxygen gas should be, in order\nElectricity\n\nPrinciples of order to be diminished most readily and in the greatest degree; and it was found that when good oxygen gas was employed, the diminution was but small; when perfectly pure azotic gas was used, no sensible diminution took place; but when five parts of pure oxygen gas, and three of common air were employed, almost the whole of the gases were made to disappear. It must be considered that common air consists of one part of oxygen gas mixed with between three and four of azotic gas, so that a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of five parts of pure oxygen gas and three of common air, was nearly the same thing as seven parts of oxygen gas and three of azotic gas.\n\nHaving made these previous trials, Mr Cavendish introduced into the tube a little soap lees, and then let up some oxygen gas and common air, mixed in the above proportions, which rising to the top of the tube M, distributed the soap-lees in the two legs of the tube, as fast as the air contained in it was diminished by the electric spark; continuing to add more of the same mixture till no further diminution took place; after which a little pure oxygen-gas, and then a little common air were added, in order to see whether cessation of diminution was not owing to some imperfection of the proportion of the two kinds of air to each other, but without effect. The lixivium being then poured out of the tube, and separated from the mercury, seemed to be perfectly neutralized, as it produced no change on the colour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> tinged with the juice of blue flowers. Being evaporated to dryness, a small quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> was left, which was evidently nitre, as appeared by the manner in which paper impregnated with a solution of it burned.\n\nFor more satisfaction, he tried this experiment over again, on a larger <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a>. About five times the former quantity of soap lees were now let up into a tube of a larger bore; and a mixture of oxygen gas and common air, in the same proportions as before, being introduced by the apparatus represented in fig. 53. The spark was continued till no more air could be made to disappear. The liquor when poured out of the tube, smelled evidently of nitrous acid. This fact was found by the manner in which paper, dipped into a solution of it, burned, to be true nitre. It appeared by the test of muriate of baryta, to contain no more sulphuric acid than the soap-lees themselves often contain, which is in general very little; and there is no reason to think that any other acid entered into it, except the nitric.\n\n(T) It was found by C. Monge, who carefully examined the gas produced by passing electric sparks through carbonic acid gas, that it had been rendered inflammable; and that the mercury employed to confine the gas, as well as the wires between which the sparks passed, were oxidated. C. Monge supposed that the carbonic acid employed had undergone no change, but that the water held in solution by it had been decomposed; thus accounting for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OXIDATION\">oxidation</a> of the metals, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> of inflammable gas.\n\nM. Theodore de Saussure, not considering C. Monge's experiments as decisive, repeated them on a larger scale. He caused to circulate for 18 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, electric sparks in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a> of a matra which contained 13 cubic inches of pure carbonic acid gas, and without any mixture of water superabundant to that which it might naturally hold in solution. The mercury in which the inverted matra was immersed rose to about the half of its neck. After electrification the metallic fluid was found oxidated black, as had been observed by Monge and Priestley; but his conductors, which were of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>, were not sensibly altered. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> fluid had experienced a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DILATATION\">dilatation</a>, which appeared to him not to exceed the tenth part of a cubic inch. He then made about a grain of water to pass in contact with the aeriform gas contained in the matra. He let it remain there for several days, without perceiving...\nThe gas obtained from sulphuric acid and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a> was diminished a little, and black spots were formed on the inside of the glass receiver. Afterwards it was observed, that only one-eighth part of the electrified gas was absorbed by water. It extinguished a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a>, and had very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a>.\n\nMuriatic acid gas seemed to oppose in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the passage of the electric sparks, since they would not pass through a greater length than 2\u00bd inches of this air. It was considerably diminished, but the rest was readily absorbed by water.\n\nFluoric acid gas was neither diminished, nor any other way sensibly altered, by the electric sparks.\n\nAmmoniacal gas, extracted from pure ammonia, was at first almost doubled in bulk; then it was diminished a little; after which it remained without any augmentation or diminution. It became unabsorbable by water; and by the contact of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> it exploded, like a mixture of hydrogen gas and a good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of common air.\n\nCommon air was lastly tried, and it was found to give a little faint redness to the tincture of turnsole; becoming, at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> sensibly deoxidized. The experiment was repeated thrice at different times, and in each time after the electrification it was examined by the admixture of nitrous gas in Mr Fontana's eudiometer, and it was compared with the same gas not electrified; the latter always suffering the greatest diminution. In the first experiment the diminutions were \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\); in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a>, \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\); and in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a>, \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\nOn attempting to repeat Mr Cavendish's experiment described above, in which he produced the nitric acid by a mixture of oxygen with azotic gas; instead of a syphon, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">Doctor</a> made use of a glass tube one-sixth part of an inch in diameter, closed at one end, into which an iron wire, \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of an inch in diameter, had been inserted: into this tube, filled with mercury, and fixed in a vertical position, was introduced the air with which the experiment was to be tried. The oxygen gas was obtained from red precipitate, and had been thoroughly purified by alkaline salts, from any acid it might have contained. With a mixture of five parts of this and three of common air, the tube was filled to the height of three inches, to which was added five-twelfths of an inch of lixivium, of the same kind with that used by Mr Cavendish. The result was, that, after transmitting through the tube a continued stream of the electric sparks during 15 minutes, two inches of the air were absorbed by the lixivium: more air being introduced into the tube till it was filled to the height of three inches, when it was again electrified. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> was repeated till 8\u00bd inches of air had been absorbed by the lixivium: this was now examined, and found to be, in some degree, impregnated with the nitric acid; but it was very far from being saturated. With the same lixivium, of which a quarter of an inch remained in the tube, the experiment was continued till 14 inches more of air had been absorbed; but its diminution was not perceived to decrease, though the lixivium had now absorbed 77 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> of air, each equal to its own; whereas, in the experiment related by Mr Cavendish, only 38 measures of air were absorbed by the alkali. But notwithstanding this greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a>, the lixivium was yet far from being saturated.\n\nThe experiment was repeated with oxygen gas, obtained from minium, moistened with the sulphuric acid; seven parts of this were mixed with three of azotic gas, and lixivium added to the height of one-eighth of an inch. Here, as in the former experiment, the diminution continued without any decrease; and the lixivium, after it had absorbed 22\u00bd inches, and consequently 178 times its own measure of air, was very far from being saturated with the nitric acid.\n\nOn this Dr Van Marum wrote to Mr Cavendish; and finding, by his answer, that this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> had used oxygen gas, obtained from a black powder produced by shaking mercury with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a>, he requested to be informed of the process by which it is generated; but Mr Cavendish, not choosing to communicate this at present, he determined to defer the repetition of the experiment till this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> should have published his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of obtaining the oxygen gas used in it.\n\nOur author then goes on to some experiments made\n\nperceiving any dilatation in the volume of the gases, the residue of the operation. He then moistened with a drop of water, which he introduced, the whole inside of the matras; but in vain: the mercury constantly remained at the same height. He, however, found, on absorbing by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POTASH\">potash</a> the residuum of the acid gas, that a cubic inch of carbonic acid gas had disappeared, and had been replaced by a quantity nearly equal, or rather superior, to the inflammable gas. The 20 cubic centimetres, occupied in the neck of the matras, a column four inches in length; and the acid gas, had the supposed explanation been <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a>, would have been dilated through all that space. He then thought that this inflammable gas did not arise from the decomposition of the water, but from that of the carbonic acid itself, by the metal. He indeed found that this gas was not hydrogen gas, but carbonous gas perfectly pure. He burnt 100 parts of it on mercury with about a third of oxygen gas. He did not perceive water after this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a>, which left for residuum 77 parts of carbonic acid gas.\n\nThe dilatation which the latter experiences by electrization may be explained by the different densities of the carbonous gas and the carbonic acid gas. He was not able to verify the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> of C. Monge reflecting the dilatation experienced by the carbonic acid gas, after electrization over mercury.\n\nIf it was not possible to reduce entirely the acid gas into carbonous gas by these processes, it was because the first stage of metallic oxidation prevented an obstacle to further oxidation, by preventing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> of contact. The development of the carbonous gas produced therefore an analogous effect.\n\nIt results then from his observations, that the change which carbonic acid gas undergoes by electrization does not arise from the decomposition of the water, but from the partial decomposition of the carbonic acid gas, which becomes carbonous gas, giving up a part of its oxygen to the metal introduced in those experiments.\nOxygen gas obtained the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> before from red precipitate, being placed over mercury, and electrified for 30 minutes, was diminished by one-fifth, the surface of the quicksilver soon began to be oxidated, and towards the end of the experiment the glass tube was lined with the oxide as to cease to be transparent. By introducing a piece of iron, the electric stream was made to pass through the air without immediately touching the mercury; yet this was equally oxidated.\n\nTwo inches and three quarters of the same kind of gas being placed over water, and electrified in the same manner during half an hour, lost a quarter of an inch; and being suffered to stand 12 hours in the tube, was found to have lost one-eighth of an inch more. This was very nearly the same diminution of the gas that had taken place when it was electrified over mercury; but, in this case, the process appears to have been more slow. The gas remaining after these experiments, being tried by the edimeter, did not differ from unelectrified oxygen gas taken from the same receiver.\n\nTo determine whether the gas retained any of the acid employed in its production, the Doctor repeated the experiment with gas obtained from red precipitate, confined by an infusion of turpentine, but could not perceive in it the least change of colour. He also electrified gas obtained from minium and the sulphuric acid, placed over some diluted acetate of lead; but this was not rendered at all turbid.\n\nThree inches of azotic gas being electrified, during the first five minutes were augmented to 3\u00bd inches, and in the next 10 minutes to 3\u00be inches: some lixivium was then introduced to try whether this would absorb it; but upon being electrified 15 minutes, the column rose to the height of 3\u00bd inches. It was suffered to stand in the tube till the next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>, when it was found to have sunk to its original dimensions.\n\nNitrous gas, confined by lixivium, being electrified during half an hour, lost three quarters of its bulk; the lixivium appeared to have absorbed a great deal of nitric acid; and the gas remaining in the tube did not seem to differ from common azotic gas. Some of the same nitrous gas, confined by lixivium, was, by standing three weeks, diminished to half its bulk, and this residuum also proved to be azotic gas.\n\nHydrogen gas obtained from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> filings and the diluted sulphuric acid, being confined by an infusion of turpentine, was electrified for 10 minutes without any change of colour in the infusion, or any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in the bulk of the air. The tube being filled with the same air to the height of 2\u00bd inches, and placed in diluted acetate of lead, was exposed to the electric stream during 12 minutes, in which time the enclosed gas rose to five inches; but the acetate remained perfectly clear. Three inches of inflammable gas, obtained from a mixture of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALCOHOL\">alcohol</a> and sulphuric acid, on being electrified for 15 minutes, rose to 10 inches; thus dilated, it lost all its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFLAMMABILITY\">inflammability</a>, and when nitrous gas was added, no diminution ensued.\n\nA column of ammoniacal gas obtained by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> from pure ammonia, three inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, was electrified four minutes, and rose to six inches, but did not rise higher when electrified ten minutes longer. It appears that this air is not expanded more by the powerful electric stream from this machine than by the common spark. Water would not absorb this electrified air, which was in part inflammable.\n\nThe tube, being filled to the height of an inch with ammoniacal gas, and inverted in mercury, was electrified four minutes; in which time the tube was filled with eight inches of gas, which proved to be equally inflammable, and as little absorbed by water as the ammoniacal gas.\n\nThe following experiment is very curious. Two balloons, made of the allantoides of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALF\">calf</a>, were filled periment with hydrogen gas, of which each contained about two cubic feet. To each of these was suspended, by a filken thread about eight feet long, such a weight as was just sufficient to prevent it from rising higher in the air; they were connected, the one with the positive, the other with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a> conductor, by small wires about 30 feet in length; and being kept near 20 feet asunder, were placed as far from the machine as the length of the wires would admit. On being electrified, these balloons rose up in the air as high as the wire allowed, attracted each other, and uniting as it were into one cloud, gently descended.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a> of air by the electric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a>, is well illustrated by an experiment of Mr Kinnerley, described by Mr Cavallo, Fig. 54. Plate CLXXXIX. This instrument, which the inventor, Mr Kin-nerley, calls the electrical air thermometer, it being very useful to observe the effects of the electric explosion upon air. The body of this thermometer consists of a glass tube AB, about ten inches long, and nearly two inches diameter, and closed air-tight at both ends by two brass caps. Through a hole in the upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>, a small tube HA, open at both ends, is introduced in some water at the bottom B of the large tube. Through the middle of each of the brass caps, a wire FG, EI, is introduced, having a brass knob within the glass tube, and by sliding through the caps, they may be set at any distance from one another. This instrument is, by a brass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a> C, fastened to the pillar of the wooden stand CD, that supports it. When the air within the tube AB is rarefied, it will press upon the water at the bottom of the tube, which will consequently rise in the cavity of the small tube; and as this water rises higher or lower, so it shows the greater or less rarefaction of the air within the tube AB, which has no communication with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> air.\n\nIf the water, when this instrument is to be used, is all at the bottom of the large tube, (i.e. none of it is in the cavity of the small tube) it will be proper to blow with the mouth into the small tube, and thus cause the water to rise a little in it; where, for better regulation, a mark may be fixed.\n\nBring the knobs GI of the wires IE, FG, into contact with one another, then connect the ring E or F, with one side of a charged jar, and the other ring with the other side, by which operation a shock will be made to pass through the wires FG, IE, i.e. between the knobs EI. In this case you will observe, that the water in the small tube is not at all moved from the mark.\n\nPut the knobs GI, a little distant from one another, and send a shock through them as before, and you will\nPrinciples of Electricity illustrated by experiment.\n\nIf the experiment be made in a room, where the degree of heat is variable, then proper allowance must be made for this circumstance, in estimating the event of the experiment; for the electrical air thermometer is affected by heat or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> in general, as well as by that caused by an electric spark.\n\nIn the year 1789, Messrs Paets, Van Troostwyk, and Deiman, the three associated Dutch chemists, as they are generally called, sent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to M. de la Mettrie, giving an account of some experiments, which they, assisted by Mr Cuthbertson, had made on the effect of passing a stream of electricity for a considerable time through water. Their letter was printed in the Journal de Physique for that year; but the account is too long to be inserted here; we shall, therefore, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a> the following succinct account of the experiment by Dr Pearson.\n\nThe apparatus employed was a tube 12 inches in length, and its bore was one-eighth of an inch in diameter, English measure; which was hermetically sealed at one end, and, while it was sealing, an inch and a half of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> or platina wire was introduced within the tube, and fixed into the closed end, by melting the glass around the extremity of the wire. Another wire of platina, or of gold, with platina wire at its extremity, immersed in quicksilver, was introduced at the open end of the tube, which extended to within five-eighths of an inch of the upper wire, which, as was just said, was fixed into the sealed extremity (u).\n\nThe tube was filled with distilled water, which had been freed from air by means of Cuthbertson's last improved air-pump, of the greatest rarefying power. As the open end of the tube was immersed in a cup of quicksilver, a little common air was let into the convex part of the curved end of the tube, with the view of preventing fracture from the electrical discharges.\n\nThe wire which passed through the sealed extremity was set in contact with a brass insulated ball; and this insulated ball was placed at a little distance from the prime conductor of the electrical machine. The wire of the lower or open extremity, immersed in quicksilver, communicated by a wire or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> with the exterior coated surface of a Leyden jar, which contained about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a> foot of coating; and the ball of the jar was in contact with the prime conductor.\n\nThe electrical machine consisted of two plates of 31 inches in diameter, and similar to that of Teyler. It possessed the power of causing the jar to discharge itself 25 times in 15 revolutions. When the brass ball and that of the prime conductor were in contact, no air or gas was discharged from the water by the electrical discharges; but on gradually increasing their distance from one another, the position was found in which gas was discharged, and which ascended immediately to the top of the tube. By continuing the discharges, gas continued to be discharged, and ascend, till it reached nearly to the lower extremity of the upper wire; and then a discharge occasioned the whole of the gas to disappear, a small portion excepted, and its place was consequently supplied by water.\n\nThe residuary portion of gas being let out after each experiment, and the discharges being continued in the same water, this residuary gas was left in smaller and smaller quantity; so that after four experiments, probably made on the same day, it did not amount to more than 1/80th of the bulk of gas which had been produced. If it had been possible to pass electric sparks through this very small quantity of gas a second time, or oftener, it was supposed it would have been diminished still more. But when the tube had been left for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> only filled with water, the residuary gas was in greater quantity than after the last experiment the preceding day (x).\n\nIt was concluded that the gas produced by the electrical discharges was oxygen and hydrogen gas, from decomposed water:\n\n1. Because no other gas hitherto known instantly disappears on passing through it an electric spark.\n2. The gas obtained must have been the oxygen and hydrogen of decomposed water, because they were in exactly those proportions in which by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> they reproduce water; the trifling residue being considered to be merely a portion of air which had been dissolved in the water.\n3. Liquids which are not compounded of hydrogen and oxygen, as sulphuric and nitric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACIDS\">acids</a>, afforded gas by the electric discharges, but which did not disappear on\n\n(u) In another part of Mr Van Troostwyk's memoir it is stated that the distance was an inch and a quarter from the end of the upper wire to the top of the lower wire; and that the distance between the insulated ball and prime conductor was at first three-fourths of an inch, but that afterwards it was increased to an inch. Although the wire fastened into the top of the tube was said to be an inch and a half in length, it is observed, that when a column of three-eighths of an inch of air was collected, it was almost at the extremity of the upper wire. From these and other inaccuracies, it will be made appear, that no one, from the account published, has been able to repeat the experiment.\n\n(x) In at least fifty experiments I have never seen the residue of gas less than one-fortieth of the gas produced, although the water had been freed from air by the most effectual means. But Mr Schurer (Annales de Chimie, tom. v. p. 276.) testifies that he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> Mr Van Troostwyk make the experiment; and that after it was repeated many times, on the same parcel of water, there was no residue at all. I have very good grounds for believing, that this is one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of inaccuracies in the account published of this subject.\nDr Pearson repeated the above experiments; and has given an ample detail of the manner in which he conducted his experiments, and of their result. Our limits will not permit us to give the paper of this ingenious chemist at length: we shall, therefore, present our readers with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRIEF\">brief</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> of it, referring them for the original to Nicholson's Journal for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a>, and November 1797, or the Philosophical Transactions for the same year.\n\nDr Pearson remarks that electric discharges may be employed in two manners to decompose water, viz. by what has been termed the interrupted explosion, which was Mr Van Troolwyk's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a>, and the uninterrupted or complete explosion.\n\nThe Doctor lays down the following requisites for succeeding in this experiment by the interrupted explosion:\n\n1. The electrical machine must possess sufficient power.\n2. Dr Pearson employed a plate machine, constructed by Cuthbertson, which he considers as preferable to a cylindrical machine.\n3. The Leyden jar must have a sufficient quantity of coated surface. The Doctor found by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> that the proper quantity was about 150 or 160 square inches, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> prime conductor.\n4. The distance between the insulated ball and the prime conductor must always be less than the distance between the extremities of the wires.\n5. The extremities of the upper and under wire within the tube must be at a certain distance from one another. The distance which the doctor generally found to answer best, was about five-eighths or seven-eighths of an inch.\n6. The upper wire fixed into the closed extremity of the tube must be of a proper length and thickness. The diameter of the upper wire cannot perhaps be too small, and the smaller the diameter of the tube, the longer this wire may be.\n7. The tubes must be of a proper length and diameter. The Doctor found the proper length to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> or ten inches, exclusive of the curved part. The diameter should not be more than one-eighth, or less than one-twelfth of an inch.\n\nTo succeed by the complete or uninterrupted explosion, Dr Pearson used the following apparatus:\n\n1. A tube about four or five inches in length, and one-fifth or one-sixth of an inch in diameter; one end of which was mounted with a brass cap, and into the other, which was hermetically sealed, was fitted a platinum wire of about 1/40th of an inch in diameter, extending into the brass cap, so as to be almost in contact with it.\n2. He also employed a tube five inches long and half an inch wide, either blown into a funnel at one end, or having a brass funnel fitted to it, and inverted in a brass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISH\">dish</a>; a wire, such as the last, is sealed into the other end, and nearly touches the brass dish.\n\nThe proper distance between the wire and dish must be found by trials. In the Doctor's experiments it was about one-twentieth of an inch.\n\n3. The Leyden jar employed must contain about 150 square inches of coating.\n4. The distance between the insulated ball and the prime conductor was about half an inch.\n\nFrom his experiments Dr Pearson draws the following conclusions.\n\nThe mere concussion by the electric discharges, appears to extricate not only the air dissolved in water, which can be separated from it by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> and the air-pump, but also that which remains in water, notwithstanding these means of extricating it have been employed.\n\nThe quantity of this air varies in the same, and in different waters, according to circumstances. New-River water from the cistern yielded one-fifth of its bulk of air, when placed by Mr Cuthbertson under the receiver of his most powerful air-pump; but in the same situation, New-River water taken from a tub exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> for some time yielded its own bulk of air. Hence the gas procured by the first one, two, or even three hundred explosions in water containing its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> quantity of air, is diminished very little by an electric spark.\n\nThe gas thus separable from water, like atmospheric air, consists of oxygen and nitrogen, or azotic gas; which may be in exactly the same proportions as in atmospheric air: for the water may retain one kind of gas more tenaciously than the other; and on this account the air separated may be better or worse than atmospheric air at different periods of the process for extricating it.\n\nWith regard to the gas, which instantly disappears on passing through it an electric spark, its nature is shown by (a) this very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of thus diminishing; and by the following properties:\n\n(b) A certain quantity of nitrous gas instantly disappeared, apparently composing nitrous acid, on being added to the gas (a).\n\nOxygen gas being added to the residue after saturation with nitrous gas, and an electric spark being applied to the mixture of gasses, well dried, a considerable diminution immediately took place, and water was produced.\n\n(c) Combustion from hydrogen and oxygen gas took place when the tube was about three-fourths full of gas, which was confirmed by passing an electric discharge, under the same circumstances, through a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gas.\n\n(d) Combustion from hydrogen and oxygen gas took place when the points of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPASSES\">compasses</a> were accidentally applied to the part of the tube containing gas; which was confirmed by passing a discharge, under the same circumstances, through a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gas, while the points of the compasses were applied to the tube.\n\n(e) The observations made of the kindling of gas, in small quantities, from time to time, during the process of obtaining it, particularly while it was ascending in chains of bubbles, or was adhering to the funnel of the tube, confirm the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> in favour of this gas being hydrogen and oxygen gas.\n\nThe electric spark fuses and oxidizes metals. The metals by first experiment to ascertain the action of electricity on the electric spark.\nPrinciples of metals was, we believe, made by Dr Franklin. The method in which he made the spark <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FUSE\">fuse</a> metals was by illustrating putting thin pieces of them between two panes of glass bound together, and sending an electric shock through them. Sometimes the piece of glass by which they were confined, would be shattered to pieces by the discharge, and be broken into a kind of coarse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SAND\">sand</a>, which once happened with pieces of thick looking-glass; but if they remained whole, the piece of metal would be melting in several places where it had lain between them, and instead of it, a metallic stain would be seen on both the glasses, the stains on the under and upper glasses being exactly similar in the minutest stroke.\n\nA piece of gold-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> used in this manner appeared not only to have been melted, but even vitrified, as the Doctor thought, or otherwise so driven into the pores of the glass, as to be protected by it from the action of the strongest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-AQUA\">aqua</a>-regia. Sometimes he observed that the metallic stains would spread a little wider than the breadth of the thin pieces of metal. True gold, he observed, made a darker stain, somewhat reddish, and silver a greenish tinge.\n\nMr Cavallo gives the following directions for fusing metallic wires.\n\nConnect with the hook, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> with the outside coating of a battery, containing at least thirty square feet of coated surface, a wire, that is about one-fiftieth part of an inch thick, and about two feet long; the other end of it must be fastened to one end of the discharging rod; this done, charge the battery, and then by bringing the discharging rod near its wires, send the explosion through the small wire, which, by this means, will be made red hot, and melted, so as to fall upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> in different glowing pieces. When a wire is melted in this manner, sparks are frequently seen at a considerable distance from it, which are red hot particles of the metal, that by the violence of the explosion are scattered in all directions. If the force of the battery is very great, the wire will be entirely dispersed by the explosion, so that none of it can be afterwards found.\n\nBy repeating this experiment with wires of different metals, and the same force of explosion, it will be found that some metals are more readily fused than others, and some not at all affected; which shows the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of their conducting power. If it be required to melt such particles of metals, that cannot easily be drawn in wires, as ores, grains of platinum, &c., they may be set in a train upon a piece of wax; this train may be inserted in the circuit, and an explosion may be sent through it, which, if it be sufficiently strong, will melt the metallic particles, as well as the wires; or, if the quantity to be tried be large enough, it may be confined in a small tube of glass.\n\nIf a wire be stretched by weights, and a shock be made to pass through it, so as to render it just red hot, the wire after the explosion will be found considerably increased in length, but if the wire be left loose it will be found after a similar explosion considerably shortened.\n\nIf a wire be melted upon a piece of glass, the glass will after the explosion be found marked with all the prismatic colours.\n\nThe wire may be formed into globules by inclosing it in a glass tube about a quarter of an inch in diameter, and sending the charge of a battery through it. The wire thus melted, will run into globules, which will adhere to the inner surface of the tube, and may be easily separated from it. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> they will be found to be hollow, and are the metal in its least state of oxidation.\n\nSome nicety is required in this experiment, as if the charge be too small, the globule will not be well formed, and if it be too great, the metal will be so much oxidated as to be diffused in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>.\n\nIf a piece of metal be fixed upon each of the knobs of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> discharger, or upon the extremities of the wires that support these knobs, so that their surfaces may come sufficiently near each other for the charge of a battery to be passed between them, and if a discharge be then made, a spot and coloured circles will be formed upon each metallic surface, which are evidently owing to a partial oxidation of the metal.\n\nIn order to exhibit coloured rings upon the surface of metals, place a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> piece of any of the metals upon one of the wires of the universal discharger, and upon the other wire fix a sharp-pointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a>, with the point just opposite to the surface of the metal; then connect one wire of the discharger with the outside of a battery, and the other with the discharging rod, &c. In this manner, if explosions be repeatedly sent either from the point to the piece of metal, or from the latter to the former, they will gradually mark the surface of the piece of metal opposite to the point, with circles, consisting of all the prismatic colours, which are evidently occasioned by laminae of the metal, raised by the force of the explosions.\n\nThese colours appear sooner, and the rings are closer to one another, when the point is nearer to the surface of the metal. The number of rings is greater or less, according as the point of the needle is more sharp or more blunt; and they are represented equally well upon any of the metals.\n\nThe point of the needle is also coloured to a considerable distance; the colours upon it returning in circles, though not very distinctly. This is an experiment of Dr Priestley.\n\nBut the most splendid experiments on the fusion of metals by electricity have been made by Dr Van Marum's experiments. He first tried the effect of a battery containing 130 square feet of coated surface. With this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> power, he melted an iron wire 15 feet long and \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of an inch in diameter; and another time melted a wire of the same metal 25 feet long and \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of an inch in diameter.\n\nHe afterwards added to the battery 90 jars, each of the same size with the former, so that his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> battery now formed a square of 15 feet, and contained 225 square feet of coated glass. He caused wires of different metals to be drawn through the same hole, of one-thirty-eighth part of an inch in diameter, and observed how many inches of each could be melted by the explosion of his battery; taking care in all these experiments to charge it to the same degree as ascertained by his electrometer. The results were as follows:\n\n| Metal       | Inches |\n|-------------|--------|\n| Lead        | 120    |\n| Tin         | 120    |\n| Iron        | 5      |\n| Gold        | 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) |\n| Silver, copper, and brass | Not quite a quarter of an inch. |\n\nThese\nThese several lengths of wire, of the same diameter melted by equal explosions, indicate according to our author, the degree in which each metal is fusible by the electrical discharge; and if these be compared with the fusibility of the same metals by fire, a very considerable difference will be observed. According to the experiments of the academicians of Dijon, to melt tin required a heat of 172 degrees of Reaumur's thermometer.\n\n| Lead   | 230 |\n|--------|-----|\n| Silver | 430 |\n| Gold   | 563 |\n| Copper | 630 |\n| Iron   | 696 (v) |\n\nThus tin and lead appear to be equally fusible by electricity, but not by fire; and iron, which by fire is less fusible than gold, is much more so by the electrical explosion.\n\nWhen iron wire is melted by the explosion of the battery, the red hot globules are thrown to a very considerable distance, sometimes to that of 30 feet; it is however remarkable, that the thicker the wire is which is melted, the further are the globules dispersed; but this is accounted for, by observing, that the globules formed by the fusion of the thinner wires, being smaller, are less able to overcome the resistance of the air, and are therefore sooner stopped in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>.\n\nTwo pieces of iron wire being tied together, the fusion extended no further than from the end connected with the inside coating of the jars to the knot; though wire of the same length and thickness, when in one continued piece, had been entirely melted by an equal explosion.\n\nWhen a wire was too long to be melted by the discharge of the battery, it was sometimes broken into several pieces, the extremities of which bore evident marks of fusion; and the effect of electricity in shortening wire, was very sensible in an experiment made on 18 inches of iron wire \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th of an inch in diameter, which by one discharge lost a quarter of an inch of its length. An explosion of this battery through very small wires, of nearly the greatest length that could be melted by it, did not entirely discharge the jars. On transmitting the charge through 50 feet of iron wire of \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th of an inch in diameter, the doctor found that the residuum was sufficient to melt two feet of the same wire; but this residuum was much less when the wire was of too great a length to be melted by the first discharge. After an explosion of the battery through 180 feet of iron wire of equal diameter with the former, the residuum was discharged through 12 inches of the same wire which it did not melt, but only blued.\n\nTwenty-four inches of leaden wire \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th of an inch in diameter, were entirely oxidized by an explosion of this battery; the greater part of the lead rose in a thick smoke, the remainder was struck down upon a paper laid beneath it, where it formed a stain which resembled the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> of a very dark cloud. When shorter wires were oxidated, the colours were more varied. In Dr Van Marum's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> a plate is given of a stain made by the oxidation of this wire, in which the cloud appears variously shaded with different tints of green, gray, and brown, in a manner of which no adequate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> can give an idea.\n\nOn discharging the battery through 8 inches of tin wire \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th of an inch in diameter, extended over a sheet of paper, a thick cloud of blue smoke arose, in which a number of filaments of oxide of tin were discernible; at the same time a great number of red hot globules of tin, falling upon the paper, were repeatedly thrown up again into the air, and continued thus to rebound from its surface for several seconds. The paper was marked with a yellowish clouded stain immediately under the wire, and with streaks or rays of the same colour issuing from it in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>; some of these formed an uninterrupted line, others were made up of separate spots. In order to be certain that the colour of these streaks was not caused by the paper being scorched, the experiment was several times repeated, when a plate of glass and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> covered with tin were placed to receive the globules. These, however, were stained exactly like the paper. On oxidating five inches of the same kind of wire, the red hot globules were thrown obliquely to the height of four feet, which afforded an opportunity of observing that each globule, in its course, diffused a matter like smoke, which continued to appear for a little time in the parabolic line described by its flight, forming a track in the air of about half an inch in breadth.\n\nDr Van Marum attributes the clouded stain, immediately under the wire, to the instantaneous oxidation of its surface; whereas the remainder of the metal is melted into globules, which while they retain their glowing heat, continue to be superficially oxidated, and during the process, part with this oxide in the form of vapour.\n\nPhenomena something similar to the above, were observed on the oxidation of a wire of equal parts of tin and lead, eight inches long, and \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)d of an inch in diameter. This also was melted into red globules, which were repeatedly driven upwards again from the paper on which they fell, and marked it with streaks of the same kind, but of a brown colour, edged with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a> tinge. Some of these globules, though apparently not less hot, moved with less <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> than others, and were soon stopped in their course by their burning a hole in the paper. In this case a yellow matter was seen to rise from their surface to the height of one or two lines, and extended itself to the width of a quarter of an inch. This matter continued during five or six seconds,\n\n(v) According to the experiments of Mr Wedgwood with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYROMETER\">Pyrometer</a>, the following are the degrees of heat computed in degrees of Fahrenheit's scale that are required to fuse certain metals.\n\n| Metals       | Degrees |\n|--------------|---------|\n| Brass        | 380\u00b0    |\n| Swedish copper | 458\u00b0   |\n| Fine silver  | 471\u00b0    |\n| Fine gold    | 523\u00b0    |\n| <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">Cast</a> iron    | 3997\u00b0   |\n\nVid. Phil. Trans. vol. lxxii.\nPrinciples of seconds, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> from the globules, and formed on their electricity surface a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EFFLORESCENCE\">efflorescence</a>, resembling the flowers of sulphur produced by the foifa-terra. The globules, from which this efflorescence had issued, were found to be entirely hollow, and to consist only of a thin shell. When this mixed metal is oxidated with a less charge of battery, it leaves a stain upon the paper, something similar to that made by lead, and does not run into globules.\n\nDr Van Marum has also given plates of the stains made upon paper by the oxidation of iron, copper, brass, silver, and gold. Those made by copper and brass wire, are uncommonly beautiful, and are variegated with yellow, green, and a very bright brown. Eight inches of gold wire, of \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\)th of an inch diameter, were, by the explosion reduced to a purple substance, of which a part rose like a thick smoke, and the remainder on the paper, left a stain diversified with different shades of this colour. Gold, silver, and copper, cannot easily be melted into globules. Our author has once accidentally succeeded in this; but it required a degree of electrical force so very particular, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> between a charge, which only broke the wire into pieces, and one which entirely oxidated it, could not be ascertained by the electrometer.\n\nDr Van Marum found, as might be expected, that the electric spark did not oxidate metals when confined in any gas which did not contain oxygen. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> wires of lead, tin, and iron, to the electric spark from the discharge of a battery, while the metals were confined in air deprived of oxygen, by the burning of inflammable bodies in it, he found that the first was reduced to a fine powder, which upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> with nitric acid appeared to be merely lead; the two other metals were melted into small globules. He found that in general metals were not more highly oxidated in pure oxigenous gas than in common air, except that lead was reduced to a fine yellow oxide, perfectly resembling mastic.\n\nIn nitrous gas, oxidation took place as easily as in common air or in oxigenous gas.\n\nHis method of making these experiments was as follows. He confined the gas in which he was to subject the metal to the explosion, in a glass cylinder six inches high and four inches in diameter, closed at the upper end with a brass plate; from the centre of this plate was suspended the wire on which the experiment was made. The cylinder was set in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEWTER\">pewter</a> dish filled with water; and to prevent its being broken by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a> of the air, its lower edges were supported by two pieces of wood half an inch high. The lower end of the wire rested on the dish, which was connected with the outside coating of the battery.\n\nOn submitting metallic wires to the action of the electric spark while confined in water, he found that the water was decomposed, the metal being oxidated, and a portion of impure hydrogenous gas being discharged (z).\n\n**Exper.\u2014To burn a metallic wire in oxygen gas, by the electric spark.**\n\nThe apparatus for this experiment is represented at fig. 55. It consists of a glass jar for holding the gas, fitted to the bottom C, so that it may easily be taken out. Into the bottom is fastened a brass knob B, and a wire passes through the top of the jar furnished with a ball at A, and a knob within the jar as D, into which the piece of wire, twisted in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRAL\">spiral</a> form, is to be inserted.\n\nThe jar, thus fitted up with the wire, is to be filled with oxygen gas, obtained from the black oxide of manganese as described under <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEMISTRY\">Chemistry</a>; and on passing the charge of a small Leyden phial through the wire A, an explosion will take place between the knob B, and the extremity of the small wire, by which this will be inflamed, producing a most brilliant and beautiful appearance.\n\nWhen the electric spark is passed through a metallic oxide, the oxide is reduced to the metallic state.\n\nThis was effected by Sign. Beccaria, by making the spark pass between two surfaces of the oxide. In this way he reduced several of the metallic oxides, among others, that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZINC\">zinc</a>. He also obtained pure mercury, from the red sulphuret or cinnabar.\n\nThe electric spark renders bodies <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a>, and makes opaque substances appear transparent.\n\n**Exper. i.\u2014Connect one end of a chain with the outside of a charged phial, and let the other end <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> on the**\n\n(z) Although there was good reason to suppose that the powders produced in the above experiments were real oxides of the metals, yet they had not been proved to be so by any satisfactory experiment. Dr Van Marum and his ingenious coadjutor (Mr Cuthbertson), began a set of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> experiments for the purpose of ascertaining this point; but the doctor was soon discouraged by the breaking of apparatus, and nothing satisfactory was done. Since Mr Cuthbertson's return to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, he has carried into execution a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of experiments which he had projected in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, and by these he has fully proved that metals exploded by the electric spark absorb oxygen from the air and become oxidated, more readily than when fused by ordinary fire. We cannot pretend to give anything like an account of these experiments in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a>; they are published at length in Nicholson's Journal for July 1801. The following are Mr Cuthbertson's general conclusions.\n\n\"From the result of the foregoing experiments, it may be safely concluded that all the ductile metals can by electric discharges be sublimed and converted into proper oxides, by absorbing the oxygen from the atmosphere, and although some of the metals resist the action of common fire, and require different solvents to convert them into oxides, yet they all yield to the action of electricity.\n\nIt is remarkable that platinum, though it resists the action of common fire, is more easily fused by electric discharges than copper, silver, or gold, and seems to be as greedy of oxygen as any of the other metals; but these experiments have not been sufficiently extensive to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a> the last mentioned property.\n\nIt is well known that all metals which are fusible by common fire, absorb oxygen in different degrees, and likewise in different proportions, according to the degrees of heat employed; this seems to take place also when they are sublimed by electric discharges, but the proper degree of discharge for each metal remains for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVESTIGATION\">investigation</a>.\"\nPlace the end of another piece of chain at the distance of about a quarter of an inch from the former; and set a glass decanter of water on the separated ends. On making the discharge, the water will appear perfectly luminous.\n\nThe electric spark may be rendered visible in water, in the following manner. Take a glass tube of about half an inch in diameter, and fix inches long; fill it with water, and to each extremity of the tube adapt a cork, which may confine the water; through each cork insert a blunt wire, so that the extremities of the wires within the tube may be very near one another; then on connecting one of these wires with the coating of a small charged phial, and touching the other wire with the knob of it; by which means the shock will pass through the wires, and cause a vivid spark to appear between their extremities within the tube. The charge in this experiment must be very weak, or there will be danger of bursting the tube.\n\nExper. 2.\u2014Fig. 56. represents a mahogany stand, so constructed as to hold three eggs at greater or smaller distance, according to the position of the sliding pieces. A chain C is placed at the bottom, in such a manner as to touch the bottom of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGG\">egg</a> at B with one end, and with its other the outside coating of a charged jar. The sliding wire A at top is made to touch the upper egg; and the distance of the eggs asunder should not exceed the quarter or eighth part of an inch. The electric spark, being made to pass down by means of the discharging rod through the wire and ball at A, will in a darkened room render the eggs very luminous and transparent.\n\nExper. 3.\u2014Place an ivory ball on the prime conductor of the machine, and take a strong spark, or send the charge of a Leyden phial through its centre, and the ball will appear perfectly luminous; but if the charge be not passed through the centre, it will pass over the surface of the ball and fizzle it. A spark made to pass through a ball of boxwood, not only illuminates the whole, but makes it appear of a beautiful crimson, or rather fine scarlet colour.\n\nExper. 4.\u2014Gold-leaf or Dutch metal may be rendered luminous by discharging a small Leyden phial through it. A strip of gold leaf, one-eighth of an inch in breadth, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-YARD\">yard</a> long, will frequently be illuminated throughout its whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, by the explosion of a jar containing two gallons. This experiment may be beautifully diversified, by laying the gold or silver leaf on a piece of glass, and then placing the glass in water; for the whole gold leaf will appear most brilliantly luminous in the water, by exposing it thus circumstanced to the explosion of a battery.\n\nExper. 5.\u2014The natural, or what answers better, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol4.html#article-BOLOGNIAN_STONE\">Bolognian <a cl</a>ass=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> reduced to powder, (commonly called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTON\">Canton</a>'s phosphorus) may be illuminated by the electric spark in a more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> manner than by the rays of the sun. The method of making this experiment is thus related by Mr Cavallo.\n\nPut some of this powder in a clear glass phial, and stop it with a glass stopper, or a cork and sealing-wax. If this phial be kept in a darkened room (which for this experiment must be very dark) it will give no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>; but let two or three strong sparks be drawn from the prime conductor, when the phial is kept at about two inches distant from the sparks, so that it may be exposed to that light, and this phial will receive the principles of light, and afterwards will appear illuminated for a considerable time.\n\nThis powder may be stuck upon a board by means of the white of an egg, so as to represent figures of planets, letters, or any thing else, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of the operator, and these figures may be illuminated in the dark, in the same manner as the above-described phial.\n\nA beautiful method of expressing geometrical figures with the above powder, is to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> small glass tubes, of about the tenth part of an inch diameter, in the shape of the figure desired, and then to fill them with the phosphoric powder. These may be illuminated in the manner described; and they are not so subject to be spoiled, as the figures represented upon the board frequently are.\n\nThe best method of illuminating this phosphorus, and that Mr W. Canton generally used, is to discharge a small electric jar near it.\n\nPaper, after being made dry and rather hot, marble, oyster shells, and most calcareous substances, especially when burned to lime, have the property of being illuminated by the light given by the discharge of a jar, though not so much as the above-mentioned powder.\n\nPut the extremities of two wires upon the surface of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARD\">card</a>, or other body of an electric nature, so that they may be in one direction, and about one inch distance from one another; then, by connecting one of the wires with the outside of a charged jar, and the other wire with the knob of the jar, the shock will be made to pass over the card or other body. If the card be made very dry, the lucid track between the wires will be visible upon the card for a considerable time after the explosion. If a piece of common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> paper be used instead of the card, it will be torn by the explosion into very small bits.\n\nWhen the electric discharge is passed through a lump of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUGAR\">sugar</a>, the sugar is rendered perfectly luminous, and will retain the light for a considerable time.\n\nExper. 6.\u2014But the most remarkable instance of the penetrability of the electric light, is that related by Dr Priefley. \"I laid a chain (says he), which was in contact with the outside of a jar, lightly on my finger, and sometimes kept it at a small distance by means of a thin piece of glass. If I made the discharge at the distance of about three inches, the electric fire was visible on the surface of the finger, giving it a sudden concussion, which seemed to make it vibrate to the very bone; and when it happened to pass on that side of the finger that was opposite the eye, the whole seemed, in the dark, perfectly transparent.\"\n\nThe following is Mr Cavallo's method of making this curious experiment.\n\nLet the extremities of two wires, one of which proceeds from the outside of a charged jar, and another from one branch of the discharging rod, be laid on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> at the distance of one-tenth of an inch from each other; then put the thumb just upon that interruption, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PRESSING\">pressing</a> it flat down. This done, bring the discharging rod in contact with the knob of the jar, and on making the discharge, the spark which necessarily happens under the thumb will illuminate it in such a manner that the bone and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> blood-vessels may be easily discerned in it.\nIn this experiment the operator need not be afraid of receiving a shock; for the discharge of the jar passes from wire to wire, and only affects the thumb with a sort of tremor, which is far from being painful.\n\nWe have before related Mr Hawkesbee's experiment by which he rendered sealing-wax transparent. Signior Beccaria effected the same by making an electric explosion pass between two plates of sealing-wax, on which some brass-dust was sprinkled. The whole was rendered perfectly luminous and transparent.\n\n**Exper. 7.**\u2014Fig. 57 represents an instrument composed of two glass tubes CD, one within another, and closed with two-knobbed brass caps A and B. The innermost of these is a spiral row of small round pieces of tin-foil stuck upon its outside surface, and lying at about one-thirtieth of an inch from each other. If this instrument be held by one of the extremities, and its other extremity be presented to the prime conductor, every spark that it receives from the prime conductor will cause small sparks to appear between all the round pieces of tin-foil stuck upon the innermost tube; which in the dark affords a pleasing spectacle, the tube appearing encompassed by a spiral line of fire.\n\nFig. 58 represents several spiral tubes placed round a board, in the middle of which is screwed a glass pillar, and on the top of this pillar is cemented a brass cap with a fine steel point. In this a brass wire turns, having a brass ball at each end, nicely balanced on the wire. To make use of this apparatus, place the middle of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> wire under a ball proceeding from the conductor, so that it may receive a succession of sparks from the ball; then push the wire gently round; and the balls in their relative motions will give a spark to each tube, and thereby illuminate them down to the board, which from its brilliancy and rapid motion, affords a most beautiful and pleasing sight.\n\n**Exper. 8.**\u2014The small pieces of tin-foil may be stuck on a flat piece of glass ABCD, fig. 59, so as to represent various fanciful figures. Upon the same principle is the word LIGHT produced, in luminous characters.\n\nIt is formed by the small separations of the tin-foil pasted on a piece of glass fixed in a frame of baked wood, as represented fig. 60. To use this, the frame must be held in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and the ball G presented to the conductor. The spark then will be exhibited in the intervals composing the word; from whence it passes to the hook at h, and thence to the ground by a chain. The brilliancy of this is equal to that of the spiral tubes.\n\nThough many of the following experiments on electric light, may not with strict propriety belong to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAPTER\">chapter</a>, we shall relate them here for the sake of uniformity.\n\nMr G. Morgan, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1785, has given a series of propositions respecting the electric light, and illustrated them by experiments; we shall here give the substance of his paper nearly in his own words.\n\nI. There is no fluid or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> body, in its passage through which the electric light may not be rendered luminous.\n\nThis proposition has been fully illustrated by the foregoing experiments.\n\nII. The difficulty of making any quantity of the electrical light visible in any body, increases as the conducting power of that body increases.\n\n**Exper. 1.**\u2014In order to make the contents of a jar luminous in boiling water, a much higher charge is necessary, than would be sufficient to make it luminous in cold water, which is universally allowed to be the worst conductor.\n\n**Exper. 2.**\u2014There are various reasons for believing the acids to be very good conductors; if, therefore, into a tube filled with water, and circumstanced as has been already described, a few drops of either of the mineral acids are poured, it will be almost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to make the light visible in its passage through the tube.\n\n**Exper. 3.**\u2014If a string, whose diameter is one-eighth of an inch, and whose length is six or eight inches, is moistened with water, the contents of a jar will pass through it luminously; but no such appearance can be produced by any charge of the same jar, provided the same string be moistened with one of the mineral acids.\n\nTo the preceding instance we may add the various instances of metals which will conduct the electric power without any appearance of light, in circumstances the same with those in which the same force would have appeared luminous in passing through other bodies, whose conducting power is less.\n\nIII. That the ease with which the electric light is rendered visible in any particular body, is increased by increasing the rarity of the body. The appearance of a spark, or of the discharge of a Leyden phial, in rarefied air, is well known. But we need not rest the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of the preceding observation on the several varieties of this fact; similar phenomena attend the rarefaction of ether, of spirits of wine, and of water.\n\n**Exper. 4.**\u2014Into the orifice of a tube, 48 inches long, and two-thirds of an inch in diameter, cement an iron ball, so as to bear the weight which presses upon it when the tube is filled with quicksilver, leaving only an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> at the open end, which contained a few drops of water. Having inverted the tube, and plunged the open end of it into a basin of mercury, the mercury in the tube stood nearly half an inch lower than it did in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a> at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a>, owing to the vapour which was formed by the water. But through this rarefied water, the electrical spark passed as luminously as it does through air equally rarefied.\n\n**Exper. 5.**\u2014If, instead of water, a few drops of spirits of wine are placed on the surface of the mercury, phenomena, similar to those of the preceding experiment, will be discovered, with this difference only, that as the vapour in this case is more dense, the electrical spark, in its passage through it, is not quite so luminous as it is in the vapour of water.\n\n**Exper. 6.**\u2014Good ether, substituted in the room of the spirits of wine, will press the mercury down so low as the height of 16 or 17 inches. The electric spark, in passing through this vapour, (unless the force be very great indeed,) is scarcely luminous; but if the pressure on the surface of the mercury in the basin, be gradually lessened by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> of an air-pump, the vapour will become more and more rare, and the electric spark, in passing through it, more and more luminous.\n\n**Exper. 7.**\u2014It has not been discovered, that any vapour does escape from the mineral acids when exposed in vacuo. To give them, therefore, greater rarity.\nPrinciples of Electricity or tenacity, different methods are found necessary.\n\nElectricity With a fine camel-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a>, dipped in the sulphuric, nitric, or the muriatic acid, draw upon a piece of glass a line, about one-eighth of an inch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>. In some instances, you must extend this line to the length of 27 inches, and you will find that the contents of an electric battery, consisting of ten pint phials coated, will pass over the whole length of this line with the greatest brilliancy. If, by widening the line, or by laying on a drop of the acid, its quantity be increased in any particular part, the charge, in passing through that part, will not appear luminous. Water, spirits of wine, circumstanced similarly to the acids in the preceding experiments, will be attended with similar, but not equal effects; because, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> of the inferiority of their conducting power, it will be necessary to make the line, through which the charge passes, considerably shorter.\n\nIV. The brilliancy or splendour of the electric light, in its passage through any body, is always increased by lessening the dimensions of that body; that is, a spark, or the discharge of a battery, which we might suppose equal to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> one quarter of an inch in diameter, will appear much more brilliant, if the same quantity is compressed into a sphere one-eighth of an inch in diameter. This observation is the obvious consequence of many known facts; if the machine be large enough to afford a spark, whose length is nine or ten inches, this spark may be seen sometimes forming itself into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>, in which state it occupies more room, but appears very faintly luminous; at other times, the same spark may be seen dividing itself into a variety of ramifications, which float into the surrounding air. A spark, which in the open air cannot exceed one quarter of an inch in diameter, will appear to fill the whole of an exhausted receiver, four inches wide and eight inches long: but in the former case it is brilliant, and in the latter it grows fainter and fainter, as the size of the receiver increases. This observation is further proved by the following experiments.\n\nExper. 8.\u2014To an insulated ball, four inches in diameter, fix a silver thread, about four yards long. This thread, at the end which is removed from the ball, must be fixed to another insulated substance. Bring the ball within the striking distance of a conductor, and the spark, in passing from the conductor to the ball, will appear very brilliant; the whole length of the silver thread will appear faintly luminous at the same instant. When the spark is confined within the dimensions of a sphere, one-eighth of an inch in diameter, it will be bright; but when diffused over the surface of air which received it from the thread, its light will be so faint as to be seen only in a dark room. If you lessen the surface of air which receives the spark, by shortening the thread, it will not fail to increase the brightness of the appearance.\n\nExper. 9.\u2014To prove that the faintness of the electric light in vacuo, depends on the enlarged dimensions of the space through which it is diffused; we have nothing more to do than to introduce two pointed wires into the vacuum, so that the fluid may pass from the point of the one to the point of the other; when the distance between them is not more than the one-tenth of an inch, in this case we shall find a brilliancy as great as in the open air.\n\nExper. 10.\u2014Into a Torricellian vacuum, 36 inches long, convey as much air as will fill two inches only of the exhausted tube if it were inverted in water; this quantity of air will afford resistance enough to condense the light as it passes through the tube into a spark, 38 inches in length. The brilliancy of the spark in condensed air, in water, and in all substances through which it passes with difficulty, depends on principles similar to those which account for the preceding facts.\n\nV. That in the appearances of electricity, as well as in those of burning bodies, there are cases in which all the rays of light do not escape; and that the most refrangible rays are those which escape first or most easily. The electrical brush is always of a purple or bluish hue. If you convey a spark through a Torricellian vacuum, made without boiling the mercury in the tube, the brush will display the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a> rays. The spark, however, may be divided and weakened, even in the open air, so as to yield the most refrangible rays only.\n\nExper. II.\u2014To an insulated metallic ball, four inches in diameter, fix a wire a foot and half long; this wire should terminate in four ramifications, each of which must be fixed to a metallic ball half an inch in diameter, and placed at an equal distance from a metallic plate, which must be communicated by metallic conductors with the ground. A powerful spark, after falling on the large ball at one extremity of the wire, will be divided in its passage from the four small balls to the metallic plate. When you examine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the spark in a dark room, you will discover some little ramifications, which will yield the indigo rays only; indeed at the edges of all weak sparks, the same purple appearance may be discovered. You may likewise observe, that the nearer you approach the center of the spark, the greater is the brilliancy of its colour.\n\nVI. That the influence of different media on electrical light, is analogous to their influence on solar light, and will help us to account for some very singular appearances.\n\nExper. 12.\u2014Let a pointed wire, having a metallic ball fixed to one of its extremities, be forced obliquely into a piece of wood, so as to make a small angle with the surface of the wood, and to make the point lie about one-eighth of an inch below the surface. Let another pointed wire, which communicates with the ground, be forced in the same manner into the same wood, so that its point likewise may lie about one-eighth of an inch below the surface, and about two inches distant from the point of the first wire. Let the wood be insulated, and a strong spark, which strikes on the metallic ball will force its passage through the interval of wood which lies between the points, and appear as red as blood. To prove that this appearance depends on the wood's absorption of all the rays but the red; when these points were deepest below the surface, the red only came to the eye through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRISM\">prism</a>; when they were raised a little nearer the surface, the red and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a> appeared; when nearer still, the yellow; and so on, till, by making the spark pass through the wood very near its surface, all the rays were at length able to reach the eye. If the points be only one-eighth of an inch below the surface of soft deal wood, the red, the orange, and the yellow rays will appear as the spark passes through it; but when the points are at an equal depth.\nPrinciples of depth in a harder piece of wood, (such as box) the yellow light will be low, and perhaps the orange will disappear. As a farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> that the phenomena, thus described, are owing to the interposition of the wood, as a medium which absorbs some of the rays, and suffers others to escape; it may be observed, that when the spark strikes very brilliantly on one side of the piece of deal, on the other side it will appear very red. In like manner, a red appearance may be given to a spark which strikes brilliantly over the inside of a tube, merely by spreading some pitch very thinly over the outside of the same tube.\n\nExper. 13.\u2014If into a Torricellian vacuum, of any length, a few drops of ether are conveyed, and both ends of the vacuum are stopped up with metallic conductors, so that a spark may pass through it; the spark in its passage will assume the following appearances. When the eye is placed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to the tube, the spark will appear perfectly white; if the eye is removed to the distance of five or seven yards, the colour of the spark will be reddish. These changes evidently depend on the quantity of medium through which the light passes, and the red light of a distant candle, or a beclouded sun.\n\nExper. 14.\u2014Dr Priestley long ago observed the red appearance of the spark when passing through hydrogen gas; but this appearance is very much diversified by the quantity of medium, through which you look at the spark. When at a very considerable distance, the red comes to the eye unmixed; but if the eye is placed close to the tube, the spark appears white and brilliant. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a>, however, of some of these conclusions, you must observe, that by increasing the quantity of sparks which are conveyed through any portion of hydrogen gas, or by condensing that gas, the spark may be entirely deprived of its red appearance, and made perfectly brilliant. All weak explosions and sparks, when viewed at a distance, bear a reddish hue. Such are the explosions which have passed through water, spirits of wine, or any bad conductor, when confined in a tube whose diameter is not more than an inch. The reason of these appearances seems to be, that the weaker the spark or explosion is, the less is the light which escapes; and the more visible the effect of any medium, which has a power to absorb some of that light.\n\nChalk, oyster-shells, together with those phosphoric bodies, whose goodness has been very much impaired by long keeping, when finely powdered, and placed within the circuit of an electrical battery, will exhibit, by their scattered particles, a shower of light; but these particles will appear reddish, or their phosphoric power will be sufficient only to detain the yellow, orange, and red rays. When spirits of wine are in a similar manner brought within the circuit of a battery, a similar effect may be discovered; its particles diverge in several directions, displaying a most beautiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GOLDEN\">golden</a> appearance. The metallic oxides are, of all bodies, those which are rendered phosphoric with the greatest difficulty; but even these may be scattered into a shower of red luminous particles by the electric stroke.\n\nVol. VII. Part II.\n\nThe following experiments are given by Mr Cavalli to illustrate the appearance of the electric light in rarefied air.\n\nExper. 1.\u2014Fig. 61 represents a prime conductor, invented by Mr Henry, which shows clearly the direction of the electric power passing through it, from whence it is called the luminous conductor (a). The middle part EF of this conductor, is a glass tube about eighteen inches long, and three or four inches in diameter. To both ends of this tube the hollow brass pieces FD, BE, are cemented air-tight, one of which has a point C, by which it receives the electric power, when let near the excited cylinder of the electrical machine, and the other has a knopped wire G, from which a strong spark may be drawn; and from each of the pieces FD, BE, a knopped wire proceeds, within the cavity of the glass tube. The brass piece FD, or BE, is composed of two parts, i.e., a cap F cemented to the glass tube, and having a hole with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VALVE\">valve</a>, by which the cavity of the glass tube may be exhausted of air; and the ball D, which is screwed upon the cap F. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SUPPORTERS\">supporters</a> of this instrument are two glass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILLARS\">pillars</a> fastened in the bottom board H, like the prime conductor represented fig. 61. When the glass tube of this conductor is exhausted of air by means of an air-pump, and the brass ball is screwed on, as represented in the figure, then it is fit for use, and may serve for a prime conductor to an electrical machine.\n\nIf the point C of this conductor is set near the excited cylinder of the machine, it will appear illuminated with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a>; at the same time the glass tube will appear all illuminated with a weak light; but from the knopped wire, that proceeds within the glass from the piece FD, a lucid pencil will issue out, and the opposite knob will appear illuminated with a star or round body of light, which, as well as the pencil of rays, is very clear, and discernible among the other light, that occupies the greatest part of the cavity of the tube.\n\nIf the point C, instead of being presented to the cylinder, be connected with the rubber of the machine, the appearance of light within the tube will be reversed; the knob which communicates with the piece FD appearing illuminated with a star, and the opposite with a pencil of rays.\n\nIf the wires within the tube EF, instead of being furnished with knobs, be pointed, the appearance of light is the same, but it seems not so strong in this, as in the other case.\n\nExper. 2.\u2014Take a glass tube of about two inches conducting diameter, and about two feet long; fix to one of its glass tube ends a brass cap, and to the other a stop-cock, or a valve; then by means of an air-pump exhaust it of air. If this tube be held by one end, and its other end be brought near the electrified prime conductor, it will appear to be full of light, whenever a spark is taken by it from the prime conductor; and much more so, if an electric jar be discharged through it.\n\nThis experiment may also be made with the receiver of an air-pump.\u2014Take, for instance, a tall receiver, clean and dry, and through a hole at its top insert a wire,\n\n(4) An instrument much like this conductor was some years ago invented by Dr Watson, with which he made several original experiments upon the electric light.\nPrinciples of wire, which must be cemented air-tight. The end of Electricity the wire, that is within the tube, must be pointed, but illustrated by experiment not very sharp; and the other end must be furnished with a knob. Put this receiver upon the plate of the air-pump, and exhaust it. If now the knob of the wire at the top of the receiver be touched with the prime conductor, every spark will pass through the receiver in a dense and large body of light, from the wire to the plate of the air-pump.\n\nIt must be observed, that when the air is very much rarefied, the electric light in it is less dense, though more diffused; and contrarywise.\n\nExper. 3.\u2014Take a phial nearly of the shape and size of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLORENCE\">Florence</a> flask, such as is represented at fig. 62.\n\nFix a stop-cock or a valve to its neck, and exhaust it of air as much as it is possible with a good air-pump. If this glass be rubbed in the common manner used to excite electrics, it will appear luminous within, being full of a flashing light, which plainly resembles the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AURORA_BOREALIS\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol3.html#article-AURORA\">aurora</a> borealis, or northern light. This phial may also be made luminous by holding it by either end, and bringing the other end to the prime conductor; in this case all the cavity of the glass will instantly appear full of flashing light, which remains in it for a considerable time after it has been removed from the prime conductor.\n\nInstead of the above-described glass vessel, a glass tube, exhausted of air and hermetically sealed, may be used, and perhaps with greater advantage. The most remarkable circumstance of this experiment is, that if the phial or tube, after it has been removed from the prime conductor (and even several hours after its flashing light hath ceased to appear) be grasped with the hand, strong flashes of light will immediately appear within the glass, which often reach from one of its ends to the other.\n\nExper. 4.\u2014GI, fig. 63, represents the receiver with the plate of an air-pump. In the middle of the plate IF, a short rod is fixed, having at its top a metal ball B nicely polished, whose diameter is nearly two inches. From the top of the receiver another rod <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AD\">AD</a> with a like ball A proceeds, and is cemented air-tight in the neck C; the distance of the balls from one another being about four inches, or rather more. If, when the receiver is exhausted of air, the ball A be electrified positively, by touching the top D of the rod AD with the prime conductor or an excited glass tube, a lucid atmosphere appears about it, which, although it consists of a feeble light, is yet very conspicuous, and very well defined; at the same time the ball B has not the least light. The atmosphere does not exist all round the ball A, but reaches from about the middle of it, to a small distance beyond that side of its surface, which is towards the opposite ball B. If the rod with the ball A be electrified negatively, then a lucid atmosphere, like the above described, will appear upon the ball B, reaching from its middle to a small distance beyond that side of it, that is towards the ball A; at the same time the negatively electrified ball A remains without any light.\n\nThe operator in this experiment must take care not to electrify the ball A too much, as, in that case, a spark will pass from one ball to the other, and the desired effect will not be produced. A little practice, however, will render the experiment very easy and familiar.\n\nThis elegant experiment is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of Sig. Becaria.\n\nFig. 64. and 65. represent a curious appearance of the electric light. In fig. 65, the light is seen streaming from a wire within the exhausted receiver of an air-pump. If in this state of things, the hand or a finger be applied to the external part of the receiver, part of the light will approach the finger, as represented in fig. 64.\n\nThe electric spark produces changes on most artificial colours.\n\nMr Cavallo made several experiments on substances Mr Cavallo painted with various colours. They were occasioned by his having observed that an electric spark sent over the surface of a card, made a black stroke upon a red spot, from which he was induced to try the effect of sending shocks over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDS\">cards</a> painted with different water colours. The force employed was generally about one foot and a half of charged surface; and the shocks were sent over the cards while the latter were in a very dry state.\n\n\"<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMILION\">Vermilion</a> was marked with a strong black track, about one tenth of an inch wide. This stroke is generally single, as represented by AB, fig. 66. Sometimes it is divided in two towards the middle, like EF; and sometimes, particularly when the wires are set very distant from one another, the stroke is not continued, but interrupted in the middle, like GH. It often, although not always happens, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> is marked stronger at the extremity of that wire from which the electric sparks issue, as it appears at E, supposing that the wire C communicates with the positive side of the jar; whereas, the extremity of the stroke, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> to the point of the wire D, is neither so strongly marked, nor surrounds the wire so much, as the other extremity E.\n\n\"Carmine received a faint and slender impression of a purple colour.\n\n\"Verdegris was shaken off from the surface of the card; except when it had been mixed with strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>-water, in which case it received a very faint impression.\n\n\"White lead was marked by a long black track, not so broad as that on vermilion.\n\n\"Red lead was marked with a faint mark much like carmine.\n\n\"The other colours I tried were <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORPIMENT\">orpiment</a>, gamboge, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAP\">sap</a> green, red <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INK\">ink</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ULTRAMARINE\">ultramarine</a>, prussian blue, and a few others which were compounds of the above; but they received no impression.\n\n\"It having been intimated, that the strong black mark, which vermilion receives from the electric shock, might possibly be owing to the great quantity of sulphur contained in that mineral, I was induced to make the following experiment. I mixed together equal quantities of orpiment and flower of sulphur; and with this mixture, by the help, as usual, of very diluted gum-water, I painted a card; but the electric shock sent over it left not the least impression.\n\n\"Deferring of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> this investigation on colours, a little farther, with a particular view to determine something relative to the properties of lamp black and oil, I procured some pieces of paper painted on both sides...\"\nChap. VIII.\n\nPrinciples of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIDES\">fides</a> with oil colours; and fending the charge of two feet of coated glafs over each of them, by making the interruption of the circuit upon their surfaces, I observ- ed that the pieces of paper painted with lamp black, prussian blue, vermilion, and purple brown, were torn by the explosion; but white lead, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPLES\">Naples</a> yellow, Eng- lish ochre, and verdigrife, remained unharmed.\n\n\"The same shock fent over a piece of paper painted very thickly with lamp black and oil left not the least impression. I fent the shock also over a piece of paper unequally painted with purple brown, and the paper was torn where the paint lay very thin, but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>- mained unhurt where the paint lay evidently thicker. These experiments I repeated several times, and with some very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a>, which naturally produced different effects; however, they all seem to point out the following propositions.\n\n\"1. A coat of oil-paint over any substance, defends it from the effect of such a shock as would otherwise injure it; but by no means defends it from any electric shock whatever.\n\n\"2. No one colour seems preferable to the others, if they are equal in substance, and equally well mixed with oil; but a thick coating does certainly afford a better <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> than a thinner one.\n\n\"By rubbing the above mentioned pieces of paper, I find that the paper painted with lamp-black and oil is more easily excited, and acquires a stronger electricity, than the papers painted with the other colours; and perhaps on this account it may be, that lamp black and oil might resist the shock somewhat better than the other paints.\n\n\"It is remarkable that vermilion receives the black impression when painted with linseed oil nearly as well as when painted with water. The paper painted with white lead and oil receives also a black mark; but its nature is very singular. The track when first made, is almost as dark as that marked on white lead painted with water; but it loses its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACKNESS\">blackness</a>, and in about an hour's time (or longer, if the paint is not fresh) it appears without any darkness; and when the painted paper is laid in a proper light appears only marked with a colourless track, as if made by a finger nail. I fent the shock also over a piece of board, which had been painted with white lead and oil four years before, and the explosion marked the black track upon this also; this track, however, was not so strong, nor vanished so soon, as that marked upon the painted paper; but in about two days time it also vanished entirely.\n\nCHAP. VIII. Of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">Mechanical</a> Effects of the Electric Power.\n\nThe electric power in its passage through the air, drives light bodies before it.\n\nSig. Beccaria put a narrow piece of silver leaf between two plates of wax, laying it across them, but so that it did not quite reach one of the sides. The discharge being made through this strip of metal, by bringing a wire opposite to the silver at the place where it was discontinued; the silver was found melted, and part of it dispersed all along the track that the electric spark took between the plates of wax, from the silver to the wire.\n\nThe following experiment shows the force of the elec-\nAn experiment given by Mr. Cavallo to prove the direction of the electric power in the discharge of a Leyden phial, will afford a good illustration of our present position.\n\nBend a card, length-ways, over a round ruler, so as to form a channel, or semicircular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GROOVE\">groove</a> (B): lay this card upon the circular board E of the universal discharger, and in the middle of it put a pith-ball of about half an inch diameter; then at equal distances, about half or three quarters of an inch from the pith-ball, lay the two brass knobs DD. The card being perfectly dry, and rather hot, if you connect, by means of a chain or otherwise, the outside of a charged jar with one of the wires C, and bring the knob of the jar to the other wire C, you will observe, that on making the discharge, which must pass between the knobs DD, and over the card, &c., the pith-ball is always driven in the direction of the electric power; i.e., it is pushed towards that knob which communicates with the negative side of the jar.\n\nIt must be observed, that in this experiment the charge of the jar must be just sufficient to pass through the interval in the circuit; the card, or piece of baked wood, must be very dry and clean; and, in short, the disposition of the apparatus, and the performance of this curious experiment, require a degree of nicety that can only be obtained by practice. Without great precaution, it sometimes fails; but when the operator has once got it to succeed, and follows exactly the same method of operating, he may be sure that the event of the experiment will be constantly as above described.\n\nBy the electric explosion, paper, pasteboard, card, thin glass, and other non-conducting substances, may be perforated or broken.\n\nExper. 1.\u2014Take a card, a quire of paper, or the cover of a book, and keep it close to the outside coating of a charged jar; put one knob of the discharging rod upon the card, quire of paper, &c., so that between the knob and coating of the jar the thickness of that card or quire of paper only is interposed; lastly, by bringing the other knob of the discharging rod near the knob of the jar, make the discharge, and the electric spark will pierce a hole (or perhaps several) quite through the card or quire of paper. This hole has a bur raised on each side, except the card, &c., be pressed hard between the discharging rod and the jar. If this experiment be made with two cards instead of one, which however must be kept very little distant from one another, each of the cards, after the explosion, will be found pierced with one or more holes, and each hole will have burs on both surfaces of each card. The hole, or holes, are larger or smaller, according as the card, &c., is more damp or more dry. It is remarkable, that if the nostrils are presented to it, they will be affected with a sulphureous, or rather a phosphorescent smell, just like that produced by an excited electric.\n\nIf, instead of paper, a very thin plate of glass, resin, sealing wax, or the like, be interposed between the knob of the discharging rod and the outside coating of the jar, on making the discharge, this will be broken in several pieces.\n\nIf the explosion is sent over the surface of a piece of glass, this will be marked with an indelible track, which generally reaches from the extremity of one of the wires to the extremity of the other. In this manner, the piece of glass is very seldom broken by the explosion. But Mr. Henley discovered a very remarkable method to increase the effect of the explosion upon the glass; which is by pressing with weights that part of the glass which lies between the two wires (i.e., that part over which the shock is to pass). He put first a thick piece of ivory upon the glass, and placed upon that ivory a weight at pleasure, from one quarter of an ounce to five pounds: the glass in this manner is generally broken by the explosion into innumerable fragments, and some of it is absolutely reduced into an impalpable powder. If the glass is very thick, and resists the force of the explosion, so as not to be broken by it, it will be found marked with the most lively prismatic colours, which are thought to be occasioned by very thin laminae of the glass, in part separated from it by the shock. The weight laid upon the glass is always thrown by the explosion, and sometimes it is thrown quite off from the ivory. This experiment may be most conveniently made with the universal discharger.\n\nExper. 2.\u2014Place the extremities of two wires, one above and the other below a card, so as to be about an inch distance from each other, taking care that the card be kept steady. Then, make the charge of a Leyden phial pass from one wire to the other, and it will be found, that a luminous track will pass from the end of that wire which is connected with the positive surface of the phial, to the extremity of the other wire, where a hole will be perforated through the card.\n\nThis experiment, to which we shall have occasion to refer hereafter, is by Mr. Lullin of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENEVA\">Geneva</a>.\n\nMr. Symmer made some experiments on the perforation of paper, which we shall mention here, as on them he grounded a principal argument in favour of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> which he adopted, and of which we shall give an account hereafter.\n\nExper. 3.\u2014A piece of paper covered on one side with Dutch gilding, and which had been left accidentally between two leaves in a quire of paper, in which a former experiment had been made, was found to have the impression of two strokes upon it, about a quarter of an inch from each other; the gilding was stripped off, and the paper left bare for a little space in both places. In the centre of one of these places was a little\n\n(b) Instead of the card, a piece of baked wood may be cut in that shape, and painted over with lamp-black and oil; which will answer better than the card, it being much more steady, and not so liable to attract moisture.\nChap. VIII.\n\nPrinciples of the round hole, in the other only an indentation or impression, such as might have been made with the point of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BODKIN\">bodkin</a>.\n\nExper. 4.\u2014In the middle of a paper book, of the thickness of a quire, Mr Symmer put a slip of tinfoil; and in another of the same thickness, he put two slips of the same sort of foil, including the two middle leaves of the book between them. On passing the explosion through the two different books, the following effects were produced. In the first, the leaves on each side of the tinfoil were pierced, while the foil itself remained unpierced; but at the same time, it might be perceived that an impression had been made on each of its surfaces, at a little distance from one another; and such impressions were still more visible on the paper, and might be traced, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> different ways. In the second, all the leaves of the book were pierced, excepting the two that were included between the slips of tinfoil; and in these two, instead of holes, the two impressions in contrary directions, were visible.\n\nThe following experiment shows how easily so hard a substance as glass, may be pierced by the electric spark. It is thus related by Mr Cavallo.\n\nExper. 5.\u2014Let a glass tube of any diameter, and about five or six inches in length, be closed hermetically, or by means of sealing-wax, at one end, and fill about half of it with olive oil; then stop the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a> of it with a cork, and let a wire pass through the cork, and come so far within the tube, as to have its extremity below the surface of the oil. This end of the wire must touch the surface of the glass, for which purpose it must be bent nearly at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a>, which may be easily done before the cork is put upon the tube. Things being thus prepared, bend into a ring the other extremity of the wire, and suspend it, with the tube hanging to it, to the wire at the end of the conductor. Then work the machine, and bring the knuckle of a finger or the knob of a wire near the outside of the tube, just opposite to the extremity of the wire; the consequence of which will be, that a spark will happen between the wire and the knuckle, which makes a hole through the glass.\u2014By turning the wire about, or raising and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a> it, many holes may be successively made in the same tube, after the manner above described.\n\nExper. 6.\u2014<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROLL\">Roll</a> up a piece of soft <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-TOBACCO\">tobacco</a>-pipe clay in a small cylinder, and insert in it two wires, so that their ends without the clay may be about a fifth part of an inch from one another. If a shock be sent through this clay, by connecting one of the wires with the outside of a charged jar, and the other with the inside, it will be inflated by the shock, i.e., by the spark, that passes between the two wires, and, after the explosion, will appear swelled in the middle. If the shock sent through it is too strong, and the clay not very moist, it will be broken by the explosion, and its fragments scattered in every direction. To make this experiment with a little variation, take a piece of the tube of a tobacco-pipe, about one inch long, and fill its bore with moist clay; then insert in it two wires, as in the above rolled clay; and send a shock through it. This tube will not fail to burst by the force of the explosion, and its fragments will be scattered about to a great distance. If, instead of clay, the above-mentioned tube of the tobacco pipe, or a glass tube (which will answer as well), be filled with any other substance, either electric or non-electric, inferior to metal, on making the discharge, it will be broken in pieces with nearly the same force. This experiment is the invention of Mr Lane, F.R.S.\n\nExper. 7.\u2014Place within a common drinking-glass, nearly full of water, two knotted wires, bent in such a manner, as that their knobs may be within a little distance of each other in the water. Connect one of these wires with the outside coating of a pretty large jar, and touch the other wire with the knob of it; on making the discharge, the explosion which must pass through the water between the two knobs, will disperse the water, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the glass with a surprising violence. This experiment requires great caution.\n\nSig. Becarria contrived a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a>, into which a drop of water was put, between the extremities of two wires which went through the sides of the mortar, and a wooden ball was applied over the drop of water; then a charged jar being discharged through the wires of the mortar, and consequently through the drop of water, rarefied the latter, and drove the ball out with considerable force. Mr Lullin produced a greater effect by making the discharge through oil instead of water.\n\nChap. IX. Of the Methods of estimating the Degree of Accumulated Electricity in Jars and Batteries.\n\nThe only method of ascertaining the charge of a Leyden phial or of a battery, which we have hitherto mentioned, is that of observing the repulsive force of the charge on the ball of Henry's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a> electrometer. But it was found (Vtae 122) that this was not always a just criterion of the amount of the charge; as, even when the jar was insulated, and consequently could receive no charge, the index of the electrometer still rose as high as if the jar was fully charged. We shall now proceed to describe two methods, which, particularly the last, are much less liable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>. The first depends on the following principle.\n\nThe distance of the ball of a discharging rod from the knob of a charged phial or battery necessary to produce an explosion, will be greater in proportion to the degree of accumulated electricity which the jar or battery has received.\n\nExper.\u2014Take a Leyden phial, into the knob of which is fixed a quadrant electrometer; communicate to it a small charge, so that the index of the electrometer may point, we shall suppose, at 10\u00b0. In making the discharge, it will be found necessary to bring the ball of the discharging rod almost in contact with the knob of the jar. Now charge the jar to 20\u00b0, and it will be found that the explosion will take place, when the ball of the discharging rod is at a greater distance from the knob of the jar, than before; and thus, by repeating the experiment with greater charges, it will be observed, that the distance necessary to produce an explosion will increase nearly in proportion to the charge.\n\nOn this principle Mr Lane constructed an electro-meter, which has been found extremely useful, when it was required to discharge a jar or battery a number of times successively, with the same charge. This instrument...\nThe principal part of it consisted originally of a brass ball about an inch and a half in diameter, screwed to a graduated brass rod, and adapted to a proper frame, so that it might be set at any required distance from the prime conductor of the knob of a Leyden phial. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> use of this instrument is to allow a jar to discharge spontaneously through any proper circuit, without employing a discharging rod, or moving any part of the apparatus, and also to produce successive explosions nearly of the same strength, as observed above. If, for example, the brass ball be placed at the distance of about half an inch from the prime conductor, and a Leyden phial be so situated as to have its knob in contact with the prime conductor, while its outside coating communicates with the ball of the electrometer, it is evident that the communication between the outside and inside of the jar, is interrupted only between the prime conductor and the brass ball, which are half an inch asunder; therefore, in charging the jar, when the charge is become so high as to strike through half an inch of air, the jar will discharge spontaneously, and by keeping the brass ball at the same distance from the prime conductor, and charging the jar successively, the shocks will be nearly of the same strength.\n\nAn electrometer of this kind, though not exactly like the original one, is now commonly used by the practitioners of medical electricity, and is delineated in fig. 67. of Plate CLXXXIX. It consists of a glass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> D, which proceeds from the wire of the jar F, and to the extremity E of which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> socket is cemented, through which a wire passes, which is furnished with a knob B, towards the knob A of the jar, and with an open ring C at its other extremity. Now, as this wire may be slid backwards and forwards, the knob B may be put at any required distance from the knob A, as far as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of the instrument will allow. The wire BC is generally marked with divisions which show the distance of the two knobs, when the wire is so situated, as that the required division coincides with the edge of the spring socket; as, for instance, one-tenth, or one quarter of an inch, &c. When the jar F is set against the prime conductor G, as represented in the figure, suppose that the ball B is set at the distance of one-tenth of an inch from the ball A, and that a wire be fixed from the electrometer's ring to the outside coating of the jar, as shown by the dotted line CK; then, when the machine is put in motion, the discharge of the jar, as soon as this becomes sufficiently charged, will be made between the knobs AB, and through the wire CK; and it is evident that these discharges will be of the same strength, as long as the distance between AB remains the same.\n\nThis instrument is subject to the following inconvenience, viz. that the force of the explosion, after a time, roughens the surface of the brass ball, and thus, for a reason to be explained hereafter, the instrument is useless, unless the polish of the ball be again renewed. It is also found that this instrument is not accurate in shewing the exact charge of a jar.\n\nThe charge of a jar or battery may be most accurately determined by the weight which the repulsive force of the accumulated electricity is able to raise.\n\nUpon this principle Mr Brooke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWICH\">Norwich</a> constructed a very valuable electrometer, of which he has given a long and accurate account in his Miscellaneous Experiments.\n\nOur limits will not permit us to copy this long description, for which we must therefore refer our readers to Mr Brooke's work. We have, however, the less reason to regret this omission, because we shall presently describe an instrument invented by the late Professor Robison, which appears to us superior to Mr Brooke's both in simplicity and utility.\n\nMr G. Adams has described an electrometer very similar in principle to that of Mr Brooke, and we shall here copy his description.\n\n\"Fig. 68. and 69. represent an electrometer, nearly similar to that contrived by Mr Brooke. The two instruments are sometimes combined in one, or used separately, as in these figures. The arms FH, fig. 69., when in use, are to be placed as much as possible out of the atmosphere of a jar, battery, prime conductor, &c. The arm FH and the ball K are made of copper, and as light as possible. The divisions on the arm FH are each of them exactly a grain. They are ascertained at first by placing grain weights on a brass ball which is within the ball L, (this ball is an exact counterbalance to the arm FH and the ball K when the small slide r is at the first division) and then removing the slide r, till it, together with the ball K, counterbalances the ball L and the weight laid on it.\n\nA, fig. 69., is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DIAL\">dial</a>-plate, divided into 90 equal parts. The index of this plate is carried once round, when the arm BC has moved through 90 degrees, or a quarter of a circle. That motion is given to the index by the repulsive power of the charge acting between the ball D and the ball B.\n\nThe arm BC being repelled, shows when the charge is increasing, and the arm FH shows what this repulsive power is between two balls of this size in grains, according to the number the weight rests at when lifted up by the repulsive power of the charge: at the same time the arm BC points out the number of degrees to which the ball B is repelled; so that by repeated trials, the number of degrees answering to a given number of grains, may be ascertained, and a table formed from these experiments, by which means the electrometer, fig. 69., may be used without that of fig. 68.\n\nMr Brooke thinks that no glass, charged (as we <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> it) with electricity, will bear a greater force, than that whose repulsive power, between two balls of the size he used, is equal to sixty grains; that in very few instances it will stand sixty grains weight; and he thinks it hazardous to go more than 45 grains.\n\nHence, by knowing the quantity of coated surface, and the diameter of the balls, we may be enabled to say, to much coated surface, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPULSION\">repulsion</a> between balls of so many grains, will melt a wire of such a size, or kill such an animal, &c.\n\nMr Brooke thinks, that he is not acquainted with all the advantages of his electrometer; but that it is clear, it speaks a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> which may be universally understood, which no other will do; for though other electrometers will show whether a charge is greater or less, by an index being repelled to greater or smaller distances, or by the charge exploding at different distances, yet the power of the charge is by no means ascertained; but this electrometer shows the force of the\nWith his electrometer, Mr Brooke made a set of experiments, with a view to determine exactly the force of batteries of an inferior power, in melting fine metallic wires of different kinds. The following is the substance of these experiments.\n\n1. With a battery of nine bottles, containing about 16 square feet of coated surface, and charged to 32 grains of repulsion, a shock was eleven times <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> through a piece of steel wire twelve inches long and \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch thick; the wire was shortened an inch and a half, being then about ten inches and a half long; by a twelfth shock, the wire was melted to pieces.\n\n2. A shock from the same nine bottles charged to the same degree of repulsion, being sent through a piece of steel wire, 12 inches long and \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch thick, the first time melted the whole of it into small globules.\n\n3. A shock from the same nine bottles charged to the same degree, being sent through a piece of brass wire twelve inches long and \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch thick, melted the whole of it, with much smoke, resembling that from gunpowder; but the metallic part formed itself, in cooling, chiefly into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CONCAVE\">concave</a> hemispherical figures of various sizes.\n\n4. A shock from only eight of the bottles charged to the same degree, did but just melt twelve inches of steel wire \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch thick, so as to fall into several pieces; these pieces in cooling formed themselves into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBLONG\">oblong</a> lumps, joining themselves to each other by a very small part of the wire between each lump which was not melted enough to separate, but appeared like oblong beads on a thread at different distances.\n\n5. A shock from the same eight bottles, charged to the same degree, so perfectly heated twelve inches of brass wire about \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch in diameter, as to melt it, or at least soften it so far as to make it fall down by its own weight, from the forceps by which it was held at each end, upon a sheet of paper placed below to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CATCH\">catch</a> it, and when it fell down it was so perfectly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> that, by falling it formed itself into a vermicular shape, and remained entire its whole length, which when it was put into the forceps was about 12 inches; but after the shock was passed through it, it flagged to much as to be stretched by its own weight to almost fifteen inches, and by falling on the paper it was flattened throughout its whole length so much, that when it was examined by a magnifier of half an inch <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a>, it appeared five or six times as broad as it was thick.\n\n6. A shock from nine bottles charged only twenty grains, was sent through a piece of steel wire, of the same length and diameter as in the former experiments, and heated it sufficiently to melt it, so that it separated in several places; and the pieces were formed into beads strung as in experiment 4.\n\n7. A shock from the same nine bottles charged to twenty grains was sent through ten inches of brass wire \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch diameter; the wire was heated red hot so as to render it very flexible, but it did not separate.\n\nIt was shortened, however, nearly three-eighths of an inch.\n\n8. A shock from the same nine bottles charged to the same degree, being sent a second time through the last piece of wire, melted it further in several places.\n\n9. A shock from nine bottles charged to 30 grains, sent through twelve inches of brass wire \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch in diameter, acted on it nearly as in experiment 5, except that it was separated in two places, and the pieces when joined measured about fifteen inches and a half long; it was perfectly flattened by its fall on the paper as before.\n\n10. A shock from nine bottles charged to 30 grains, being sent through eight inches and a half of brass wire of the same diameter, wholly dispersed it in smoke, and left nothing remaining to fall on the sheet of paper placed below it.\n\n11. A shock from twelve bottles charged to 20 grains sent through ten inches of steel wire, \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch in diameter, made it red hot, but did not melt it.\n\n12. A second charge, the same as the last, being sent through the same piece of wire, heated it red hot as before, but did not cause it to separate; the wire was now, however, shortened five-sixteenths of an inch.\n\n13. A shock from the same twelve bottles charged to 25 grains, being sent through the same piece of wire, partly melted it into several pieces, and produced many globules of oxidated metal.\n\n14. With 15 bottles charged to 25 grains, a shock was sent through ten inches of steel wire \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch in diameter, which melted it at the first time, and dispersed a great part of it about the room.\n\n15. A shock from the same 15 bottles charged to 20 grains, just melted ten inches of steel wire of the same diameter as before, so as to cause it to run into several beautiful globules, nearly as in experiment 13.\n\n16. A shock of 15 bottles charged to 15 grains, being sent through ten inches of steel wire of the same diameter as the last, made the wire barely red-hot; but shortened it one-tenth of an inch.\n\n17. The last piece of wire having received a shock from 15 bottles charged to 12 and a half grains, was not made red-hot.\n\n18. A shock from the same 15 bottles, charged to 25 grains, was sent through the same piece of wire, and seemingly tore the wire into splinters.\n\n19. Four bottles charged to 30 grains, just melted three inches of steel wire \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch in diameter, so as to make it fall into pieces.\n\n20. Five bottles charged to 25 grains, melted three inches of such wire as the last into large beautiful globules.\n\n21. With eight bottles charged to 15 grains, three inches of steel wire, \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)th of an inch in diameter, were melted as in the last experiment; indeed the appearance and effect were so nearly alike in both cases, that the metal after both experiments might have been said to be the same.\n\n22. The force of ten bottles charged twelve grains and a half rather exceeded experiment 19, but scarcely came up to experiments 20 and 21.\n\n23. Suspecting something wrong in experiment 19, Mr Brooke found, that though his bottles hitherto were as nearly of the same size as he could procure them,\nPrinciples of them, yet some of them were a little larger than others, Electricity and which was the case in experiment 19, one of the four was smaller than the other three; so that he repeated the experiment with four bottles more equal in size, charging them to 30 grains, and the fusion was as perfect as in any.\n\n24. A charge to 30 grains, with the last eight bottles, beautifully melted six inches of steel wire \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch in diameter.\n\n25. A shock from two bottles charged to 45 grains, was sent through one inch of steel wire, of the same diameter as the last, but only changed its colour.\n\n26. With three bottles charged to 40 grains, a shock sent through one inch and a half of steel wire of the above diameter, dispersed it all about the room.\n\n27. Mr Brooke considering that a steel wire of \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch in diameter, contains nearly twice the quantity of metal which is contained in the same length of wire of \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch in diameter, took three inches of the former, and sent through it a shock from ten bottles, charged to 25 grains. This shock melted it just as the shock from five bottles did in experiment 20.\n\n28. With 20 bottles charged to 12 grains and a half, he melted three inches of steel wire of \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch in diameter, exactly as in the foregoing experiment.\n\n29. As a steel wire of \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch diameter contains nearly twice the quantity of metal in the same length, as is contained in a steel wire of \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th, or four times the quantity contained in a steel wire of \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch diameter; it might from the foregoing experiments be expected, that 20 bottles charged to 25 grains would melt three inches of steel wire of \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch in diameter: but on a great many trials he could not procure 20 bottles which would bear the discharge when charged to 25 grains; for at the discharge, there was always one or more bottles broken or perforated. He was now reduced to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of being content with bottles of any size, that would bear the required charge of from one to three gallons each, or that contained from 150 to 300 or more square inches of coated surface each, but all in vain. The only resource left him, as he was not near a glasshouse, was to increase the quantity of surface and not to charge so high and to proportion the one to the other: it was therefore resolved to adopt a third expedient, i.e., instead of employing about 36 square feet of coating, he added a third, or twelve feet, which made it in all 48 feet; and instead of charging to 25 grains, or rather 24 for the sake of a more easy division by three, he annulled one-third of the charge, leaving fifteen grains, and thus he succeeded perfectly well; for by 48 feet of coated surface charged to 16 grains, three inches of steel wire \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch in diameter were as curiously melted as in any of the former experiments.\n\nThese bottles, thus broken in large discharges, seem always to break or to be perforated nearly in the thinness, but never in the thickest place, which shows the necessity of the glass being of a considerable thickness.\n\n30. As in experiments 19 and 20, where the coated surface in the former is but half the quantity of that in the latter, and the former is charged to 30, and the latter to 15 grains, to know how high 48 feet of coating must be charged to produce the same effect exactly: and as the coating in four bottles, consisting of a little more than six feet and a half, is contained in 48 feet a little more than seven times; so Mr Brooke tried, by charging 48 feet only to a little more than four grains, or only about one-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a> part to high, as four times seven is 28; that is, but two less than 30: and this had exactly the same effect on the wire, which was \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch in diameter, and three inches long, as it had upon the former.\n\n31. As the last experiment agreed so exactly with experiments 19 and 20, the next thing tried was to see the effect of 48 feet of coated surface charged to a little more than four grains upon six inches of steel wire, the size of the last; this was made very faintly red.\n\n32. By a repetition of the last experiment, with the same length of the same wire, to see how often the same charge might be sent through it without melting it, and to observe the appearance of the wire after each shock, he found that by the eighth shock it was melted into several pieces. After the first shock, the redness produced became less every time, even the last time, when it was separated. By the first shock, though made little more than fairly red, the wire became flexible, that by a small addition to its own weight, it seemed to become almost perfectly straight when cooled: at about the third or fourth shock it began to assume a zig-zag appearance; after the fifth shock the surface of it appeared rough; after the seventh shock the surface was very roughly scorched or scaly; and some of the scales had fallen upon a piece of white paper placed at about half an inch distance below it. The eighth shock melted it in three places; and at these places where the angles appeared the sharpest or most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a>, a great number of the scales were driven off about the paper, and appeared as in experiment 18; some of them were almost one-tenth of an inch long, and some of them about a third or fourth part of the diameter of the wire in breadth, and very thin; after the seventh shock it was shortened seven-sixteenths of an inch; the wire was \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch in diameter.\n\n33. Repeating experiment 31. again with the same length of wire of the same diameter, and the same battery charged to the same degree, in order to observe the method of the wire shortening, having fixed an insulated gage <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to it and at the distance of about a quarter of an inch from it: after the first shock, which made the wire fairly red, (holding it fixed at one end, that the shortening might appear all at the other, which was held so that it might either <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> or dilate,) he observed, that it shortened considerably as it cooled; repeating the shock, it did the same, and so on till it was melted, which was by the eighth shock, as before. At the instant when the shock passed through the wire, it appeared to dilate a little; and after it was at the hottest, it gradually contracted after every stroke, as it cooled, about one-sixteenth of an inch each time; the dilatation was so very trifling, as to bear but a very small proportion to its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a>, and sometimes it was doubtful whether or not it dilated at all; but after all the observations it appeared oftenest to dilate, than not.\n\n34. The same 48 feet, negatively charged to a little more than four grains, melted three inches of steel wire \\( \\frac{1}{7} \\) th of an inch in diameter, the same as the positive charge did in experiment 30.\n\n35. The same battery of 48 feet of coated surface, charged\nPrinciples of charged to a little more than eight grains, melted three inches of steel wire, \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)th of an inch in diameter. This is very nearly in proportion to experiment 27, but here the charge was negative, and Mr Brooke says the fusion was the most pleasing he had hitherto had; which he attributes to the charge having been probably so well adjusted as to be exactly sufficient to melt the wire and no more: the heat remained for the longest time, and the fused metal ran into the largest globules; probably the long continuance of the heat, was owing to the charge being just sufficient, and to the size of the lumps into which the fused metal was formed.\n\n36. This was a repetition of experiment 1, with twelve inches of steel wire \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)th of an inch in diameter, but with this difference, that as then only nine bottles were employed, containing about fifteen feet of coated surface, charged to 32 grains, he here used 18 bottles containing about 32 square feet of coating charged to only 16 grains. This was done to observe the progress of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of the wire, as in experiment 32, as well as to prove the similarity of the effect. The wire being the same size, fort of metal, and length, as recited just above; the first shock made it red-hot throughout its whole length attended with smoke and smell, changed its colour to a kind of copperish hue, and shortened it considerably; the second shock made it of a fine blue, but it did not appear red, and shortened it more; at the third shock it assumed a zig-zag appearance, many radii were very visible at the bendings, and the wire continued to shorten till the eleventh shock, when one of the bottles in the second row of the battery was struck through: the fracture was covered over with common cement, and its place supplied by changing place with one in the third row, supposing the mended one to be the weakest; and with the battery in this state he made the twelfth shock, which separated the wire as in experiment 1, but shortened it only one inch.\n\n37. A shock from 48 feet of coated surface, charged to eight grains, sent through three inches of copper wire \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)th of an inch in diameter, seven times, gave it the zig-zag appearance, but did not make it much shorter; the eighth shock separated it at one end close to the forceps which held it, but it did not appear to be made at all sensibly red-hot, notwithstanding it must have been often so at the place where it was melted; which space was so very small as barely to be perceptible, like as when a point is set upon any flat surface of iron, and a shock from a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> phial sent through, both the point and flat surface where the point rested, if examined with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNIFYING\">magnifying</a> glass, will be found to have been melted, and a speck may be seen; but the redness of the metal will scarcely be visible.\n\n38. A shock from 48 feet, charged to 16 grains, was sent through six inches of lead wire \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)th of an inch in diameter, and melted it into many pieces.\n\n39. A shock from 48 feet, charged to 15 grains, was sent through six inches of wire like the last, which did not separate it, but made it smoke.\n\n40. A shock like the last, was sent through the same piece of wire a second time, and melted it into several pieces.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> by which wires resist destruction, in proportion to the diameter of the wire, does not seem to be nearly so equable, in the lead as in the steel wire. For a charge of four grains, in experiment 34, melted three inches of lead wire \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)th of an inch in diameter; but it took a charge of about three times that power, to destroy three inches of lead wire \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)th of an inch in diameter; which is about double the quantity of metal in the same length as in that of \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)th of an inch in diameter. Thus, it is easy to find what different resistance a wire of any of the preceding metals, of equal size and length, will make to the electrical stroke.\n\nThe length of the electric circuit, in which the different wires were placed, in the foregoing experiments, from the nearest part of the inside to the nearest part of the outside of the battery, exclusive of the length of the laid wires, was about eight feet.\n\n41. Two gentlemen coming to see a piece of wire melted by electricity, Mr Brooke proceeded to show it them, by fixing twelve inches of steel wire \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)th of an inch in diameter, and then (supposing the electrometer, and all other things ready placed), to charge the battery, but the electrometer did not move: nevertheless, he continued charging as he supposed; but still the electrometer remained as it was, although he had been charging much longer than would have been necessary, contrary to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, which was to take a small wire, that a smaller charge might be sufficient. Having been charging a long time, Mr Brooke left off to look about the apparatus, in order to see if all was right: as he was looking he found there was no communication between the battery and the electrometer, and he heard a slight crackling in the battery which convinced him that it was charged. Accordingly he made the discharge, expecting nothing unusual; but the wire was dispersed seemingly in a very violent manner. The report was so very loud that their ears were stunned, and the flash of light so very great, that Mr Brooke's sight was quite confused for a few seconds.\n\nMr Cuthbertson has lately contrived an electrometer, which possesses all the advantages of Mr Brooke's, added to those of Lane and Henly, with which he has ingeniously combined it.\n\nThis valuable instrument is thus described by the inventor:\n\nThe electrometer is represented in Plate CLXXXIX. No. 2, fig. 70. GH is a long square piece of wood, about 18 inches long, and six inches broad, in which are fixed three glass supports, DEF, mounted with brass balls, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\). Under the brass ball \\(a\\) is a long brass hook; the ball \\(c\\) is made of two hemispheres, the under one being fixed to the brass mounting, and the upper turned with a groove to fit upon it, so that it can be taken off at pleasure. The ball \\(b\\) has a brass tube fixed to it, about three inches long, cemented on to the top of F; and the same ball has a hole at the top, of about one-half inch diameter, corresponding with the inside of the tube. AB is a straight brass wire, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a>-edged centre in the middle, placed a little below the centre of gravity, and equally balanced with a hollow brass ball at each end, the centre, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a>, resting upon a proper shaped piece of brass fixed in the inside of the ball \\(c\\); that side of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEMISPHERE\">hemisphere</a> towards \\(c\\) is cut open, to permit the end \\(c\\) A of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> to descend till it touches the ball \\(a\\), and the upper hemisphere C.\nPrinciples of Electricity also cut open to permit the end c B to ascend; i is a weight, weighing a certain number of grains, and made in the form of a pin with a broad head; the ball B has two holes, one at the top, and the other at the bottom; the upper hole is so wide, as to let the head of the pin pass through it, but to stop at the under one, with its shank hanging freely in b; a number of such pins are commonly made to each electrometer of different weights; (c) k is a common Henly's quadrant electrometer, and when in use, it is screwed upon the top of c.\n\nIt is evident, from the construction, that if the foot stand <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a>, and the ball B be made to touch b, it will remain in that position without the help of the weight i; and if it should by any means receive a very low charge of electric fluid, the two balls b, B, will repel each other; B will begin to ascend, and, on account of the centre of gravity being above the centre of motion, the ascension will continue till A rest upon a. If the balance be set again horizontal, and a pin i, of any small weight, be put into its place in B, it will cause B to rest upon b, with a pressure equal to that weight, so that more electric fluid must be communicated than before, before the balls will separate; and as the weight in B is increased or diminished, a greater or less quantity of electric fluid will be required to effect a separation.\n\nWhen this instrument is to be applied to a jar, or battery, for which purpose it was invented, one end of a wire, L, must be inserted into a hole in b, and the other end into a hole of any ball proceeding from the inside of a battery, as M (d); k must be screwed upon c, with its index towards A; the reason of this instrument being added, is to show, by the index continuing to rise, that the charge of the battery is increasing, because the other part of the instrument does not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> till the battery has received its required charge.\n\nIf this instrument be examined with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>, it will be found to consist of three electrometers; and answers three different purposes, namely, a Henly's electrometer, Lane's discharging electrometer, and Brooke's steel-yard electrometer; the first not improved, but the two last, which were very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a> when first invented, I flatter myself are here brought to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>. As the only use of Henly's electrometer to this instrument is, as I have said before, to show, by its continuing to increase in divergency, that the battery continues to receive a still stronger charge, it required no improvement; but Lane's electrometer, in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMITIVE\">primitive</a> state, could by no means answer the required purpose for batteries, because the ball intended to discharge the battery, was necessarily placed so near to the ball of the battery, that dull and fibrous particles were always attracted by and adhered between the two balls, so as to retard the charging, and often render a high charge impossible: whereas, in this, they are placed at four inches asunder; and when the desired height of charge is obtained, and not before, the ball of the electrometer moves of itself nearer to the ball which is connected with the outside of the battery, and causes a discharge. The defects in Brooke's steel-yard electrometer were, first, that it could not cause a discharge; and secondly, the difficulty of observing the first separation of the balls caused great error. If it were not placed in an advantageous light (which the nature of the experiments could not always permit), it would not be seen, without the attention of an assistant, which is sometimes unpleasant, and cannot always be commanded. But the instrument which I have described, requires no attention or assistance; for as soon as the separation takes place between B and b, the ball A descends, and discharges the battery of itself.\n\nBy this combination and improvements, we possess in the present instrument all that can ever be required of an electrometer; namely, by k, we see the progress of the charge; by the separation of B, b, we have the Nielsboer's repulsive power in weight; and by the ball A, the dilution of charge is caused, when the charge has acquired the proper strength propolled.\n\nWith this electrometer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">Lieutenant</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLONEL\">Colonel</a> Haldane Col. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HALL\">Hall</a> has made some very ingenious experiments to determine the mode of the exact charge of a battery required to produce certain changes in wires of the same kind. His method of estimating the force of the charge is by the number of explosions that it is capable of producing in a jar containing the outside coating of the battery. Thus, if the battery while charging produces three explosions of the jar, he says, it has received three measures of electricity.\n\nMr Cuthbertson having observed that when he breathed into a jar, it was thus rendered capable of receiving a higher charge, made the following experiments to ascertain the effect of such increased charge.\n\nExper. 1.\u2014Prepare the electrometer in the manner Breathing shewn in the plate, with the jar M annexed, which contains about 168 square inches of coating (e): put into bear a B the pin, marked 15; take two inches of watch-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAN\">pan</a> higher, duline wire, fix to each end a pair of spring tongs, as is represented at G m, hook one end to m, and the other to the wire N, communicating with the outside of the jar; let the uncoated part of the jar be made very clean and dry; and let the prime conductor of an electrical machine, or a wire proceeding from it, touch the wire L; then, if the machine be put in motion, the jar and electrometer will charge, as will be seen by the rising of the index of k, and when charged high enough, B will be repelled by b, and A will descend and discharge the jar through the wire, which was confined in the tongs, and the wire will be fused and run into balls.\n\n(c) Instead of the pins, which were found inconvenient, Mr Cuthbertson has lately constructed his electrometer with a sliding piece of brass, so adapted to the arm of the balanced wire, as by sliding nearer to, or farther from the centre of gravity to denote proportional weights.\n\n(d) A chain, or wire, or any body through which the charge is to pass, must be hung to the hook at m, and carried from thence to the outside of the battery, as is represented by the line N.\n\n(e) Take out the pin in B, and observe whether the ball B will remain at rest upon b; if not turn the adjusting screw at C till it just remains upon A.\nChap. IX.\n\nPrinciples of Exper. 2.\u2014Put into the tongs eight inches of the Electricity same fort of wire as before, hang one pair of tongs to the illustrated hook m, and apply the other to the wire which forms the outside communication: take out the pin in B, and put in its stead one marked 30; all the other part of the apparatus remaining as before, and the uncoated part of the jar being previously cleaned and dried: the machine will charge, as is shown by the rising of the index as before; but as soon as the jar has received a greater quantity of electric power than before, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> explosion will happen without affecting the balls B b, because the discharge will have passed along the uncoated part of the jar from the inside coating to the outside: whence it follows, that, while the jar remains in that clean state, it is incapable of receiving a charge high enough to affect the balls, or even a higher charge than it had received in the first experiment. Let the uncoated part of the jar be therefore rendered, in a slight degree, damp; which is easily done, by breathing into the inside, through a glass tube; put the machine in motion, and no spontaneous explosion will happen, but the balls B b will repel, as in the first experiment, and the discharge will happen from A to a, and pass through the wire placed in the circuit; and though it was eight inches, it will be fused in the same degree as two inches in the last experiment, namely, the wire seen red hot the whole length, and then fall into balls.\n\nVery different degrees of fusion are caused by electric discharges, which may cause great mistakes, if not well attended to. It is proper to adhere to the degree above-mentioned, and particular care ought to be taken to lay the wire, intended for fusion, straight, without any bendings or angles in it. The wire used in the two last experiments, was that which is commonly called watch-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENDULUM\">pendulum</a> wire, which is flattened; and as it approaches very near to such a sharp edge as might be supposed to affect the experiment, by permitting a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> of the electric fluid in its passage, round wires were tried, and the result was the same.\n\nThe late Dr Robison contrived an electrometer on similar principles with that of Mr Brooke, but much superior to it in simplicity of construction, and not inferior to any which have been invented in point of accuracy.\n\nPlate CLXXXIX. Fig. 71. exhibits a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FRONT\">front</a> view of this instrument, which is thus constructed. A polished brass ball No. 2. A, a quarter of an inch in diameter, is fixed on the point of a common needle about three inches long, and as slender as can be procured of that length. On the other end of the needle is fixed a ball of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBER\">amber</a>, glass, or other solid non-conducting substance, of about half an inch or three-quarters of an inch in diameter. This ball is fixed in such a way as that the needle does not quite reach to its surface, though the ball F must be completely perforated. From the electric ball there passes a slender glass rod, F, E, L, bent at right angles at E, so that the part FE is about three inches long, and the other extremity L is immediately opposite to the centre of the ball A. A piece of amber C, cut so as to have two parallel <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a>, is fixed on the extremity L of the glass rod. For the principal part of the instrument, a strong dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> thread is to be prepared by holding it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> in melted sealing-wax, till it shall be fully penetrated by the wax, so as to retain a thin coating of it. The thread, thus coated, must be kept extended, so that it may be quite straight, and it must be made perfectly smooth by holding it before a clear fire and rolling it on a smooth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>. It is then to be passed through a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUBE\">cube</a> of amber, that has two holes drilled in two of its opposite faces, perpendicularly about half way to the stalk. By these holes the cube is suspended, so as to move readily, on two fine brass pins, between the cheeks of the piece of amber at L. The waxed thread is about six inches long, and is equally divided by the amber cube. To one end of it, B, is fixed a ball of some conducting substance, as of very thin polished metal, or gilt and burnished cork, a quarter of an inch in diameter. The other extremity, D, passes through a cork ball, so as to move with some friction.\n\nThis part of the instrument is so constructed, that when FE is perpendicular to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a>, and the stalk BD, with its balls, is allowed to hang freely, the ball B just touches the ball A. This position is represented in fig. 72.\n\nThe ball F is fixed to one end of a glass rod FI made to pass perpendicularly through the centre of a graduated circle GHO, and furnished at its other extremity I with a knopped handle of box wood. HK is the stand of the electrometer, in the head of which is a hole in which the rod FI moves smoothly but not easily. Farther, there is adapted to the glass rod FI an index NH that turns round it. This index is so placed as to be parallel to a line LA drawn through the centre of the ball A. Now, as the circle is divided into 360 degrees, O being marked above and 90 on the right hand; the index will point out the angle which the line LA makes with the vertical line. It is convenient to have another index on the rod FI turning stiffly round it, and extending considerably beyond the circle.\n\nThe method of using this instrument will be shown when we speak of the law of electric action in the next part.\n\nChap. X. Of the Electrophorus.\n\nThe electrophorus is an instrument invented by Signior Volta of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMO\">Como</a>. It generally consists of two of the electrophorus parts; a round plate of metal, or of wood, made perfectly free from points and edges, and covered with tin foil; as A fig. 73; and another circular plate of any conducting substance covered with a coating of some resinous electric, generally of lac dissolved in alcohol, melted sealing-wax, pitch, or of sulphur; as B. The first plate is furnished with a glass handle, or with silk strings, so that it may be occasionally inflated: to this plate Volta has given the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of Scudo.\n\nSometimes the apparatus is made in three parts, i.e., the resinous electric is formed into a cake independent of the plate B, and this is the most convenient method for experiment. To these three parts Dr Robison has given the following names; viz. the resinous electric he calls the cake, the plate B, the sole, and the plate A the Cover; and these names we shall adopt for the sake of convenience. For the purpose of exhibiting the appearances which we are about to describe in the most brilliant manner, the several parts may be made very thin in proportion to their circumference; but for illustrating the theory\nThe general appearances which have been observed with this apparatus may be reduced to the following heads.\n\n1. If the cake, after being just formed, be suffered to remain on the sole, till it be perfectly cool and hard, while the sole is insulated; on examination the whole will be found negatively electric, and on applying the finger to any part of it, especially the sole, a spark is produced. If the apparatus be now suffered to remain at rest, its electricity gradually becomes weaker, and at length entirely disappears. It may, however, be again produced by rubbing the cake with a piece of new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol9.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a>, or, what is better, a piece of hare or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol7.html#article-MOLE\">mole</a> skin with the fur on, made dry and warm. If after the cake has been thus excited, the cover be placed on it, by means of its insulating handle, and if it be again lifted off, without being touched, no electricity whatever can be observed in the cover.\n\n2. If, however, the cover while in contact with the cake, be touched with the finger, a smart pungent spark will be obtained from the cover; and if, while the finger touches the cover, the thumb is placed upon the sole, a sensible shock will be felt between the finger and thumb.\n\n3. After the above spark or shock has been obtained, the electricity of the electrophorus disappears, and the apparatus is said to be dead; no signs of electricity appearing in either sole or cover, so long as the latter remains in contact with the cake.\n\n4. But if the cover be raised to some distance from the cake, and in a direction parallel to it, and if the cover be touched while held in this position, a smart spark will appear between it and the finger, and will even strike to some distance. This spark will be more remarkable, if obtained from the upper surface of the cover, especially from its edge, which, if it has not been well rounded, will even throw off sparks into the air. The spark received from the cover under these circumstances, is however, not so pungent as that mentioned in No. 2, resembling a spark from any electrified conductor.\n\n5. When the cover is thus raised from the cake, the former is found positively electrified, and the latter, as before, negatively.\n\n6. But the electricity of both cover and cake, while in contact, is negative.\n\n7. The appearances above described may be repeated for a considerable time, with apparently undiminished vivacity, without re-exciting the cake by friction; the apparatus has been observed to retain its electric power, even for several months. Hence it serves as a kind of electrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGAZINE\">magazine</a>, and may be repeatedly employed for charging jars, either positively, by imparting to the jar the electric spark from the cover while raised from the cake; or negatively, by receiving the sparks from the cover in contact with the cake. From this property of retaining the electric power for so long a time, Signor Volta denominated the apparatus electrophorus, or electroforo perpetuo.\n\n8. If, before placing the cover on the cake, the sole has been insulated, the same spark may be obtained from the cover, and the same shock may be felt on touching both cake and cover at the same time; but the spark, in this case, is by no means so pungent as that obtained when the sole has not been insulated.\n\n9. If, when the sole has been insulated, the cover be again lifted to a considerable distance from the cake, the sole will be found electrical, and its electricity will be the same as that of the cake, or negative.\n\n10. If, after touching both sole and cover, the cover be raised from the cake, by its insulating handle, and again replaced upon the cake without being touched while separate, the whole apparatus is found to possess no electricity.\n\n11. If both sole and cover be inactive after being joined, they will, when separated, show opposite electricities; the cover being electrified positively and the sole negatively.\n\n12. If both cover and sole be rendered inactive while separate, they will, when placed in contact, be found to possess the electricity opposite to that of the cake, i.e., they will together be in a state of positive electricity.\n\nIt is of little consequence what substance forms the glass plate to which the electric coating is applied; formerly Mr. Cavallo used a glass plate, and this was coated with various resinous electrics. Mr. Cavallo, who made several experiments on the construction and phenomena of the electrophorus, found that the most convenient electric was made with the second sort of sealing-wax spread upon a thick glass plate. A plate made by him after this manner, the diameter of which was no more than six inches, was, when once excited, capable of charging a coated phial strongly, that by the explosion, a card could be perforated; this phial might be charged several times successively, without again exciting the plate. Sometimes the cover, when separated from the plate, was so strongly electrified, that it darted strong flashes towards the table on which the electric plate was laid, and even into the air. \"The power of some of my plates,\" says Mr. Cavallo, \"is so strong, that sometimes the electric plate adheres to the metal when this is lifted up; nor will they separate even when the metal plate is touched with the finger, or other conductor.\"\n\n\"If, after having excited the sealing-wax,\" continues he, \"I lay the plate with the wax upon the table, and the glass uppermost, i.e., contrary to the common method, then, on making the usual experiment of putting the metal plate on it, and taking the spark &c., I observe it to be attended with the contrary electricity; that is, if I lay the metal plate upon the electric one, and while in that situation touch it with an insulated body, that body acquires the positive electricity, and the metallic, removed from the electric plate, appears to be negative; whereas it would become positive if laid upon the excited wax. This experiment, I find, answers in the same manner, if an electric plate is used which has the sealing-wax coating on both sides, or one of Mr. Adams's, which has no glass plate.\n\n\"If the brass plate, after being separated from, be presented...\"\nChap. X.\n\nPrinciples of electricity illustrated by experiment.\n\nElectrolysis while the fluid is in contact with its excited surface. If the negative side of the phial be applied, and a spark be taken from the positive, the pith-balls immediately separate negatively; but on taking up the fluid, they immediately close, and as rapidly separate again positively.\n\nIf after the phial is removed, the hand be applied to the fluid before it is raised, a small spark strikes into the hand; but on raising the fluid, the balls close and separate instantaneously, and give signs of positive electricity. If the fluid and the brass plate be connected, either by an insulated or uninsulated discharging rod, the balls close and separate again, and the fluid, upon being raised, receives a vigorous negative spark.\n\nIt is obvious that in all the preceding experiments, the brass plate continues unchangeably adherent to the lower surface, while the fluid only, or the conducting substance in connection with the upper surface, is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a>. It is of importance that we should know the consequences of making both the metallic surfaces moveable.\n\nBut this is not an easy matter; it is very difficult to get a resinous substance thin enough, and at the same time firm enough, for the purpose. The perfect laminae of tallow, which I have been able to procure, are too small to be used with any satisfaction; I have therefore had recourse to glass for the purpose. The result of my repeated trials is the following.\n\nHaving substituted a glass plate, about twelve inches in diameter, and one fourth of an inch thick, in the room of the resinous substance, and having reeled it on a ground metallic plate, five inches in diameter, and well connected with the pith-balls g and h, I exposed it to the sparks of a conductor charged positively, and kept my hand at the same time in connexion with the wire a b. The plate took a considerable charge; its upper side was unequivocally positive, and its lower side negative. I placed the fluid on the glass thus charged, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> it with my hand, I received a spark. I then approached a b with my hand, and received another. By <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> approaches of this kind, four or five times repeated, the sparks became weaker and weaker till they disappeared; the fluid was then raised, and was strongly negative; but the pith-ball, on the removal of the fluid, closed and separated positively.\n\nI then made the lower the upper surface; and placing the fluid upon it, formed the communication, as in the preceding part of the experiment; but upon being raised, the fluid was strongly positive, and the balls negative.\n\nBut if, previous to the placing the fluid on the glass, the pith-balls be carefully discharged of all adherent electricity, both the upper and lower sides of the glass will be charged with positive electricity, or will give signs of their being in the same state at the same time.\n\nIt is observable that the succession of electricities, in the preceding experiments seems to vary according to the priority of contact given to the wire or the fluid. But though this happens most frequently, yet such anomalies take place as not to justify us in considering this singular connection of diversities as by any means certain.*\n\n* Cavalli's Electricity, vol. ii.\n\nMr Morgan's experiments.\n\nMr Morgan has given us some valuable experimental observations on the Insulated Electrolysis.\n\nHis apparatus consists of a rounded piece of wood, A B fig. 74., with smooth edges and covered with tin-foil, placed on an insulating stand C D. On this board or foil is placed the electric plate or cake; a b is a wire with a brass ball from which are hung the electrometer balls g h. G represents the fluid or cover. After relating the usual appearances produced by friction, he proceeds to describe those which arise from connecting the cake with opposite sides of a Leyden phial.\n\n\"When the negative surface of a charged phial is placed on the excited surface, by bringing the hand into contact with the opposite side of the phial, a spark is instantly communicated, and the pith-balls g and h, separate negatively.\n\nIf the phial be taken off, and the fluid placed in its room, no change is observable on the subsequent removal of the fluid, provided, that no communication has been formed between it and the ground. When such a communication is formed, a charge is communicated, and the fluid and the balls are in opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of electricity.\n\nIf the positive side of a Leyden phial be placed on the excited surface, the pith-balls separate positively. It must be observed that these experiments are made with a resinous substance.\n\nThe appearances of the pith-balls and fluid are materially varied, if the Leyden phial be applied to the\nMr Nicholson published in the Phil. Trans. for 1789, some valuable observations on the best means of excitation, which we shall here extract.\n\n1. A glass cylinder was mounted, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSHION\">cushion</a> applied with a silk flap, proceeding from the edge of the cushion over its surface, and thence half round the cylinder. The cylinder was then excited by applying an amalgamated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> in the usual manner. The electricity was received by a conductor, and passed off in sparks to Lane's electrometer. By the frequency of these sparks, or by the number of turns required to cause spontaneous explosion of a jar, the strength of the excitation was ascertained.\n\n2. The cushion was withdrawn about one inch from the cylinder, and the excitation performed by the silk only. A stream of fire was seen between the cushion and the silk; and much fewer sparks passed between the balls of the electrometer.\n\n3. A roll of dry silk was interposed, to prevent the stream from passing between the cushion and the silk. Very few sparks then appeared at the electrometer.\n\n4. A metallic rod, not insulated, was then interposed instead of the roll of silk, so as not to touch any part of the apparatus. A dense stream of electricity appeared between the rod and the silk, and the conductor gave very many sparks.\n\n5. The knob of a jar being substituted in the place of the metallic rod, it became charged negatively.\n\n6. The silk alone, with a piece of tin-foil applied behind it, afforded much electricity, though less than when the cushion was applied with a light pressure. The hand being applied to the silk as a cushion, produced a degree of excitation seldom equalled by any other cushion.\n\n7. The edge of the hand answered as well as the palm.\n\n8. When the excitation by a cushion was weak, a line of light appeared at the anterior part of the cushion, and the silk was strongly disposed to receive electricity from any uninsulated conductor. These appearances did not obtain when the excitation was by any means made very strong.\n\n9. A thick silk, or two or more folds of silk, excited worse than a single very thin flap. I use the silk which the milliners call Perian.\n\n10. When the silk was separated from the cylinder, sparks passed between them; the silk was found to be a weak negative, and the cylinder in a positive state.\n\nThe foregoing experiments show that the office of the silk is not merely to prevent the return of electricity from the cylinder to the cushion, but that it is the chief <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> in the excitation; while the cushion serves only to supply the electricity, and perhaps increase the pressure at the entering part. There likewise seems to be little reason to doubt but that the disposition of the electricity to escape from the surface of the cylinder is not prevented by the interposition of the silk, but by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPENSATION\">compensation</a> after the manner of a charge; the silk being then as strongly negative as the cylinder is positive; and, lastly, that the line of light between the silk and cushion in weak excitations does not consist of returning electricity, but of electricity which passes to the cylinder, in consequence of its not having been sufficiently supplied during its contact with the rubbing surface.\n\n11. When the excitation was very strong in a cylinder newly mounted, flashes of light were seen to fly across its inside, from the receiving surface to the surface in contact with the cushion, as indicated by the brush figure. These made the cylinder ring as if struck with a bundle of small twigs. They seem to have arisen from part of the electricity of the cylinder taking the form of a charge. This appearance was observed in a 9-inch and a 12-inch cylinder, and the property went off in a few weeks. Whence it appears to have been chiefly occasioned by the rarity of the internal air produced by handling, and probably restored by gradual leaking of the cement.\n\n12. With a view to determine what happens in the state of the inside of the cylinder, recourse was had to a plate machine. One cushion was applied with its filken flap, cylinder 4 inch thick. During the excitation, the surface opposite to the cushion strongly attracted electricity, which it gave out when it arrived opposite to the extremity of the flap; so that a continual stream of electricity passed through an insulated metallic bow terminating in balls, which were opposed, the one to the surface opposite the extremity of the silk, and the other opposite to the cushion; the former ball showing positive and the latter negative signs. The knobs of two jars being substituted in the place of these balls, the jar applied to the surface opposite to the cushion was charged negatively, and the other positively. This disposition of the back surface seemed, by a few trials, to be weaker, the stronger the action of the cushion, as judged by the electricity on the cushion side.\n\nHence it follows, that the internal surface of a cylinder is so far from being disposed to give out electricity during the friction by which the external surface acquires it, that it even greedily attracts it.\n\n13. A plate of glass was applied to the revolving plate, and thrust under the cushion in such a manner as to supply the place of the silk flap. It rendered the electricity stronger, and appears to be an improvement of the plate machine.\n\n14. Two cushions were then applied on the opposite surfaces with their silk flaps, so as to clap the plate between them. The electricity was received from both by applying the finger and thumb to the opposite surfaces of the plate. When the finger was advanced a little towards its correspondent cushion, so that its distance was less than between the thumb and its cushion, the finger received strong electricity, and the thumb none; and, contrariwise, if the thumb were advanced beyond the finger, it received all the electricity, and none passed to the finger. This electricity was not stronger than was produced by the good action of one cushion applied singly.\n\n15. The cushion in experiment 12, gave most electricity when the back surface was supplied, provided that surface was suffered to retain its electricity till the rubbed surface had given out its electricity.\nFrom the two last paragraphs it appears, that no advantage is gained by rubbing both surfaces; but that a well managed friction on one surface will accumulate as much electricity as the present methods of excitation seem capable of collecting; but that, when the excitation is weak, on account of the electric matter not paffing with sufficient facility to the rubbed surface, the friction enables the opposite surface to attract or receive it, and if it be supplied, both surfaces will pass off in the positive state; and either surface will give out more electricity than is really induced upon it, because the electricity of the opposite surface forms a charge. It may be necessary to observe, that I am speaking of the facts or effects produced by friction; but how the rubbing surfaces act upon each other to produce them, whether by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> or otherwise, we do not here inquire.\n\n16. When a cylinder is weakly excited, the appearances mentioned (par. 8.) are more evident the more rapid the turning. In this case, the avidity of the surface of the cylinder beneath the silk is partly supplied from the edge of the silk, which throws back a broad <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASCADE\">cascade</a> of fire, sometimes to the distance of above 12 inches. From these causes it is that there is a determinate velocity of turning required to produce the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAXIMUM\">maximum</a> of intensity in the conductor. The stronger the excitation, the quicker may be the velocity; but it rarely exceeds five feet of the glass to pass the cushion in a second.\n\n17. If a piece of silk be applied to a cylinder, by drawing down the ends so that it may touch half the circumference, and the cylinder be then turned and excited by applying the amalgamated leather, it will become very greedy of electricity during the time it passes under the silk. And if the entering surface of the glass be supplied with electricity, it will give it out at the other extremity of contact; that is to say, if insulated conductors be applied at the touching ends of the silk, the one will give, and the other receive, electricity, until the intensities of their opposite states are as high as the power of the apparatus can bring them; and these states will be instantly reversed by turning the cylinder in the opposite direction.\n\nAs this discovery promises to be of the greatest use in electrical experiments, because it affords the means of producing either the plus or minus states in one and the same conductor, and of instantly repeating experiments with either power, and without any change of position or adjustment of the apparatus, it evidently deserves the most minute examination.\n\n18. There was little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> (par. 6.) that cushions could be dispensed with. They were therefore added; and it was then seen, that the electrified conductors were supplied by the difference between the action of the cushion which had the advantage of the silk, and that which had not; so that the naked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the cylinder was always in a strong electric state. Methods were used for taking off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRELUDE\">prelude</a> of the receiving cushion; but the extremity of the silk, by the construction, not being immediately under that cushion, gave out large flashes of electricity with the power that was used. Neither did it appear practicable to prevent a row of points or other apparatus to intercept the electricity which flew round the cylinder; because such an addition would have materially diminished the intensity of the conductor, which in the usual way was such as to flash into the air from rounded extremities of four inches diameter, and made an inch and half ball become luminous and blow like a point. But the greatest inconvenience was, that the two states with the backward and forward turn were seldom equal; because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> of the amalgam on the silk, produced by applying the leather to the cylinder in one direction of turning, was the reverse of what must take place when the contrary operation was performed.\n\nNotwithstanding all this, as the intensity with the two cushions was such as most operators would have called strong, the method may be of use, and I still <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> to make more experiments when I get possession of a very large machine which is now in hand.\n\n19. The more immediate advantage of this discovery is, that it suggested the idea of two fixed cushions method of with a moveable silk flap and rubber. Upon this principle, which is so simple and obvious, that it is wonderful it should have been so long overlooked, I have constructed a machine with one conductor, in which the two opposite and equal states are produced by the simple process of loosening the leather rubber, and letting it pass round with the cylinder (to which it adheres) until it arrives at the opposite side, where it is again fastened. A wish to avoid prolixity prevents my describing the mechanism by which it is let go and fastened in an instant, at the same time that the cushion is made either to press or is withdrawn, as occasion requires.\n\n20. Although the foregoing series of experiments naturally lead us to consider the silk as the chief agent in excitation; yet as this business was originally performed by a cushion only, it becomes an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of inquiry to determine what happens in this case.\n\n21. The great Beccaria inferred, that in a simple cushion, the line of fire, which is seen at the extremity manner of contact from which the surface of the glass recedes, performed consists of returning electricity; and Dr Nooth grounded his happy invention of the silk flap upon the same rubber supposition. The former asserts, that the lines of light without both at the entering and departing parts of the surface a silk flap, are absolutely similar; and thence infers, that the cushion receives on the one side, as it certainly does on the other. I find, however, that the fact is directly contrary to this assertion; and that the opposite inference ought to be made, as far as this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDICATION\">indication</a> can be reckoned conclusive: for the entering surface exhibits many luminous perpendiculars to the cushion, and the departing surface exhibits a neat uniform line of light. This circumstance, together with the consideration that the line of light behind the silk in par. 8. could not consist of returning electricity, showed the necessity of farther examination. I therefore applied the edge of the hand as a rubber, and by occasionally bringing forward the palm, I varied the quantity of electricity which passed near the departing surface. When this was the greatest, the sparks at the electrometer were the most numerous. But as the experiment was liable to the objection that the rubbing surface was variable, I passed a piece of leather upon a thin flat piece of wood, then amalgamated its whole surface, and cut its extremity off in a neat right line close to the wood. This being applied by the constant action of a spring against the cylinder, produced a weak excitation; and the line where the contact of the cylinder and leather ceased (as abruptly\nPrinciples of Electricity (as possible) exhibited a very narrow fringe of light.\n\nAnother piece of wood was prepared of the same width as the rubber, but one quarter of an inch thick, with its edges rounded, and its whole surface covered with tin-foil. This was laid on the back of the rubber, and was there held by a small spring, in such a manner as that it could be slid onward, so as occasionally to project beyond the rubber, and cover the departing and excited surface of the cylinder without touching it. The sparks at the electrometer were four times as numerous when this metallic piece was thus projected; but no electricity was observed to pass between it and the cylinder. The metallic piece was then held in the hand to regulate its distance from the glass; and it was found, that the sparks at the electrometer increased in number as it was brought nearer, until light appeared between the metal and the cylinder; at which time they became fewer the nearer it was brought, and at last ceased when it was in contact.\n\nThe following conclusions appear to be deducible from these experiments. 1. The line of light on a cylinder departing from a simple cushion consists of returning electricity; 2. The projecting part of the cushion compensates the electricity upon the cylinder, and by diminishing its intensity prevents it striking back in such large quantities as it would otherwise do; 3. That if there was no such compensation, very little of the excited electricity would be carried off; And, 4. That the compensation is diminished, or the intensity increased, in a higher <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIO\">ratio</a> than that of the distance of the compensating substance; because, if it were not, the electricity which has been carried off from an indefinitely small distance, would never fly back from a greater distance and form the edge of light.\n\nI hope the considerable intensity I shall speak of will be an apology for describing the manner in which I produce it. I wish the theory of this very obscure process were better known; but no conjecture of mine is worth mentioning. The method is as follows:\n\nClean the cylinder, and wipe the silk.\n\nGrease the cylinder by turning it against a greased leather till it is uniformly obscured. Use the tallow of a candle.\n\nTurn the cylinder till the silk flap has wiped off so much of the grease as to render it semitransparent.\n\nPut some amalgam on a piece of leather, and spread it well, so that it may be uniformly bright. Apply this against the turning cylinder. The friction will immediately increase, and the leather must not be removed until it ceases to become greater.\n\nRemove the leather, and the action of the machine will be very strong.\n\nMy rubber, as before observed, consists of the silk flap pasted to a leather, and the cushion is pressed against the silk by a slender spiral spring in the middle of its back. The cushion is loosely retained in a groove, and rests against the spring only, in such a manner that by a sort of libration upon it as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FULCRUM\">fulcrum</a>, it adapts itself to all the irregularities of the cylinder, and never fails to touch it in its whole length. There is no adjustment to vary the pressure, because the pressure cannot be too small when the excitation is properly made. Indeed the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> withdrawing of the cushion to the distance of \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th of an inch from the silk, as in par. 2, Principles of Electricity Illustrated by Experiment, will not materially affect a good excitation.\n\nThe amalgam is that of Dr Higgins, composed of zinc and mercury. If a little mercury be added to melted zinc, it renders it easily pulverizable, and more mercury may be added to the powder to make a very soft amalgam. It is apt to crystallize by repose, which seems in some measure to be prevented by triturating it with a small proportion of grease; and it is always of advantage to triturate it before using.\n\nA very strong excitation may be produced by applying the amalgamated leather to a clean cylinder with a clean silk; but it soon goes off, and is not so strong as the foregoing, which lasts several days.\n\nTo give some distinctive criterions by which other electricians may determine whether the intensity they produce exceeds or falls short of that which this method affords, I shall mention a few facts.\n\nWith a cylinder 7 inches diameter and cushion 8 mer. inches long, three brushes at a time constantly flew out of a 3-inch ball in succession too quick to be counted, and a ball of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch diameter was rendered luminous, and produced a strong wind like a point. A 9-inch cylinder with an 8-inch cushion occasioned frequent flashes from the round end of a conductor 4 inches diameter; with a ball of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inches in diameter the flashes ceased now and then, and it began to appear luminous: a ball of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch diameter first gave the usual flashes; then, by quicker turning, it became luminous with a bright spark moving about on its surface, while a constant stream of air rushed from it; and, lastly, when the intensity was greatest, brushes of a different kind from the former appeared. These were less luminous, but better defined in the branches; many started out at once with a hoarse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a>. They were reddish at the item, sooner divided, and were greenish at the point next the ball, which was bright. A ball of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)ths of an inch in diameter was surrounded by a steady faint light, enveloping its exterior hemisphere, and sometimes a flash struck out at top. When the excitation was strongest, a few flashes struck out sidewise. The horizontal diameter of the light was longest, and might measure one inch, the item of the ball being vertical.\n\nWith a 12-inch cylinder and rubber of \\( \\frac{7}{2} \\) inches, a 5-inch ball gave frequent flashes, upwards of 14 inches long, and sometimes a 6-inch ball would flash. I do not mention the long spark, because I was not provided with a favourable apparatus for the two larger cylinders. The 7-inch cylinder affords a spark of 10\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inches at best. The 9-inch cylinder, not having its conductor insulated on a support sufficiently high, afforded flashes to the table which was 14 inches distant. And the 12-inch cylinder, being mounted only as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODEL\">model</a> or trial for constructing a larger apparatus, is defective in several respects, which I have not thought fit to alter. When the five-inch ball gives flashes, the cylinder is enveloped on all sides with fire which rushes from the receiving part of the conductor.\n\nIt is of consequence that electricians should employ usual methods common method of estimating the power of their kinds of machines, so as to admit of comparing those of different sizes or constructions. This is usually done by describing the length and appearance of the simple spark drawn from the prime conductor; or the distance to electrical machines.\nNicholson has been led to alter his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>; and he now prefers a plate to a cylinder.\n\nFrom considering the defects of the usual methods of estimating the power of machines, Mr Cuthbertson was led to propose the explosion of steel wire as a proper measure; and he has made several experiments to show that this method is the least liable to error. Mr Nicholson has given an account of these experiments in his Journal for August 1798; but they seem to require measuring a repetition and farther <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> before they can be received as conclusive.\n\nAs glass, though preferable to all electrics that can be employed for the purpose of excitation, from its substitutes durability and unchangeable nature, is from its brittleness attended with considerable expense, various experiments have been thought of to substitute in its place some other electric in the construction of electrical machines.\n\nDr Ingenhouz, the inventor of the plate machine, made a variety of experiments for this purpose. Pasteboard thoroughly dried and heated, and then soaked and varnished with a solution of amber in linseed oil, formed plates which were strongly electrified when rubbed with a cat's skin or hare's skin. He tried baked wood boiled in linseed oil, but with less success. A cylinder of strong silk <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELVET\">velvet</a>, formed by stretching that substance upon two circular wooden disks, was found to afford considerable electrical force when caused to revolve against a cushion covered with hare's skin.* Phil.\n\nAnd lastly, the same philosopher contrived a portable Transf. for apparatus for charging a jar by means of a varnished silk ribbon, exposed to the friction of a rubber attached to the external coating, while the opposite electricity of the silk was taken off by a metallic part communicating with the inside.\n\nIt was at the beginning of 1784, that M. Walckiers de St Amand undertook to construct a machine, in which a piece of silk was made to revolve incessantly, and pass between two pair of rubbers. He made one of small dimensions, and afterwards a larger one, in which the silk was twenty-five feet in length, and five feet broad. In the following year M. Rouland, professor of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">natural <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a> in the university of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a>, constructed a machine of the same kind.\u2020 As the advantages and effects of these machines appear to be considerable, we shall here insert the description of the latter from Nicholson's Journal for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 1798.\n\nA, B, fig. 80, is a wooden table four feet and a half long, two feet nine inches wide, and somewhat more of silk than an inch and a half thick; its feet are 18 inches long. Upon this table are fastened by strong wooden screws, a b c d, two crofs pieces, each nine inches broad, which carry the uprights C, D, E, F, which last are 27 inches in height. At about two-thirds or more of the height of these uprights, there are cut notches of an inch square each, in which the axes of the two cylinders G and H turn freely. These axes are parallel to the table and to each other, and are kept in their place by clamps of wood screwed over them. The cylinders G and H are formed of light wood glued together, and covered at the ends by a circular piece, whose rounded edges arise half an inch above the surface of the cylinders themselves. Their diameter is eight inches; the axes are of box-wood, and are less than an inch in diameter, having a shoulder which prevents the ends of the cylinders from...\n\nPrinciples of Electricity lastly, the cylinders are covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERGE\">serge</a>.\n\nThe handle is copper, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RADIUS\">radius</a> being six inches long.\n\nK, L, is a piece of taffety covered with oily and resinous matter, of the same kind as used in France in the construction of air-balloon, which, M. Rouland says, renders the silk very electrical; the breadth of the silk is nearly one inch less than the length of the cylinders, and it is wrapped round them with its ends sewed together.\n\nThe whole breadth of the silk is taken hold of or pinched between two flattened tin tubes opposite each other at M, and two of the same kind at N: these are the rubbers, and may be made to press against each other, more or less strongly, by means of screws. They are retained by strings of silk fastened to the four uprights of the machine. v v are two brass chains hooked upon the rubbers, and communicating with the earth; o p and q r are four pieces of taffety, prepared in the same manner as the principal piece, sewed in the direction of their length to the rubbers, and fastened to each other by their corresponding corners by means of threads of silk. The metallic tubes or rubbers are covered with cat's skin.\n\nS represents the conductor. It is a cylinder of brass three inches in diameter, 36 inches in length, including the balls at the end, whose diameters are four inches: one of these balls has a ring, t above it, which serves to form a communication between the conductor S and any other conductor.\n\nThe upper and lower parts of this cylindrical prime conductor are armed with two plates of brass y y, whose length is equal and correspondent to the breadth of the taffety, which is 26 inches, and 13 1/2 inches or 11 feet long: the edges of the plates are about half an inch distant from the silk, and serve instead of the metallic points that were used by M. Walckiers, but rejected by M. Rouland, because they were apt to stick into the silk and damage it.\n\nThe conductor S is suspended by silk strings, fastened to the uprights of the machine by the hooks and rings i i: its situation is parallel to the cylinders G, H, and equidistant from each. The action of this machine is as follows: The cylinder H is moved rapidly on its axis by means of the handle, and the cylinder G moves of course in the same direction on the two extremities of its axis, provided the taffety K, L, be properly stretched. This tension is easily obtained; because the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> pieces to which the uprights C, D, and E, F, are fixed, may be moved nearer or further from each other, and fastened by means of the screws a b and c d, which pass through holes cut in the direction of the table.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-ROTATION\">rotation</a> of the cylinders necessarily producing a circulation of the taffety, it must consequently be rubbed in its passage between the tin tubes covered with cat's skin at M and N; and by this friction it obtains what is called the negative electricity, which is communicated from both parts of the silk to the common conductor S. But it may be made to electrify positively, by removing the rubbers to the middle of the silk, so that the prime conductor may communicate with them: or, if the two cushions be removed to half the distance between the revolving cylinders and the prime conductor, positive and negative electricity may be had at the same time, the rubbers being in a negative state, and the prime conductor in a positive state.\n\nThe advantages of a machine of this construction beyond those of glass are stated by the inventor to be, 1. It is not brittle in any part. 2. Its excitation is more steady, because it requires no amalgam. 3. Its dimensions have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a>.\n\nThe power of excitation in this way appears to have been very considerable. The facts are not related with so much detail as could be wished in the report of the academy; but it appears that the negative sparks from the conductor of Walckiers, which was five feet long, were from 15 to 17 inches in length, very loud and dense, and very painful to the hand; that pointed bodies emitted very sensible sparks to the conductor; and that a battery of 50 square feet was charged by 30 turns of the machine, which gives 19 feet of silk rubbed to charge one foot of glass*. In another instance,* see Phil. however, it is said, that a square foot was charged by Journal, one turn of the machine, which answered to 31 1/2 square feet of silk. It is not said whether the labour of turning was considerable or not.\n\nM. Rouland made several trials to substitute plain silk instead of that which was varnished; and he also tried woollens and mixed cloth containing goat's hair; but none of these answered to his satisfaction.\n\nCHAP. XII. Of the Electric Properties of Air.\n\nWe have ranked air among the electrics, but it will be seen by the table of electric substances given in page 646, that it is but an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> electric. We have observed at the beginning of this part, that it may even become a conductor by being impregnated with moisture. It is also found that when air is heated to a considerable degree, it becomes a conductor; this according to Cavallo, may be shewn by the following experiment. Electrify a common ball electrometer, or the prime conductor with Henly's quadrant electrometer placed upon it; the balls will, of course, separate from each other, or the index of the quadrant will denote the degree of electricity communicated to the prime conductor. Now bring a red-hot iron within a sufficient distance of the electrometer or the prime conductor, and it will be found that they soon lose their electricity, it being conducted away by the heated air that surrounds the iron; that the heated iron is the cause of the loss of electricity may be proved, by repeating the experiment with the same iron when cold, as in this case it will be found that the electrometer of the conductor, will not lose its electricity so soon, unless the iron be brought very near.\n\nMr Read made the following experiment to prove that hot air is not a conductor.\n\n\"It has been,\" says Mr Read, \"commonly said, that hot air conducts electricity. With a view to affirm certain this matter, the following experiments were made. To one end of a long piece of wood (which served as a handle,) was fixed a glass rod fifteen inches long; to the remote end of the glass was fixed a pith-ball electrometer. Having electrified the balls, I held them by the wood handle, and projected them into a large oven, immediately after the fire was drawn out of it; the consequence was, that when I performed the operation slowly, the balls lost their electricity; but\nChap. XII.\n\nPrinciples of Electricity.\n\nIllustrated electricity, in the first case, was found to have escaped along the glass into the wooden handle, and so to the earth, owing to the great heat the glass rod had acquired, by which it became a conductor of the fluid; for until it had cooled a little, the balls could not be charged again.\n\n\"I shall lay before the reader one circumstance more, because it may tend to throw light on what degree of heat the oven was in at the time the observations were made. The baker having pointed out to me the hottest part of the oven; with a quick motion in and out, I plunged the electrified balls into that part of it, by which one thread ball was burned off, but the remaining ball showed that it still retained its electric charge, because it was strongly attracted on the approach of my finger.\"\n\nAir, as an electric, may be electrified either by excitation or by communication.\n\nAir may be excited by any circumstance which tends to produce motion among its particles; as by friction, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>, heat and cold, expansion and contraction, and by any chemical processes in which these circumstances are produced.\n\n1. That air may be excited by friction was sufficiently shown by the experiments related to demonstrate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> of Bennet's electrometer; by these experiments it appeared, that whenever a cloud of dust or powder was raised in the air surrounding the electrometer, the slips of gold leaf, by their separation, manifested signs of electricity, which must doubtless have been produced by the attraction of the particles of dust or powder against the particles of air.\n\n2. Air may be rendered electrical by the vapour or smoke which rises into it from evaporating or burning substances. At the end of the first part of this article, we noticed, in a general way, Sig. Volta's experiments on the electricity produced by evaporation; we must now consider this subject rather more at large. The production of electricity by evaporation, may be thrown by the following experiments.\n\nExper. 1. Upon the cap of Bennet's electrometer c, fig. 81., place a metallic cup containing a little water; drop into the water a red-hot coal, or a red-hot piece of clean iron; a vapour will arise from the water, and the strips of gold leaf n n will diverge with strong negative electricity. If at the same time, an iron wire p, fixed to a rod of glass or sealing-wax, with a common ball electrometer hanging from its extremity, be held by the glass or sealing-wax in the air, at a little distance above the cup, the balls d will be found to diverge with positive electricity.\n\nExper. 2. Let there be two of the above electrometers, as A, B, fig. 82.; upon the cap of the electrometer B, place a metallic cup d, as in the last experiment, and into the cap of the electrometer A, let there be screwed a bent wire m, with a piece of tin soldered to its other extremity. If now, the electrometer B with its metallic cup be placed immediately below the tin r, and a cullender c, containing a few live coals, be held over the cup, and if water be poured from the jug upon the coals in the cullender, so as to fall into the metal cup, the slips of gold leaf in both electrometers will diverge; those of the electrometer B, with negative electricity, and those of the electrometer A, with positive electricity.\n\nThe experiments on the electricity produced by evaporation, may be very conveniently made by heating the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINAL\">final</a> end of a pretty long tobacco-pipe, and pouring water into the bowl of it; the water running down to the heated part, which should be held over the cap of Bennet's electrometer, is suddenly expanded into vapour, and the slips of gold leaf will separate with negative electricity.\n\nIn the above experiment it has been seen, that the electrometer from which the vapour arose, was always electrified negatively; from having observed this to be bodies not always the case in his experiments, Sig. M. Volta always considered it as a general law. Mr Cavallo, however, mentions some experiments made by a professor at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MANTUA\">Mantua</a>, and by himself, which seem to contradict this supposition.\n\nAll the experiments, (says Mr Cavallo), made on evaporation for some years after this discovery, were attended with results conformable to the above-mentioned general law; but two remarkable exceptions have of late been discovered, which, besides their contradicting the said law, seem to point out a more intimate connection between the electric fluid and other bodies. The first of these exceptions was discovered and published three years ago, by a learned professor of the academy of Mantua; the second was very lately discovered by myself.\n\nThe Mantuan professor observed, that when water was evaporated by being put in contact with a red hot-piece of rusty iron, it would leave the iron electrified positively; whereas when the experiment was tried with a clean piece of iron, the electricity acquired by the metal would be of the negative kind.\n\nWhen I first attempted to repeat this curious experiment, the result did by no means answer my expectations; the electricity, which was produced being of the negative, and not of the positive kind; but observing that sometimes no sensible degree of electricity was produced, though the evaporation was very quick and copious, I began to suspect that the iron, which I had employed, was not sufficiently covered with rust, in consequence of which two opposite states of electricity might possibly be produced, viz. the negative from the clean, and the positive from the rusty part of the iron; which two opposite states, by counteracting each other, would leave the iron un-electrified. After various repetitions of this experiment, in which the red-hot iron was thrown into the inflated water, or the water was poured upon the red-hot and inflated iron, I found that this was actually the case.\n\nI procured some old iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAILS\">nails</a>, which had remained exposed to the atmosphere for several years, and of course had contracted a very thick coat of rust; and on performing the experiment with them, I obtained positive electricity, agreeably to the assertion of the above-mentioned gentleman. The same nail very seldom would answer for more than one experiment; for the action of the fire and of the water generally removed a great deal of the rust, and exhibited the naked metal, which would afterwards acquire the negative electricity. Here follows the manner of performing this remarkable experiment.\n\nInsulate a metallic or earthen plate, and pour a small\nPrinciples of small quantity of water in it, and let a sensitive electrometer be connected with the water; then drop a red-hot piece of iron into the plate, and it will be found, that, if very ruddy iron be used, the electrometer will be opened with positive electricity; if the iron be clean, or free from rust, the electrometer will acquire the negative electricity; and lastly, if the iron be partially ruddy, the electrometer will acquire little or no electricity, though in every case the evaporation may be equally quick and copious.","sp":301,"ep":334},{"h":"ELECTRICITY","t":"Principles of Electricity illustrated by experiment.\n\nExper. 3.\u2014Into a jar, coated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> the outside, he put a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of powdered glass, and having furnished it in other respects like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a> phial, he proceeded to examine whether it would receive a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>.

Van Swinden found that flowers of sulphur acted as a conductor though more imperfectly than powdered glass.\n\nSoon after the discovery of the Leyden phial and shock produced by it, it became a desirable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> with electricians to ascertain how far the shock might be conveyed, and how <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> would be required to convey it to any considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>.\n\nThe French philosophers were the first to appear in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>, but they did little more than excite the English to go far beyond them in these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> undertakings. A circuit was made by the former of 900 toises, consisting of men holding <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> wires betwixt each two, through which the electric shock was sensibly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a>. At another time they made the shock pass through a wire two thousand toises in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a>, that is, near a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> about two English miles and a half; though part of the wires dragged upon wet grass, went over chasms, hedges, or palisades and over <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> newly ploughed up. Into another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> they took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> of the basin in the Tuileries, the surface of which was about an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACRE\">acre</a>, and the phial was discharged through it.\n\nMr Monnier the younger, endeavoured to determine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> of the electric power; and for this purpose made the shock pass through an iron wire of 950 toises in length, but he could not observe that it spent a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> in passing it. He also found, that when a wire of 1319 feet, with its extremities brought near together, was electrified, that the electricity ceased at one end the moment it was taken off at the other.\n\nBut all these attempts of the French would scarcely have deserved to be mentioned, but that they preceded the greater, the more numerous, and more accurate experiments of the English. The names of the English gentlemen, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a> with a truly philosophical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>, and who were indefatigable in this business, deserve to be transmitted to posterity.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGENT\">agent</a> in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> was Dr Watson. He planned and directed all the operations, and never failed to be present at every experiment. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> assistants were Martin Folkes, Esq., <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-PRESIDENT\">president</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">Royal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">Society</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHARLES\">Charles</a> Cavendish, Dr Bevis, Mr Graham, Dr Birch, Mr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PETER\">Peter</a> Daval, Mr Trembley, Mr Elliot, Mr Robins, and Mr Short. Many other persons, and some of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a>, gave their attendance occasionally.\n\nDr Watson, who wrote the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a> of their proceedings, in order to lay them before the Royal Society, begins by observing (what was verified in all their experiments) that the electric shock is not, strictly speaking, conducted in the shortest manner possible, unless the bodies through which it passes, conduct equally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a>; for that, if they conduct unequally, the circuit is always formed through the best conductors, though the length of it be ever so great.\n\nThe first attempt these gentlemen made, was to convey the electric shock across the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THAMES\">Thames</a>, making use of the water of the river for one part of the chain of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a>. This they accomplished on the 14th and 18th of July of 1747, by fastening a wire all along <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WESTMINSTER\">Westminster</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRIDGE\">bridge</a>, at a considerable height above the water. One end of this wire communicated with the coating of a charged phial, the other being held by an observer, who in his other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> held an iron rod, which he dipped into the river. On the opposite side of the river stood a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a> who likewise dipped an iron rod in the river with one hand, and in the other held a wire, the extremity of which might be brought into contact with the wire of the phial.\n\nUpon making the discharge, the shock was felt by the observers on both sides of the river, but more sensibly by those who were stationed on the same side with the machine; part of the electric fire having gone from the wire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> the moist <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> of the bridge, thereby making several shorter circuits to the phial, but still all passing through the gentlemen who were stationed on the same side with the machine. This was, in a manner demonstrated by some persons feeling a sensible shock in their arms and feet, who only happened to touch the wire at the time of one of the discharges, when they were standing upon wet steps which led to the river.\n\nUpon this and the subsequent occasions, the gentlemen made use of wires, in preference to chains, for this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> among other reasons, that the electricity which was conducted by chains, was not so strong as that conducted by wires. This, as they well observed, was occasioned by the junctures of the links not being sufficiently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>, as appeared by the flashing and snapping at every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNCTURE\">juncture</a>, where there was the least separation. These lesser snappings being numerous in the whole length of a chain, very sensibly lessened the great discharge at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIME\">prime</a> conductor.\n\nTheir next attempt was to force the electrical shock to make a circuit of two miles, at the New-river at Stoke Newington. This they performed on the 24th of July 1747, at two places; at one of which, the distance by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a> was 800 feet, and by water 2000; in the other the distance by land was 2800 feet, and by water 8000. The disposition of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> was similar to what they before used at Westminster bridge, and the effect answered their utmost expectations. But, as in both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>, the observers at both extremities of the chain, which terminated in the water, felt the shock, as well when they stood with their rods fixed into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> 20 feet from the water, as when they were put into the river; it occasioned a doubt, whether the shock was formed through the windings of the river, or a much shorter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> by the ground of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MEADOW\">meadow</a>; for the experiment plainly showed, that the meadow ground, with the grass on it, conducted the electricity very well.\n\nBy subsequent experiments, they were fully convinced, that the electricity had not in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> been conveyed by the water of the river, which was two miles in length, but by land, where the distance was only one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MILE\">mile</a>; in which space, however, the electric power must necessarily have passed over the New-river twice, have gone through several gravel pits, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> stubble field.\n\n\u2020 p. 360.\nOn the 28th of July they repeated the experiment at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, with the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> of circumstances. The iron wire was, in its whole length, supported by dry sticks, and the observers stood upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> electrics; the effect of which was, that they felt the shock much more sensibly than when the conducting wire had lain upon the ground, and when the observers had stood likewise upon the ground, as in the former experiment.\n\nAfterwards, everything remaining as before, the observers were directed, instead of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIPPING\">dipping</a> their rods into the water, to put them into the ground, each 150 feet from the water. They were both smartly struck, though they were distant from each other above 500 feet.\n\nThe same gentlemen, pleased with the success of their former experiments, undertook another, the object of which was to determine, whether the electric power could be conveyed through dry ground; and at the same time to carry it through water to a greater distance than they had done before. For this purpose they pitched upon Highbury-barn, beyond Illington, where they carried it into execution on the 5th of August 1747. They chose a station for their machine almost equally distant from two other stations for observers, upon the New-river, which were somewhat more than a mile asunder by land, and two miles by water. They had found the streets of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a>, when dry, to conduct very strongly, for about 40 yards; and the dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> at Newington about the same distance. The event of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a> answered their expectations. The electric fire made the circuit of the water when both the wires and the observers were supported on original electrics, and the rods dipped into the river. They also both felt the shock, when one of the observers was placed in a dry gravelly pit, about 300 yards nearer the machine than the former station, and 100 yards distant from the river; from which the gentlemen were satisfied, that the dry gravelly ground had conducted the electricity as strongly as water.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> attempt of this kind which these gentlemen made, and which required all their sagacity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> in the conduct of it, was to try whether the electric shock was perceptible at twice the distance to which they had before carried it, in ground perfectly dry, and where no water was near, and also to distinguish, if possible, the comparative velocity of electricity, and of found.\n\nFor this purpose they fixed upon Shooter's-hill, and made their first experiment on the 14th of August 1747, a time, when, as it happened, but one shower of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> had fallen during five preceding weeks. The wire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> with the iron rod, which made the discharge, was 6732 feet in length, and was supported all the way upon baked sticks; as was also the wire which communicated with the coating of the phial, which was 3868 feet long, and the observers were distant from each other two miles. The result of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a> demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the gentlemen present, that the circuit performed by the electricity was four miles, viz., two miles of wire, and two of dry ground, the space between the extremities of the wires, a distance, which, without trial, as they justly observed, was too great to be credited. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GUN\">gun</a> was discharged at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> of the explosion, and the observers had stop watches in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTE\">note</a> the moment when they felt the shock; but as far as they could distinguish, the time in which the electric power performed that vast circuit was instantaneous.\n\nIn all the explosions where the circuit was made of any considerable length, it was observed, that though the phial was very well charged, yet that the snap at the gun-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a> made by the explosion was not near so loud as when the circuit was formed in a room; so that a bystander, says Dr Watson, would not imagine, from seeing the flash and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> the report, that the stroke, at the extremity of the conducting wire, would have been considerable, the contrary of which, when the wires were properly managed, he says, always happened.\n\nStill the gentlemen, unrestrained in these pursuits, were desirous of ascertaining, if possible, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> velocity of electricity though a certain space; because, though in the last experiment, the time of its progress was certainly very small, they were desirous of knowing, small as that time might be, whether it was measurable, and Dr Watson had contrived an excellent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> for that purpose.\n\nAccordingly, on the 5th of August 1748, the gentlemen met for the last time, at Shooter's-hill; when it was agreed to make an electric circuit of two miles, by several turnings of the wire, in the same field. The middle of this circuit they contrived to be in the same room with the machine, where an observer took in each hand one of the extremities of the wires, each of which was a mile in length. In this excellent disposition of the apparatus, in which the time between the explosion and the shock could be observed with the greatest exactness, the phial was discharged several times; but the observer always felt himself shocked at the very instant of making the explosion. Upon this the gentlemen were fully satisfied, that through the whole length of this wire, which was 12,276 feet in length, the velocity of the electric power was instantaneous.\n\nWe have noticed the increased <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a> from liquids by means of electricity. The following experiment, which is commonly exhibited by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LECTURERS\">lecturers</a> on electricity, is usually considered of the same kind.\n\nStick a small piece of sealing-wax on the end of a wire, and set fire to it. Then put an electrical machine in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, and present the wax <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> blown out at the distance of some inches from the prime conductor. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of extremely fine filaments <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> immediately dart from the sealing wax to the conductor, on which they will be condensed into a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NET\">net</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, resembling <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>.\n\nIf the wire with the sealing-wax be stuck into one of the holes of the conductor, and a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> be presented at a moderate distance to the wax, just after it has been ignited, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> the machine in motion, a network of wax will be formed on the paper. The same effect, but in a slighter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, will be produced, if the paper be briskly rubbed with a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, and the melting sealing-wax be held pretty near the paper immediately after rubbing.\n\nIf the paper thus painted, as it were, with sealing-wax, be gently warmed by holding the back of it to the fire, the wax will adhere to it, and the result of the experiment will thus be rendered permanent.\n\nA beautiful experiment of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> is made\nElectricity illustrated by experiment.\n\nTo make camphor flow into ramifications.\n\nCurious experiment of Professor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LICHTENBERG\">Lichtenberg</a>.\n\nThe electrophorus, that is, a plate of some resinous substance, as sulphur, rosin, gum-lac, &c., is first excited, either by rubbing or otherwise; then a piece of metal of any shape, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, as for instance, a three-legged compass, a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> tube, or the like, is set upon the electrophorus, and to this piece of metal, so placed, a spark is given, of the electricity contrary to that of the plate; this done, the piece of metal is removed, by means of a stick of sealing-wax or other electric, and some powder of rosin, kept in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> bag, is shaken upon the electrophorus; this powder will be found to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> about those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> upon the plate, which the piece of metal touched, forming some radiated appearances, much like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> representations of flares; at the same time, upon the greatest part of the plate, that is, besides those flares, there is hardly any powder at all. Now, it is to be remarked, that if the plate be excited negatively, and the spark given to the metal set upon it is positive, the appearance will be as above described; but if, on the contrary, the plate is positive and the spark is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>, then the powder of rosin will be found to fall upon those parts of the plate which in the other case is left uncovered, and to leave the flares clean; in short, it will do just the reverse of what it did in the other case; or, in other words, the powder of rosin will be attracted by those parts only of the electrophorus which are electrified positively.\n\nThe configurations produced in the above experiment of M. Lichtenberg appeared to curious that they were soon imitated by various electricians, particularly by Mr Cavallo and the Reverend <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABRAHAM\">Abraham</a> Benney, inventor of the doubler. The directions given by this last gentleman are as follows.\n\nTo make <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> figures, take a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> of rasped <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRAZIL\">Brazil</a> wood; put it into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KETTLE\">kettle</a> with as much water as will cover it, or rather more; also put in about an ounce of gum arabic and a lump of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALUM\">alum</a> about as big as a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol15.html#article-NUT\">nut</a>; let it boil about two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, or till the water is strongly coloured; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRAIN\">strain</a> off the extract into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISH\">dish</a>, and set it in an iron oven, where it is to remain till all the water be evaporated, which with me was effected in about twelve hours; but this depends on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the oven, which should not be so hot as to endanger its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a>. Sometimes I have boiled the strained extract till it was considerably infusified before it was placed in the oven, that it might be sooner dry.\n\nWhen it is quite dry but not burnt, scrape it out of the dish, and grind it in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORTAR\">mortar</a> till it be finely pulverized. In doing this, it is proper to cover the mortar with a cloth, having a hole through to prevent the powder from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> away and offending the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOSE\">nose</a>, and also to do it out of doors if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a> be dry and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALM\">calm</a>, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> may carry away the powder necessarily escaping, and which otherwise is very disagreeable.\n\nWhen ground fine, let it be sifted through <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MUSLIN\">muslin</a> or a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>-sieve, returning the coarser part into the mortar to be ground again. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> and sifting are finished, the powder is ready for use. The resinous plate I have mostly used was composed of five pounds of rosin, half a pound of bees-wax, and two ounces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LAMP\">lamp</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a>, melted together, and poured upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> fifteen inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, with ribs upon the edges at least half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, to confine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a> whilst fluid; thus the resinous plate was half an inch thick, which is better than a thinner plate, the figures being more distinct. After the composition is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a>, it will be found covered with small blisters, which may be taken out by holding the plate before the fire, till the surface be melted, then let it cool again, and upon holding it a second time to the fire, more blisters will appear; but by thus repeatedly heating and cooling the surface, it will at last become perfectly smooth. Some plates were made smaller, and the resinous composition confined to the form of an ellipse, a circle, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESCUTCHEON\">escutcheon</a>, by a rim of tin half an inch broad, and fixed upon a board.\n\nThe next thing to be done is to prepare the paper, which is to be softened in water, either by laying the pieces upon each other in a vessel of cold water, or first pouring a little hot water upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of a large dish, then laying upon it a piece of paper, so that one edge of the paper may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> over the edge of the dish, to remain dry; that it may afterwards be more conveniently taken up. Then pour more hot water upon its upper surface. Upon this place another piece in the same manner, again pouring on more water, and thus proceed till all the pieces are laid in. By using hot water, the paper will be more softened in a few minutes than if it remains in cold water a whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>.\n\nWhen the figures are to be made, the resinous plate must lie horizontally, whilst the electricity is communicated, if the experiment requires anything to be placed upon the plate; but it is convenient afterwards to hang it up in a vertical position whilst the powder is projected, lest too much powder should fall where it is not required.\n\nA little of the powder may be taken between a finger and thumb, and projected by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> it over a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>; or, which is better, a quantity of powder may be put into the bellows and blown towards the plate. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> is sufficiently covered with powder, let the plate be again laid horizontally upon a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>; then take one of the softened papers out of the water by its dry edge, and lay it carefully between the leaves of a book, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PRESSING\">pressing</a> the book together, and let it lie in this situation about half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>. Then remove the paper to a dry place in the book, and press it again about the same time, which will generally be sufficient to take off the superfluous moisture. Then take up the paper by the two corners of its dry edge, and place the wet edge a little beyond the figure on the resinous plate, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a> the rest of the piece gradually till it covers the figure without sliding; then lay over it a piece of clean dry paper, and press it gently; let it remain a short time, and then rub it closer to the plate with a cloth, or, which is better, press it down by means of a wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROLLER\">roller</a> covered with cloth, taking care that the paper be not moved from its first position. When the paper is sufficiently pressed, let it be taken up by its dry\nPrinciples of dry edge, and laid upon the surface of a vessel of water Electricity with the printed side downwards; by this means the illustrated superfluous powder will sink in the water, and the by experiment figure will not be so liable afterwards to spread in the paper. After the paper has remained on the water during a few minutes, take it up and place it between the leaves of a book, removing it frequently to a dry place. If it be desired that the paper should be speedily dry, let the book-leaves in which it is to be placed be previously warmed, and by removing it to several places it will be dry much sooner than by holding it near a fire, and without drawing the paper crooked.\n\nBy the above <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a>, it is obvious, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CALICO\">calico</a>, or linen, as well as paper, may be printed with these figures, and the effects of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSION\">diffusion</a> of electricity upon a refrinous plate be exhibited to those who have not leisure or inclination to perform the experiments.\n\nThe figures represented in Plate CXCII. were formed much after Mr Bennet's method.\n\nThe apparatus used for making them consisted only of a common Leyden phial, and a plate of glass 15 inches square, covered on one side with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a> of gum-lac dissolved in spirit of wine, and several times laid over. The other side is covered with tin-foil laid on with common paste. When it is to be used, the glass plate is put upon a metallic stand, with the tin-foil side laid undermost; the phial is to be charged, and the knob drawn over the varnished side. Thus any kind of figure may be drawn, or letters made, as represented in the plate; and from every figure beautiful ramifications will proceed, longer or shorter according to the strength of the charge. On some occasions, however, the charge may be too strong, particularly where we wish to represent letters, so that the whole will be blended into one confused <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a>. The round figures are formed by placing metallic rings or plates upon the electrical plate; and then giving them a spark from the electrified bottle, or sending a shock through them. The figures may be rendered permanent by blowing off the loose chalk, and clapping on a piece of black-sized paper upon them; or if they are wanted of another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, they may easily be obtained by means of lake, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VERMILION\">vermilion</a>, rose-pink, or any of the ordinary colours ground very fine. The easiest way of applying them seems to be by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARBER\">barber</a>'s puff bellows.\n\nWe shall conclude this part of our article with noticing the effects produced by electricity on magnetic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol16.html#article-NEEDLES\">needles</a>.\n\nThese may be stated in the following proposition.\n\nAn electric shock communicates a magnetic power to needles, and frequently reverses or destroys that polarity.\n\nBy electricity Dr Franklin frequently gave polarity to needles and reversed them at pleasure. A shock from four large jars, sent through a fine sewing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a>, he says, gave it polarity, so that it would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a> when laid on water. What is most remarkable in these electrical experiments upon magnets is, that if the needle, when it was struck, lay <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a> and west, the end which was entered by the electric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BLAST\">blast</a> pointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>; but that if it lay north and south, the end which lay to wards the north would continue to point north, whether the fire entered at that end or the contrary; though he imagined that a stronger stroke would have reversed the poles even in that situation, an effect which had been known to have been produced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>. He also observed, that the polarity was strongest when the needle was struck lying north and south, and weakest when it lay east and west. He takes notice that, in these experiments the needle, in some cases, would be finely blued like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> of a watch, by the electric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>; in which case, the colour given by a flash from two jars only might be wiped off, but that a flash from four jars fixed it, and frequently melted the needles.\n\nThe jars which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOCTOR\">doctor</a> used held seven or eight gallons, and were coated and lined with tin-foil.\n\nDr Van Marum made several experiments on communicating polarity to needles with his very powerful machine. He and his coadjutor tried to give polarity to needles made of watch springs from three to five inches in length, and likewise to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> bars <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> inches long, from a quarter of an inch to half an inch broad, and about a line in thickness. The result was, that when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAR\">bar</a> or needle was placed horizontally in the magnetic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MERIDIAN\">meridian</a>, whichever way the shock entered, the end of the bar that stood toward the north acquired the north polarity, or the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> towards the north when freely suspended, and the opposite end acquired the south. If the bar, before it received the shock, had some polarity, and was placed with its poles contrary to the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, then its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> polarity was always diminished, and often reversed; so that the extremity of it, which in receiving the shock looked towards the north, became the north pole, &c.\n\nWhen the bar or needle was struck standing perpendicularly, its lowest end became the north pole in any case, even when the bar had some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-MAGNETISM\">magnetism</a> before, and was placed with the south pole downwards. Ceteris paribus, the bars seemed to acquire an equal degree of magnetic power, whether they were struck whilst standing horizontally in the magnetic meridian, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a>.\n\nWhen the bar or needle was placed in the magnetic equator, whichever way the shock entered, it never gave it any magnetism; but if the shock was given through its width, then the needle acquired a considerable degree of magnetism, and the end which lay towards the west became the north pole, and the other end the south pole.\n\nIf a needle or bar, already magnetic, or a real magnet, was struck in any direction, its power was always diminished. For this experiment, they tried considerably large bars, one being 7.08 inches long, 0.26 broad, and 0.05 thick.\n\nWhen the shock was so strong in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of the needle, as to render it hot, then the needle generally acquired no magnetism at all, or very little.\n\nThese experiments were made with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> power of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BATTERY\">battery</a> composed of 135 phials, containing among them about 130 square feet of coated surface.\n\nCHAP. I. Of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">Thunder</a>.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">Sect</a>. I. Of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IDENTITY\">Identity</a> of Electricity and Lightning.\n\nIt is not surprising that the experiments in which the electric spark is made to produce the effects which we have recounted in the third part of this article, should have led philosophers to conceive a similarity between these effects, and those produced by lightning.\n\nDr Wall and Mr Grey seem to have fancied a resemblance between thunder and the snapping noise produced by applying the fingers to an excited electric; but how such a resemblance should strike them, is not easy to conceive; and indeed it seems to have been merely a bold conjecture.\n\nThe abb\u00e9 Nollet appears to have formed the first rational idea of their similitude, and expresses himself on the subject in the following remarkable manner.\n\n\"If any one should take upon him to prove from a well connected <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of phenomena, that thunder is in the hands of nature what electricity is in ours; that the wonders which we now exhibit at our pleasure, are little imitations of those great effects that frighten us, and that the whole depends upon the same mechanism: if it can be demonstrated that a cloud prepared by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the winds, by heat, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MIXTURE\">mixture</a> of exhalations, &c., is opposite to a terrestrial object; that this is the electrified body, and at a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROXIMITY\">proximity</a> to that which is not: I avow that this idea, if it was well supported, would give me a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> of pleasure; and in support of it, how many specious reasons present themselves to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> who is well acquainted with electricity! The universality of the electric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, the readiness of its action, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFLAMMABILITY\">inflammability</a>, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> in giving fire to other bodies, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> of striking externally and internally even to their smallest parts, the remarkable example we have of this effect in the Leyden experiment, the idea which we might truly adopt in supposing a greater degree of electric power, &c., all these points of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> which I have been some time meditating, begin to make me believe, that by taking electricity for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODEL\">model</a>, one might form to one's self, in respect to thunder and lightning, more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> and more probable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> than have hitherto been offered.\"\n\nBut the first electrician who formed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> for ascertaining the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-HYPOTHESIS\">hypothesis</a>, was Dr Franklin, who truly realized the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FABLE\">fable</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMETHEUS\">Prometheus</a> in bringing down fire from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a>.\n\nBefore we relate Dr Franklin's experiments, we shall state the points of resemblance which led him to think of making them.\n\nHe begins his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the similarity of the electric fluid and lightning, by cautioning his readers not to be flattered at the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of effects in point of degree; since that was no argument of any disparity in their nature. It is no wonder, says he, if the effects of the one should be so much greater than those of the other. For if two gun-barrels electrified will strike at two inches distance, and make a loud report; at how great a distance will 10,000 acres of electrified cloud strike and give its fire, and how loud must be the crack!\n\n1. Flashes of lightning, are generally seen crooked and waving in the air. The same is the electric spark always, when it is drawn from an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a> body at some distance. He might have added, when it is drawn by an irregular body, and through a space in which the best conductors are disposed in an irregular manner, which is always the case in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HETEROGENEOUS\">heterogeneous</a> effects of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a> of our globe.\n\n2. Lightning strikes the highest and most pointed objects in its way, preferably to others; as high hills and trees, towers, spires, masts of ships, points of spears, &c. In like manner, all pointed conductors receive or throw off the electric fluid more readily than those which are terminated by flat surfaces.\n\n3. Lightning is observed to take the readiest and best conductor; so does electricity in the discharge of the Leyden phial.\n\n4. Lightning sets fire to inflammable bodies; so does electricity.\n\n5. Lightning, as well as electricity, fuses <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-METALS\">metals</a>.\n\n6. Lightning rends some bodies. The same does electricity.\n\n7. Lightning has often been known to strike people <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a>. And a pigeon, after a violent shock of electricity, by which the Doctor intended to have killed it, was observed to have been struck blind likewise.\n\n8. Lightning destroys animal life. Animals have likewise been killed by the shock of electricity.\n\n9. Magnets have been observed to lose their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, or to have their poles reversed by lightning. The same effect has been produced by electricity.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">Reasoning</a> on the similarity of these effects, he formed the bold attempt to draw down lightning from the clouds, and examine by experiment whether he could produce effects similar to those of nature. Having observed the effects of pointed conductors in attracting the electric fluid more easily than those of any other form, he conceived that pointed rods of iron, fixed in the air, when the atmosphere was loaded with lightning, might draw from it the matter of thunderbolts, without noise or danger, into the body of the earth. His account of this supposition is given by himself in the following words: \"The electric fluid is attracted by points. We do not know whether this property be in lightning; but since they agree in all the particulars in which we can already compare them, it is not improbable that they agree likewise in this. Let the experiment be made.\"\n\nIn the year 1752, while waiting for the erection of a spire in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PHILADELPHIA\">Philadelphia</a>, not imagining that a pointed rod of moderate height could answer the lightning purpose; at last it occurred to him, that, by means of a common kite, he could have readier access to the clouds, higher regions of the atmosphere than any other way whatever. Preparing, therefore, a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> handkerchief, and two cords sticks of a proper length on which to extend it, he took the opportunity of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> thunder-storm to take a walk into a field where there was a field proper for his purpose. But dreading the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIDICULE\">ridicule</a> which too often attends unsuccessful attempts in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>, he communicated his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a> to nobody but his son, who assisted him in raising the kite. A considerable time elapsed before there was any appearance of success. One very promising cloud had passed over the kite without any effect; when, just as he was beginning to despair, he observed some loo\nloose threads of the hempen string to stand erect, and avoid one another, just as if they had been suspended by the conductor of a common electrical machine. On this he presented his knuckle to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KEY\">key</a> which was fastened to the string, and thus obtained a very evident electric spark. Others succeeded, even before the string was wet; but when the rain had begun to descend, he collected electric fire pretty copiously. We are told, that when he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a> the fibres of the string erect themselves, he uttered a deep sigh, and wished that moment to be his last, feeling that by this discovery his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> would be immortalized. He had afterwards an insulated iron rod to draw the lightning into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>; and performed almost every experiment with real lightning, that had before been done with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> representations of it by electrical machines. That he might lose no opportunity of making his experiments, he connected two bells with his insulated rod; and these by their ringing, gave him notice whenever his apparatus was electrified by the lightning.\n\nAlthough we have recounted Dr Franklin's experiments first, he was not however, the first who verified his own hypothesis. This was done in France, about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> before Dr Franklin's experiments with the kite.\n\nThe most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> persons were two French gentlemen, Mefris Dalibard, and Delor. The former prepared his apparatus at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARLY\">Marly</a> la ville, situated about five or six leagues from Paris; the latter at his own house, which was on some of the highest ground in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>. Mr Dalibard's apparatus consisted of an iron rod, 40 feet long, the lower extremity of which was brought into a fenny box where the rain could not enter; while on the outside, it was fastened to three wooden poles, by silken strings defended from the rain. This machine was the first that happened to be favoured with a visit from the ethereal fire. Mr Dalibard himself was not at home; but, in his absence he had intrusted the care of his apparatus to one Coifier, a joiner, who had served 14 years among the dragoons, and on whose courage and understanding he could depend. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICER\">artificer</a> had all the necessary instructions given him, and was desired to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> some of his neighbours, particularly the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CURATE\">curate</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARISH\">parish</a>, whenever there should be any appearance of a thunder-storm. At length the long-expected event arrived. On <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEDNESDAY\">Wednesday</a> the 10th of May 1752, between two and three in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFTERNOON\">afternoon</a>, Coifier heard a pretty loud clap of thunder. Immediately he ran to the machine, taking with him a vial furnished with a brafs wire; and presenting the wire to the end of the rod, a small spark issued from it with a snap like that of a spark from an electrified conductor. Stronger sparks were afterwards drawn, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of the curate and a number of other people. The curate's account of them was, that they were of a blue colour, an inch and a half in length, and smelled strongly of sulphur. In taking them, he received a stroke on his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a>, a little below the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELBOW\">elbow</a>; but he could not tell whether it came from the brafs wire inserted into the phial, or from the bar. He did not attend to it at the time, but the pain continuing, he uncovered his arm when he went home, in the presence of Coifier. A mark was perceived round it, such as might have been made with a blow of the wire on his naked skin.\n\nEight days after, Mr Delor witnessed the same appearances at his own house, though only a cloud passed over, without either thunder or lightning. His apparatus differed little from that of Mr Dalibard, except that his rod was 99 feet high, and answered rather better than that of the other gentleman. As it was found that only a small quantity of electric fluid could be collected by a single pointed rod, these experimentalists added to this apparatus a number of insulated iron bars, communicating with the pointed iron conductor, constituting what they called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGAZINE\">magazine</a> of electricity.\n\nDr Franklin having proved the identity of lightning and electricity, was desirous of ascertaining whether the electricity produced from the clouds was positive or negative. The first time he succeeded in making an experiment for this purpose, was on the 12th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 1753, when the lightning appeared to be negative. Having found that the clouds electrified negatively for eight successive thunder-gusts, he concluded that their electricity was always negative, and set about forming a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> to account for this. But he afterwards found he had concluded too soon. For on the sixth of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a> following, he met with one cloud which was electrified positively; upon which he corrected his former theory, but did not seem able perfectly to satisfy himself with any other. The Doctor sometimes found the clouds would change from positive to negative electricity several times in the course of one thunder-gust, and he once observed the air to be strongly electrified during a fall of snow, when there was no thunder at all.\n\nThe experiments of Dr Franklin and M. Dalibard, were soon known over all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, and the electricians of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a> were eager to participate in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> and satisfaction to be derived from such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> undertakings. M. M. Mazeas, Monnier, and de Roma in France, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANTON\">Canton</a> and Willon in England, and above all, Beccaria in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, made a number of interesting experiments on the electricity to be drawn from the clouds, and soon discovered that signs of electricity might be obtained, not only during thunder-storms, but almost at all times, and in every kind of weather. But before we relate these observations, we must conclude our present subject. We shall only here describe Dr Priestley's method of constructing a thunder-rod for making such observations.\n\n\"On the top of any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BUILDING\">building</a>, which will be the most convenient if it stand upon an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a>, erect a conducting pole as tall as a man can well manage, having on the top of it a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> piece of glass or baked wood a foot in length. Let this be covered with a tin or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a> vessel in the form of a funnel, to prevent its ever being wetted. Above this, let there rise a long slender rod, terminating in a pointed wire, and having a small wire twisted round its whole length, to conduct the electricity the better to the funnel. From the funnel make a wire descend along the building, about a foot distance from it, and be conducted through an open sash, into any room which shall be most convenient for making the experiments. In this room let a proper conductor be insulated, and connected with the wire coming in at the window. This wire and conductor, being completely insulated, will be electrified whenever there is a considerable quantity of electricity in the air; and notice will be given when it is properly charged, either...\"\nby Mr Canton's balls hung to it, or by a set of bells.\n\nSect. II. Of the Phenomena and Effects of Lightning.\n\nA thunder-storm commonly commences in the following manner. At first a low dense cloud begins to form in a part of the atmosphere which was previously clear; this cloud increases fast, but only from its upper part, and spreads into an arched form, appearing like a large heap of cotton wool. Its lower surface is generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a>, as if it reeled on a smooth <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>. The wind is all this time very gentle, and frequently it is imperceptible.\n\nNumberless small ragged clouds, like teazled flakes of cotton, soon begin to make their appearance, moving about in various directions, and perpetually changing their irregular surface, appearing to increase by gradual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a>. As they move about, they approach each other, and appear to stretch out their ragged arms towards each other; they do not often come in contact, but after approaching very near each other, they evidently recede, either in whole, or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENDING\">bending</a> away their ragged arms.\n\nWhile this irregular motion continues, the whole mass of small clouds gradually approaches towards the large cloud which first appeared, and with which they finally coalesce; frequently, however, uniting with each other into larger masses, before the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> coalescence takes place. The upper cloud often increases by accretion of fresh vapour, without any affluence from the smaller masses. When this happens, its lower surface, which was before level and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a>, becomes ragged, and stretches out its irregular tatters towards each other, and towards the earth. The clouds now thicken fast, moving about swiftly in all directions, and flashes of lightning are seen to dart from one cloud to another; the wind now rises or increases, generally blowing in squalls. The lightning becomes more frequent, striking between the clouds and the earth, often in two places at once; flashes of various shapes and various brilliancy are produced, and frequently a vast expanse of horizon appears in one blaze of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>. The thunder is now heard to roar at a distance, gradually approaching nearer, and soon succeeded by heavy rain.\n\nThe circumstances to be noticed as attending a thunder-storm, chiefly respect the form and colours of the lightning, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOUND\">sound</a> of the thunder, and the deviations produced when an explosion takes place between a cloud and some imperfectly conducting body on the surface of the earth.\n\nThe form of the flash is various, but in ordinary lightning it is generally angular, or zig-zag; this zig-zag is sometimes larger than at others, and in some instances the flash is divided into several distinct currents. These diversities might be expected from the heterogeneous nature, and various conducting power, of the several substances which float in our atmosphere. As these substances are placed in no certain order, the electric spark, in passing through the air, and striking successively from one of these bodies to another, as so many stepping stones irregularly placed, can seldom observe the same tract, and hence its zig-zag appearance.\n\nSometimes the flash appears as one dense <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> of fire, especially when it strikes from a cloud to any part of a building, when it is generally described as a globe of fire falling on the building.\n\nThe colours of the flash are also various; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> straw colours of colour, vivid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>, and various shades of blue, are the most prevailing tints. These various colours probably depend on the different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a> of the air through which the light has passed, or perhaps, on its different nature. We found, when relating the experiments of Mr Morgan on the appearance of the electric light in rarefied air, that its colour varied with the degree of rarity produced in the exhausted receiver; and from the experiments on passing the electric spark through various gases, we found that the colour of the light varied considerably with the nature of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAS\">gas</a> through which it passed.\n\nLightning very often appears without being succeeded by thunder, but we believe there is scarcely an instance where the latter is not preceded by the former; we say, scarcely an instance, for we have on record in the 77th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Philosophical Transactions, an account of a thunder-storm that happened on the banks of the Tweed in 1785, in which an explosion took place that killed a man and two horses, but was not preceded by any flash. The respectable recorder of this account, Mr Brydone, was not himself a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WITNESS\">witness</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a>, but could not learn from the persons whom he interrogated, (two Scotch peasants), who had seen the accident, that there was any preceding flash of lightning. In such singular circumstances, and with such doubtful authority, we should be disposed to suspend our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a>, and, until some similar instance better authenticated shall occur, to take it for granted, that a clap of thunder is always preceded by a flash of lightning.\n\nThe sound which attends the explosion of the lightning, varies according to the distance from which it is heard, and the nature of the country where the storm takes place. At a little distance, it is generally a hoarse grumbling noise, which appears to extend through a considerable part of the atmosphere, and gradually dies away. If it be heard very near, the crash is instantaneous, and exactly similar to the explosion of a cannon, when we are very near it at the time of its being fired.\n\nWhen the explosion begins very near, the snap begins with great sharpness, and for some time resembles the violent tearing of a piece of strong silk; but it becomes more mellow as it proceeds to a greater distance.\n\nIf the country where the storm happens be high and irregular, where there are numerous objects capable of reverberating the sound, the explosion consists of a long and broken succession of claps, the loudness of which varies more according to the nature and circumstances of the reverberating objects, than according to the length of time which intervenes between the claps. In a level and low country, where there is no diversity of reverberating objects, and particularly at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of explosions is regular, and their loudness decreases as the length of time increases.\n\nThe explosion of thunder differs from the snap produced by the electric spark, or even the explosion of a jar or a battery, not only in its degree of loudness, but\nin its nature; it is a long-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, rumbling, unequalable noise. The long-continued roar of thunder, is certainly owing to the commencement and termination of the explosion reaching our ears at different periods of time; and the unequally loud rumbling noise is owing to the different parts of the explosion striking the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> in a different manner.\n\nIt will not be improper here to mention the method by which the distance of a thunder-stroke may be ascertained. By observing the flash, and counting, by means of a watch with a second hand, the number of seconds which elapse between the appearance of the flash and the commencement of the roar, this may be easily effected; for we know that sound travels at the rate of 186,708 feet in a minute; by reducing the time observed between the flash and the report, into seconds, and allowing for each its proper number of feet, we obtain, with sufficient accuracy, the distance of the stroke from the place of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a>.\n\nTo understand the manner in which the explosion of thunder is produced, we must observe, that the air of the atmosphere is often arranged in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRATA\">strata</a>, and these strata are bounded by clouds. That the clouds are stratified, is very evident. From various causes, to be explained hereafter, these strata, or the opposite surfaces of a particular stratum, are possessed of opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of electricity, or the stratum becomes charged as the plate of air between the two coated boards, described in No. 235. Numerous experiments have proved, that during a thunder-form, there is a contemporaneous accumulation and deficiency of the electric fluid, or that there are two parts in the atmosphere, that are in the opposite states of positive and negative electricity. Hence we may easily conceive the nature of the explosion; for when the accumulation and deficiency, on the opposite surfaces of the stratum of air, have attained a certain height, a discharge must take place, similar to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> discharge of a Leyden phial.\n\nThe explosion commonly takes place in the heavens, and is merely the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESTORATION\">restoration</a> of the equilibrium between opposite clouds; but in some instances, the explosion happens between the clouds and the earth. In this latter case, it is believed by most electricians, that the earth is in the negative state; but Mr G. Morgan is of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that the deficiency is never in the earth, but in some other cloud to which an easier passage is found through so good a conductor as the wet earth, than through the air, which is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> conductor. Mr Morgan brings a great many arguments in support of his opinion, but for these we must refer to his lectures. It is of little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> to our present purpose, whether the deficiency is in the earth or in some adjacent cloud; it is sufficient to know, that lightning sometimes strikes from the cloud to the earth, or from the earth to the clouds. When this happens, and when the accumulated fluid comes in contact with any body that is an imperfect conductor, such as trees, buildings, &c., it produces those devastations which are sometimes the attendants of severe thunder-storms; these, therefore, we are now to consider.\n\nLightning, when it strikes a building, for the most part attacks the highest parts of it, as the chimneys, or spires, especially if they are surmounted by any metallic work, which is always the case with spires of churches, and not unfrequently on chimney-tops, where iron machines have been placed to prevent smoking. In most of the cases which have been recorded of spherical houses being damaged by lightning, it has entered by the chimney, down which it seems to be conducted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> and foot. Having entered the house, it commonly proceeds to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BELL\">bell</a> and nearest conductors in its passage, particularly bell-wires, gilt cornices, frames of pictures, and other gilded <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a>; these it commonly destroys, fusing, and very often oxidizing, the metal as it passes along. Some very remarkable instances are related of the power of lightning in fusing metals; we have heard of the fusion of bells, of large chains, and of iron conducting-rods near an inch in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>; but the authority on which these facts are related does not seem worthy of our implicit confidence. There are instances, however, sufficiently credible, where the pointed end of a conductor has been rounded, parts of leaden spouts melted, and the edge and point of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIFE\">knife</a> completely fused. But in general the bell wires of a house suffer the most; these are always shortened and very commonly melted in some parts; while in others, they are entirely dissipated in oxide, marks of which are very commonly visible on the walls.\n\nIt has been disputed, whether the fusion of metals by lightning be such a chemical fusion as is occasioned by fire, or what is called a cold fusion. Dr Franklin was of the latter opinion; the principal arguments for which, metals by arc, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a> has been melted in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>'s pocket, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> within its scabbard, without the pocket or scabbard being destroyed. We confess ourselves at a loss to conceive what is meant by a cold fusion, as we have no idea of a metallic body being fused at all, i.e., reduced into those globular forms which metals that have been subjected to the action of lightning and electricity usually assume, but by the power of a degree of heat, which would, when applied to bodies sufficiently inflammable, set these on fire.\n\nThat the explosion of lightning frequently does this, is sufficiently certain. In the ordinary cases, indeed, of fires to a building's being struck by lightning, inflammation does not ensue, because the parts of the building through which the fluid passes, are either in their nature very little inflammable, or are so hard and dense in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TEXTURE\">texture</a>, that they are not easily inflamed. But when the building attacked contains matters of a very combustible nature, such as hay, straw, and more especially gun-powder, a fire is very commonly the consequence; and accordingly, we every now and then hear of instances of stables being burned, and powder magazines blown up by lightning.\n\nWhen the lightning in its course meets with any obstruction, as in passing through a body which is an imperfect conductor, it overcomes this obstruction by forcing its passage through the resisting body; hence, we very commonly find large beams shattered, and stones and bricks either driven from their places, or split and perforated in an unequal manner. Frequently, the lightning will forsake one conducting body, as the handle of a bell-wire, and strike through the wall of the room, attracted by some conductor, either of greater power or larger dimensions, such as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KITCHEN\">kitchen</a> grate, on the other side. This effect of lightning is exactly similar to the perforation and rending of bodies by electricity, as we related when treating of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> effects of that power; it is undoubtedly owing to the sudden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPANSION\">expansion</a>\nof the air or moisture contained within the pores of the refilling body.\n\nWe have seen that animals are destroyed by lightning; but the effects of this power on the animal body come to be explained with more propriety in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> part of this work, where we shall treat of the effects of electricity on vegetable and animal life.\n\nWe shall here only relate the unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of the celebrated Professor Richman of St. Petersburg. This happened on the 6th of August 1753, as he was making experiments on lightning drawn into his own room. He had provided himself with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> for measuring the quantity of electricity communicated to his apparatus; and as he stood with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> inclined to it, Mr. Solokow an engraver, who was near him, observed a globe of blue fire, as big as his fist, jump from the instrument, which was about a foot distant, to Mr. Richman's head. The professor was instantly dead, and Mr. Solokow was also much hurt. The latter, however, could give no particular account of the way in which he was affected; for, at the time the professor was struck, there arose a sort of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEAM\">steam</a> or vapour, which entirely benumbed him, and made him sink down to the ground, so that he could not even remember to have heard the clap of thunder, which was a very loud one. The globe of fire was attended with an explosion like that of a pistol; the instrument for measuring the electricity (called by the professor an electrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GNOMON\">gnomon</a>) was broken to pieces, and the fragments thrown about the room. Upon examining the effects of the lightning in the professor's chamber, they found the door-case half split through, and the door torn off and thrown into the room. They opened a vein in the body twice, but no blood followed; after which, they endeavoured to recover life by violent friction, but in vain; upon turning the corpse with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACE\">face</a> downwards during the rubbing, an inconsiderable quantity of blood ran out of the mouth. There appeared a red spot on the forehead, from which spurted some drops of blood through the pores without wounding the skin. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHOE\">shoe</a> belonging to the left foot was burst open, and uncovering the foot at that part, they found a blue mark; from whence it was concluded, that the electric matter having entered at the head, made its way out again at that foot. Upon the body, particularly on the left side, were several red and blue spots, resembling leather shrunk by being burnt. Many more also became visible over the whole body, and particularly over the back. That upon the forehead changed to a brownish red, but the hair of the head was not fringed. In the place where the shoe was unstriped, the flocking was entire; as was the coat everywhere, the waistcoat only being fringed on the fore flap where it joined the hinder; but there appeared on the back of Mr. Solokow's coat long narrow streaks, as if red-hot wires had burned off the nap, and which could not well be accounted for.\n\nWhen the professor's body was opened next day, the cranium was very entire, having neither fissure nor contra-fissure; the brain was sound; but the transparent pellicles of the windpipe were excessively tender, and easily rent. There was some extravasated blood in it, as also in the cavities below the lungs. Those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> were quite sound; but those towards the back of a brownish black colour, and filled with more of the blood above mentioned. The throat, the glands, and the small intestines, were all inflamed. The fingered leathery-coloured spots penetrated the skin only. In 48 hours the body was so much corrupted, that they could scarcely get it into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COFFIN\">coffin</a>.\n\nFrom the dangers to which persons and buildings are distance at exposed from lightning, it becomes an object of importance to ascertain the distance at which they may be considered as secure from its influence. The following dangerous observations of Mr. G. Morgan on this subject are related with ingenuity and good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>.\n\n\"The greatest danger of a thunder-storm lies between Morgan's two nearest extremities of the correspondent parts of the charged atmosphere, or in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> of un-electrified air which is always found to separate the positive from the negative portion of the loaded cloud: but on either side of this interval, the further you get into the positive or the negative, the more does the power of injuring diminish.\n\n\"The idea which I now wish to impress, will be illustrated by the following circumstances of fact.\n\n\"Take a Leyden phial, five inches in diameter, and thirteen or fourteen inches in height. On the inside, let the coating rise till its upper edge be two inches and a half from the rim of the vessel. On the outside, let the coating rise no higher than one inch from the bottom. When the phial is thus coated, let it be charged, and a spark will pass from the tin-foil on the outside to that on the inside; but its form will resemble that of a tree, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUNK\">trunk</a> will increase in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGNITUDE\">magnitude</a> and brilliancy, and consequently in power, as it approaches the edge, owing to ramifications which it collects from all parts of the glass. Within two inches of the edge it becomes one body or stream, and along that interval its greatest force acts.\n\n\"When two clouds, or the two correspondent parts of a cloud, have their equilibrium restored by a discharge, the appearances are exactly similar to those of the preceding experiment. Each extremity of the flash is formed by a multitude of little streams, which gather into one body, whose power is undivided in that interval only which separates the positive from the negative.\n\n\"In this country these appearances are frequently seen; but they are most commonly hidden by intervening clouds. While I was passing over Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-JURA\">Jura</a>, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a> during a thunder-storm, the flashes succeeded each other so rapidly, that about thirty struck within each minute, but owing to the height of my situation at that time, not one of them appeared otherwise than partially or generally, according to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> I have just given. Sometimes a lower cloud would hide one of the two charged parts, and in this case the lightning assumed the form of a tree, whose trunk and branches only appeared. Sometimes the trunk was hidden, and then the ramifications on each side were alone visible. Frequently intervening clouds would hide all but the trunk, and the lightning then appeared as it commonly does to a spectator in a low situation.\n\n\"It must be obvious from the preceding statement of circumstances, that the greatest deviation of lightning must take place in that interval through which the whole body of the fluid passes, and that as you penetrate further and further into the cloud, the stream that is formed becomes less and less, like a river which diminishes...\"\nnithes by entwining itself as you approach its fountain. Hence to us placed on the ground, no danger can ever occur, till the clouds are so low, that the striking distance through air, or the aerial interval between the charged parts, resists the passage more powerfully than the body of earth, and any additional portion of atmosphere which may lie in the direction of the earth from the striking interval.\n\n\"If the charged cloud lies in contact with the ground, its passage to the earth will be that of several streams, and the danger will be great, in proportion to the magnitude of these separate stream which passes through any given part of the earth; and several distinct situations may be thus unequally endangered at the same time. Hence it happens, that the same stroke will frequently injure several distinct buildings, which are very near to each other, and that different degrees of injury are always observed in the different tracts.\n\n\"The striking distance, or the length of the interval of greatest danger, will vary with the height of the charge, and not with the dimensions of the charged body. This is clear from a multitude of facts already illustrated and applied. We may hence safely conclude, that the longer any charged cloud is in the vicinity of the wet ground, the more will the length, and consequently the danger, of its striking distance be diminished, provided the points and prominences, which are active on the ground, discharge the fluid more abundantly than it is accumulated by the producing cause.\n\n\"From what I have already said, it is clear that all the parts of the circuit, through which a thunder cloud may discharge its contents, are not equally dangerous, and that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAXIMUM\">maximum</a> of danger is confined within much narrower limits than those of the interval, within which it may be felt in one inferior degree or another. You must however perceive, that as the cloud enlarges, the number of additions increases, by which the great body of the flash is formed, and that the length of the most dangerous interval will always increase with, and bear a certain proportion to, the diameter of the cloud. In our attempts to estimate this diameter, we may follow two methods, which have been recommended; but I cannot say that either of these methods has any great pretensions to accuracy.\n\n\"1st, If you <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> the space on which the thunder-shower falls, it is said that you measure what is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMENSURABLE\">commensurable</a> with the dimensions of the thunder-cloud. In a mountainous country this measurement is very possible; for the body of the shower may be seen at a small distance, well described upon the elevated grounds whose parts it separates from the eye. Its diameter, therefore, may be correctly estimated from the distance of those well known objects by which it is bounded. Those thunder-showers, which I have observed, have varied in their diameter, from five hundred yards to two miles. It is, however, to be observed, that the partial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a>, produced by the collapse attending the removal of the electric fluid, may extend its influence to a greater distance, and cause the fall of rain, by rarefying the atmosphere, far beyond the bounds of the charged cloud.\n\n\"2dly, The velocity of a cloud may be known by measuring its height, and the time which any fixed appearance in it takes to describe a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a>. This may be done in a very small portion of time, and when it is done, you are next to watch the moment at which it begins to affect your elevated conductor, and with equal accuracy you are to mark the evanescence of its signs. The knowledge of these circumstances, united with that of the cloud's velocity, will correctly determine its dimensions.\n\n\"From a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIARY\">diary</a> in my possession, made by Mr. Brook, it does not appear that the same electricity ever lasted more than fifteen minutes. When the symptoms of approaching thunder were decisive, the opposite electricity generally lasted as long, and the interval of time between the two electrics seldom exceeded one-tenth of the whole.\n\n\"If we allow, that the cloud in this case moved at the rate of eight or ten miles in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, its diameter must have been four miles. However, in many instances, all the above-mentioned changes of electricity took place in two minutes. This happened several times successively, and each series of changes terminated by a flash of lightning. In all instances of this kind, to make the diameter of the cloud half a mile, we must suppose that it moves at the rate of thirty miles an hour; and in such a case, one-tenth of the whole, or the interval of greatest danger, would not exceed a hundred and eighty yards. But on the supposition that the size of the cloud were such as to strike over the distance of two miles, many are the circumstances which, on its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> towards the ground will encroach upon its offensive powers, change its direction, or decrease and perhaps altogether annihilate its violence.\n\n\"1. Innumerable points and prominences rise from the whole surface of the earth over which it hangs. These <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> as so many channels, through which its contents will find a rapid evacuation. In the power of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> off the fluid gradually, I have been able to discover but little difference between partial and metallic conductors. It should be added, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a> through an elevated wire is such, when the cloud approaches it, as would discharge a battery, whose surface equalled four or five acres, in twenty or thirty seconds. When, therefore, millions of other conductors are acting with equal effect at the same moment, that must be an immense cloud indeed, whose striking distance in such circumstances is not much lessened, or whose striking powers are not altogether exhausted.\n\n\"2. Metals alone conduct the fluid better than charged surfaces. If a plate of glass, coated on one side with tin-foil, be charged and placed in a circuit, so that the contents of a jar may pass over the other side uncoated, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> striking distance will be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRUPLE\">quadruple</a> what it is in air. Such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> of changes as that which I have now described must frequently occur in the upper regions of the atmosphere; for the charged clouds must lie in strata above each other; and in the varieties of their motions, produced by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> attractions, and by the innumerable causes which affect their different currents, they must be perpetually serving as discharging-rods to one another. We consequently find that nine hundred and ninety-nine flashes out of a thousand, strike from cloud to cloud through the intervening air.\"\n\nSevere shocks have been sometimes experienced from...\na flash of lightning, when the person or building struck has been at a very considerable distance from the cloud in which the discharge appeared to take place. A person at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIENNA\">Vienna</a> received a terrible shock from a thunder-rod, on which his hand reeled during an explosion that happened at the distance of three miles from the place where the conductor was erected; and it is supposed that a shock might be felt, or even a person killed, at a distance \"prodigiously greater.\" It is certain that during a thunder-storm, the insulated conductor is affected at every explosion, however great, so as to emit sparks.\n\nIt is supposed by most electricians that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> stroke is adequate to the production of these effects, and they have therefore had recourse to what Lord Stanhope calls the returning stroke. The following is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol2.html#article-ABRIDGMENT\">abridgment</a> of this theory.\n\nLet PC, fig. 122, represent a conductor charged positively; and AB a conductor in its natural state, placed so that one of its extremities A may just enter the atmosphere of PC. In this case, Lord Stanhope says, that the superabundance of PC will cause some of the natural share of AB to pass from A to B, where it is stopped and accumulated. By this change A is left in a different or negative state, and B by the addition it has received becomes positive. But when the superabundance at P is taken off, the positive fluid at B rushes back to its natural place at A, and this restoration is called the returning stroke.\n\nAgain, let us suppose PC to be negative; and A placed as before just within its atmosphere. Now part of the fluid in AB will rush from B to A, and there being stopped will produce an accumulation; but when PC is discharged, this accumulation will disappear, and the returning stroke will be from A to B.\n\nTo apply this to the present case. Let us suppose two clouds horizontally distant, A and B (in the annexed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DIAGRAM\">diagram</a>), the one A electrified positively and the other B negatively, to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> over the surface of the earth at a and b; they will here tend to produce the opposite states, or the part of the surface a will be negative and b positive. If now a discharge take place between the clouds A and B, the fluid will rush back from b to a; and if conductors are fixed at these places, the fluid will rush down the conductors at b, and up that at a. The same effects, though in a less degree, will be produced, if we suppose the negative cloud B placed above the positive cloud A.\n\nBy this theory, Lord Stanhope undertook to explain how the man and two horses were killed in the thunder-storm described by Mr Brydone, and his Lordship presented a very able paper on this subject to the Royal Society.\n\nThis theory of Lord Stanhope has been well received, and it is no small testimony in its favour that it has obtained the support of so able a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> as Professor Robison. Mr G. Morgan, however, strenuously objects to this theory, on the very serious grounds that its principle is erroneous, its effects overrated, and its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> unnecessary. Our limits will not permit us to detail all Mr Morgan's objections, but we must confess they do not convince us of the fallacy of the theory, although they certainly tend to invalidate the effects attributed to the returning stroke.\n\n\"Let us allow,\" says Mr Morgan, \"that the force required by the theory is rendered active in the manner which I have just described, what reason have we for believing that it would be active to the degree supposed? Lord Stanhope has estimated, that what is effects separated from our natural share without injuring us, and the return may be absent for hours without being felt, is so great in quantity as to destroy us by its motion in returning. But what are the grounds of this estimate? As yet it has been justified by no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPEAL\">appeal</a>, either to fact or experiment; and the person who could say, that the greatest possible loss from our natural share is little or nothing, would certainly stand upon equal, I think rather better, grounds, than those who would make it adequate to the fusion of metals and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> of life. I would add, that when the power of the returning stroke is magnified as it is in this theory, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RATIONALE\">rationale</a> of this bold estimate is not only neglected, but it is neglected where it might have been made without much trouble.\n\n\"If the returning stroke of a thunder-cloud will destroy large edifices, surely artificial electricity could produce a similar stroke which would destroy a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> or a mouse, or act on some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCALE\">scale</a> analogous to that which it is said to resemble. If, I say, the returning stroke in nature will melt the irons of a waggon wheel, surely, with the grand machines which we are now able to construct, such a returning stroke might be caused as would melt a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CAPILLARY\">capillary</a> thread of metal. But nothing of this kind has ever been done or attempted by those who support the theory, and I am bold enough to prophecy, from the details of my own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>, that nothing of the kind ever will be done.\"\n\nSect. III. Of the means of preventing Accidents from Lightning.\n\nIt has been well observed, that knowledge is invaluable chiefly in proportion as it is useful; a maxim of conduct which no man ever exemplified better than Dr Franklin against lightning. No sooner was the real nature of lightning ascertained by experiment, than it was naturally suggested to Franklin that this grand discovery might be rendered beneficial to mankind, by affording means for preserving buildings from the formerly inevitable devastations of that powerful instrument of nature. Here too, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> of Franklin led the way; and as he certainly deserves the greatest share of the merit due to the discovery of the identity of lightning and electricity, we are also chiefly indebted to him for the means of applying this knowledge to advantage. He was led to propose the use of pointed metallic conductors attached to the building, as a security against the effects of lightning; and this proposal, like most of Dr Franklin's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> contrivances in electricity, was the result at once of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACUTE\">acute</a> reasoning and accurate observation.\n\nDr Franklin considered the earth as performing the office of a conductor, in restoring to the atmosphere the ions for electrical equilibrium, that had been disturbed by the conflagrations which tend to produce atmospherical electricity. In its course, he observes, that the lightning will commonly strike the best conductors; and accordingly, as a metallic rod is a much more perfect conductor than the stones, bricks, &c., of which buildings are chiefly composed, the lightning will strike the rod in preference.\n\nChap. I.\n\nAtmospheric Electricity.\n\nRequisites to be observed.\n\nShould be of the best conductors.\n\nShould be of sufficient diameter, and perfectly continuous.\n\nThunder-houfe.\n\nence to the materials of the building. He therefore advised, that a metallic rod should be fixed to some part of the building, penetrating for some distance into the moist earth, and, as lightning does not in every case strike the highest parts of a building, that the rod should extend for some feet above these, in order, as it were, to solicit the lightning. As lightning has been found to destroy metallic rods of a considerable diameter, he advises, that these conductors should be at least half an inch thick, that they may the better resist the destructive power of the lightning.\n\nFrom a comparison of numerous experiments and observations, the following rules have been laid down for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of conductors.\n\n1. That the rods be made of such substances as are in their nature the best conductors of electricity.\n\nIt is found that all metals do not conduct equally well, and that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> and copper are the best fitted to serve as conductors against lightning; but as lead is exceedingly destructible by electricity, and therefore would require to be of a very considerable diameter, copper is to be preferred, as well on account of its greater conducting power, as from its being less liable to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> rust than iron, which is commonly employed.\n\n2. That the rods be of a sufficient diameter.\n\n3. That they be perfectly uninterrupted, or, if formed of several pieces, that their junctions be as nearly in contact as possible.\n\nThe effect of interruptions in conductors, as well as the effects of lightning in general on buildings, may be illustrated by the following experiments.\n\nExper. 1.\u2014Fig. 123. shews an instrument representing the side of a house, either furnished with a metallic conductor, or not; by which both the bad effects of lightning striking upon a house not properly secured, and the usefulness of metallic conductors, may be clearly represented. A is a board about three-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of an inch thick, and shaped like the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GABLE\">gable</a> end of a house. This board is fixed perpendicularly upon the bottom board B, upon which the perpendicular glass pillar CD is also fixed, in a hole about eight inches distant from the basis of the board A. A square hole, LMK, about a quarter of an inch deep, and nearly one inch wide, is made in the board A, and is filled with a square piece of wood, nearly of the same dimensions. We say nearly of the same dimensions, because it must go so easily into the hole, that it may drop off by the least shaking of the instrument. A wire, LK, is fastened diagonally to this square piece of wood. Another wire, IH, of the same thickness, having a brass ball, H, screwed on its pointed extremity, is fastened upon the board A; so also is the wire MN, which is looped in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a> at O.\n\nFrom the upper extremity of the glass pillar CD, a crooked wire proceeds, having a spring socket F, through which a double-knobbed wire slips perpendicularly, the lower knob G of which falls just above the knob H. The glass pillar DC must not be made very fast into the bottom board; but it must be fixed so as to be pretty easily moved round its own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a>, by which means the brass ball G may be brought nearer or farther from the ball H, without touching the part of EFG. Now when the square piece of wood LMIK (which may represent the shutter of a window or the like) is fixed into the hole so, that the wire LK stands in the dotted representation IM, then the metallic communication from H to O is complete, and the instrument represents a house furnished with a proper metallic conductor; but if the square piece of wood LMIK is fixed so, that the wire LK stands in the direction LK, as represented in the figure, then the metallic conductor HO, from the top of the house to its bottom, is interrupted at IM, in which case the house is not properly secured.\n\nFix the piece of wood LMIK, so that its wire may be as represented in the figure, in which case the metallic conductor HO is discontinued. Let the ball G be fixed at about half an inch perpendicular distance from the ball H, then, by turning the glass pillar DC, remove the former ball from the latter: by a wire or chain connect the wire EF with the wire Q of the jar P, and let another wire or chain, fastened to the hook O, touch the outside coating of the jar. Connect the wire Q with the prime conductor, and charge the jar; then, by turning the glass pillar DC, let the ball G come gradually near the ball H, and when they are arrived sufficiently near one another, you will observe that the jar explodes, and the piece of wood, LMIK, is pushed out of the hole to a considerable distance from the thunder-house. Now the ball G, in this experiment, represents an electrified cloud; which, when it is arrived sufficiently near the top of the house A, the electricity strikes it, and, as this house is not secured with a proper conductor, the explosion breaks part of it, i.e., knocks off the piece of wood IM.\n\nRepeat the experiment with only this variation, viz., that this piece of wood IM is situated so, that the wire LK may stand in the situation IM; in which case the conductor HO is not discontinued; and you will observe, that the explosion will have no effect upon the piece of wood LMIK; this remaining in the hole unmoved; which shews the usefulness of the metallic conductor.\n\nFurther: Unscrew the brass ball H from the wire HI, so that this may remain pointed, and, with this difference only in the apparatus, repeat both the above experiments; and you will find that the piece of wood IM is in neither case moved from its place, nor any explosion will be heard; which demonstrates the preference of conductors with pointed terminations to those with blunted ones.\n\nExper. 2.\u2014This apparatus is sometimes made in the powder-shape of a house, as represented fig. 124, where, for the house's sake of distinctness, the side and part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a> next the eye are not represented. The gable end AC represents that of the thunder-house, and may be used in the same manner with that above described, or more readily by the following method. Let one ball of the discharging rod touch the ball of the charged jar, and the other the knob A of the conductor AC of the thunder-house; the jar will then of course explode, and the fluid will act upon the conductor just mentioned. The conducting wire at the windows HH must be placed in a line. The sides and gable AC of the house are connected with the bottom by hinges; and the building is kept together by a ridge on the roof. To use this model, fill the small tube a with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, and ram the wire c a little way into the tube; then connect the tube e with the bottom of a large jar or battery. When the jar is charged, form a communication from the hook at C, on the outside, to the top of the jar, by discharging.\ndischarging the rod; the discharge will fire the powder, and the explosion of the latter will throw off the roof, with the sides, back and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FRONT\">front</a>, so that they will all fall down together. The figures f and g in the side of the house represent a small ramrod for the tube a, and a pricker for the touch-hole at C.\n\nMr Jones of Holborn makes the front of the common thunder-houses, as well as the powder-house above described, with two pieces of wood or windows h h, which, by being placed in proper situations, the one to conduct and the other to reflect the fluid, will illustrate by one discharge the usefulness of good conductors for securing buildings or magazines from the explosion of thunder, as well as the danger of using imperfect ones.\n\nExper. 3.\u2014Fig. 125 represents a wooden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a>, made in several pieces, with a wire through each, so that their ends may touch, as at s s s. Let one corner of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEDESTAL\">pedestal</a> d be loose, and have the safety wire pass almost but not quite through it. Let the wire passing through the rest of the pedestal join by a chain the outside coating of a Leyden phial. If the cloud x be supported by a wire from the prime conductor, and hang half an inch from the knob q of the pyramid; when the phial is discharged, a spark will take place between x and g; the spark will pass along the wires s s s, till it comes to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> at d; there an explosion will take place, that will drive out the corner-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a> d, and overthrow the fabric.\n\nAbundant observation has proved the danger of having discontinuous conductors either attached to a building, or forming part of the materials. About the middle of the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, the steeple of St <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRIDE\">Bride</a>'s <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHURCH\">church</a> in London was struck by lightning, and greatly injured. In the construction of this steeple a great deal of iron work had been employed; the stones having been fastened together in many places by iron cramps, the ends of which were covered with small stones. The lightning seems first to have struck the vane of the spire, from which it was safely conducted down the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SHAFT\">shaft</a> by which the vane was supported; from the extremity of this shaft, it leaped to two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> iron bars which were at the base of the obelisk, shattering the obelisk in its way. Hence it passed to one of the above mentioned cramps, and thus from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CRAMP\">cramp</a> to cramp throwing out or demolishing the stones as it passed along.\n\nThe principles of electricity afford us an easy explanation of the manner in which the interruption of conductors acts. We know that at the extremity of all long rods there is a considerable accumulation of electricity, and this has here a tendency to fly off with great force, especially if there is another conductor at hand. This other conductor also assists the accumulation in the former by acquiring at its adjacent extremity the opposite electricity. Supposing a positive cloud to be over the upper conductor, this conductor will be electrified positively at its lower extremity, and this accumulation being increased by the negative electricity of the upper and of the lower conductor, will tend to fly off with great violence into the air, or if any obstruction oppose its passage, this will be removed by the bursting or displacing the resisting body.\n\n4. It is necessary that the connection between the conductor and the common stock, or the earth, be as complete as possible.\n\nIt has been said, that the lower extremity of the conductor should be inserted some feet below the surface of the ground; it is also proper that it should be turned in a direction away from the foundation; and as moisture is one of the best conductors, it would be advisable, where this can conveniently be done, to connect the extremity of the metallic rod with some neighbouring piece of water.\n\n5. That the rod be carried from the top of the building to the common stock in the shortest convenient direction, as straight as possible.\n\n6. That the upper extremity be finely tapered, and terminative in a sharp smooth point.\n\nThere is no question in electricity, that has been argued with more keenness, than whether thunder-rods pointed should terminate in a sharp point, or in a round ball. Dr Franklin, we have seen, decidedly gave the preference to a pointed conductor, and he has been followed by most of the electricians of Europe; Dr Wilson standing almost alone in support of the round ball. This controversy was renewed with great warmth on the occasion of a house at Purfleet belonging to the board of ordnance, having been struck by lightning, although guarded by a pointed conductor. A set of very ingenious experiments were made, both by Mr Nairne and Dr Wilson, to estimate the comparative merits of pointed and obtuse conductors; but by these the question was not decided; Mr Nairne's experiments always concluding in favour of pointed conductors, while those of Dr Wilson as constantly favoured the obtuse termination. Most electricians, however, still prefer the pointed conductor.\n\nLet B (fig. 126) represent the position of a charged cloud; A, the part that is oppositely charged, or that is connected with it; FG a pointed wire. In this case, the electric fluid must pass either through the series of partial conductors, a, b, c, &c., or through the body of earth, AF.\n\nNow when, on the one hand, we consider the dryness of that foil which is generally selected for the foundation of buildings, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> there is that nothing but the foil, thus dry, may separate A from the wire FG, and the certainty that if water should connect A and FG, its resistance is very considerable; when, on the other hand, we take into consideration, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAILS\">nails</a>, bolts, iron bars, strips of lead, bell wires, and metallic utensils that are scattered through all buildings, we shall, I think, perceive the much greater probability there is of the lightning's passing through a, b, c, d, &c., to the cloud, than of its passage through the ground.\n\n2. Let us erect another wire, HI, and fill the danger is almost as great; for now the possible circuits of the lightning are four, and of those, that leading through the house appears to be the easiest; if HI convey it harmlessly, then it must pass through the body of the air FG, or over the roof of the house. We well know from past experiments, that the insulating power of the air makes the resistance in the direction IG very considerable; and even on the supposition that j were wet, the resistance over the roof of the house is not much considerable. If the house were covered or coped with lead, the probability of a stroke would then be diminished, but not taken away; for, suppose the easiest circuit should lie in the direction KM, then, rather than pass through the body of earth HK, or FK, it might\nmight find an easier passage through the house than either of the conductors. This would not be the case, if a strip of lead, or metallic substance of any kind, extended from K to H, and from K to F. \"I hence thought,\" says Mr Morgan, \"at one time, that a house would be perfectly safe, if a strip of lead were carried around the top, and all the bottom of the building, and then connected by two or three metallic strips extending from the one to the other.\n\n\"Let us suppose that a house were erected over a stratum of moisture, or any other conducting substance, which dipped considerably, at a little distance from the house, and then suddenly rose just below it; in that case, if the stratum became the circuit of a charge, the stroke would rise immediately in the centre or body of the house, and in all directions would force its way with devastation, towards the conductors on the outside.\"\n\nTo prevent all possible danger, Mr G. Morgan proposes, that, while the house is building, the foundation of each partition wall be laid on a strip of lead, or that such a strip be fastened to the sides of these partition walls. The strips should be two inches wide, and at least a quarter of an inch thick, and they should be closely connected with each other. A perpendicular strip on each side of the house, should rise from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of conductors, to the surface of the ground; whence a strip should be continued round all the house, and carefully connected with water-pipes, &c. The strips on the sides of the house, should then be continued to the roof, which should be guarded in the same manner as the foundation. The top should be surrounded by a strip, whose connection should spread over every edge and prominence, and should continue to the summit of each separate chimney. It is particularly necessary to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> the chimneys; for Mr Morgan was witness to a case, in which a house that had been guarded, in most respects, according to the foregoing directions, except that the chimneys were unprotected, was struck with lightning which entered by one of the chimneys; here it spent its fury; but the chimney falling on the roof, did considerable damage.\n\nThe principal objection to this method, is the expense attending it; but this may be, in a great measure avoided, by making proper use of the leaden pipes, gutters, and copings, which belong to most houses.\n\nShips, from the height and construction of their masts, and from their being such inflated conducting objects as must necessarily attract the lightning from a cloud that is very near, are peculiarly exposed to danger. It is, therefore, still more necessary to guard vessels by proper conductors. Chains are very commonly employed for this purpose, from their being more conveniently disposed among the rigging; but it is found, that from the want of continuity in the links, chains are very imperfect conductors, and have not unfrequently been broken by a severe shock. Strips of lead, are therefore, to be preferred, both as they are cheaper, and less liable to be injured by the weather and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> water, than iron chains. One strip should surround the deck, and another the bottom or side of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KEEL\">keel</a>, and these should be connected with other strips, embracing the ship in various parts. If the ship be copper-bottomed, it will only be necessary to connect the copper with the deck; but in every case, a strip should\n\nVol. VII, Part II.\nprevent our being injured by the splinters of wood, if the tree should be strucken. It is particularly necessary to avoid rivers and brooks, as these are excellent conductors.\n\nPerhaps the best protection in the open air, is a carriage made so large, as that a person may fit in it at a distance from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TIDES\">tides</a>, especially if it be surrounded at the top and bottom with metallic fillets connected with each other by a strip of the same substance.\n\nIf overtaken in a storm, it is safer to be completely wet than dry.\n\n**CHAP. II. Experiments and Observations on the Spontaneous Electricity of the Atmosphere.**\n\nThe first person who observed the spontaneous electricity of the atmosphere, was M. Momnier, who found that even when there was no appearance of lightning, some degree of electricity might generally be observed in the atmosphere. His experiments were made at St Germaine en Laye, and published in a memoir read at the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris in 1752.\n\nBut more accurate experiments were made upon the electricity of the air by the abb\u00e9 Mazeas, at Chateau de <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAINTENON\">Maintenon</a>, during the months, June, July, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a>, of 1753, and communicated to the Royal Society in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a> to Dr Hales.\n\nThe abb\u00e9's apparatus consisted of an iron rod, 370 feet long, raised 90 feet above the horizon. It came down from a very high room in the castle, where it was fastened to a silk <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> fixed feet long; and was carried from thence to the steeple of the town, where it was likewise fastened to another silk cord of eight feet long, and sheltered from rain. From the extremity of this rod, a large key was suspended to receive the electric fluid.\n\nWhen he began his experiments, viz. on the 17th of June, the electricity of the air was sensibly felt every day, from sunrise till seven or eight in the evening, except in moist weather, when he could perceive no signs of electricity. In dry weather, the rod attracted minute bodies at no greater distance than three or four lines. He repeated the experiment carefully every day, and constantly observed, that in weather void of storms, the electricity of a piece of sealing wax of two inches long, was above twice as strong as that of the air. This observation inclined him to conclude, that in weather of equal dryness, the electricity of the air was always equal.\n\nIt did not appear to him that hurricanes and tempests increased the electricity of the air, when they were not accompanied with thunder; for that during three days of a very violent continual wind in July, he was obliged to put some dust within four or five lines of the conductor, before any sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> could be perceived.\n\nNo sensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERATION\">alteration</a> in the electricity of the air was observed under different directions of the winds, except when these were moist.\n\nHe could observe no electricity in the air during the driest nights of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a>, but it returned in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> with the sun, disappearing again soon after sunrise.\n\nThe strongest common electricity of the atmosphere during that summer, was observed in July, on a very dry, clear, warm day.\n\nOn the 27th of June about noon, he perceived some stormy clouds rising above the horizon, and observed that the electricity of the atmosphere occasioned by them, was increased as the clouds reached the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZENITH\">zenith</a>. He at this time drew considerable sparks from his apparatus, though there was neither thunder nor lightning.\n\nThe electricity observed during the appearance of these stormy clouds, was not diminished by a very heavy rain, till the clouds began to dissipate.\n\nMr Kinnerley observed, that when the air was in its driest state, there was always a quantity of electricity in it, and which might be easily drawn from it. This, he says, may be proved by a person in the negative state of electricity extending his arm into the air in the dark while holding a pointed needle in his hand; this, however, can only be observed when the air is very dry.\n\nWhether the electricity in the air, in clear dry weather, be of the same density at the height of two or three hundred yards, as on the surface of the earth, Mr Kinnerley thought might be easily ascertained by Dr Franklin's old experiment with the kite. The twine, he says, should have throughout a very small wire in it, and the ends of the wire, where the several lengths are united, ought to be tied down with a waxed thread, to prevent their acting in the manner of points.\n\nMr Canton made several ingenious experiments on atmospheric electricity, by means of his pith-ball electrometer, described in No. 66. According to this philosopher, desiccated atmospheric air, when heated, becomes negatively electric, and when cooled, the electricity is of the positive kind, even when the air is not permitted to expand or contract; and the expansion or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of atmospheric air occasions changes in its electrical state.\n\nBut no electrician, in the earlier stage of the science, Beccaria, conducted his observations in this way with greater accuracy, or purified them farther than Sig. Beccaria. He observed, that, during very high winds, his apparatus gave no signs of being electrified. Indeed he found, that in three different states of the atmosphere, he could find no electricity in the air: viz. in windy and clear weather; in weather when the sky was covered with distinct and black clouds, that had a slow motion; in moist weather, not actually raining. In a clear sky, when the weather was calm, he always perceived signs of a moderate electricity, but interrupted. In rainy weather without lightning, his apparatus was always electrified a short time before the rain fell, and during the time of the rain, but it ceased to be affected a little before the rain was over.\n\nThe higher his rods reached or his kites flew, the stronger signs they gave of electricity. Also longer strings and cords, extended and insulated in the open air, acquired electricity sooner than those which were shorter. A cord 1500 Paris feet long, stretched across the river Po, was strongly electrified during a shower without thunder, as a metallic rod, employed to bring lightning into his house, had been in any thunderstorm.\n\nHaving\nHaving two rods for bringing the lightning into his house, 140 feet afar, he observed, that if he took a spark from the higher of these, the spark from the other, which was 30 feet lower, was at that instant lessened; but its power again revived, though he kept his hand upon the former.\n\nHe imagined that the electricity communicated to the air might sometimes furnish small sparks to his apparatus; since the air parts with the electricity it has received very slowly, and therefore the equilibrium of the electric fluid in the air, will not be restored so soon as in the earth and clouds.\n\nAmong the effects of a moderate electricity in the atmosphere, Signor Beccaria considers rain, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a>, and snow.\n\nClouds that bring rain, he thought, were produced in the same manner as thunder-clouds, only by a more moderate electricity.\n\nHe notes several circumstances attending rain without lightning, which make it very probable, that it is produced by the same cause as when it is accompanied with lightning. Light has been seen among the clouds by night in rainy weather; and even by day, rainy clouds are sometimes seen to have a brightness evidently independent of the sun. The uniformity with which the clouds are spread, and with which the rain falls, he thought were evidences of a uniform cause, like that of electricity. The intensity of electricity in his apparatus, generally corresponded very nearly to the quantity of rain that fell in the same time.\n\nSometimes all the phenomena of thunder, lightning, hail, rain, snow and wind, have been observed at one time; which shews the connection they all have with some common cause.\n\nSignor Beccaria supposes, therefore, that previous to rain, a small quantity of electric fluid escapes out of the earth, in some place where there was a redundancy of it; and in its ascent to the higher regions of the air, collects and conducts into its path a great quantity of vapours. The same cause that collects will condense them more and more, till in the places of the nearest intervals they come almost into contact, so as to form small drops, which uniting with others as they fall, come down in rain. The rain will be heavier in proportion as the electricity is more vigorous, and the cloud approaches more nearly to a thunder cloud.\n\nHe imitated the appearance of clouds that bring rain, by inflating himself between the rubber and conductor of his electrical machine, and with one hand dropping colophonium into a spoon fastened to the conductor, and holding a burning coal, while his other hand communicated with the rubber. In these circumstances, the smoke spread along his arm, and by degrees all over his body, till it came to the other hand that communicated with the rubber. The lower surface of this smoke was everywhere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to his clothes, and the upper surface was swelled and arched like clouds replete with thunder and rain. In this manner, he supposed, the clouds that bring rain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFUSE\">diffuse</a> themselves from over those parts of the earth which abound with the electric fluid, to those parts that are exhausted of it; and by letting fall their rain, restore the equilibrium between them.\n\nThis ingenious philosopher supposes hail to be formed in the higher regions of the air, where the cold is intense, and where the electric fluid is very copious.\n\nIn these circumstances a great number of particles of water are brought near together, where they are frozen, and in their descent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> other particles, so that the density of the substance of the hailstone grows less and less from the centre; this being formed first in the higher region, and the surface being collected on the lower. Agreeable to this it is observed, that in mountains, hailstones, as well as drops of rain, are very small; there being but small space through which to fall and thereby increase their bulk. Drops of rain and hail also agree in this circumstance, that the more intense is the electricity that forms them, the larger they are.\n\nClouds of snow differ in nothing from clouds of rain, but in the circumstance of cold which freezes them. Both the regular diffusion of snow, and the regularity in the structure of its particles, shew the clouds of snow to be actuated by some uniform cause like electricity. All these conjectures about the cause of hail and snow were confirmed by observing, that his apparatus never failed to be electrified by snow, as well as by rain.\n\nA more intense electricity unites the particles of hail more closely, than the more moderate electricity does those of snow. In like manner, we see thunder clouds more dense than those that merely bring rain, and the drops of rain are larger in proportion, though they often fall not from so great a height.\n\nMr Romayne observed, that the air in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRELAND\">Ireland</a> was generally electrified in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOG\">fog</a>, and even in a mist, and that both day and night, but principally in winter; Romayne seldom in summer, except from positive clouds or cool fogs. The electricity of the air in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FROST\">frost</a> or fog is always positive. He says, that he has often observed, during what seemed the puffing of one cloud, successive changes from negative to positive, and from positive to negative. It may be remarked that most fogs have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SMELL\">smell</a> like an excited glass tube.\n\nMr Henly has shewn, that fogs are more strongly electrified in or immediately after a frost than at other times; and that the electricity of fogs is often the strongest soon after their appearance. Whenever there appears a thick fog, and at the same time the air is sharp and frothy, that fog is strongly electrified positively.\n\nThough rain is not an immediate cause, yet Mr Henly is inclined to consider it as a remote consequence of atmospherical electricity; and he generally found, that in two or three days after he had discovered the air to be strongly electrified, there was either rain or snow.\n\nIf, in clear weather, a low cloud, which moves slowly and is considerably distant from any other, passes over the apparatus, the positive electricity generally grows very weak, but does not become negative; and when the cloud is gone, it returns to its former state. When many whitish clouds keep over the wire, sometimes uniting with and then separating from each other, thus forming a body of considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a>, the positive electricity commonly increases. In all the above circumstances the positive electricity never changes to negative.\n\nThe clouds which lessen the electricity of the exploring wire, are those which move; though those that are low, seem also to have the same effect.\n\nMr Cavallo has considerably improved our knowledge with respect to atmospherical electricity, and by his apparatus, has greatly facilitated the means of making.\nmaking experiments. His first experiments were made by means of a kite; and after bestowing much pains in constructing kites of various dimensions, &c., he found that a common school-boy's kite, about four feet high, and two wide, answered as well as any other. The string of his kite was formed by twisting together two threads of common twine, and one of copper thread, such as is used for trimmings. When a kite constructed in this manner was raised, he always found the string give signs of electricity, except once, when the weather was warm, and the wind very weak, that the kite could scarcely be raised, and could be kept up only for a few minutes. Afterwards, however, when the wind increased so that he could easily raise the kite, he obtained, as usual, pretty strong signs of electricity.\n\nAs making experiments on atmospheric electricity is often attended with more or less danger, it is necessary to observe the following directions given by Mr Cavallo.\n\n\"In raising the kite when the weather is very cloudy and rainy, in which time there is fear of meeting with a great quantity of electricity, I generally use to hang upon the string AB, fig. 127, the hook of a chain C, the other extremity of which falls upon the ground. Sometimes I use another caution besides, which is, to stand upon an insulating stool; in which situation I think, that if any great quantity of electricity, suddenly discharged by the clouds, strikes the kite, it cannot much affect my person. As to insulated reels, and such-like instruments, that some gentlemen have used to raise the kite, without danger of receiving any shock; fit for the purpose as they may appear to be in theory, they are yet very inconvenient to be managed. Except the kite be raised in time of a thunder-storm, there is no great danger for the operator to receive any shock. Although I have raised my electrical kite hundreds of times without any caution whatever, I have very seldom received a few exceedingly slight shocks in my arms. In time of a thunder-storm, if the kite has not been raised before, I would not advise a person to raise it while the stormy clouds are just overhead; the danger at such time being very great, even with the precautions above mentioned: at that time, without raising the kite, the electricity of the clouds may be observed by a cork-ball electrometer held in the hand in an open place; or, if it rains, by my electrometer for the rain; which will be described hereafter.\n\n\"When the kite has been raised, I generally introduce the string through a window in a room of the house, and fasten it to a strong silk <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LACE\">lace</a>, the extremity of which is generally tied to a heavy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol5.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> in the room. In fig. 128, A.B represents part of the string of the kite which comes within the room; C represents the silk lace; D.E, a small prime conductor, which, by means of a small wire, is connected with the string of the kite; and F represents the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUADRANT\">quadrant</a> electrometer, fixed upon a stand of glass covered with sealing-wax, which I used to put near the prime conductor, rather than to fix it in a hole upon the conductor, because the string A.B sometimes shakes so as to pull the prime conductor down; in which case the quadrant electrometer remains safe upon the table; otherwise it would be broken, as I have often experienced before I thought of this method. G represents a glass tube, about eighteen inches long, with a knobbed wire cemented to its extremity; with which instrument I use to observe the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the electricity, when the electricity of the kite is so strong that I think it not safe to come very near the string. The method is as follows:\u2014I hold the instrument by that extremity of the glass tube which is the farthest from the wire, and touch the string of the kite with the knob of its wire, which, being insulated, acquires a small quantity of electricity from it; which is sufficient to ascertain its quality when the knob of the instrument is brought near an electrified electrometer.\n\n\"Sometimes, when I raise the kite in the night-time, out of the house, and where I have not the convenience of observing the quality of its electricity by the attraction and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPULSION\">repulsion</a>, or even by the appearance of the electric light, I make use of a coated phial, which I can charge at the string, and, when charged, put it into my pocket; wherein it will keep charged even for several hours. By making use of this instrument, I am obliged to keep the kite up no longer than is necessary, to charge the phial, in order to observe the quality of the electricity in the atmosphere; for after the kite has been drawn in and brought home, I can then examine the electricity of the inside of the phial, which is the same as that of the kite.\n\n\"When the electricity of the kite is very strong, I fix a chain, communicating with the ground, at about six inches distance from the string; which may carry off its electricity, in case that this should increase too much as to put the bystanders in danger.\n\n\"Besides the above-described apparatus, I have occasionally used some other instruments, which I have often varied, according as some particular experiments required; but, as they are of no great consequence, I shall omit to describe them. It is only necessary, to give an idea of the standard of my quadrant electrometer; which may, very probably, show the same intensity of electricity under a number of degrees different from the other instruments of the same kind. When the kite is flying, and the apparatus is disposed as in fig. 128, I bring, under the extremity E of the prime conductor, a little bran, held upon a tin plate, and observe, that when the index of the electrometer is at ten degrees, the prime conductor begins to attract the bran at the distance of about three-fifths of an inch; when the index is at twenty degrees, the prime conductor attracts the bran at the distance of about one inch and a quarter; when the index is at thirty degrees, the bran begins to be attracted at the distance of two inches and one-fifth. These distances vary, as the weather changes its degree of dryness; but in frosty weather I observe them constantly as above.\"\n\nMr Cavallo has given copious extracts from a journal which he kept of his experiments with the kite; great danger from these we shall give his account of one experiment, which is peculiarly interesting from the danger to which the experimenters appear to have been exposed.\n\n\"October the 18th. After having rained a great deal in the morning, and night before, the weather became a little clear in the afternoon, the clouds appearing separated, and pretty well defined. The wind was west, and rather strong, and the atmosphere in a temperate degree of heat. In these circumstances, at three P.M. I raised my electrical kite with three hundred...\"\nAfter that the end of the string had been inflated, and a leather-ball, covered with tin-foil, had been hung to it, I tried the power and quality of the electricity, which appeared to be positive, and pretty strong. In a short time a small cloud passing over, the electricity increased a little; but the cloud being gone, it decreased again to its former degree. The string of the kite was now fastened by the silk lace to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-YARD\">yard</a> of the house wherein I lived, which was situated near Illington, and I was repeatedly charging two coated phials, and giving shocks with them\u2014while I was doing so, the electricity, which was still positive, began to decrease, and in two or three minutes time it became so weak, that it could be hardly perceived with a very sensible cork-ball electrometer. Observing at the same time that a large and black cloud was approaching the zenith (which, no doubt, caused the decrease of the electricity) indicating imminent rain, I introduced the end of the string through a window, in a first-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> room, wherein I fastened it by the silk lace to an old chair. The quadrant electrometer was set upon the same window, and was, by means of a wire, connected with the string of the kite. Being now three quarters of an hour after three o'clock, the electricity was absolutely unperceivable; however, in about three minutes time, it became again perceivable, but now upon trial was found to be negative; it is therefore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a>, that its flopping was nothing more than a change from positive to negative, which was evidently occasioned by the approach of the cloud, part of which by this time had reached the zenith of the kite, and the rain also had begun to fall in large drops.\u2014The cloud came farther on; the rain increased, and the electricity keeping <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PACE\">pace</a> with it, the electrometer soon arrived to $15^\\circ$. Seeing now, that the electricity was pretty strong, I began again to charge the two coated phials, and to give shocks with them; but the phials had not been charged above three or four times, before I perceived that the index of the electrometer was arrived at $35^\\circ$, and was keeping still increasing. The shocks now being very smart, I desisted from charging the phials any longer; and, considering the rapid advance of the electricity, thought to take off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFLATION\">inflation</a> of the string, in case that if it should increase farther, it might be filently conducted to the earth, without causing any bad accident, by being accumulated in the inflated string. To effect this, as I had no proper apparatus near me, I thought to remove the silk lace, and fasten the string itself to the chair; accordingly I disengaged the wire that connected the electrometer with the string; laid hold of the string; untied it from the silk lace, and fastened it to the chair; but while I effected this, which took up less than half a minute of time, I received about a dozen, or fifteen, very strong shocks, which I felt all along my arms, in my breast, and legs; shaking me in such a manner, that I had hardly power enough to effect my purpose, and to warn the people in the room to keep their distance. As soon as I took my hands off the string, the electricity (in consequence of the chair being a bad conductor) began to snap between the string and the shutter of the window, which was the nearest body to it. The snappings, which were audible at a good distance out of the room, seemed first isochronous with the shocks which I had received, but in about a minute's time, oftener; so that the people of the house compared their sound to the rattling noise of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACK\">jack</a> going when the fly is off. The cloud now was just over the kite; it was black, and well defined, of almost a circular form, its diameter appearing to be about $40^\\circ$; the rain was copious, but not remarkably heavy. As the cloud was going off, the electrical snapping began to weaken, and in a short time became inaudible. I went then near the string, and finding the electricity weak, but still negative, I inflated it again, thinking to keep the kite up some time longer; but observing that another larger and denser cloud was approaching apace towards the zenith, as I had then no proper apparatus at hand, to prevent every possible bad accident, I resolved to pull the kite in; accordingly a gentleman, who was by me, began pulling it in, while I was winding up the string. The cloud was now very nearly over the kite, and the gentleman, who was pulling in the string, told me, that he had received one or two slight shocks in his arms, and that if he were to feel one more, he would certainly let the string go; upon which I laid hold of the string, and pulled the kite in as fast as I could, without any farther observation; being then ten minutes after four o'clock.\n\n\"N.B. There was neither thunder nor lightning perceived that day, nor indeed for some days before or afterwards.\"\n\nFrom his experiments with the kite, Mr Cavallo deduces the following conclusions:\n\n1. The air appears to be electrified at all times; its electricity is constantly positive, and much stronger in frosty, than in warm weather; but it is by no means less in the night than in the daytime ($\\kappa$).\n\n2. The presence of the clouds generally lessens the electricity of the kite; sometimes it has no effect upon it; and it is very seldom that it increases it a little.\n\n3. When it rains, the electricity of the kite is generally negative, and very seldom positive.\n\n4. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AURORA_BOREALIS\"><a class=\"xref\"</a> href=\"vol3.html#article-AURORA\">aurora</a> borealis seems not to affect the electricity of the kite.\n\n5. The electrical spark taken from the string of the kite, or from any inflated conductor connected with it, especially when it does not rain, is very seldom pungent. When the index of the electrometer is not higher than $20^\\circ$, the person that takes the spark will feel the effect of it in his legs; it appearing more like the discharge of an electric jar, than the spark taken from the prime conductor of an electrical machine.\n\n6. The\n\n---\n\n($\\kappa$) In all his experiments, it happened only once that the string of the kite gave no signs of electricity; it was one afternoon, when the weather was warm, and the wind so weak, that the kite was raised with difficulty, and could hardly be kept up for a few minutes; in the evening, however, the wind, which in the daytime had been north-west, shifted to the north-east, blowing a little stronger: he then raised the kite again, being half past ten o'clock, and obtained, usual, a pretty strong positive electricity.\n6. The electricity of the kite is in general stronger or weaker, according as the string is longer or shorter; but it does not keep any exact proportion to it: the electricity, for instance, brought down by a string of a hundred yards, may raise the index of the electrometer to 25\u00b0; when, with double that length of string, the index of the electrometer will not go higher than 25\u00b0.\n\n7. When the weather is damp, and the electricity is pretty strong, the index of the electrometer, after taking a spark from the string, or presenting the knob of a coated phial to it, rises surprisingly quick to its usual place; but in dry and warm weather, it rises exceedingly slow.\n\nMr Bennet observed with his electrometer, that in very clear weather, when no clouds were visible, on applying the instrument to the insulated string of kites without metal, their positive electricity caused the slips of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a> to strike the sides of the glass; but when a kite was raised in cloudy weather, with a wire in the string, and when it gave sparks about a quarter of an inch long, the electricity was sensible by the electrometer, at the distance of about ten yards from the string; but when placed at the distance of five feet, the gold-leaf continued to strike the sides of the electrometer for more than an hour together, with a velocity increasing and decreasing with the density or distance of the unequal clouds that passed over.\n\nSometimes the electricity of an approaching cloud has been sensible without a kite, though in a very unfavourable situation for it, being in a town surrounded with hills, and where buildings encompassed the wall on which the electrometer was placed. A thunder cloud passing, caused the gold-leaf to strike the sides of the glass very quick at each flash of lightning.\n\nMr Bennet relates the following instance of the danger sometimes incurred in making experiments with the kite. Having on the 5th of July 1788, raised a kite with two hundred yards of string, when it had been flying for about an hour, a dark cloud appeared at a great distance, and changed the electricity from positive to negative. The electric power increased till the cloud became nearly vertical, when some large drops of rain fell; and Mr Bennet attempting to secure the string from wet, received such a strong shock in his arm, as deprived it for a few seconds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>. The explosion was heard at the distance of forty yards, like the loud crack of a whip.\n\nThe following curious phenomenon was observed by Mr Loammi Baldwin, while raising an electrical kite in July 1771, during the approach of a severe thunderstorm. He observed himself to be surrounded by a rare <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> of fire, which, as the cloud rose nearer the zenith, and the kite rose higher, continued to extend itself with some gentle faint flashes. Mr Baldwin felt no other effect than a general weakness in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> and limbs, and a kind of little feeling; all which, he observes, might possibly be the effect of surprise, though it was sufficient to discourage him from pursuing any farther attempt at that time. He therefore drew in his kite, and retired to a shop till the storm was over, and then went to his house, where he found his friends much more surprised than he had been himself; and who, after expressing their astonishment, informed him, that he appeared to them (during the time he was raising the kite, to be in the midst of a large bright flame of fire, attended with flasings; and, that they expected every moment to see him fall a sacrifice to the flame. The atmosphere was observed by some of his neighbours, who lived near the place where he stood.\n\nFig. 129 represents a very simple instrument, contrived by Mr Cavallo for making experiments on atmospheric electricity, and which, on several accounts, seems to be the most convenient for that purpose.\n\nAB is a common jointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FISHING\">fishing</a>-rod, without the last or smallest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a>. From the extremity of this rod proceeds a slender glass tube C, covered with sealing-wax, atmospheric and having a cork D, at its end, from which a pith-ball cal electrometer is suspended. HG is a piece of twine fastened to the other extremity of the rod, and supported at G by a small string FG. At the end I of the twine a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a> is fastened, which, when pushed into the cork D, renders the electrometer E uninsulated.\n\nWhen he would observe the electricity of the atmosphere with this instrument, he thrust the pin I into the cork D, and holding the rod by its lower end A, projects it out from a window of the upper part of the house into the air, raising the end of the rod with the electrometer, so as to make an angle of about 50\u00b0 or 60\u00b0 with the horizon. In this situation he keeps the instrument for a few seconds, and then pulling the twine at H, disengages the pin from the cork D; which operation causes the string to drop in the dotted situation KL, and leaves the electrometer insulated and electrified, with an electricity contrary to that of the atmosphere.\u2014This done, he draws the instrument into the room, and examines the quality of the electricity, without obstruction either from wind or darkness.\n\nWith this instrument he made observations on the electricity of the atmosphere, several times in a day for several months, and from them he deduces the following general observations, which seem to coincide with those made with the electrical kites.\n\n1. That there is in the atmosphere, at all times, a quantity of electricity; for, whenever he used the above-described instrument, it always acquired some electricity.\n\n2. That the electricity of the atmosphere, or fogs, is always of the same kind, namely positive; for the electrometer is always negative, except when it is evidently influenced by heavy clouds near the zenith.\n\n3. That in general, the strongest electricity is observable in thick fogs, and also in frosty weather; and the weakest, when it is cloudy, warm, and very near raining; but it does not seem to be less by night than in the daytime.\n\n4. That in a more elevated place, the electricity is stronger than in a lower one; for, having tried the atmospheric electrometer, both in the stone and iron <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GALLERY\">gallery</a> on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUPOLA\">cupola</a> of St Paul's cathedral, Mr Cavallo found that the balls diverged much more in the latter than in the former less elevated place; hence it appears, that, if this rule takes place at any distance from the earth, the electricity in the upper regions of the atmosphere must be exceedingly strong.\n\nMr Cavallo has also contrived an instrument, which he calls his electrometer for the rain; this is merely an insulator for insulated instrument to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CATCH\">catch</a> the rain, and, by means of a pith-ball electrometer, to show the degree and quality of its electricity.\n\nAt fig. 130, is represented an instrument of this kind, which Mr Cavallo frequently used, and after several\nseveral observations, found to answer very well. ABCI is a strong glass tube about two feet and a half long, having a tin funnel, DE, cemented to its extremity, which funnel defends part of the tube from the rain. The outside surface of the tube from A to B is covered with sealing-wax; so also is the part of it which is covered by the funnel. FD is a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANE\">cane</a>, round which several braids wires are twisted in different directions, so as to catch the rain easily, and at the same time to make no resistance to the wind. This piece of cane is fixed into the tube, and a slender wire proceeding from it goes through the bore of the tube, and communicates with the strong wire AG, which is thrust into a piece of cork fastened to the end A of the tube. The end G of the wire AG is formed into a ring, from which is suspended a more or less sensible pith-ball electrometer, as occasion requires.\n\nThis instrument is fastened to the side of the window-frame, where it is supported by strong brass hooks at CB, which part of the tube is covered with a silk lace, in order to adapt it better to the hooks. The part FC is out of the window, with the end F a little elevated above the horizon. The remaining part of the instrument comes through a hole in one of the lights of the sash, within the room, and no more of it touches the side of the window than the part CB.\n\nWhen it rains, especially in passing showers, this instrument, standing in the situation above described, is frequently electrified; and, by the diverging of the electrometer, the quantity and quality of the electricity of the rain may be observed, without any danger of a mistake. With this instrument, he observed, that the rain is generally, though not always electrified negatively, and sometimes to strongly, that he has been able to charge a small coated phial at the wire AG.\n\nThis instrument should be fixed in such a manner, that it may be easily taken off from the window, and replaced again, as occasion requires; for it will be necessary to clean it very often, particularly when a shower of rain is approaching.\n\nMr Cavallo has also shewn how the electricity of the atmosphere may be observed by means of his multiplier, described in No. 255.\n\nIn order to examine the electricity of the atmosphere, he at first used to fix a long pointed wire into the socket of the plate A, and then exposed it to the open air. But he has lately used a much better method of accomplishing that object. He exposes, out of the window, an inflated stick of about five feet in length, and covered with tin-foil; and while he holds this apparatus by the extremity of its inflating handle, he touches with the other hand, for about two or three seconds, the lower part of the stick. By this means, the stick being free from points, acquires an electricity contrary to that of the surrounding air. Mr Cavallo then brings it within the room, and communicates that electricity to the plate A of the multiplier, &c. But the electricity so acquired by the inflated stick, is generally sufficient to affect an electrometer without the use of the multiplier. To examine the electricity of the rain, snow, hail, &c., the same apparatus must be exposed out of a window, but the stick must not be touched, for in this case, it acquires the same sort of electricity as that of the rain, snow, &c., and not the contrary sort, as when exposed to the air.\n\nMr Read, in his \"Summary View of the Spontaneous Electricity of the Earth and Atmosphere,\" observes, that the electricity of the atmosphere, in moderate weather, was always found to be positive; in storms and disturbed states of the air frequently negative; and suddenly and repeatedly changing from the one state to the other. Warm small rain, was found to be very slightly electric; large drops, strongly; hail showers, the most intensely of all. In an easterly wind of long continuance, the electricity was so faint, as to require the nicest of all known tests for discovering its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>. The vapour of water, as soon as it had attained the height of five or six inches of inflation in the air, was found to be permanently and positively electrified; and the surface from which it evaporated, negatively. According to Mr Read, vapour has a greater <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> for electricity, or absorbs and requires more of fluid, than water in its denser state; and, therefore, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a> must diminish, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDENSATION\">condensation</a> increase, the sensible electric charge of the vapour. Hence, in serene weather, the atmosphere is subject to a regular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLUX\">flux</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFLUX\">reflux</a>, or increase and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIMINUTION\">diminution</a> of electricity twice in every twenty-four hours, depending on the action of the sun, and the consequent evaporation and state of the vapours. This diligent observer further remarks, that a limited portion of the earth's surface is often sensibly electrified; over it, there is always a proportionate state of the contrary electricity in the atmosphere; and when an electrified cloud is carried forward by wind, an equal and opposite electric charge keeps pace with it on the earth, till the two charges, becoming more augmented or approaching nearer to one another, or meeting with some conducting eminence, rush together, and produce an explosion.\n\nWe shall conclude our account of experiments on atmospheric electricity, with those made by M. Sauflaire in his excursions among the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPS\">Alps</a>. The instrument employed by M. Sauflaire is a modification of Cavallo's atmospheric electrometer, and shall be described under the article Electrometer.\n\nThe following are M. Sauflaire's observations on the electricity of the atmosphere.\n\nAerial electricity varies according to the situation; it is generally stronger in elevated and inflated situations; not to be observed under trees, in streets, in houses, or electricity, any inclosed places; though it is sometimes to be found pretty strong on quays and bridges. It is also not so much the absolute height of the places, as their situation: thus a projecting angle of a high hill will often exhibit a stronger electricity than the plain at the top of the hill, as there are fewer points in the former to deprive the air of its electricity.\n\nThe intensity of the atmospheric electricity is varied by a great many circumstances, some of which may be accounted for, others cannot. When the weather is serene, it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to assign any rule for their variation, as no regular correspondence can then be perceived with the different hours of the day, nor with the various modifications of the air. The reason is evident; when contrary and variable winds reign at different heights, when clouds are rolling over clouds, these winds and clouds, which we cannot perceive by any exterior sign, influence however the strata of air in which we make our experiments, produce these changes of which we only see the result, without being\ning able to assign either the cause, or its relation. Thus, in stormy weather, we see the electricity strong, then null, and in a moment after arise to its former force; one instant positive, the next negative; without being able to assign any reason for these changes. M. Sauflure says, that he has seen these changes succeed with such rapidity, that he had not time to note them down.\n\nWhen rain falls without a storm, these changes are not so sudden; they are however very irregular, particularly with respect to the intensity of force; the quality thereof is more constant. Rain, or snow, almost uniformly gives positive electricity.\n\nIn cloudy weather, without rain or storms, the electricity follows generally the same laws as in serene weather.\n\nStrong winds generally diminish its intensity; they mix together the different strata of the atmosphere, and make them pass successively towards the ground, and thus distribute the electricity uniformly between the earth and the air; M. Sauflure has observed a strong electricity with a strong north wind (la bise).\n\nThe state of the air, in which the electricity is strongest, is foggy weather: this is always accompanied with electricity, except when the fog is going to resolve into rain.\n\nThe most interesting observations, and those which throw the greatest light upon the various modifications of electricity in our atmosphere, are those that are made in serene weather. In winter, (during which most of M. Sauflure's observations were made) and in serene weather, the electricity was generally weakest in an evening, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEW\">dew</a> had fallen, until the moment of the sun's rising; its intensity afterwards augmented by degrees, sometimes sooner, and sometimes later; but generally before noon, it attained a certain maximum, from whence it again declined, till the fall of the dew, when it would be sometimes stronger than it had been during the whole day; after which, it would again gradually diminish during the whole night; but is never quite destroyed, if the weather is perfectly serene.\n\nAtmospherical electricity seems, therefore, like the Periodical sea, to be subject to a flux and reflux, which causes it to flux and reflux twice in 24 hours. The moments of its greatest force are some hours after the rising and setting of the sun; those when it is weakest, precede the city of the rising and setting thereof. This will be further explained in the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a>.\n\nM. Sauflure has given an instance of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PERIODIC\">periodic</a> flux in electricity, on the 22nd of February, 1785, (one of the coldest days ever remembered at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENEVA\">Geneva</a>); the hygrometer and thermometer were suspended in the open air, on a terrace exposed to the south-west; the electrometer, from its situation, indicated an electricity equal to what it would have shown if it had been placed on an open plain. The height of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BAROMETER\">barometer</a> is reduced to what it would have been if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> had been constantly at the temperature of 19 degrees of Reaumur's thermometer. The place of observation was elevated 60 feet above the level of the lake. The observations of the day preceding and following this great cold, are inserted in the following table; because it is pleasing to have the observations which precede and follow anyingular phenomena. There was a weak south-west wind during the whole three days; and it is rather remarkable, that most of the great colds, which have been observed at Geneva, were preceded by, or at least accompanied with, a little south-west <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREEZE\">breeze</a>.\n\n### TABLE\n\n| Barometer, feet in height | Thermometer | Hygrom. | Electrom. |\n|---------------------------|-------------|---------|-----------|\n| h. m.                     |             |         |           |\n| Feb. 21st                 |             |         |           |\n| 9 15 M                    | 26 6 7      | 8 3     | 89 3      | 2 0 Pale sun, cloudy. |\n| 11 10 M                   | 26 6 5      | 4 3     | 83 0      | 1 6 Bright sun. |\n| 2 10 E                    | 26 6 1      | 0 2     | 69 6      | 1 1 The same. |\n| 5 E                       | 26 6 1      | 2 3     | 77 2      | 1 1 Setting sun. |\n| 6 E                       | 26 6 0      | 5 2     | 85        | 1 0 Cloudy in the S.W. |\n| 7 E                       | 26 6 2      | 6 8     | 89        | 1 8 Perfectly clear. |\n| 8 E                       | 26 6 3      | 10 0    | 95        | 2 0 Idem. |\n| 9 E                       | 26 6 3      | 10 6    | 97 5      | 1 8 Idem. |\n| 10 E                      | 26 6 1      | 9 9     | 95        | 1 2 Little cloud at horizon S. |\n| 11 E                      | 26 6 0      | 12 3    | 99 1      | 1 5 Idem more to S.W. |\n| 12 E                      | 26 5 15     | 12 5    | H r frost | 1 2 Idem. |\n| 22d, 1 M                  | 26 6 0      | 14 3    | Idem      | 0 9 Idem. |\n| 2 M                       | 26 6 8      | 14 5    | Id.       | 1 2 Clouds increase and approach. |\n| 6 15 M                    | 26 5 7      | 15 0    | Id.       | 0 8 Clear. |\n| 7 30 M                    | 26 5 4      | 14 7    | Id.       | 1 2 Light fog. |\n| 8 10 M                    | 26 5 2      | 14 2    | Id.       | 1 1 Idem. |\n| 9 10 M                    | 26 4 15     | 10 7    | Id.       | 1 6 Idem. |\n| 10 10 M                   | 26 4 13     | 8 2     | Id.       | 2 2 Thicker fog. |\n| 11 10 M                   | 26 4 3      | 4 8     | Id.       | 1 8 Idem. |\n| 1 10 E                    | 26 4 0      | 4 9     | Id.       | 1 7 Idem. |\n| 2 20 E                    | 26 3 14     | 6 6     | 82        | 1 4 Weak fog, pale sun. |\n### Table\n\n| h. m. | Barometer, feet in height | Thermometer | Hygrom. | Electrom. |\n|-------|--------------------------|-------------|---------|-----------|\n| Feb. 22d, 3 30 | E 26 3 13 | \u2014 0 9 | 81 9 | 1 1 | Cloudy pale sun. |\n| 5 | E 26 3 13 | \u2014 4 3 | 89 | 1 2 | Less cloudy. |\n| 6 | E 26 3 14 | \u2014 4 4 | 91 2 | 2 2 | More fo. |\n| 7 | E 26 3 14 | \u2014 6 1 | 94 | 1 7 | Idem. |\n| 8 | E 26 3 13 | \u2014 5 9 | Id. | 3 7 | Cloudy foggy in S.

In general, in summer, if the ground has been dry for some days, and the air is dry also, the electricity generally increases, from the rising of the sun till three or four in the afternoon, when it is strongest: it then diminishes till the dew begins to fall, which again reanimates it; though after this it declines, and is almost extinguished during the night.\n\nBut the serene days that succeed rainy weather in summer, generally exhibit the same diurnal periods or states of electricity, as are to be observed in winter.\n\nThe air is invariably positive in serene weather, both in winter and summer, day and night, in the sun or in the dew. It would seem, therefore, that the electricity of the air is essentially positive, and that whenever it appears to be negative, in certain rains or in storms, it probably arises from some clouds, which have been exposed to the influence of the electric fluid contained in the upper part of the atmosphere, or to more elevated clouds, that have discharged a part of their fluid upon the earth, or upon other clouds.\n\nIn order to find out the cause of these phenomena, Mr. Saussure instituted a set of experiments on evaporation, avoiding the use of Volta's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDENSER\">condenser</a>.\n\nTo produce a strong evaporation, he threw a mass of red hot iron into a small quantity of water, which was contained in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COFFEE\">coffee</a>-pot, with a large mouth, and suspended by silk strings; by this he obtained a strong positive electricity, though, according to M. Volta's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a>, it ought to have been negative. The experiment was repeated several times, varying some of the circumstances, but the result was always the same.\n\nAs it was not easy to think so able a philosopher as M. Volta was deceived, it was necessary to try the experiment in a manner more analogous to that of M. Volta. A small chafing-dish was therefore inflated by silk cords, and the coffee-pot, with a small quantity of water, placed on it; one electrometer was connected with the coffee-pot, and another with the chafing-dish; the fire was raised by a pair of bellows: when the water had boiled strongly for a few minutes, both electrometers exhibited signs of electricity, which, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a>, was found to be negative; proving the truth of M. Volta's experiment. The evaporation produced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EFFERVESCENCE\">effervescence</a> of iron in the sulphuric acid, and by that of chalk in the same acid, gave also negative electricity.\n\nIt was now necessary to inquire, why the vapour, excited by the heated iron, produced positive electricity; while that from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a> water, in any other way, produced a negative electricity.\n\nM. Saussure suspected, that the intensity of heat to which the water is exposed, by the contact of a body in a state of incandescence, was the cause of the electricity produced by its evaporation; and that a combination was then formed, by which a new quantity of the electric fluid was produced. This conjecture may at first sight seem improbable; but the quantity of electricity produced by this experiment will amply show that it is true; and this quantity is more surprising, because, if it is true, according to the system of M. Volta, that the vapours absorb, while they are forming, a quantity of the electric fluid, there must, therefore, be enough developed in this experiment, for the formation of the great quantity of vapours produced by the heated iron, and afterwards a sufficient quantity to electrify strongly the apparatus, and all these vapours.\nThis experiment shows clearly the cause of that prodigious quantity of electricity, which is unfolded in the eruption of volcanoes; as it is probable, that the water in these, from many circumstances, acquires a much greater degree of heat than is given to it in our experiments.\n\nTo verify this conjecture, that it was in some measure the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMBUSTION\">combustion</a> of the water, or the iron, that produced the positive electricity, it was proper to try whether, by a regular moderation of the heat of the iron, positive electricity would always be obtained. This was essayed in the following manner: A large iron crucible, five inches high, four in diameter, and six lines thick, was heated red hot; then insulated; after which, small quantities of water were thrown into it, each <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROJECTION\">projection</a> of the water cooling more and more the crucible; thus defending by degrees till there was only sufficient heat to boil the water; carefully observing, and then destroying the electricity produced at each projection. The electricity was always positive or null; at the first projections it was very strong; it gradually diminished to the twelfth, when it was scarce sensible, though always with a tendency to be positive.\n\nOn repeating this experiment, and varying it in different ways, a remarkable circumstance was observed: When a small quantity of water was thrown into the crucible, the moment it was taken from the fire, while it was of a pale red, approaching what is called the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> heat, no electricity was obtained.\n\nThis fact seemed to have some connection with another mentioned by Mufchenbroek, that water evaporates more slowly on a metal, or any other incandescent body, than on the same body, heated only a small degree above boiling water. To examine this relation, and to find whether there was any between the periods of evaporation, and the production of electricity, M. Sauffire made a great number of experiments, which are most accurately described in his excellent work; but as the detail would be much too long to be introduced in this article, we must content ourselves with presenting the reader with the heads thereof, and a description of the apparatus.\n\nThe apparatus consisted of a pot of clay, well baked or annealed, fifteen lines thick, and four inches in diameter; this was insulated by a dry glass goblet; upon this pot was placed the crucible, or any other heated substance, on which the water was to be thrown, in order to be reduced into vapours; the crucible was <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> to a wire connected with an electrometer; a measure containing 54 grains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> of distilled water, was thrown upon the heated crucible; the time employed in the evaporation thereof was observed by a second watch; the electricity produced by this evaporation was noted. When this measure of water was reduced into vapour, the electricity of the apparatus was destroyed, and a fresh measure of water was thrown into the crucible; proceeding in the same manner till the crucible was almost cold.\n\nThe first experiment was with an iron crucible, from which it was found, that Mufchenbroek was not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a>, in saying that the evaporation was slower when the iron was hottest; for at the instant it was taken from the fire it required 19 seconds to evaporate the water, and took more time till the third projection, when it took 35 seconds, though from that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> it employed less time, or in other words, the evaporation accelerated in proportion as the iron cooled.\n\nWith respect to the electricity, it was at first 0, then positive, afterwards negative, then 0, and afterwards positive to the end of the experiment. The vapour was not visible till the 7th projection.\n\nIn the second experiment with the same crucible, though every endeavour was made use of to render them as similar as possible, the electricity was constantly positive.\n\nThe third experiment was with a copper crucible; here also the electricity was positive, and the longest time employed in evaporation was not the instant of the greatest heat. It was very curious to see the water endeavouring to gather itself into a globule, like mercury on glass; to be sometimes immovable, and then to turn on itself horizontally, with great rapidity; sometimes throwing from some of its points a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JET\">jet</a>, accompanied with a hissing noise.\n\nThe fourth experiment was with the same crucible; the electricity was at first negative, then constantly positive.\n\nThe fifth was with a crucible of pure silver; a considerable time was employed here in evaporating the same quantity of water; even in the instant of the greatest heat it took five minutes, five seconds; the electricity was weak, three times no electricity was perceived, five times negative electricity was discovered.\n\nIn a sixth experiment with the same crucible, a positive electricity was obtained, at the second projection; after which none of any kind was perceived.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SEVENTH\">seventh</a> with the same, gave at first strong negative electricity, the second and third projection gave a weak positive electricity.\n\nThe eighth was made with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PORCELAIN\">porcelain</a> cup; here the evaporation was slower at the second, than the first projection; but from this it took longer time till it was cold, contrary to what happened with the metals; the electricity was always negative.\n\nThe ninth and tenth experiments, with the same cup, produced similar effects.\n\nThe eleventh experiment was with spirits of wine in a silver crucible; here there was no electricity produced at the two first projections, and what was afterwards obtained was negative.\n\nTwelfth experiment with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a>; here the electricity was also negative. These two inflammable fluids, in evaporating, followed the same laws as water, being diffused at first most rapidly in the greatest heat, afterwards taking a longer and longer time before they were evaporated, to a certain period, then employing less time, or evaporating quicker, till the crucible was nearly cold.\n\nNow as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHINA\">china</a> and silver always produced negative electricity, while iron and copper have generally given positive electricity, we may conclude, that electricity is positive with those bodies that are capable of decomposing water, or of being decomposed themselves by their contact with the water; and negative with those which are not at all decomposed or altered.\n\nIf in the foregoing experiment, those substances which were susceptible of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OXIDATION\">oxidation</a> had constantly given a positive electricity, and those which do not oxidise had always given the negative; everything would have been explained by these principles, and they would thence have acquired a greater degree of probability. But the phenomena have not always followed this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a>.\nWe have seen iron and copper sometimes give a negative electricity, and silver the positive. The first case is not difficult to account for; it is well known with what facility iron and copper are oxidized in a brick fire; they become covered with a scaly crust, which is not susceptible of any further alteration with the same heat. If the bottom of the crucible acquires this crusty coating, the drop of water placed thereon will be no longer in contact with an oxidizable substance; there will be no further decomposition, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a> of the electric fluid: the vapors, however, which are still formed, will absorb a part of the fluid naturally contained in the apparatus, and this will therefore be electrified negatively. If some of the scales should be so far detached, that the water may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> some points of contact, the quantity thus <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a> may compensate for what is absorbed by the vapors, and thus the electricity will be null. If more are detached, it will super-abound and be positive. From the same reasons, a large mass of water, by attacking the iron in a greater number of points, always gives positive electricity; and hence, also, a strong positive electricity is obtained, by throwing a piece of red-hot iron into a mass of water.\n\nIt is not easy to explain why silver gives sometimes a positive electricity, but by supposing it to have been mixed with some substances capable of oxidation; and this the more, as the white porcelain always gave negative electricity. This supposition was verified by some subsequent experiments, in which the same silver, when purified, always gave a negative electricity.\n\nM. Sauflure owns himself incapable of explaining why heated <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARCOAL\">charcoal</a> always gives negative electricity; unless it can be attributed to the promptitude with which it rare a substance loses its heat, by the contact of water.\n\nOne fact astonished him, namely, that by combustion properly so called, although it is an evaporation, nay, the highest degree of evaporation, he never obtained any signs of electricity; though he tried to obtain it in a variety of ways. Probably, the current produced by the flame, disperses and dissipates the electricity as soon as it is formed. The case, however, must not be looked upon as general, because M. Volta obtained signs of electricity from bodies in combustion, by means of his condenser.\n\nAnother singular fact was, his not being able to obtain electricity without ebullition, though he endeavored to compensate by the quantity of surface for the quantity of vapors that were elevated by boiling water; and indeed, the same quantity of water, if extended over too large a surface, will not give any electricity.\n\nWe shall resume this subject immediately, but must first conclude our observations on the phenomena of atmospheric electricity.\n\nThe following axioms with respect to atmospheric electricity, deduced by M. Cotte after a long course of observations, merit <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>.\n\n1. Electricity manifests itself oftener without storms than with them.\n2. It is produced more frequently by dry than by rainy clouds.\n3. It is more frequently positive than negative, especially when occasioned by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATIONARY\">stationary</a> clouds.\n4. The atmosphere exhibits signs of electricity at all times by night or day.\n\nIn our endeavors to explain the production of natural electricity, we have nothing more to do, than to discover the various circumstances of the atmosphere, in which moisture is absorbed or precipitated.\n\nIt is necessary to recollect the proof furnished by numerous experiments, that when any portion of the atmosphere is in a state to take up an additional quantity of moisture, it is in a state at the same time to take up more electric fluid; and vice versa, when it is parting its portion with its water, it is at the same time parting with its electric fluid. But in these cases, neither the superabundance nor the deficiency can produce a charge, unless there be some other part of the air contemporaneously in an opposite state, or in a disposition either to receive or give. It is, however, scarcely possible that this should not always happen; for our atmosphere is, throughout its vast dimensions, each moment agitated by millions of co-instantaneous changes, and for our purpose, it is of no consequence where the required change takes place. Were it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-NEW_HOLLAND\">New <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOLLAND\">Holland</a>, or at the Antipodes, a connection would be instantly formed between the remote but opposite situations, by the conducting power of the earth.\n\nIt is a necessary conclusion from what we have just said, that if the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> of moisture by air, or the storms copious evaporation of it from the earth, be attended with a new accumulation of the fluid; then where this cause operates most powerfully, there its correspondent effect will be most sensible. We consequently find, that the most tremendous electrical phenomena belong to the countries within the tropics, or to that portion of our atmosphere which is loaded with moisture by the most powerful influence of the sun's rays. In like manner, within the limits of our own and other similar climates, electrical phenomena are greatest, both in force and frequency, during the hottest months of the year, or during the season in which our atmosphere is most copiously and rapidly charged, by absorbing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMIDITY\">humidity</a> of the ground.\n\nIn the neighborhood of Etna and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VESUVIUS\">Vesuvius</a>, during the period of their volcanic fury, surfaces, covering the dimensions of several square leagues, are sometimes volca- noes, scorched with red-hot <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LAVA\">lava</a>, and every atom of their moisture is rapidly dissipated. At the same time the surrounding air is heated to a vast extent, and in this state swallows up an immense quantity of aqueous vapor; but contemporaneously with the operation of these powers, according to the reports of all natural historians, an immense quantity of the electric fluid is accumulated and discharged.\n\nAgain, a dry wind passing over a moist <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> is another modification of the cause we are applying; it produces a copious and rapid solution of the aqueous particles, and its consequent alteration of attractive force. Let us for instance, suppose a wind, which had passed over the deserts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>, or that had been torrefied in its passage over a large extent of burning sands, to come in contact with a similar extent of marshy soil, or of any surface well drenched with water, a most abundant evaporation would necessarily take place, and with it an immense accumulation of the electric fluid. But subsequently, in case any power operated, which would take away the aqueous particles thus dissolved, and of course alter the degree of attractive force by which the collected electric fluid is fufilled, we should find\nthat the most dreadful thunder-storms would take place. This is really the case; for there is scarcely a region in the vast circle surrounding the immeasurable lands of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, which is not remarkable for storms and tempests.\n\nOn the side of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABYSSINIA\">Abyssinia</a>, when the warm winds that have passed over the neighbouring deserts are condensed on its mountains, those deluges are collected, which form the inundations of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a>.\n\nOn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUINEA\">Guinea</a>, the harmattan, which is a current of air so dry, as to wither and pulverize, by a complete absorption of all its juices, every substance that occurs in its passage, is no sooner mixed with that body of air which is cooled by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>, than it forms most terrific hurricanes of wind and lightning that are described by navigators. Along the Syrian regions, we learn from sacred authority, that the storms gather with such rapidity, that a cloud, which this instant might be covered with the hand, is within the interval of a few minutes, charged with water adequate to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INUNDATION\">inundation</a> of a whole country.\n\nThe thunder that attended these impetuous storms, provoked the sublimest expressions of their poets. Indeed, whenever their minds attempt the description of celestial greatness, or the sudden and overwhelming approach of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> power in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a>, or in its fury, they have recourse for imagery to those thunder-clouds, which they justly represented as extinguishing the light of the sun, and as involving the world in a few instants in the darkness of midnight.\n\nHaving specified the two most general causes of evaporation on the surface of this earth, let us now attend to the possible changes of the atmosphere, when by the operation of either, or both, it is charged with the electric fluid. All these changes are but different degrees of the same effect, viz. the condensation of moisture, and this condensation is in every case produced by an alteration of temperature, which may proceed,\n\n1. From a mixture, or even the contact, of a colder with a warmer air. When the smallest clouds are formed by such a mixture, an electrical charge takes place, so that one part of the cloud has more, and the other less, than its natural share. Fogs, dews, and the slightest change of clear for hazy weather, commonly arise from a warmer atmosphere coming in contact with one of a lower temperature; but even these trifling degrees of condensation are always followed by signs of electricity.\n\nIn this country, from its insular situation, which exposes it to the perpetual influence of varying winds, the air changes its appearances often many times in one day. But there is no degree of thick cloudiness or perfect clearness, of scattered clouds succeeding embodied masses of clouds, of small rain increasing to heavy, or vice versa, that is not attended with changes in the expressions of the elevated conductor, which never fails to vary with all the atmospheric condensations and rarefactions that take place.\n\nIt is, however, obvious that the effect must be in proportion to the quantity and rapidity of the condensation. When, therefore, any body of air has been for a long time suspended over a surface of ground previously drenched with showers, and at the same time exposed to the violence of the sun's rays, a change in the direction of the wind, or such a change in the weight of the air as mixes the upper with the lower regions of the air, is almost always attended with a thunder-storm.\n\nIn tropical climates, for months together, scarcely a day passes, in which the calm atmosphere is not loaded by successive additions of moisture, till at last, it becomes the reservoir of vast rivers and lakes, and of all the moisture that is spread over whole continents. But when this drought has reached its crisis, the sun crosses the line, the wind takes a new direction, a colder air mixes with that which is thus charged with vapours, and the condensation becomes so copious, as to inundate all the subjacent country; but the deluge is not more destructive than its attendant storm; for, according to the reports of spectators, our imaginations, confined to the proceedings of nature in this frozen region, have no images from which any such comparison can be made, as will communicate the least idea of the thunder attending a tropical hurricane.\n\nThe cause which we are now applying to the explanation of these natural appearances, will furnish us with an easy solution of a difficulty which has oppressed several theories of electricity, namely, that rapid generation and increase of the electric fluid which takes place in some thunder-storms. Even in this country, the succession of flashes is sometimes so quick, that one hundred and twenty have been known to follow each other in a minute. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>, this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CELERITY\">celerity</a> of accumulation and discharge was so great, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a> uses it as part of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SIMILE\">simile</a>, by which he paints the quick repetition of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGAMEMNON\">Agamemnon</a>'s sighs and pantings in an hour of distress.\n\nIt may be asked, if each distinct cloud is loaded with a distinct charge, and if each flash is a separate discharge of such a cloud, what is there, in our knowledge of natural powers, that will account for an innumerable repetition of these accumulations and discharges within a very short space of time, more especially when each of them is connected in our minds with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of a distinct part of that time for its process? In other words, do we know of any cause that is adequate to the filling and emptying of the same portion of air every instant, for hours together?\n\nOn a hot summer's day it not unfrequently happens, that a fine blue sky will, within five seconds, be changed into one mass of clouds. If the cause which produces so great an effect, were supposed to be doubled in its power of condensation, the degree of electricity shown by the elevated conductor would be rather more than doubled, and its signs would be much stronger than in a common storm; we may hence conclude, that the whole mass which might be thus formed in five seconds, would be loaded so as to have every part of it at the discharging height; but the mass might consist of hundreds of distinct clouds all in the same state, and consequently adequate to the production of several hundred flashes within a minute.\n\nThe collapse of aqueous particles, which would necessarily follow such a rapid succession of discharges as have been now proved to be possible, would produce a partial vacuum of great extent, and on all sides the heavier air would rush into it, and the upper and colder regions would press downwards, and by their condensing temperatures, would renovate all the accumulations and discharges which have been already described; a second collapse would follow a second series of thunder-strokes,\nthunder-strokes, and a partial vacuum, additional to the former; a fresh portion of warm air would again rush in from all quarters, and a fresh mixture of cold air from the upper regions. It is scarcely necessary to show that this repetition of condensations may continue for hours, or till the air, which rushes in laterally, becomes of such a temperature, that its mixture with the colder air will not produce the condensations adequate to the collection of that quantity of electric fluid which is necessary for a discharge.\n\nFrom this explanation, it is obvious that a central point must exist, at which the violence of every storm begins, and from which it is spread in all directions. A hurricane in the West Indies, though ruinous to many, is generally the distinguishing calamity of one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAND\">island</a>, at which alone the wind is described as blowing from every point of the compass; while in every other island, it is represented as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> down decisively from one quarter.\n\n2. The precipitation of aqueous particles when suspended by heat in air, is frequently the consequence of the loaded atmosphere's coming in contact with portions of the earth that are colder than itself. Such, particularly, are the summits of mountains, whose effect is great in proportion to the degree of their cold and the extent of their surface. It is, however, certain that condensations, when thus produced, are invariably attended by thunder-storms.\n\nThe uproar, and the splendour of the innumerable lightnings, which dart through all the entangled circuits of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABYSS\">abyss</a> of thunder-clouds, are the immutable attributes of grandeur which belong to the Cordilleras; for they dam up, as it were, an immense flow of air, which is almost saturated with moisture by passing over several thousand leagues of land, exposed to the fury of a tropical sun.\n\nIn summer, the north-westerly winds that pass over France, are always condensed by the Alps; and in the night, during such a state of the atmosphere, to all those who live along the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAONE\">Saone</a> and the upper part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RHONE\">Rhone</a>, these mountains are always brightened by electrical flashes and coruscations.\n\nAll ridges or chains of very high grounds, especially those which terminate extensive plains lying in the direction of their most common winds, are perpetually beclouded; and with a good conductor, fixed on their summit, we should find that the signs of electricity were as constant as the condensations by which they are enveloped. But in proportion to the coldness, so is the subsequent change of temperature on the eminences diminished, and the electrical effect dependant on that change. It hence happens, that there are countries in the northern parts of Europe, the gloom of whose mists is never dispelled by a thunder-storm, excepting in the hottest season of summer.\n\n3. When the sun, by directing its rays with force and abundance upon the earth for any length of time, has produced a considerable evaporation, the mere interruption of its influence will be attended with a discharge of the electric fluid; for the great source of change in our atmosphere is the ready influence of its upper regions, which are cold, on its lower regions when warmed; and any cause which mixes these together, must bring on a condensation of aqueous vapour. This mixture, however, takes place on the mere approach of night, as is evident from the change of temperature expressed by the thermometer, and the usual fall of the dew; we consequently find, that as night comes on, the signs of electricity always increase. When the weather is tolerably settled, or such that no other cause is active than that proceeding from the change of day for night, or night for day; then the signs of electricity gradually decrease from twelve o'clock at night till six in the morning; from this hour till nine, they gradually increase, when they become exceedingly weak, and continue so till four in the afternoon; the increase at this time recommences, and is very decisive in its appearance till about two hours after sunset, when it becomes stationary, and remains in this state, or decreasing, so farcely to be sensible, till the morning.*\n\nThe cause, whose operation we have now investigated in the production of its most feeble effects, may be easily applied to many other causes, in which similar, but greater powers are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> by nature. Let us suppose, that on a wide surface of ground, previously warmed by the sun, copious showers of rain had fallen, followed by a return of the sun's influence; in this case, the evaporation is necessarily very rapid, and the signs of electricity expressed by an elevated conductor are very strong.\n\nWhen a copious production of electric fluid has attended a copious evaporation continued for several successive hours, a thunder-storm, or some striking electrical appearance will come on with the approach of night; for unless the barometer should suddenly rise, the condensation attending the evening's cold must be very considerable, and its usual consequences proportionally great. Such a day as we have just described, is usually followed by a violent thunder-storm. Indeed, there is scarcely an instance in which a moist ground, operated on for some hours by a clear sun, provided the wind continues to blow from the south-west or west, is not attended the following night by the appearance of falling stars, flashes of lightning, or the Aurora Borealis.\n\nWe have alluded to the connection of winds with the phenomena of atmospheric electricity. The influence of winds must depend on various circumstances; in some cases, they will tend to diminish electrical appearances, and in others, they may altogether destroy them. The current of air which proceeds from a mixture of two winds of different temperatures, is the effect of a condensation of vapour, that may be succeeded by the most violent storms. But if there should be two neighbouring regions, in one of which, the rays of the sun should co-operate with the moisture of the ground, in producing electricity, while in the other there should prevail a condensation favourable to the discharge of the electric fluid; a current of air would be produced that would act like a communicating rod between two opposite electrified surfaces, would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> the situations of the charged bodies, and would consequently cause the new situation to counteract the effects produced in the last. This effect would be more sensible in proportion as the exchange has been more rapid, and accordingly we find, that during high winds, the electricity of the atmosphere is very small.*\n\n* Vide Read on Spontaneous Electricity.\n\nMorgan's Lectures, vol. ii.\nMost of the luminous appearances in the atmosphere have of late been attributed to electricity. Of these we shall at present only consider the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, referring the account of other meteors for the article <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METEOROLOGY\">Meteorology</a>.\n\nThe aurora borealis is usually of a reddish colour, inclining to yellow, sending out frequent coruscations of pale light, which seem to rise from the horizon in a pyramidal undulating form, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHOOTING\">shooting</a> with great velocity towards the zenith. This light sometimes appears remarkably red, as it happened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> 5, 1737.\n\nThe aurora borealis appears frequently in the form of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCH\">arch</a>; chiefly in spring and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AUTUMN\">autumn</a>, after a dry year. This arch is partly bright, partly dark, but generally transparent; and no change is found to be produced by it on the rays of light which pass through it. It sometimes produces a rainbow.\n\nThis kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METEOR\">meteor</a>, which becomes more uncommon as we approach towards the equator, is almost constant during the long winter of the polar regions, and appears there with the greatest lustre.\n\nIn the Shetland isles, the merry dancers, as the northern lights are there called, are the constant attendants of clear evenings, and afford great relief amid the gloom of the long winter nights. They commonly appear at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TWILIGHT\">twilight</a>, near the horizon, of a dim colour, approaching to yellow; sometimes continuing in that state for several hours, without any perceptible motion; and afterwards breaking out into streams of stronger light, spreading into columns, and changing slowly into numberless different shapes, and varying in colour from all the tints of yellow, to the most obscure russet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a>. They often cover the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEMISPHERE\">hemisphere</a>, then exhibiting the most brilliant appearance. Their motions at this time are exceedingly quick, and they astonish the spectator with the rapid change of their form. They break out in places where none were seen before, skim briskly along the heavens, are suddenly extinguished, and are succeeded by a uniform dusky tract. This again is brilliantly illuminated in the same manner, and as suddenly becomes a dark space. In some nights, they assume the appearance of large columns, on one side of the deepest yellow, and on the other gradually changing, till it becomes indistinguishable from the sky. They have generally a strong tremulous motion from one end to the other, continuing till the whole vanishes. As for us, who see only the extremities of these phenomena, we can have but a faint idea of their splendour and motions. They differ in colour according to the state of the atmosphere, and sometimes assuming the colour of blood, they make a dreadful appearance. The rustic sages who observe them become prophetic, and terrify the spectators with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAR\">war</a>, pestilence, and famine; nor indeed were these superstitious preludes peculiar to the northern islands: appearances of a similar nature are of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a>; and they were distinguished by the appellations of phaenata, trabea, and bolides, according to their forms and colours. In old times they were either more rare or less frequently noticed; but when they occurred, they were supposed to portend great events, and the timid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> formed of them aerial conflicts.\n\nIn the northern latitudes of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWEDEN\">Sweden</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAPLAND\">Lapland</a>, the aurora borealis is not only an object of pleasing curiosity from the singular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a> of its appearance, but is extremely useful in affording to travellers, by its almost constant effulgence, a very brilliant light. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HUDSON_S_BAY\">Hudson's <a </a>class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BAY\">bay</a>, it is said to possess a variegated splendour, equalling that of the full <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOON\">moon</a>. \"In the north-eastern parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIBERIA\">Siberia</a>,\" says Gmelin, \"these northern lights are observed to begin with single bright <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILLARS\">pillars</a> rising in the north, and almost at the same time in the north-east, which gradually increasing, comprehend a large space of the heavens, rush about from place to place with incredible velocity, and finally almost cover the whole sky up to the zenith, and produce an appearance as if a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-TENT\">tent</a> was spread in the heavens, glittering with gold, rubies, and sapphire. A more beautiful spectacle cannot be painted; but whoever should see such a northern light for the first time, could not behold it without terror. For however fine the illumination may be, it is attended, as I have learned, with such a hissing, cracking, and rushing noise through the air, as if the largest fireworks were playing off. To describe what they then hear, they make use of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> spolochi chodiat, i.e., 'the raging hoist is paling.' The hunters who pursue the white and blue foxes in the confines of the icy sea, are often overtaken with these northern lights. Their dogs are then so frightened, that they will not move, but lie obstinately on the ground till the noise has passed. Commonly clear and calm weather follows this kind of northern lights. I have heard this account, not from one person only, but confirmed by the testimony of many who have spent part of several years in these very northern regions, and inhabited different countries from the Yenisei to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENA\">Lena</a>; so that no doubt of its truth can remain. This seems, indeed, to be the birthplace of the aurora borealis.\"\n\nThis account of the noises attending the aurora borealis, allowing for some degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAGGERATION\">exaggeration</a>, has been corroborated by other testimonies.\n\nSimilar appearances have likewise been observed towards the south pole, and are therefore called aurora australis australis. The best account of these is given by Mr Forster, who in his voyage round the world with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAPTAIN\">Captain</a> Cook, says that he observed them in high southern latitudes, though attended with phenomena somewhat different from those observed here. \"On February 17, 1773, in south lat. 58\u00b0, a beautiful phenomenon (he says), was observed during the preceding night, which appeared again this and several following nights. It consisted of long columns of a clear white light, shooting up from the horizon to the eastward, almost to the zenith, and gradually spreading on the whole southern part of the sky. These columns were sometimes bent sideways at their upper extremities, and though in most respects similar to the northern lights (aurora borealis) of our hemisphere, yet differed from them in being always of a whitish colour, whereas ours assume various tints, especially those of a fiery and purple hue. The sky was generally clear when they appeared, and the air sharp and cold, the thermometer standing at the freezing point.\"\nThe periods of the appearances of the aurora borealis are very inconstant. In some years they occur very frequently, and in others they are more rare; and it has been observed that they are more common about the time of the equinoxes than at other seasons.\n\nDr Halley has given us a sort of chronological history of the appearances which may be ranked under the aurora borealis; but for his account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> cases we must refer to his paper in the Philosophical Transactions Abridged, vol. iv.\n\nThe particular part of the atmosphere in which these appearances take place, or the height above the earth to which they extend, is by no means certain; various philosophers have attempted to ascertain the height of various aurora borealis by trigonometrical calculation; some have estimated them at a few hundreds, others at some thousands of miles above the earth; but the results of their measurements are so contradictory, that they cannot be relied on.\n\n\"Several of the most celebrated inquirers into nature have given their authority to some of the most extravagant theories, in attempting to assign its proper cause to the aurora borealis. Their imaginations have kindled bonfires in the poles of the earth, and they have represented the northern lights as the effects of flames, to which those lights have scarcely any similarity, and from which they are distinguished by numberless diversities.\n\n\"The salt-pits of the north were at one time regarded as emitting a luminous effluvium from their entrails, copious enough to pervade the whole of our northern atmosphere. The discoveries of electricians have confirmed all these reveries to a shade; whence they would never return to excite the wonder of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> philosophers, if the authors of them had not brought forth other productions, whose merits have made even their mistakes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMMORTAL\">immortal</a>.\"\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> which we have for considering the aurora borealis as an effect of electricity, chiefly consists of the following arguments.\n\n1. If lightning be an effect of electricity, the same cause must, at a certain height in the atmosphere, produce such an appearance as is exhibited by the aurora borealis. The passage of the electric matter through air rarefied to a certain degree, is attended with all the undulating coruscations of this meteor. Indeed there is scarcely a single circumstance attending the passage of a spark or a charge through an exhausted tube, that does not bear a resemblance to something observed in the northern lights. The same peculiar motion, the same variety of colour, the same rapid alternations of flashes, occur both in the experiment, and in the natural phenomenon; the streams of light in both are vivid and pointed; and if, in the experiment, the exhaustion has been properly managed, some parts of the light will be marked with that reddish tinge, which in the aurora borealis has so often struck the vulgar mind with terror and consternation. The experiments to which we particularly allude are those of the conducting glass tube, the luminous conductor and the aurora borealis described in No. 188\u2014190.\n\n2. The striking distance of a charge of electric fluid passing through the air, increases according to the rarefaction of that medium. If, therefore, two clouds in opposite states of electricity have no other circuit, it is probable that they will be discharged through the higher regions of the atmosphere, more especially if they are at such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a>, as renders their communication with the earth impracticable.\n\n3. The same causes which tend to produce such an accumulation of electricity in the atmosphere as will bring on a thunder-storm, have been found, in certain seasons, and in the more northern climates, to be attended with an aurora borealis.\n\nIt must be confessed, however, that Mr Brook and Mr Bennet, in their observations on the electricity of the atmosphere during an aurora borealis, could observe no particular signs of increased electricity, more than would have occurred in a serene sky without any such appearance.\n\n4. A magnetic needle commonly appears a little disturbed during a strong aurora borealis.\n\nWe have already hinted at the connection between magnetism and electricity, and we shall fully illustrate this in the article MAGNETISM. Till this connection is fully explained, the force of this last argument can scarcely be seen.\n\nA considerable difficulty attends even the most received theories of the aurora borealis, viz. the light appearing always to strike from the poles towards the equator, rather than in the contrary direction. Perhaps this may be explained in the following manner. We shall assume the three following axioms.\n\n1. That all electrics when considerably heated, become conductors of electricity.\n\n2. That, conversely, non-electrics when subjected to violent degrees of cold, ought to become electrics.\n\n3. That cold must also increase the electric powers of such substances as are already electric.\n\nThe air, all round the globe, at a certain height above its surface, is found to be exceedingly cold, and, as far as experiments have yet determined, exceedingly electrical. The inferior parts of the atmosphere between the tropics, are violently heated during the daytime, by the reflection of the sun's rays from the earth. Such air will, therefore, be a kind of conductor, and much more readily part with its electricity to the clouds and vapours floating in it, than the colder air towards the north and south poles. Hence the prodigious appearances of electricity in these regions, shewing itself in thunder and other tempests of the most terrible kind. Immense quantities of the electric fluid are thus communicated to the earth; and the inferior warm atmosphere having once exhausted itself, must necessarily be recruited from the upper and colder region. This becomes very probable from what the French mathematicians observed when on the top of one of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANDES\">Andes</a>. They were often involved in clouds, which, sinking down into the warmer air, appeared there to be highly electrified, and discharged themselves in violent tempests of thunder and lightning; while in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, on the top of the mountain, they enjoyed a calm and serene sky. In the temperate and frigid zones, the inferior parts of the atmosphere, never being so strongly heated, do not part with their electricity so easily as in the torrid zone, and consequently do not require such recruits from the upper regions; but notwithstanding the difference of heat observed in different parts of the earth near the surface, it is very probable that at considerable heights the degrees of cold are nearly equal all round.\nthe globe. Were there a like equality in the heat of the under part, there could never be any considerable loss of equilibrium in the electricity of the atmosphere; but as the hot air of the torrid zone is perpetually bringing down vast quantities of electric matter from the cold air that lies above it; and as the inferior parts of the atmosphere lying towards the north and south poles do not conduct in any great degree; it thence follows, that the upper parts of the atmosphere lying over the torrid zone will continually require a supply from the northern and southern regions. This easily shews the necessity of an electric current in the upper parts of the atmosphere from each pole towards the equator; and thus we are also furnished with a reason why the aurora borealis appears more frequently in winter than in summer; namely, because at that time the electric power of the inferior atmosphere is greater on account of the cold than in summer; and consequently the abundant electricity of the upper regions must go almost wholly off to the equatorial parts, it being impossible for it to get down to the earth; hence also the aurora borealis appears very frequent and bright in the frigid zones, the degree of cold in the upper and under regions of the atmosphere being much more nearly equal in these parts than in any other. In some parts of Siberia particularly, this meteor appears constantly from October to Christmas, and its corruptions are said to be very terrifying. Travellers agree that here the aurora borealis appears in its greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>; and it is to be remarked, that Siberia is one of the coldest countries in the world. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFIRMATION\">confirmation</a> of this, it may also be observed, that from the experiments hitherto made with the kite, the air appears considerably more electrical in winter than in summer, though the clouds are known to be often most violently electrified in the summer time; a proof, that the electricity naturally belonging to the air, is in summer much more powerfully drawn off by the clouds than in winter, owing to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> of heat.\n\nA considerable difficulty, however, still remains from the upright position which the streams of the aurora borealis are generally supposed to have; whereas, according to our hypothesis, they ought rather to run directly from north to south. Dr Halley answered this difficulty by supposing his magnetic effluvia, (to which he attributed this phenomenon), to pass from pole to pole in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARCHES\">arches</a> of great circles, rising to a great height above the earth, and consequently darting from the places whence they arose like the radii of a circle; in which case, being let off in a direction nearly perpendicular to the surface of the earth, they must necessarily appear erect to those who see them from any part of the surface, as is demonstrated by mathematicians. It is also reasonable to think that they will take this direction rather than any other, on account of their meeting with less resistance in the very high regions of the air than in such as are lower.\n\nBut the greatest difficulty still remains; for we have supposed the equilibrium of the atmosphere to be broken in the daytime, and restored only at night; whereas, considering the immense velocity with which the electric fluid moves, the equilibrium ought to be restored in all parts almost instantaneously; yet the aurora borealis never appears except in the night, although its brightness is such as must sometimes make it visible to us did it really exist in the daytime.\n\nIn answer to this it must be observed, that though the passage of electricity through a good conductor is almost instantaneous, yet through a bad conductor it takes some time in passing. As our atmosphere, therefore, unless very violently heated, is but a bad conductor of electricity; though the equilibrium in it is broken, it can by no means be instantaneously restored. Add to this, that as it is the action of the sun which breaks the equilibrium, so the same action, extending over half the globe, prevents almost any attempt to restore it till night, when flashes arise from various parts of the atmosphere, gradually extending themselves with a variety of undulations towards the equator.\n\nMarum's Van, experiments with the gases, No 166\nexperiments with metals, 172\nexperiments on magnetic needles, 278\nMazeas's, abbe, experiments on atmospheric electricity, 483\nMercurial phosphorus, 14\nMetals fused and oxidated by electricity, 171\nfusibility of, comparative, by heat and by electricity, No 172, and p. 700, note (y).\noxides of, reduced, 174\nfusion of, by lightning not a cold fusion, 454\nMilner's observations on the Leyden phial, 120\nMonnier's experiments on atmospheric electricity, 482\nMorgan's rules for constructing batteries, 112\nfor discharging rods, 118\ndischarging rod, 119\nexperiments on electric light, 182\u2014187\nexperiments on the inflated electrophorus, 209\nexperiments on the non-conducting power of a vacuum, 238\nobservations on the effect of friction, 364\nobservations on the distance at which thunder may strike, 460\nproposal for preventing danger to buildings from lightning, 477\nMultiplier of electricity, 255\nMultiplying wheel, its uses, 41\n\nN\nNairne's electrical machine, method of securing jars, 121\nNeutral points, several in an imperfect conductor, 346\nNeutrality of bodies that are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUNDANT\">redundant</a> or deficient, 313\nNicholson's observations on the electric spark, 130\ninstrument for distinguishing the two electricities, 210\nremarks on excitation, 220\nrevolving doubler, 250\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPINNING\">spinning</a> condenser, 257\nimprovement of Bennet's electrometer, 262\nremarks on the glass case of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DITTO\">ditto</a>, 263\nNitric acid formed by electricity, 165\nNitrous gas decomposed by electricity, 166\n\nNollet's, abbe, electrometer, theory of electricity, conjectures on the identity of lightning and electricity, experiments on electrifying <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>, 527\nNon-conductors.

Suppose Emilius is lazy and inactive, and we wish to make him learn to run. When walking out with the young flibbertigibbet after <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DINNER\">dinner</a>, I would sometimes put a couple of his favourite cakes in my pocket; of these each of us should eat one in the course of our walk. After some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> I would show him I had put a third cake in my pocket.

After seeing this several times repeated, Emilius begins to think himself qualified to obtain the third cake as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as any of the little boys, and to look upon running as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a> of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a>. He seeks an opportunity\nAs children naturally imitate almost whatever they behold, they are often disposed to attempt <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a>. In this our pupil might be obliged, not merely for the sake of the art, but to give him a steady <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a> and a good eye. But he should draw from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, not from other drawings or from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol17.html#article-PRINTS\">prints</a>. Were he to draw the likeness of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a>, he should look at the animal; if to attempt a representation of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>, he should view the house itself. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> he will, no doubt, scratch for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> time without producing any likeness; but he will acquire what we proposed as the ends of his attempting to draw; namely, steadiness of hand and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUSTNESS\">justness</a> of sight, by this method, sooner than by any other.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOMETRY\">Geometry</a>, when taught in the usual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a>, is certainly above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> of children; they cannot go along with us in our reasonings: Yet they are not totally incapable of acquiring even this difficult <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a>; if, when they are prosecuting their amusements, you <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAD\">lead</a> them insensibly to observe the properties of the circle, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIANGLE\">triangle</a>, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> them now and then in circumstances when they may have occasion to apply their knowledge of these to real uses in life.\n\nA child has been taught the various relations between the outlines, surfaces, and contents of bodies, by having cakes set before him, cut into all manner of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> solids; by which means he was led to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> the whole science of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a>, by studying which form contained the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a>.\n\nThere is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUBERTY\">puberty</a>, at which the growth and improvement of our faculties exceed the increase of our desires. About 12 or 13, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPETITE\">appetite</a> for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEX\">sex</a> has not yet begun to make itself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a>, when unnatural wants are yet unknown, no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> appetites yet acquired; at that period, though weak as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a>, as a child the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a> is strong.\n\nThis <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, when the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIVIDUAL\">individual</a> is able to effect more than is necessary for the gratification of his wishes, contains the most precious moments of his life, which ought to be anxiously filled up in an useful manner. This is the best time for employment, for instruction, for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STUDY\">study</a>.\n\nNow, let us begin to consider what is useful; for, hitherto, we have only inquired what was necessary. In entering on our studies, we will make no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of any but such as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTINCT\">instinct</a> directs us to pursue: those which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEDANT\">pedant</a> and the pretended <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> are impelled to pursue solely from the desire of attracting the admiration of mankind, are unworthy of our notice.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> which we inhabit, and the sun by whose beams we are enlightened, are the first objects which claim our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a>. We will therefore <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> the attention of our pupil to the phenomena of nature. We will lead him to the knowledge of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GEOGRAPHY\">geography</a>, not by maps, spheres, and globes: we will lead Emilius out on some beautiful evening to behold the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> sun. Here we take particular notice of such objects as mark the place of his going <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a>. Next <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> we visit the spot to contemplate the rising of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">Education</a> glorious luminary. After contemplating for some time the successive appearances which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCENE\">scene</a> before us affords, and making Emilius observe the hills and the other surrounding objects, I stand silent a few moments, affecting to be occupied in deep <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITATION\">meditation</a>: At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> I <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADDRESS\">address</a> him thus: \"I am thinking, that when the sun set last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">night</a>, it went down yonder; whereas this morning you see he is risen on the opposite of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> here before us. What can be the meaning of this?\" I say nothing more at this time, but rather endeavour to direct his attention to other objects.\n\nThis is our first lesson on cosmography.\n\nOur last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> was made about Midsummer; we will next view the rising sun on some fine morning in the middle of winter. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> observation shall be made on the very same spot which we chose for the former. When Emilius and I perceive the sun now emerging above the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a>, we are struck at the change of the place of his rising. By such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LESSONS\">lessons</a> as these may the pupil be gradually taught a real, not a seeming, acquaintance with the relative motions of the sun and the planets and with geography.\n\nDuring the first period of childhood, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> of education was to spend our time as idly as possible, in order that we might avoid employing it to an ill purpose: but our views are now changed with our pupil's progress in life; and we have scarce enough of time for the accomplishment of our necessary pursuits. We therefore proceed as quickly as possible in making ourselves acquainted with the nature of the bodies around us, and the laws by which their motions and appearances are regulated. We keep to this study at present, as being necessary for the most important purposes in life, and as being the most suitable to the present state of our pupil's powers. We still begin with the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> and obvious phenomena of nature, regarding them as mere facts; and, advancing from these, we come to generalize by degrees.\n\nAs soon as we are so far advanced as to be able to give our pupil an idea of what is meant by the word useful, we have attained a considerable influence over his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUTURE\">future</a> conduct. On every occasion after this, a frequent question between us will be, Of what use is this? This shall be the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> by means of which I shall now be able to render him absolutely submissive to my wishes. However, I will allow him to make use of it in his turn, and will be careful not to require of him to do or learn anything the utility of which he cannot comprehend.\n\nBooks only teach people to talk about what they do not understand. Emilius shall have as little recourse as possible to books for instruction. Yet if we can find a book in which all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> wants of man are <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> in a manner suitable to the understanding of a child, and in which the means of satisfying those wants are gradually displayed with the same ease and simplicity; such a book will be worthy of his most attentive study. There is such a book to be found; but it is neither <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARISTOTLE\">Aristotle</a>, nor Pliny, nor Buffon; it is Robinson Crusoe. Emilius shall have the adventures of Robinson put into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a>: he shall.\nEducation shall imitate his example; even affect his dress; and, like Robinson, learn to provide for himself without the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-AID\">aid</a> of others.\n\nAnother employment of Emilius at this period shall be, to visit the shops of various artisans; and when he enters a shop, he shall never come out without lending a hand to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>, and understanding the nature and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> of what he sees going forward.\n\nStill, however, we are careful to afford not a hint concerning those social relations the nature of which he is not yet able to comprehend.\n\nThe value and importance of the various arts are ordinarily estimated, not according to their real utility, but by a very injudicious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of estimation: those which contribute in a particular manner to the gratification of the fantastic whims of the rich, are preferred to those which supply the indispensable necessities of life. But Emilius shall be taught to view them in a different <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>. Robinson Crusoe shall teach him to value the stock of a petty ironmonger above that of the most magnificent toy-shop in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>. Let us establish it as a maxim, that we are to lead our pupil to form <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> notions of things for himself, not to dictate to him ours. He will estimate the works both of nature and art by their relation to his own convenience; and will therefore regard them as more precious than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>\u2014a shoemaker or a mason, as a man of more importance than the most celebrated jeweller in Europe.\n\nThe intercourse of the arts consists in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCHANGE\">exchange</a> of industry; that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a>, in the exchange of commodities; and that of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, in the exchange of bills and cash. To make our pupil comprehend the nature of these, we have now only to generalize and extend to a variety of examples those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of the nature of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, and of the exchange of property, which we formerly communicated to him. The nature of money, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BEARING\">bearing</a> only a conventional value, which it derives from the agreement of men to use it as a sign for facilitating commerce, may be now explained to Emilius, and will be easily comprehended by him. But go no farther: seek not yet to explain to the child in what manner money has given rise to the numerous chimeras of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> and caprice; nor how countries which abound most in gold and silver, come to be the most destitute of real wealth.\n\nStill our views are directed to bring up our pupil in such a manner that he may be qualified to occupy any place in the order of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> into which even the caprice of fortune can throw him. Let us make him a man; not a slave, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LORD\">lord</a>, or a monarch. How much superior the character of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYRACUSE\">Syracuse</a> turned schoolmaster at Corinth, of a king of Macedon become a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NOTARY\">notary</a> at Rome, to an unhappy Tarquin incapable of supporting himself in a state of independence when expelled from his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a>!\n\nWhatever be our situation in the world, we can contribute nothing but our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> abilities to society. To exert them is therefore the indispensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> of every one who enjoys the advantages of a social state; and to cultivate them in our pupil to the best purpose, ought to be the great aim of every course of education. Emilius has already made himself familiar with all the labours of husbandry; I can therefore bid him cultivate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a> which he inherits from his father. But if it should be lost, what shall be his resource? He shall learn a trade, that he may be provided against such an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a>. And he shall not be a politician, a painter, a musician, or an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ARCHITECT\">architect</a>; to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a> employment for his talents in any of these arts, would cost him no less trouble than to regain his lost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESTATE\">estate</a>. He shall learn some simple <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> art: he will then need only to step into the first shop he sees open, to perform his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a>'s labour, and receive his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-WAGES\">wages</a>.\n\nIt may be here proper to take notice of a mistake into which people generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> in determining the trade or profession in which they are to place their children. Some accident disposes the child to declare himself for a particular employment: the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARENT\">parent</a> regards that as the employment to which his talents are fitted by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of nature; and permits him to embrace it without inquiring whether another would have been more suitable or advantageous. But because I am pleased with my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPATION\">occupation</a>, I am not on that account necessarily qualified for it. Inclinations do not confer abilities. It requires more careful and accurate observation than is generally imagined, to distinguish the particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> with which nature has endowed the mind of a child. We view him carelessly, and of consequence we are apt to mistake casual inclination for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> disposition.\n\nBut Emilius needs not now to hesitate about the occupation which he is to choose. It is to be some mechanical employment. All the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> we have now to make is, to prefer one that is cleanly and not likely to be injurious to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEALTH\">health</a>. We shall make choice of that of a joiner. We cannot dedicate all our time to the trade; but at least for two days in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WEEK\">week</a> we will employ ourselves in learning our trade. We will have no workshop erected for our convenience, nor will we have a joiner to wait on us in order to give us the necessary instructions: but for the two days in every week which we dedicate to the purpose of learning a trade, we will go to our master's workshop; we will rise before him in the morning; work according to his orders; eat at his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>; and, after doing ourselves the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOUR\">honour</a> of supping with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a>, return to our own hard mattresses at night. We shall be treated only according to the merit of our performances. Our master shall find fault with our work when clumsily or negligently done, and be pleased with it only when well executed.\n\nWhile my pupil has been accustomed to bodily <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MANUAL\">manual</a> labour, his education has been hitherto conducted in such a manner as to give him insensibly a taste for reflection and meditation. Before he has been long a workman, therefore, he will begin a trade to become more sensible of that inequality of ranks which takes place in the order of society. He will therefore take notice of his own dependence, and of my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> wealth, and will be desirous to know why I contribute not my personal exertions to society. I put off the question with telling him, that I befoye my fulness of wealth on him and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-POOR\">poor</a>; and will take to make a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENCH\">bench</a> or table every week, that I may not be quite useless to the public.\n\nAnd now, when about to enter the most critical period of life, when just on the brink of that age at which the heart and blood begin to feel the impulse of\nEducation, a new appetite, what progress has our pupil made? what knowledge has he acquired? All his science is merely physical. Hitherto he has scarcely acquired any ideas of moral relations; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENTIAL\">essential</a> relations between men and things he has attentively studied. He knows the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> qualities of certain bodies; but upon those qualities he has not attempted to reason. He has an idea of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSTRACT\">abstract</a> space by means of geometrical figures; of abstract quantity, by means of algebraical signs. He has no desire to find out the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ESSENCE\">essence</a> of things; their relations alone <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> him. He values nothing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> but from its relation to himself. The general consent of mankind, or the caprice of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a>, have not yet given anything a value in his eyes; utility alone is his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> of estimation. He is laborious, temperate, patient, resolute, and bold. His <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMAGINATION\">imagination</a> never exaggerates danger. He scarcely knows as yet what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> is; but should it approach him, he is prepared to submit to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a>. He is virtuous in everything relative merely to himself. He is prepared to become a virtuous member of society as soon as he shall be made acquainted with the nature of his social relations. He is free from vice and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a> as far as is possible for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> nature. He considers himself as unconnected with others; requires nothing from anyone, and thinks none has a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to require anything of him. Sure a youth arrived thus at his fifteenth year has not mispent the period of his infancy.\n\nBut now our pupil has reached the most critical period of life. He now feels the influence of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol16.html#article-PASSION\">passion</a> for the sex; and as soon as we become subject to the influence of that passion, we are no longer unocial beings. The want of a mistress soon produces the want of a friend.\n\nAs hitherto we have been careful not to force or anticipate nature, so even now our attention must be directed to divert the impulses of that dangerous appetite which now begins to make itself felt. To confine the growing passions within proper limits, let it be our care to defer as long as possible the time at which they begin to display themselves. For this purpose, let us cautiously <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> our words and actions in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a> of our pupil. Let us be careful to give him no premature instructions.\n\nTo excite and cherish that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> of mind which now first begins to show itself, to extend the care of the youth beyond himself, and to interest him in the welfare of his fellow creatures, let us be careful to put such objects in his way as have a tendency to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> forth and refine the feelings. It is not possible for the human heart to sympathize with those who are happier than ourselves; our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYMPATHY\">sympathy</a> is moved only by the sight of misery. We pity in others only those distresses to which we ourselves are liable; and our pity for the misfortunes of others is measured, not by the quantity of the evil, but by the supposed sensibility of the sufferer. Let these observations serve to direct us in what manner we are to form the minds of children to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMANITY\">humanity</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPASSION\">compassion</a>.\n\nIn prosecution of our design, to retard rather than accelerate the growth of the passions, let us, when that critical period which we have so much feared comes on, exclude him as much as possible from the intercourse of society, where so many objects appear to inflame the appetites. Let us be circumspect in the choice of his companions, his employment, his pleasures. Let all our care be directed to nourish his sensibility without inflaming his desires. As his moral powers now begin to unfold themselves; in cultivating them let us proceed not by way of lecture, or by directing his attention to books, but still by leading him to acquire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a>. At <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> the period will arrive for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> to him some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> instruction. When he knows the nature of his relations to society, he may be informed of his relation to, and dependence upon, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEITY\">Deity</a>.\n\n[The creed of the Savoyard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CURATE\">curate</a>, containing those sentiments concerning religious matters which Rousseau seems to propose as the most proper to be inculcated on his pupil, comes next in the order of the work; but it does not appear to be so closely connected with the subject of education as to render it proper for us to give a view of it in this place. The sentiments which he there advances, the reasonings which he urges, are evidently hostile to revealed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>; and the power of his eloquence has adorned flighty and superficial arguments with such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHARM\">charm</a>, that even the sternest believer, if not absolutely detestable of taste and feeling, must read them with delight.]\n\nAnd now, notwithstanding all my arts, I can no longer keep back that moment which I have endeavoured to defer to as late a period as possible. As soon as I perceive that it has certainly arrived, I no longer treat Emilus as my pupil or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a>, but as my friend. His affections are now expanded beyond himself; his moral powers have begun to exert themselves, and have received some cultivation; he also is become capable of religious sentiments, and instructed in the nature of his relation to a supreme Being. Besides, it is now requisite, if we consider the period to which nature has conducted him, that he should no longer be treated as a simple child. Hitherto <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> has been his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">guardian</a>, but now he must be restrained by his own good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SENSE\">sense</a>.\n\nNow is the time for me to give him in my accounts; to show him in what manner his time and mine have been employed; to acquaint him with his station and mine, with our obligations to each other, his moral relations, the engagements he has entered into with regard to others, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of improvement which he has attained, the difficulties he will hereafter meet with, and the means by which he may surmount them;\u2014in a word, to point out to him his critical situation, and the new perils which surround him; and to lay before him all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> reasons which should engage him to watch with the utmost attention over his conduct, and to be cautious of indulging his youthful desires.\n\nBooks, solitude, idleness, a sedentary and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFEMINATE\">effeminate</a> life, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of women and young people, employed to be what he must carefully avoid at this age. He has preferably learned a trade, he is not unskilled in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>; the purity of these may be means, but not our only means, for preserving him from the impulse of sensual desire. He is now too familiar with these; he can exercise them without taking the trouble to reflect; and while his hands are busy, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> may be engaged about something quite different from that in which he is employed. He must have some new exercise which may at once fix his attention and cause him to exert his bodily powers.\nWe can find none more suitable for this purpose than hunting. Now, therefore, Emilius shall eagerly join in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHASE\">chase</a>; and though I do not wish him to acquire that cruelty of disposition and ferocity of temper which usually distinguish those who dedicate their lives to that barbarous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVERSION\">diversion</a>, yet at present it may have the happiest effects in suspending the influence of the most dangerous of passions.\n\nWhen I have now conducted my pupil so far; have informed him of what I have done for him, and of the difficulty of his situation; and have resigned my authority into his hands; he is so sensible of the dangers to which he is exposed, and of the tender solicitude with which I have watched over him, that he still wishes to continue under my <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>. With some feigned difficulty I again resume the reins. My authority is now established. I may command obedience; but I endeavour to guard against the necessity of using it in this manner.\n\nTo preserve him from indulging in licentious pleasures, I let him know that nature has designed us for living in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARRIAGE\">marriage</a>, and invite him to go in search of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-COMPANION\">companion</a>. I will describe to him the woman whom he is to consider as worthy of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTACHMENT\">attachment</a> in the most flattering colours. I will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol2.html#article-ARRAY\">array</a> her in such charms, that his heart shall be hers before he has once seen her. I will even <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> her: her name shall be Sophia. His attachment to this imaginary fair one will preserve him from all the allurements of unlawful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOVE\">love</a>. Besides, I take care to inspire him with such reverence for himself, that notwithstanding all the fury of his desires, he will not condescend to pursue the enjoyments of debauchery. And though I may now sometimes intrust him to his own care, and not seek to confine him always under my eye; yet still I will be cautious to watch over his conduct with careful circumspection.\n\nBut as Emilius is to be shortly introduced to his Sophia, it may perhaps be proper for us to inquire into her character, and in what manner she has been brought up.\n\nThere is a natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the two sexes. The difference in the structure of their bodies shows them to be destined by nature for different purposes in life, and must necessarily occasion a distinction between their characters. It is vain to ask which of them merits the pre-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a>: each of them is peculiarly fitted to answer the views of nature. Woman is naturally weak and timid, man strong and courageous; the one is a dependent, the other a protector. As the guardian of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a>, and a restraint on her desires, woman is armed with native <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODESTY\">modesty</a>. Reason is the guide and governor of man. When a man and a woman are united by conjugal vows, a violation of those vows is evidently more criminal in the woman than in the man. The wife ought to be answerable for the genuineness of the offspring with which she has been intrusted by nature. It is no doubt barbarous and wicked for the husband to defraud his wife of the only reward which she can receive for the severe duties of her sex: but the guilt of the faithless wife is still more atrocious; and the consequences of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFIDELITY\">infidelity</a> are still more unhappy.\n\nBut if nature has established an original distinction between the characters of the two sexes; has formed them for different purposes, and assigned them different duties; it must follow, that the education of the one sex ought to be conducted in a manner different from that of the other. The abilities common to the two sexes are not equally divided between them; but if that share which nature has distributed to woman be scantier than what she has bestowed on man, yet the deficiency is more than compensated by the qualities peculiar to the female. When the woman confines herself to assert her proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a>, she has always the advantage over man; when she would usurp those of the other sex, the advantage is then invariably against her.\n\nBut we require not that woman should be brought up in ignorance. Let us consider the delicacy of her sex, and the duties which she is destined to perform; and to these we may accommodate the education which we bestow upon her. While boys like whatever is attended with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> and noise, girls are fond of such decorations as please the eye. Dolls are the favourite plaything of the sex in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANT\">infant</a> years. This is an original taste, of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> of which we have the plainest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a>. All therefore that we ought to do is, to trace and bring it under proper regulation. Allow the girl to decorate her baby in whatever manner she pleases; while employed about that, she will acquire such skill and dexterity in those arts which are peculiar to her sex, that with scarce any difficulty she will acquire <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a> work, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMBROIDERY\">embroidery</a> and the art of working <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LACE\">lace</a>. Her improvements may even be extended as far as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGNING\">designing</a>, an art somewhat connected with taste in dress; but there is no reason that their skill in this art should be carried farther than to the drawing of foliage, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>, flowers, drapery, and such parts of the art as bear some relation to dress. Always assign reasons for the employment which you give to young girls, but be sure you keep them constantly busy. They ought to be accustomed to laborious industry, as well as to bear the abridgement of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>. Use every art to prevent their work from becoming disagreeable to them. For that purpose, let the mother be careful to make herself agreeable. A girl who loves her mother or her aunt, will work cheerfully by them all day; while she to whom her mother is not dearer than all the world besides, seldom turns out well. Never suffer girls, even at their diversions, to be entirely free from restraint, nor allow them to run from one amusement to another. If you now and then detect your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAUGHTER\">daughter</a> using a little artifice to excuse herself from obedience, reflect that artifice is, in a certain degree, natural to the fair sex; and as every natural inclination, when not abused, is upright and good, why should it not be cultivated? In order to give girls proper notions of dress, let them be taught to consider splendour and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEGANCE\">elegance</a> of dress, as designed only to conceal the natural defects of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>; and to regard it as the noblest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIUMPH\">triumph</a>, the highest praise, of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEAUTY\">beauty</a>, to shine with unborrowed lustre in the simplest attire. Forbid not young women to acquire those arts which have a tendency to render them agreeable. Why refuse them the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol12.html#article-INDULGENCE\">indulgence</a> of learning to dance, to sing, and to study such other accomplishments as afterwards enable them to entertain their husbands? Girls are more disposed to prattle, and at an earlier age, than boys. We may now and then find it necessary to restrain their volubility. But the proper question to them on such occasions is not, as to boys,\nAt this early period, when they are yet strangers to the distinction between good and evil, and therefore unable to form a just judgment concerning any person's conduct, we ought to restrain them carefully from saying what may be disagreeable to those with whom they <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSE\">converse</a>.\n\nGirls are no less incapable than boys of forming distinct notions of religion at an early age. Yet, and even for that very reason, religious instruction should be communicated to them much sooner than to the youth of the other sex. Were we to wait the period when their mental faculties arrive at maturity, we might perhaps lose the happiest time, from our inability to make a right distinction. Since a woman's conduct is subject to public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a> ought therefore to depend, not on reason, but on authority. Every girl ought to follow the religion of her mother, every married woman that of her husband. They cannot derive a rule of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a> from their own inquiry. Let us therefore seek, not so much to instruct them in the reasons of our belief, as to give them clear distinct notions of those <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ARTICLES\">articles</a> which we require them to believe. Be more careful to instruct her in those doctrines which have a connexion with morality, than in those mysterious articles which we are required to believe, though we cannot comprehend them.\n\nSuch are the principles on which the education of Emilius's unknown mistress has been conducted.\n\n[Notwithstanding the merit of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of this treatise in which the author entertains us with the courtship between his Emilius and Sophia, it does not appear to be intimately connected with the subject of education as to render it proper for us to present our readers with a view of it. We therefore pass over the courtship, to give a view of our author's sentiments concerning the advantages to be derived from travelling, and the manner in which it ought to be directed.]\n\nWhen Emilius has formed a firm attachment to Sophia, and by his affinities has been so fortunate as to gain her affections, his great wish now is, to be united with her in the bonds of marriage. But as he is still young, is but imperfectly acquainted with the nature of those duties <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCUMBENT\">incumbent</a> on him as a member of a particular society, and is even ignorant of the nature of laws and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOVERNMENT\">government</a>, I must separate him from his Sophia, and carry him to gain a knowledge of these things, and of the character and circumstances of mankind, in various countries, and under various forms of civil government, by travelling. Much has been said concerning the propriety of sending young people to travel, in order to complete their education. The multiplicity of books is unfavourable to real knowledge. We read with avidity, and think that by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> we render ourselves prodigiously wise. But we implore on ourselves: the knowledge which we acquire from books is a false <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of knowledge, that can never render us truly wise.\n\nTo obtain real knowledge, you must observe nature with your own eyes, and study mankind. But to gain this knowledge by travelling, it is not necessary that we should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRAVERSE\">traverse</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>. Whoever has seen ten Frenchmen has beheld them all; and whoever has surveyed and compared the circumstances and manners of ten different nations may be said to know mankind.\n\nTo pretend that no advantages may be derived from travelling, because some of those who travel return home without having gained much real improvement, would be highly unreasonable. Young people who have had a bad education, and are sent on their travels without any person to direct or superintend their conduct, cannot be expected to improve by visiting foreign countries. But they whom nature has adorned with virtuous dispositions, and have been so happy as to receive a good education, and go abroad with a real desire of improvement, cannot but return with an increase of virtue and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-WISDOM\">wisdom</a>. In this manner shall Emilius conduct his travels. To induce him to improve in the most attentive manner that time which he should spend in travelling, I would let him know, that as he had now attained an age in which it might be proper for him to form some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETERMINATION\">determination</a> with regard to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> of his future life, he ought therefore to look abroad into the world, to view the various orders in society, to observe the various circumstances of mankind under different forms of government, and in different parts of the globe; and to choose his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>, his station, and his profession. With these views should Emilius set out on his travels: and with these views, in the course of our travels, we should inquire into the origin of society and government, into the nature of those principles by means of which men are united in a social state, into the various circumstances which have given rise to so many different forms of government, and into the necessary relation between government and manners. Our stay in the great towns should be but short: for as in them corruption of manners has risen to a great height, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISSIPATION\">dissipation</a> reigns, a long stay in any great town might be fatal to the virtuous dispositions of Emilius. Yet his attachment to Sophia would alone be sufficient to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-SAVE\">save</a> him from the dangers to which his virtue is exposed. A young man must either be in love, or be a debauchee. Instances may be pointed out in which virtue has been preserved without the aid of love; but to such instances I can give little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a>.\n\nEmilius, however, may now return to his Sophia. His understanding is now much more enlightened than his when he set out on his travels. He is now acquainted with several forms of government, their advantages and defects, with the characters of several different nations, and with the effects which difference in circumstances may be expected to produce on the characters of nations. He has even been so fortunate as to get acquainted with some persons of merit in each of the countries which he has visited. With these advantages gained, and with affection unchanged and unabated, he returns to his Sophia. After having made him acquainted with the languages, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURAL_HISTORY\">natural <a clas</a>s=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">history</a>, the government, the arts, customs, and manners, of so many countries, Emilius eagerly informs me that the period which we had destined for our travels is now expired. I ask, What are then his purposes for life? He replies, that he is satisfied with the circumstances in which nature has placed him, and with my endeavours to render him independent on fortune, and wishes only for his Sophia to be happy. After giving him a few advices\nadvises for the regulation of his conduct in life, I conduct him to his Sophia, and behold him united with her in marriage. I behold him happy; with affectionate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRATITUDE\">gratitude</a> he blesses me as the author of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>; and I thus receive the reward of all the pains with which I have conducted his education.\n\nSuch are the outlines of the system of education proposed by this singular and original genius. For originality of thought, affecting sentiment, enchanting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>, and bold vehement eloquence, this book is one of the noblest pieces of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPOSITION\">composition</a>, not only in the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a>, but even in the whole compass of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> literature. The irregularity of his method, however, renders it a very difficult task to give an abridged view of his work. He conducts his pupil, indeed, from infancy to manhood: But instead of being merely a system of education, his work is besides a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> of moral and philosophical knowledge. He has chosen a path, and follows it from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> to the summit of the hill: yet whenever a flower appears on the right or left hand, he eagerly steps aside to pluck it; and sometimes, when he has once stepped aside, a new object catches his eye and seduces him still farther. Still, however, he returns. His observations are in many places loyally thrown together, and many things are introduced, the want of which would by no means have injured either the unity or the regularity of his work. If we attempt to review the principles on which he proceeds in reprobating the prevalent modes of education, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTING\">pointing</a> out a new course, his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIMARY\">primary</a> and leading one seems to be, that we ought to watch and second the designs of nature, without anticipating her. As the tree blossoms, the flowers blow, and the fruit ripens at a certain period; so there is a time fixed in the order of nature for the sensitive, another for the intellectual, and another for the moral powers of man to display themselves. We in vain attempt to teach children to reason concerning <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a> and falsehood, concerning right and wrong, before the proper period arrive: We only confound their notions of things, and load their memories with words without meaning; and thus prevent both their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> and moral powers from attaining that strength and acuteness of which they are naturally capable. He attempts to trace the progress of nature; and to mark in what manner she gradually raises the human mind to the full use of all its faculties. Upon the observations which he has made in tracing the gradual progress of the powers of the human mind towards maturity, his system is founded.\n\nAs it is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to communicate to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a> any just ideas of colours, or to the deaf of sounds: so it must be acknowledged, that we cannot possibly communicate to children ideas which they have not faculties to comprehend. If they are, for a certain period of life, merely sensitive animals, it must be folly to treat them during that period as rational and moral beings. But is it a truth that they are, during any part of life, guided solely by instinct, and capable only of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENSATION\">sensation</a>? Or, how long is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a> of that period? Has nature unkindly left them to be, till the age of twelve, the prey of appetite and passion? So far are the facts of which we have had occasion to take notice, concerning the history of infancy and childhood, from leading to such a conclusion, that to us it appears undeniable Education, that children begin to reason very soon after their entrance into life. When the material world first opens on their senses, they are ignorant of the qualities and relations of surrounding objects: they know not, for instance, whether the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> which they look at be near or at a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a>; whether the fire with which they are agreeably warmed may also affect them with a painful sensation. But they remain not long in this state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> ignorance. They soon appear to have acquired some ideas of the qualities and relative situation of bodies. They cannot, however, acquire such ideas, without exerting reasoning powers in a certain degree. Appearances must be compared, and inferences drawn, before knowledge can be gained. It is not sensation alone which informs us of the relative distances of bodies; nor can sensation alone teach us, that the same effects which we have formerly observed will be again produced by the same cause.\n\nBut if children appear capable of reasoning at a very early period, they appear also to be at a very early period subject to the influence of the passions: they are angry or pleased, merry or sad, friends or enemies, even while they hang at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a>; instead of being selfish, they are naturally liberal and social. And if we observe them with candid attention, we will find that the passions do not display themselves sooner than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MORAL_SENSE\">moral sense</a>. As nature has wisely ordered, that we should not see, and hear, and feel, without being able to compare and draw inferences from our perceptions; so it is a no less certain and evident <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> of nature, that the passions no sooner begin to agitate the human breast, than we become able to distinguish the beauty and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFORMITY\">deformity</a> of virtue and vice. The child is not only capable of gratitude and attachment to the person who treats him with kindness; he is also capable of distinguishing between gratitude and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INGRATITUDE\">ingratitude</a>, and of viewing each with proper sentiments. He cries when you refuse to gratify his desires; but he boldly infers that he is injured when you use him cruelly or unjustly. It is indeed impossible to attend to the conduct of children during infancy, without being convinced that they are, even then, capable of moral distinctions. So little are they acquainted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> language, that we and they do not then well understand each other. But view their actions; consider those signs by which nature has taught them to express themselves. Our limbs, our features, and our senses, are not gradually and by piecemeal bestowed as we advance towards maturity; the infant body comes not into the world mutilated or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFECTIVE\">defective</a>: why then, in point of mental abilities, should we be for a while brutes, without becoming rational and moral beings till the fulness of time be accomplished? All the differences between the phenomena of manhood and those of infancy and childhood may be accounted for, if we only reflect, that when children come into the world, they are totally unacquainted with all the objects around them; with the appearances of nature, and the institutions of society; that they are sent into the world in a feeble state, in order that the helplessness occasioned by their ignorance may attract the notice and gain the affluence of those who are able to help them; and that they attain not full strength in the powers, either of mind or body, nor\nEducation, nor a sufficient acquaintance with nature, with artificial language, and with the arts and institutions of society, till they arrive at manhood.\n\nEven Rousseau, notwithstanding the art with which he lays down his system, cannot avoid acknowledging indirectly, on several occasions, that our social dispositions, our rational and our moral powers, display themselves at an earlier period than that at which he wishes us to begin the cultivation of them.\n\nBut though the great outlines of his system be merely <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a>, unsupported by facts, nay plainly contradictory to facts; yet his observations on the impropriety or absurdity of the prevalent modes of education are almost always just, and many of the particular directions which he gives for the conducting of education are very judicious. He is often fanciful, and often deviates from the common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a>, only to show that he is able to walk in a separate path. Yet why should he be opposed with so much virulence, or branded with so many reproachful epithets? His views are liberal and extensive; his heart seems to have glowed with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a>; his book contains much observation of human actions; displays an intimate acquaintance with the motives which sway the human heart; and if not a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> system for education, is yet superior to what any other writers had before done upon the subject. It is surely true, that we ourselves often call forth evil passions in the breasts of children, and impress them with bad habits: it is no less true that we put books in their hands, and load their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMORY\">memory</a> with words, when we ought rather to direct their attention to things, to the phenomena of nature, and the simplest arts of life. The form in which he has chosen to communicate his sentiments on the subject of education renders the perusal of it more pleasing, and his precepts more plain, than they would otherwise have been: it is nearly that dramatic form with which we are so much delighted in some of the noblest compositions of the ancients.\n\nAfter viewing the public establishments for education which existed in some of the most renowned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of antiquity; and after listening to the sentiments of the experienced Quintilian, the learned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILTON\">Milton</a>, the judicious Locke, and the bold fanciful Rousseau, on this interesting subject; it may now be proper to lay before the reader our own sentiments concerning the education of youth under a few distinct heads.\n\nIndeed, if we were disposed to give abridgments of all the books which have been written on the subject of education, or even to hint at all the various modes which have been recommended by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEACHERS\">teachers</a> or theorists; we might swell this article to an amazing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a>: Nay, were we only to take notice of the many elegant and sensible writers who have of late endeavoured to call the attention of the public to this subject, we might extend it to an immoderate length. A Kames, a Priestley, a Knox, a Madame de Sillery, and a Berquin, might well attract and fix our attention. But as, among such a crowd of writers, every thing advanced by each cannot be original; and even of those things which are original, only a certain, and that perhaps even a moderate, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a>, can be just and judicious; and as they often either borrow from one another, or at least agree in a very friendly manner, though in some things they profess a determined <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOSTILITY\">hostility</a>; therefore\n\nwe shall content ourselves with having taken notice of four of the most respectable writers on the subject.\n\nIn prefenting to our readers the result of our own observations and reflections, we shall throw our thoughts nearly under the following heads. The management of children from their birth till they attain the age of five or six; from that period till the age of puberty; and from that age till manhood; private and public education; religion and morals; the languages; <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-NATURAL_PHILOSOPHY\">natural <a class=\"</a>xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILOSOPHY\">philosophy</a>; the education of people of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a> and fortune; education of persons designed for a mercantile employment; and for the other humbler occupations in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> life not particularly connected with literature; education of the female sex; foreign travel; knowledge of the world; and entrance into active life. We do not pretend to be able to include under these heads everything worthy of notice in the subject of education: but under these we will be able to comprehend almost everything of importance that has occurred to us on the subject.\n\nI. On the Management of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol11.html#article-INFANTS\">Infants</a> from the Time of their Birth till they attain the Age of five or six.\n\nThe young of no other animal comes into the world in so helpless a state, or continues so long to need assistance, as that of the human species. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALF\">calf</a>, the lamb, and the kid, are vigorous and lively at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> of their birth; require only, for a very short period, nourishment and protection from their respective dams; and soon attain such degrees of strength and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> as to become entirely independent. The infancy of the oviparous animals is not of longer continuance: And, indeed, whatever department of the animal world we may choose to survey, we still find that no species is subject to the same severe laws as man during the first period of life.\n\nYet the character and the views of man are so very different from those of the other animals, that a more careful attention to these may perhaps induce us to regard this seeming severity rather as an instance of the peculiar kindness of the Author of nature. From every observation which has been hitherto made on the powers and operations of the inferior animals, we are led to consider them as guided and actuated chiefly, if not solely, in reply to instinct, appetite, and sensation: their views extend not beyond the present moment; nor do they acquire helplessness of infancy, new knowledge or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a> as they advance in life. But the character of the human race is much more exalted. We have also powers and organs of sensation, instincts and appetites; but these are the most ignoble parts of our nature: our rational faculties and moral powers elevate us above the brutes, and advance us to an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a> with superior beings. These rational faculties and moral powers render us capable of social life, of artificial language, or art, of science, and of religion. Now, were one of the species to come into the world full grown, possessed of that bodily strength and vigour which distinguishes manhood, his ignorance would still render him inadequate to the duties of life; nay, would even render him unable to procure means for his subsistence: while his manly appearance would deprive him of the compassion and benevolent affluence of others; and his strength and vigour would also render him less docile and obedient than is necessary, in order that\nEducation. that he may receive instruction in the duties and arts of life. Again, were the period of infancy as short to the human species as to the other animals; were we to be no longer subjected to a parent's authority, or protected by his care, than the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIRD\">bird</a> or the quadruped; we should be exposed to the dangers and difficulties of the world before we had acquired sufficient knowledge or prudence to conduct us through them, before we had gained any acquaintance with the ordinary phenomena of nature, or were able to use the language or practice the arts of men in a social state.\n\nSince then, it is by the benevolence of nature that we are feeble and helpless at our entrance into life, and that our progress towards maturity is slow and gradual; since nature has destined us to be for a considerable time under the care and authority of our parents; and since the manner in which we are managed during that early part of life has so important an influence on our future character and conduct: it is therefore incumbent on parents to direct that tenderness, which they naturally feel for their offspring, in such a manner as to second the views of nature.\n\nWhen children come into the world, instinct directs them to receive nourishment from the breast, and to claim attention to their pains and wants by crying. We attend to their signs, and strive to render them as easy as we can. They are walked, clothed with such garments as we think most suitable, and fuddled either by their mother or by some other woman who is considered as proper for the purpose. The absurd mode of swaddling up infants in such a manner as to confine them almost from all motion, and leave scarce a limb at liberty, which has been so often exclaimed against and represented as highly injurious to the symmetry and vigour of the human frame, is now almost entirely laid aside; and therefore we need not raise our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> against it. Still, however, there are certainly too many pins and bandages used in the dress of infants: these are unfavourable to the circulation of the blood, impede the growth, and often occasion those tears and that peevishness which we rashly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> to the natural ill <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMOUR\">humour</a> of the poor creatures. Their dress ought to be loose and cool, so as to press hard on no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a>, nor vein nor muscle; and to leave every limb at liberty. If too heavy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a>, it may occasion too copious a perspiration, and at the same time confine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> perspired on the surface of the skin; than which nothing can be more prejudicial to the health of the child. It may also, however, be too thin and cool: for as moderate warmth is necessary to the vegetation of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a>; so it is no less necessary for promoting the growth of animals: and, therefore, though the dress of infants ought to be loose and easy, yet still it should be moderately warm.\n\nIt is common for mothers in affluent or even in comfortable circumstances, to forego the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> of nursing their own children, that they may avoid the fatigues with which it is attended. This practice has long prevailed in various ages and among various nations: it has been often reproved with all the warmth of passion, and all the vehemence of eloquence, as dishonourable, inhuman, contradictory to the designs of nature, and destructive of natural affection: yet still it prevails; fathers and mothers are still equally deaf to the voice of nature and the declamations of philosophers. Indeed, in a luxurious age, such a practice may be naturally expected to prevail. In such an age, they who are possessed of opulence generally persuade themselves, that, to be happy, is to spend their time wholly amid diversions and amusements, without defending to useful industry, or troubling themselves about the ordinary duties of life. Influenced by such notions, they think it proper for them to manage their family affairs, and to nurse and educate their children, by proxy; nay, to do for themselves nothing that another can perform for them. It is vain to make a serious opposition to these absurd notions; the false views of happiness, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIDE\">pride</a> and the indolence produced by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a>, will still be too powerful for us. We must not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">hope</a> to persuade the mother, that to receive the cares, to behold the smiles, and to mark the bodily and mental powers of her child in their gradual progress towards maturity, would be more than a sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPENSATION\">compensation</a> for all the fatigues which she would undergo in nursing and watching over him in his infant years. We need not mention, that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> affection between a mother and her child, which is partly the effect of instinct, depends also, in no inconsiderable degree, on the child's spending the period of infancy in its mother's arms; and that when she substitutes another in her place, the child naturally transfers its affection to the person who performs to it the duties of a mother. We need not urge these, nor the various other reasons which seem to recommend to every mother the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> of fuddling her own children, and watching over their infant years; for we will either not be heard, or be listened to with contempt. Yet we may venture to suggest, that if the infant must be committed to a stranger, some degree of prudence may be employed in selecting the person to whom he is to be intrusted. Her health, her temper, and her manner of speaking, must be attended to. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of other qualifications are also to be required in a nurse: but it is rather the business of the physician to give directions with regard to these. If her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of body be any way unhealthy, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> of the infant that sucks her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILK\">milk</a> cannot but be injured: if her temper be rough or peevish, the helpless child subjected to her power will be often harshly treated; its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> will be broken, and its temper fouled: if her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PRONUNCIATION\">pronunciation</a> be inarticulate or too rapid, the child may acquire a bad habit when it first begins to exert its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VOCAL\">vocal</a> organs, which will not be easily corrected.\n\nIn the milder seasons of the year, infants ought to be frequently carried abroad. Not only is the open <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a> favourable to health, but the freshness, the beauty, the variety, and the lively colours of the scenes, have even a tendency to enliven and invigorate the powers of the mind. At this period, the faculties of the understanding and the dispositions of the heart generally acquire that particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BIAS\">bias</a>, and those distinguishing features, which characterize the individual during the future part of his life, as quick or dull, mild or passionate; and which, though they be generally attributed to the original <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFORMATION\">conformation</a> of the mind by the hand of nature, yet are owing rather to the circumstances in which we are placed, and the manner in which we are treated, during the first part of life.\n\nWhen children begin to walk, our fondness disposes\nEducation us to adopt many expedients to assist them. But these seem to be improper. It is enough for us to watch over them so as to guard them from any danger which they might otherwise incur by their first attempts to move about. Those who advise us not to be too anxious to preserve children from those slight hurts to which they are exposed from their disposition to activity, before they have acquired sufficient strength or caution, certainly give a judicious piece of advice which ought to be listened to. By being too attentive to them, we teach them to be careless of themselves; by seeming to regard every little accident which befalls them as a most dreadful calamity, we inspire them with timidity, and prevent them from acquiring manly fortitude. When children begin to lip out a few words or syllables, the pleasure which we feel at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> them aim at the use of our language, dispose us to listen to them with such attention as to relieve them from the necessity of learning an open distinct articulation. Thus we teach them to express themselves in a rapid, indistinct, and hesitating manner, which we often find it difficult, sometimes even impossible, to correct, when they are farther advanced. Would we teach them a plain distinct articulation, we ought not only to speak plainly and distinctly in their presence, but also to disregard their questions and requests, if not expressed with all the openness and distinctness of pronunciation of which they are capable.\n\nMan is naturally an imitative animal. Scarce any of our natural dispositions is displayed at an earlier period than our disposition to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMITATION\">imitation</a>. Children's first amusements are dramatic performances, imitative of the arts and actions of men. This is one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> among others, that even in infancy our reasoning faculties begin to display themselves; for we cannot agree with some philosophers that children are actuated and guided solely by instinct in their attempts at imitation.\n\nHowever that be, the happiest use might be made of this principle which discovers itself so early in the infant mind. Whatever you wish the child to acquire, do in his presence in such a manner as to tempt him to imitate you. Thus, without forcing his mind by restraint during this gay innocent period of life, you may begin even now to cultivate his natural powers. Were it impossible at this time to communicate any instruction to the boy, without banishing that sprightly gaiety which naturally distinguishes this happy age, it would be best to think only how he might lose his time in the least disadvantageous manner. But this is far from being necessary. Even now the little creature is disposed to imitation, is capable of emulation, and feels a desire to please those whose kindness has gained his affection. Even now his sentiments and conduct may be influenced by rewards when prudently bestowed, and by punishments when judiciously inflicted. Why then should we hesitate to govern him by the same principles, by which the laws of God and society affect their influence on our own sentiments and conduct? Indeed, the imprudent manner in which children are too generally managed at this early period, would almost tempt us to think it impossible to instruct them, as yet, without injuring both their abilities and dispositions. But this is owing solely to the carelessness, stupidity, or capricious conduct of those under whose education they are placed.\n\nIs implicit obedience to be exacted of children? And what period of life should we begin to enforce it? Whether, as children appear to be capable both of reasoning and when of moral distinctions at a very early age; and as they to be exact are so weak, so inexperienced, so ignorant of the powers of surrounding bodies, and of the language, institutions, and arts of men, as to be incapable of supporting or conducting themselves without direction or assistance; it seems therefore proper that they be required even to submit to authority. To the necessity of nature both they and we must on many occasions submit. But if the will of a parent or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TUTOR\">tutor</a> be always found scarce less unalterable than the necessity of nature, it will always meet with the same respectful submissive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RESIGNATION\">resignation</a>. It may not perhaps be always proper to explain to children the reasons for which we require their obedience: because, as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANGE\">range</a> of their ideas is much less extensive than ours; as they do not well understand our language, or comprehend our modes of reasoning; and as they are now and then under the influence of passion and caprice, as well as people who are farther advanced in life; we are therefore likely to fail in making them comprehend our reasons, or in convincing them that they are well grounded. And as it is proper to exact obedience of children; so we should begin to require it as soon as they become capable of any considerable degree of activity. Yet we must not confine them like slaves, without allowing them to speak, to look, or to move, but as we give the word. By such treatment we could expect only to render them peevish and capricious. It will be enough, at first, if we let them know that obedience is to be exacted; and if we restrain them only where, if left at liberty, they would be exposed to imminent danger.\n\nIf then, at so early a time of life as before the age of five or six, it is possible to render children obedient, and to communicate to them instruction; what art, or what learning, ought we to teach them at that period? To give a proper answer to this question, is no easy matter. It seems at first difficult to determine, whether we ought yet to initiate them in letters. But as their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a> is now quick, and their memory pretty tenacious, there cannot be a more favourable time for this very purpose. As soon as they are capable of a distinct articulation, and seem to possess any power of attention, we may with the greatest propriety begin to teach them the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a>. The most artful, alluring methods may be adopted to render the horrid book agreeable; or we may use the voice of authority, and command attention for a few minutes; but no harshness, no severity, and scarce any restraint. At the same time, it will be proper to allow the little creatures to run much about in the open air, to exercise their limbs, and to cultivate those social dispositions which already begin to appear, by playing with their equals.\n\nSuch are the thoughts which have suggested themselves to us concerning the management of children in mere infancy. What an amiable little creature would the boy or girl be, who were brought up in a manner not inconsistent with the spirit of these few hints? Behold him healthy and vigorous, mild, sprightly, and cheerful!\nEducation ful: He is submissive and docile, yet not dull or timid; he appears capable of love, of pity, and of gratitude. His mind is hitherto, however, almost wholly uninformed: he is acquainted but with a few of the objects around him; and knows but little of the language, manners, and institutions of men: but he feels the impulse of an ardent curiosity, and all the powers of his mind are alive and active.\n\nII. On the Management of Children between the Age of five or six and the Age of Puberty.\n\nAt this period it may be proper, not only to exact obedience, and to call the child\u2019s attention for a few minutes now and then to those things of which the knowledge is likely to be afterwards useful to him: but we may now venture to require of him a regular steady <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a>, during a certain portion of his time, to such things as we wish him to learn. Before this time it would have been wrong to confine his attention to any particular task. The attempt could have produced no other effect than to destroy his natural gaiety and cheerfulness, to blunt the natural quickness of his powers of apprehension, and to render hateful that which you wished him to acquire. Now, however, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> is somewhat different: The child is not yet sensible of the advantages which he may derive from learning to read, for instance; or even though he were able to foresee all the advantages which he will obtain by skill in the art of reading through the course of life; yet is it the character of human nature, at every stage of life, to be so much influenced by present objects in preference to future views, that the sense of its utility alone would not be sufficient to induce him to apply to it. Even at the age of 12, of 20, of 50; nay, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> old age, when reason is become very peripatetic, and the passions are mortified; still we are unable to regulate our conduct solely by views of utility. Nothing could be more absurd, therefore, than to permit the child to spend his time in foolish tricks, or in idleness, till views of utility should prompt him to spend it in a different manner. No; let us begin early to habituate him to application and to the industrious exertion of his powers. By endowing him with powers of activity and apprehension, and rendering him capable of pursuing with a steady eye those objects which attract his desires, nature plainly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> out to us in what manner we ought to cultivate his earlier years. Besides, we can command his obedience, we can awaken his curiosity, we can rouse his emulation, we can gain his affection, we can call forth his natural disposition to imitation, and we can influence his mind by the hope of reward and the fear of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a>. When we have so many means of establishing our authority over the mind of the boy without tyranny or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-USURPATION\">usurpation</a>; it cannot surely be difficult, if we are capable of any moderation and prudence, to cultivate his powers, by making him begin at this period to give regular application to something that may afterwards be useful.\n\nAnd if the boy must now begin to dedicate some portion of his time regularly to a certain task, what task will be most suitable? Even that to which children are usually first required to apply; continue teaching learnt at the him to read. Be not afraid that his abilities will suffer from an attention to books at so early an age. Say not Education that it is folly to teach him words before he have gained a knowledge of things. It is necessary, it is the design of nature, that he should be employed in acquiring a knowledge of things, and gaining an acquaintance with the vocal and written signs by which we denote them, at the same time. These are intimately connected; the one leads to the other. When you view any object, you attempt to give it a name, or seek to learn the name by which men have agreed to distinguish it: in the same manner, when the names of substances or of qualities are communicated to us, we are desirous of knowing what they signify. At the same time, so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a> is the knowledge of nature which children can acquire from their own unassisted observation, that they must have frequent recourse to our affluence before they can form any distinct notions of those objects and scenes which they behold. Indeed language cannot be taught, without teaching that it is merely a system of signs, and explaining what each particular sign is designed to signify. If, therefore, language is not only necessary for facilitating the mutual intercourse of men, but is even useful for enabling us to obtain some knowledge of external nature, and if the knowledge of language has a natural tendency to advance our knowledge of things; to acquaint ourselves with it must therefore be regarded as an object of the highest importance: it must also be regarded as one of the first objects to which we ought to direct the attention of children. But the very same reasons which prove the propriety of making children acquainted with those artificial vocal signs which we use to express our ideas of things, prove also the propriety of teaching them those other signs by which we express these in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>. It is possible indeed, nay it frequently happens, that we attempt to instruct children in language in too improper a manner as to confound their notions of things, and to prevent their intellectual powers from making that improvement of which they are naturally capable; but it is also possible to initiate them in the art of reading, and in the knowledge of language, with better auspices and happier effects. The knowledge of language may be considered as the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KEY\">key</a> by which we obtain access to all the stores of natural and moral knowledge.\n\nThough we now agree to confine our pupil to a certain task, and have determined that his first task shall be meant, how to learn to read; yet we do not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> to require that he be confined to this task during the greatest part of the day, or that his attention be ferociously directed to no other object. To subject him to too severe restraint would produce the most unfavourable effects on his genius, his temper, and his dispositions. It is in consequence of the injudicious management of children, while they are sometimes suffered to run riot, and at other times cruelly confined like prisoners or slaves; it is in consequence of this, that we behold so many instances of peevishness, caprice, and invincible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-AVERSION\">aversion</a> to all serious application at this period of life. But were a due <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> observed, were restraint duly tempered with liberty and indulgence, nothing would be more easy than to dispose children to cheerful obedience, and to communicate to them instruction at this age. That part of their time which they are left to enjoy at liberty, they naturally dedicate to their little sports.\nEducation. The favourite sports of boys are generally active; those of girls, sedentary. Of each we may take advantage, to prepare them for the future employments of life. However, neither are the amusements of boys invariably active, nor those of girls always sedentary; for as yet, the manners and dispositions of the two sexes are distinguished rather by habit or accident than by nature. The disposition to activity which characterizes children, is no less favourable to health than to their improvement in knowledge and prudence; their active sports have a tendency to promote their growth and add new vigour to their limbs. Perhaps, even at this time, children might be enticed to learn the elements of natural philosophy and natural history amid their amusements and sports. Birds, butterflies, dogs, and other animals, are now favourite objects of their care; their curiosity is powerfully roused by the appearance of any strange object; and many of the simplest experiments of natural philosophy are so pleasing, that they cannot fail to attract the attention even of those who are least under the influence of curiosity.\n\nYet it would be improper to insist on their attention to these things as a task: if we can make them regard them as amusements, it will be well; if not, we must defer them to some happier season. They might also, by proper management, be led to acquire some skill in the arts. They build mimic houses, and fill them with suitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a>; they construct little boats, and sail them; they will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FENCE\">fence</a>-in little gardens, and cultivate them; and we even see them imitate all the labours of the husbandman. Such is the pleasure which man naturally feels in exerting his powers, and in acting with design. Let us encourage this disposition. These are the most suitable amusements in which they can engage.\n\nAs the boy's attention to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LITERARY\">literary</a> objects is still supposed to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a>, he will soon be able to read with some correctness and facility. It becomes an object of importance, and of no small difficulty, to determine what books are to be put into his hands, and in what manner his literary education is to be conducted. After the child is made acquainted with the names and powers of the letters, with their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> into syllables, and with the combination of these again into words, so that he can read with tolerable facility; it will be proper that the pieces of reading which are put into his hands be such as are descriptive of the actions of men, of the scenes of external nature, and of the forms and characters of animals. With these he is already in some degree acquainted; these are the objects of his daily attention; beyond them the range of his ideas does not yet extend; and therefore other subjects will be likely to render his talk disagreeable to him. Besides, our present object is to teach him words: in order to teach him words, we must let him know their signification; but till he have acquired a very considerable knowledge of language, till he have gained a rich <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FUND\">fund</a> of simple ideas, it will be impossible for him to read or to hear with understanding on any other subject but these. And let us not as yet be particularly anxious to communicate to him religious or moral instruction, otherwise than by our example, and by causing him to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> in such a manner as we think most proper. Our great business at present is, to make him acquainted with our language, and to teach him in what manner we use it to express our ideas. Education. By his own observation, and by our instruction, he will soon become capable of comprehending all that we wish to communicate: But let us not be too hasty; the boy cannot long view the actions of mankind, and observe the economy of the animal and the vegetable world, without becoming capable of receiving both religious and moral instruction when judiciously communicated.\n\nAs soon as the pupil can read and spell with tolerable facility, and has acquired sufficient strength of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> and fingers to hold a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEN\">pen</a>, it may be proper to initiate him in the art of writing. If this art is not made disagreeable by the manner in which his application to it is required, he will learn it without difficulty. Children's natural disposition to imitate, particularly whatever depends on manual operation, renders this art peculiarly easy and pleasing to them, when they are not harshly forced to apply to it, nor suffered to get into a habit of performing their task with haste and negligence.\n\nIt requires indeed the most cautious prudence, the nicest delicacy, and the most artful address, to prevail with children to give a cheerful and attentive application to any appointed task. If you are too stern and rigid in enforcing application, you may seemingly obtain your object: the child sits motionless, and fixes his eye on his book or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPY\">copy</a>; but his attention you cannot command; his mind is beyond your reach, and can elude your tyranny; it wanders from the present objects, and flies with pleasure to those scenes and objects in which it has found delight. Thus you are disappointed of your purpose; and, besides, inspire the child with such aversion both to you and to those objects to which you wish him to apply, that perhaps at no future period will he view learning otherwise than with disgust.\n\nAgain, gentleness, and the arts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSINUATION\">insinuation</a>, will not always be successful. If you permit the child to apply just when he pleases; if you listen readily to all his pretences and excuses; in short, if you seem to consider learning as a matter not of the highest importance, and treat him with kindness while he pays but little attention and makes but slow progress; the consequences of your behaving to him in this manner will be scarce less unfavourable than those which attend imprudent and unreasonable severity. It is, however, scarcely possible to give particular directions how to treat children so as to allure them to learning, and at the same time to command their serious attention. But the prudent and affectionate parent and the judicious tutor will not always be unsuccessful; since there are so many circumstances in the condition of children, and so many principles in their nature, which subject them to our will.\n\nThe principles of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARITHMETIC\">arithmetic</a> ought to make a part of the boy's education as soon as his reasoning powers appear to have attained such strength and quickness that he will be able to comprehend them. Arithmetic affords more exercise to the reasoning powers of the mind than any other of those branches of learning to which we apply in our earlier years; and if the child's attention be directed to it at a proper period, if he be allowed to proceed slowly, and if care be taken to make him comprehend fully the principles upon which each particular\nparticular operation proceeds, it will contribute much to increase the strength and the acuteness of the powers of his understanding.\n\nWhere the learned languages are regarded as an object worthy of attention, the boy is generally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INITIATED\">initiated</a> in them about this time, or perhaps earlier. We have referred to a separate head the arguments which occur to us for and against the practice of instructing children in the dead languages; and shall therefore only observe in this place, that the study of them ought not to engross the learner's attention so entirely as to exclude other parts of education.\n\nFrom arithmetic our pupil may proceed to the practical branches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol1.html#article-MATHEMATICS\">mathematics</a>; And in all of these, as well as in every other branch of learning, what you teach him will be best remembered and most thoroughly understood, if you afford him a few opportunities of applying his lessons to real life in life. Geometry and geography are two most important branches of education; but are often taught in such a manner, that no real benefit is derived from the knowledge of them. The means which Rousseau proposes for initiating young people in these and in several other of the arts and sciences are excellent; and if judiciously applied, could hardly fail of success.\n\nWhile boys are engaged in these and in the languages, they may also attend to and cultivate the bodily exercises; such as dancing, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FENCING\">fencing</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORSEMANSHIP\">horsemanship</a>. Each of these exercises is almost absolutely necessary for one who is designed to have intercourse with the world; and besides, they have a tendency to render the powers of the body active and vigorous, and even to add new courage and firmness to the mind.\n\nWhen our pupil has acquired some knowledge of his own and of the learned languages, has gained some skill in the principles of arithmetic and of practical mathematics, and has received some instruction in the principles of morality and religion, or even before this time, it will be proper to begin him to the practice of composition. Themes, versions, and letters, the first exercises in composition which the boy is usually required to perform, none of them seems happily calculated for leading him to increase his knowledge, or to acquire the power of expressing himself with ease and elegance. Without enlarging on the impropriety or absurdity of these exercises, we will venture to propose something different, which we cannot help thinking would conduce more effectually to the end in view. It has been already observed, that the curiosity of children is amazingly eager and active, and that every new object powerfully attracts their regard; but they cannot view any object without taking notice of its most obvious qualities; any animal, for instance, without taking notice of its shape, its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a>, its seeming mildness or ferocity; and they are generally pretty ready to give an account of anything <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> which they have observed. How easy then would it be to require them to write down an account of any new object exposed to their observation? The task would not be difficult; and every new piece of composition which they presented to us would add so much to their knowledge of nature. We might even require such specimens of their accuracy of observation and skill in language, at times when they enjoyed no opportunities of beholding new or surprising objects; a tree, a flower, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>, a house, an animal, any other simple object, should be the subject of their exercise. After some time, we might require them to describe something more various and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEX\">complex</a>. They might give an account of several objects placed in a relative situation; as, a stream, and the vale through which it flows; or, a bird, and the manner in which it constructs its nest; or, of one object successively assuming various appearances, as the bud, the flower, the apple. Human actions are daily exposed to their observation, and powerfully attract their attention. By and by, therefore, their talk should be to describe some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> which had lately passed in their presence. We need not pursue this hint farther; but, if we mistake not, by these means young people might sooner, and much more certainly, be taught to express themselves with ease and correctness in writing, than by any of the exercises which they are at present caused to perform with a view to that. Besides, they would at the same time acquire much more real knowledge. The study of words would then be rendered truly subservient to their acquiring a knowledge of things.\n\nWe cannot descend to every particular of that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of education in which we wish the boy to be engaged from that period when he first becomes capable of serious application till he reach the age of puberty. It is not necessary that we should, after having given abstracts of what has been offered to the world by so many respectable writers on the subject.\n\nThe few hints which we have thrown out will be sufficient to show, in general, in what manner we wish the youth's education to be conducted during this period. Let the parent and the tutor bear in mind, that much depends on their example, with regard to the dispositions and manners of the youth; and let them carefully strive to form him to gentleness, to firmness, to patient industry, and to vigorous courage; let them, if possible, keep him at a distance from that contagion with which the evil example of worthless servants and playfellows will be likely to infect him. Now is the time for sowing the seeds of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIETY\">piety</a> and virtue; if carefully sown now, they will scarce fail to grow up, and bear fruit in future life.\n\nIII. From Puberty to Manhood.\n\nThis age is every way a very important period in human life. Whether we consider the change which now takes place in the bodily constitution; or the passion which now first begins to agitate the breast, still we must regard this as a critical season to the youth. The business of those whose care he is still intrusted, is to watch over him so as to prevent the pallion for the sex from hurrying him to shameful and vicious indulgence, and from seducing him to habits of frivolity and indolence; to prevent him from becoming either the shameless rake, or the trifling coxcomb. Though so furious is the impulse of that appetite which now fires the bosom and shoots through the veins of the youth, that to restrain him from the excesses to which it leads can be no easy task; yet if his education has been hitherto conducted with prudence, if he is fond of manly exercises, active, sober,\nEducation, and temperate, and still influenced by modesty and the sense of shame; even this may through the blest- \ning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEAVEN\">heaven</a> be accomplished. It is impossible to give better directions than those of Rousseau for this purpose. Let the young man know his situation; set before him in a striking light the virtue which he may practice by restraining appetite, and the frightful fatal vices into which he may be hurried. But trust not to precept, nor to any views which you can lay before him, either of the disgracefulness and the pernicious consequences of vice, or of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a> and the happy fruits of virtue. Something more must be done. Watch over him with the attention of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARGUS\">Argus</a>; engage him in the most active and fatiguing sports. Carefully keep him at a distance from all such company, and such books, as may suggest to his mind ideas of love, and of the gratification at which it aims. But still all your precautions will not counteract the designs of nature; nor do you wish to oppose her designs. The youth under your care must feel the impulse of desire, and become susceptible of love. Let him then fix his affections on some virtuous young woman. His attachment to her will raise him above debauchery, and teach him to despise brutal pleasures: it will operate as a motive to dispose him to apply to such arts, and to pursue such branches of knowledge, as may be necessary for his future establishment in the world. The good sense of Rousseau on this head renders it less necessary for us to enlarge on it; especially as we are to treat of some articles separately which regard the management of youth at this period.\n\nIV. Religion and Morals.\n\nIn pointing out the general plan of education which appears to us the most proper to be pursued in order to form a virtuous and respectable member of society, we took but slight notice of the important objects of religion and morals. At what period and in what manner, ought the principles of religion and morality to be infilled into the youthful mind? It has been before observed, that children are capable of reasoning and of moral distinctions even at a very early age. But they cannot then comprehend our reasonings, nor enter into our moral distinctions; because they are strangers to our language, and to the artificial manner in which we arrange our ideas when we express them in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> or in writing. It follows, then, that as soon as they are sufficiently acquainted with our language, it must be proper to communicate to them the principles and precepts of morality and religion. Long before this time, they are diligent and accurate observers of human actions. For a short period it is merely the external act which they attend to and observe; soon, however, they penetrate farther; conscious themselves of reflection and volition, they regard us also as thinking beings; conscious of benevolent and of unfriendly dispositions, they regard us as acting with design, and as influenced by passion; naturally imitative animals, they are disposed in their conduct to follow the example which we set before them. By our example we may teach them piety and virtue long before it can be proper to offer them religious or moral instruction in a formal manner.\n\nWe cannot presume to determine at what particular period children ought to be first informed of their relations to God and to society, and of the duties incumbent on them in consequence of those relations. That period will be different to different children, according to the pains which have been taken, and the means which have been employed, in cultivating their natural powers. Perhaps even where the most judicious maxims of education have been adopted, and have been pursued with the happiest effects, it cannot be sooner than the age of eight or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a>. But even before this period much may be done. Show the child your reverence for religion and virtue; talk in his presence, and in the plainest, simplest terms, though not directly to him, of the existence of God the creator, the preserver and the governor of the world; speak of the constant dependance of every creature on the gracious care of that Being; mention with ardour the gratitude and obedience which we owe to him as our great parent and best benefactor; next, speak of the mutual relations of society; of the duties of children and parents, of masters and servants, of man to man. At length, when his mind is prepared by such discourses which have passed in his presence without being addressed to him, you may begin to explain to him in a direct manner the leading doctrines of religion. He will now be able to comprehend you, when you address him on that important subject: the truths which you communicate will make a powerful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> on his mind; an impression which neither the corruption and dissipation of the world, nor the force of appetite and passion, will ever be able to efface.\n\nSome writers on this subject have asserted, that Habit. youth are incapable of any just ideas of religion till they attain a much more advanced age; and have insisted, that, for this reason, no attempts should be made to communicate to them the articles of our creed in their earlier years. This doctrine, both from its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOVELTY\">novelty</a> and from its pernicious tendency, has provoked the keenest opposition. It has, however, been opposed rather with keenness than with acuteness or skill. Its opponents seem to have generally allowed that children are incapable of reasoning and of moral distinctions; but they have ascribed wonderful effects to habit. Enrich the memories of children, say they, with the maxims of morality, and with the doctrines of religion; teach them prayers, and call them to engage in all the ordinances of religion. What though they comprehend not the meaning of what they learn? What though they understand not for what purpose you bid them repeat their prayers, nor why you confine them on the Lord's day from their ordinary amusements? Their powers will at length <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIPEN\">ripen</a>, and they will then see in what they have been employed, and derive the highest advantage from the irksome tasks to which you confined them. You have formed them to habits which they will not be able to lay aside. After this they cannot but be religious at some period of life, even though you have inspired them with a disgust for the exercises of religion. Those good people have also talked of the principle of the affec- \ntion of ideas. As no man stands alone in society, say they; so no one idea exists in the mind single and unconnected with others: as you are connected with your parents, your children, your friends, your coun- \ntrymen; so the idea of a tree, for instance, is connect-\nEducation, ed with that of the field in which it grows, of the fruit which it bears, and of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a>, dissimilar, and resembling objects. When any one set of related ideas have been often presented to the mind in connexion with one another, the mind at length comes to view them as so intimately united, that any particular one among them never fails to introduce the rest. Revisit the scenes in which you spent your earliest years; the spots and companions of your youth naturally arise to your <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOLLECTION\">recollection</a>. Have you applied to the study of the classics with reluctance and constraint, and suffered much from the severity of parents and tutors for your indifference to Greek and Latin; you will, perhaps, never through the course of life see a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GRAMMAR\">grammar</a> school, without recollecting your sufferings, nor look on a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRGIL\">Virgil</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a> without remembering the stripes and confinement which they once occasioned to you. In the same manner, when religious principles are impressed on the mind in infancy in a proper manner, a happy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ASSOCIATION\">association</a> is formed which cannot fail to give them a powerful influence on the sentiments and conduct in a future life. But if we have advanced to manhood before being informed of the existence of a Deity, and of our relation to him; the principles of religion, when communicated, no longer produce the same happy effects: the heart and the understanding are no longer in the same state; nor will the same associations be formed.\n\nThis doctrine of the association of ideas has been introduced by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-INGENIOUS\">ingenious</a> writer, distinguished for his discoveries in natural philosophy, and for his labours in controversial <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIVINITY\">divinity</a>, as an argument in behalf of the propriety of instructing youth in the principles of religion even in their earliest years. We admire, we esteem, the spirit which has prompted him to discover so much concern for the interests of the rising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATION\">generation</a>; but at the same time we will not conceal our opinion, that even this argument ought to be urged with caution. Many of the phenomena of human nature may indeed be explained, if we have recourse to the principle of association. The influence of any principle, religious or moral, depends in a great measure on the ideas and images which, in considering it, we have been accustomed to associate with it in our minds. But what are the ideas or images most likely to be associated by children with the doctrines and duties of religion, if we call them to listen to the one and perform the other at too early a period? Will they be such as may affect the influence of religion on their sentiments and conduct in the future part of life? Observe the world: Are those who, in infancy, have been most rigidly compelled to get their catechisms by rote, either the most pious or the best informed in religious matters? Indeed, when we consider what has been said of the influence of habit, and of the association of ideas, we cannot help thinking, that any arguments which on the present occasion may be adduced from either of these, tend directly to prove, not that we ought to pour in religious instruction into the minds of children, without considering whether they be qualified to receive it; but, on the contrary, that we ought cautiously to wait for and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CATCH\">catch</a> the proper season\u2014that season when the youthful mind, no longer a stranger to our language, our sentiments, our views of nature, or our manner of reasoning, will be able to go along with us, when we talk to him of a supreme Being, or our condition as dependent and accountable creatures, of truth, benevolence, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-JUSTICE\">justice</a>.\n\nWe flatter ourselves, then, that our readers will readily agree with us, 1st, That the moral and reasoning powers of children begin to display themselves at a very early age, even in infancy, 2dly, That as soon as they have made themselves acquainted with the most obvious appearances of nature, and have gained a tolerable knowledge of our language and our manner of arranging our ideas in reasoning, we may with the greatest propriety begin to instruct them in the principles of religion, 3dly, That the most careful and judicious observation is necessary to enable us to distinguish the period at which children become capable of receiving religious instruction; because, if we either attempt to communicate to them these important truths too early, or defer them till towards manhood, we may fail of accomplishing the great end which we have in view.\n\nIf we can be so fortunate as to choose the happiest season for sowing the first seeds of piety in the infant mind, our next care will be to sow them in a proper manner. We must anxiously endeavour to communicate the principles of religion and morality, so as they may be easiest comprehended by the understanding of the learner, and may make the deepest impression on his heart. It would be a matter of the greatest difficulty to give particular directions on this head. The discretion of the parent or tutor must here be his guide. We are afraid that some of the catechisms commonly taught are not very happily calculated to serve the purpose for which they are intended. Yet we do not wish that they should be neglected while nothing more proper is introduced in their room. In instructing children in the first principles of religion, we must beware of arraying piety in the gloomy garb, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAINTING\">painting</a> her with the forbidding features, in which she has been represented by anchorites, monks, and puritans. No; let her assume a pleasing form, a cheerful dress, and an inviting manner. Describe the Deity as the affectionate parent, the benefactor, and though the impartial yet the merciful judge of mankind. Exhibit to them <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JESUS\">Jesus</a> Christ, the generous friend and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVIOUR\">Saviour</a> of the posterity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADAM\">Adam</a>, who with such enchanting benevolence hath said, \"Suffer little children to come unto me.\" Represent to them his yoke as easy, and his burden as light. Inflict not on their laying long prayers or hearing tedious sermons. If possible, make the doctrines of religion to appear to them as glad tidings, and its duties as the most delightful of tasks.\n\nV. The Languages.\n\nIs the time usually spent in learning the languages usefully occupied? What advantages can our British youth derive from an acquaintance with the languages and the learning of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GREECE\">Greece</a> and Rome? Would we listen to many of the fathers, the mothers, and the polite tutors of the present age, they will persuade us, that the time which is dedicated to grammar-schools, and to Virgil, Cicero, Homer, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEMOSTHENES\">Demosthenes</a>, is foolishly thrown away; and that no advantages\nEducation advantages can be gained from the study of classical learning. They with their children and pupils to be not merely scholars; they with them to acquire what may be useful and ornamental when they come to mingle with the world; and for this purpose, they think it much better to teach their young people to smatter out French, to dance, to fence, to appear in company with invincible assurance, and to dress in such a manner as may attract the attention of the ladies. Besides, the tenderness and humanity of those people are amazing. They are shocked at the idea of the sufferings which boys undergo in the course of a classical education. The confinement, the stripes, the harsh language, the burdens laid on the memory, and the pain occasioned to the eyes, during the dreary period spent in acquiring a knowledge of Greek and Latin, affect them with horror when they think of them as inflicted on children. They therefore give the preference to a plan of education in which less intense application is required and less severity employed.\n\nBut, again, there are others who are no less warm in their eulogiums on a classical education, and no less industrious in recommending the study of Greek and Latin, than those are eager in their endeavours to draw neglect on the polished languages of antiquity. With this second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a>, if an adept in Greek and Latin, you are a great and learned man; but without those languages, contemptible for ignorance. They think it impossible to inspire the youthful mind with generous or virtuous sentiments, to teach the boy wisdom, or to animate him with courage, without the assistance of the ancient philosophers, historians, and poets. Indeed their superstitious reverence for the ancient languages, and for those writers whose compositions have rendered Greece and Rome so illustrious, leads them to ascribe many other still more wonderful virtues to a classical education.\n\nWith which of these parties shall we join? or shall we mediate between them? Is it improper to call youth to the study of the languages? Is it impossible to communicate any useful knowledge without them? Or are they, though highly useful, yet not always indispensably necessary?\n\nWe have formerly taken notice of one circumstance in favour of a classical education, to which it may be proper to recall the attention of our readers. We observed, that the cultivation of classical learning has a favourable influence on the living languages. It has a tendency to preserve their purity from being debauched, and their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a> from becoming <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRREGULAR\">irregular</a>. In studying the dead languages, we find it necessary to pay more attention to the principles of grammar than in acquiring our mother tongue. We learn our native language without attending much to its analogy and structure. Of the numbers who speak English through the British dominions, but few are skilled in the inflection of its nouns and verbs, or able to distinguish between <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol8.html#article-ADVERBS\">adverbs</a> and conjunctions. Delirious only of making their meaning understood, they are not anxious about purity or correctness of speech. They reject not an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPRESSION\">expression</a> which occurs to them, because it is barbarous or ungrammatical. As they grew up they learned to speak from their mothers, their nurses, and others about them; they were soon able to make known their wants, their wishes, and their observations, in words. Satisfied with this, or called at a very early period to a life of humble industry, they have continued to express themselves in their mother tongue without acquiring any accurate knowledge of its general principles. If these people find occasion to express themselves in writing, they are scarce more studious of correctness and elegance in writing than in speaking; or, though they may aspire after those properties, yet they can never attain them. But such writers or speakers can never refine any language, or reduce it to a regular analogy. Neither can they be expected to distinguish themselves as the guardians of the purity and regularity of their native tongue, if it should before have attained a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>. But they who, in learning a language different from their native tongue, have found it necessary to pay particular attention to the principles of grammar, afterwards apply the knowledge of grammar which they have thus acquired in using their mother tongue; and by that means become better acquainted with its structure, and learn to write and speak it with more correctness and propriety. Besides, the languages of Greece and Rome are so highly distinguished for their copiousness, their regular analogy, and for various other excellencies, which render them superior to even the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of modern languages, that the study of them has a natural tendency to improve and enrich modern languages. If we look backwards to the 15th <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, when learning began to revive in Europe, and that species of learning which began first to be cultivated was classical literature, we find that almost all the languages then spoken in Europe were wretchedly poor and barbarous. Knowledge could not be communicated, nor business transacted, without calling in the aid of Latin. Classical learning, however, soon came to be cultivated by all ranks with enthusiastic eagerness. Not only those designed to pursue a learned profession, and men of fortune whose object was a liberal education without a view to any particular profession; but even the lower ranks, and the female sex, keenly studied the languages and the wisdom of Greece and Rome. This avidity for classical learning was followed by many happy effects. But its influence was chiefly remarkable in producing an amazing change on the form of the living languages. These soon became more copious and regular; and many of them have consequently attained such perfection, that the poet, the historian, and the philosopher, can clothe their thoughts in them to the greatest advantage. Could we derive no new advantage from the study of the ancient languages, yet would they be worthy of our care, as having contributed so much to raise the modern languages to their present improved state. But they also conduce to the preservation and support of those noble structures which have been reared by their affluence. The intercourse of nations, the association of writers, the gradual introduction of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROVINCIAL\">provincial</a> barbarisms, and various other causes, have a tendency to corrupt and debauch even the noblest languages. By such means were the languages of Greece and Rome gradually corrupted, till the language used by a Horace, a Livy, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-XENOPHON\">Xenophon</a>, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENANDER\">Menander</a>, was lost in a jargon unfit for the purposes of composition. But if we would not disdain to take advantage of them, the classical works in those languages might prevent\nEducation prevent that which we use from experiencing such a decline. He who knows and admires the excellencies of the ancient languages, and the beauties of those writers who have rendered them so celebrated, will be the firm enemy of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARBARISM\">barbarism</a>, affectation, and negligence, whenever they attempt to debauch his mother tongue. We venture therefore to assert, that when the polished languages of antiquity cease to be studied among us, our native tongue will then lose its purity, regularity, and other excellencies, and gradually decline till it be no longer known for the language of Pope and Addison; and we adduce it as an argument in behalf of classical learning, that it has contributed so much to the improvement of the living languages, and is almost the only means that can prevent them from being corrupted and debased.\n\nIn those plans of education of which the study of industry, the dead languages does not make a part, proper means are seldom adopted for impressing the youthful mind with habits of industry; nor do the judgment, memory, and the other powers of the mind, receive equal improvement, as they pass not through the same exercises as in a classical education. Let us enter those academies where the way to a complete education leads not through the thorny and rugged paths of classical literature; let us attend to the exercises which the polite teachers cause their pupils to perform. Do they infuse laborious industry or intense application? No; they can communicate knowledge without requiring laborious study. They profess to allow their pupils to enjoy the sweets of idleness, and yet render them prodigies of learning. But are their magnificent promises ever fulfilled? Do they indeed cultivate the understandings of the young people intrusted to their care? They do not: their care is never once directed to this important object. To adorn them with flowery and superficial qualities, is all that those gentlemen aim at. Hence, when their pupils come to enter the world and engage in the duties of active life, they appear destitute of every manly qualification. Though they have attained the age and grown up to the size of manhood, their understandings are still childish and feeble: they are capricious, unsteady, incapable of industry or fortitude, and unable to pursue any particular object with keen, unremitting perseverance. That long series of study and regular application, which is requisite in order to attain skill in the ancient languages, produces much happier effects on the youthful mind. The power of habit is universally felt and acknowledged. As he who is permitted to trifle away the earliest part of his life in idleness or in frivolous occupations, can scarcely be expected to display any manly or vigorous qualities when he reaches a more mature age; so, on the contrary, he whose earlier days have been employed in exercising his memory and furnishing it with valuable treasures, in cultivating his judgment and reasoning powers by calling the one to make frequent distinctions between various objects, and the other to deduce many inferences from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMPARISON\">comparison</a> of the various objects presented to the understanding, and also in strengthening and improving the acuteness of his moral powers by attending to human actions and characters, and distinguishing between them, as virtuous or vicious, as mean or glorious: he who has thus cultivated his powers, may be naturally expected to distinguish himself when he comes to perform his part in active life, by prudence, activity, firmness, perseverance, and most of the other noble qualities which can adorn a human character. But in the course of a classical education, the powers of the mind receive this cultivation; and therefore these happy effects may be expected to follow from it. The repetitions which are required afford improving exercise to the memory, and store it with the most valuable treasures; the powers of the understanding are employed in observing the distinctions between words; in tracing words to the substances and qualities in nature which they are used to represent; in comparing the words and idioms of different languages, and in tracing the laws of their analogy and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a>; while our moral faculties are at the same time improved by attending to the characters which are described, and the events and actions which are related, in those books which we are directed to peruse in order to acquire the ancient languages. We assert therefore that the study of the ancient languages is particularly useful for improving and strengthening all the powers of the mind: and, by that means, for preparing us to act our part in life in a becoming manner; and this our readers will readily agree with us in considering as a weighty argument in behalf of that plan of education.\n\nBut if, after all, classical learning is still to be given up, where shall we find the same treasures of moral and elegant wisdom, of elegance, and of useful historical knowledge, which the celebrated writers of Greece and Rome afford? Will you content yourself with the modern writers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ITALY\">Italy</a>, France, and England? Or will you deign to survey the beauties of Homer and Virgil through the medium of a translation? No surely; let us penetrate to those sources from which the modern writers have derived most of the excellencies which recommend them to our notice; let us disdain to be imposed upon by the whims or the ignorance of a translator.\n\nFarther, classical learning has long been cultivated among us; and both by the stores of knowledge which it has conveyed to the mind, and the habits which it has impressed, has contributed in no small degree to form many illustrious characters. In reviewing the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANNALS\">annals</a> of our country, we will scarce find an eminent politician, patriot, general, or philosopher, during the two last centuries, who did not spend his earlier years in the study of the classics.\n\nYet though we have mentioned these things in favour of classical literature, and were we to descend to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> particulars might enumerate many more facts and circumstances to recommend it; we mean not to argue that it is absolutely impossible to be a wife, a great, or a good man, unless you are skilled in Greek and Latin. Means may, no doubt, be adopted to inspire the young mind with virtuous dispositions, to call forth the powers of the youthful understanding, and to improve habits of industry and vigorous perseverance, without having recourse to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> of a grammar school. But we cannot help thinking, for the reasons which we have stated to our readers, that a classical education is the most likely to produce these happy effects.\nAs we are afterwards to take particular notice of the course of education most suitable for those who are to occupy the humble stations in society, we shall not here inquire whether it be proper to introduce them to an acquaintance with the Greek and Latin classics.\n\nVI. On the Education of People of Rank and Fortune.\n\nThose whom the kindness of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROVIDENCE\">providence</a> has placed in an elevated station, and in affluent circumstances, so that they seem to be born rather to the enjoyment of wealth and honours than to act in any particular profession or employment, have notwithstanding a certain part assigned them to perform, and many important duties to fulfil. They are members of society, and enjoy the protection of the civil institutions of that society to which they belong; they must therefore contribute what they can to the support of those institutions. The labours of the industrious poor are necessary to supply them with the luxuries of life; and they must know how to distribute their wealth with prudence and generosity among the poor. They enjoy much leisure; and they ought to know how to employ their leisure <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a> in an innocent and agreeable manner. Besides, as their circumstances enable them to attract the regard and respect of those who are placed in inferior stations, and as the poor are ever ready to imitate the conduct of their superiors; it is necessary that they endeavour to adorn their wealth and honours by the most eminent virtues, in order that their example may have a happy influence on the manners of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNITY\">community</a>.\n\nTheir education ought therefore to be conducted with a view to these ends. After what we have urged in favour of a classical education, our readers will naturally presume that we regard it as highly proper for a man of fortune. The youth who is destined to the enjoyment of wealth and honours, cannot spend his earlier years more advantageously than in gaining an acquaintance with the elegant remains of antiquity. The benefits to be derived from classical learning are particularly necessary to him. Care must be taken to preserve him from acquiring a haughty, fierce, imperious temper. The attention usually paid to the children of people of fortune, and the foolish fondness with which they are too often treated, have a direct tendency to inspire them with high notions of their own importance, and to render them passionate, overbearing, and conceited. But if their temper acquire that bias even in childhood, what may be expected when they advance towards manhood, when their attention is likely to be oftener turned to the dignity and importance of that rank which they occupy, and to the pitiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMILITY\">humility</a> of those beneath them? Why, they are likely to be so proud, insolent, resentful, and revengeful, as to render themselves disagreeable and hateful to all who know them; and besides, to be incapable of those delightful feelings which attend humane, benevolent, and mild dispositions. Let the man of fortune, therefore, as he is concerned for the future happiness and dignity of his child, be no less careful to prevent him from being treated in such a manner as to be inspired with haughtiness, caprice, and insolence, than to prevent his mind from being soured by harsh and tyrannical usage.\n\nThe manly exercises, as they are favourable to the health, the strength, and even the morals; so they are highly worthy of engaging the attention of the young <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol10.html#article-GENTLEMAN\">gentleman</a>. Dancing, fencing, running, horsemanship, the management of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MUSKET\">musket</a>, and the motions of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> discipline, are none of them unworthy of occupying his time, at proper seasons. It is unnecessary to point out the advantages which he may derive from dancing; these seem to be pretty generally understood. Perhaps our men of fortune would be ashamed to make use of their legs for running; but occasions may occur, on which even this humble accomplishment may be useful. Though we wish not to see the young man of fortune become a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOCKEY\">jockey</a>; yet to be able to make a graceful appearance on horseback, and to manage his horse with dexterity, will not be unworthy of his station and character. If times of public danger should arise, and the state should call for the services of her subjects against any hostile attack, they whose rank and fortune place them in the most eminent stations will be first expected to stand forth; but if unacquainted with those exercises which are connected with the military art, what a pitiful <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> must they make in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a>, or on the field of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a>?\n\nAs the man of fortune may perhaps enjoy by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HEREDITARY\">hereditary</a> right, or may be called by the voice of his fellow citizens, to a seat among the legislative body of his country; he ought in his youth to be carefully instructed in the principles of her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> constitution, and of those laws by which his own rights and the rights of his fellow citizens are determined and secured.\n\nNatural philosophy, as being both highly useful and entertaining, is well worthy of the attention of all who can afford to appropriate any part of their time to scientific pursuits; to the man of fortune, a taste for natural philosophy might often procure the most delightful entertainment. To trace the wonders of the planetary systems, to mark the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of vegetation, to examine all the properties of that fine element which we breathe, to trace the laws by which all the different elements are confined to their proper functions, and above all to apply the principles of natural philosophy in the cultivation of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, are amusements which might agreeably and innocently occupy many of the leisure hours of the man who enjoys a splendid and independent fortune.\n\nNeither do we suppose civil history and the principles of morals to be overlooked. Without being acquainted with these, how could any just or accurate knowledge of the laws and political constitution of his country be acquired by the young gentleman? History exposes to our observation the fortune and the actions of other human beings, and thus supplies in some measure the place of experience; it teaches prudence, and affords exercise to the moral sense. When history condescends to take notice of individuals, they are almost always such as have been eminent for virtue, for abilities, or for the rank which they held in life; to the rich and great it ought to speak with peculiar efficacy, and they ought to be carefully invited to listen to its voice.\n\nSuch then is the manner in which we wish the education of young men of rank and fortune to be conducted.\nEducation ducted, in order that they may be prepared for enjoying their opulence and honours with becoming dignity. Let them be early inured to habits of vigorous industry and persevering firmness, by passing through a regular course of classical learning in a free school; let them play and converse with their equals, and not be permitted to form high ideas of their own importance, nor to domineer over servants or inferiors: Let them be carefully instructed in the principles of morality and religion: Let them be taught the manly exercises: Let them be carefully informed of the nature of the political constitution of their country, and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of those civil and political rights which it secures to them and their fellow citizens: Let them be called to trace the annals of mankind through the records of history; to mark the appearances and operations of nature, and to amuse themselves by pursuing these to their general causes. We say nothing of causing the young man of fortune to learn some mechanical art: We think skill in a mechanical art might now and then afford him an innocent and pleasing amusement; but we do not consider it as absolutely necessary, and therefore do not insist on his acquiring it. With those accomplishments we hope he might become a useful member of society, might adorn the rank and fortune to which he is born, and might find wealth and high station a blest, not a curse. It is peculiarly unfortunate for our age and country, that people of rank and fortune are not so studious that their children acquire these as the more superficial accomplishments.\n\nVII. On the Education of People designed for a Mercantile Employment, and for the humbler Occupations in Life not particularly connected with Literature.\n\nWere modern literature in a less flourishing state; were the English and French languages adorned with fewer eminent poetical, historical, and philosophical compositions; we might perhaps insist on it as necessary to give the boy, who is designed for a mercantile employment, a classical education. At present this does not appear absolutely necessary; yet we do not presume to forbid it as improper. Even the merchant will scarce find reason to resent his having been introduced to the acquaintance of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLATO\">Plato</a> and Cicero. But still, if the circumstances of the parent, or any other just reason, should render it inconvenient, to send the young man who is intended for trade to a free school to study the ancient languages, means may be easily adopted to make up for his loss. Confine him not to writing and accounts alone. These, though particularly useful to the merchant, have no great power to restrain the force of evil passions, or to inspire the mind with generous and virtuous sentiments. Though you burden him not with Latin and Greek, yet strive to inspire him with a taste for useful knowledge and for elegant literature. Some of the purest and most elegant of our poets, the excellent periodical works which have appeared in our language, such as the Spectator, the Adventurer, the Mirror, and the compositions of our British historians, together with some of the best translations of the classics which we possess; these you may with great propriety put into his hands. They will teach him how to think and reason justly, and to express himself in conversation or in writing with correctness and elegance: they will refine and polish his mind, and raise him above low and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GROSS\">gross</a> pleasures. And as no man, who has any occasion to speak or write, ought to be entirely ignorant of the principles of grammar, you will therefore be careful to instruct the young man who is destined for a mercantile occupation in the grammar of his mother tongue.\n\nA sacred regard to his engagements, and an honesty Integrity, which may prevent him from taking undue advantages or exacting unreasonable profits, are the virtues which a merchant is most frequently called to exercise: punctuality and integrity are the duties most particularly incumbent on the mercantile profession. Temptations will now and then arise to seduce the merchant to the violation of these. But if superior to every such temptation, he is one of the most illustrious characters, and is likely to be one of the most successful merchants. From his earliest years, then, labour to inspire the child whom you intend for trade with a sacred regard for truth and justice: let him be taught to view deceit and fraud, and the violation of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a>, with abhorrence and disdain. Frugality is a virtue which, in the present age, seems to be antiquated or prohibited. Even the merchant often appears better skilled in the arts of profusion than in those of parsimony. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MISER\">miser</a>, a character at no time viewed as amiable, is at present beheld with double detestation and contempt. Yet, notwithstanding these unfavourable circumstances, fear not to impress upon the young merchant habits of frugality. Let him know the folly of beginning to spend a fortune before he have acquired it. Let him be taught to regard a regular attention to confine his expenses within due bounds, as one of the first virtues which can adorn his character.\n\nFrugality and industry are so closely connected, that when we recommend the one of them to the merchant, we will be naturally understood to recommend the other also. It is easy to see, that without industrious application, no man can reasonably expect to meet with success in the occupation in which he engages; and if the merchant thinks proper to leave his business to the management of clerks and shop-keepers, it is not very probable that he will quickly accumulate a fortune. It is, therefore, no less necessary, that he who is intended for trade be early accustomed to habits of sober application, and be carefully restrained from volatility and levity, than that he be instructed in writing, arithmetic, and keeping of accounts.\n\nWith these virtues and qualifications the merchant is likely to be respectable, and not unsuccessful, while he continues to prosecute his trade: and if, by the blessing of Providence, he be at length enabled to accumulate a moderate fortune, his acquaintance with elegant literature, and the various habits which he has acquired, will enable him to enjoy it with taste and dignity. Indeed, all the advantages which a man without taste, or knowledge, or virtue, can derive from the possession of even the most splendid fortune, are so inconsiderable, that they can be no adequate reward for the toil which he undergoes, and the mean arts which he practises in acquiring it. At the head of a great fortune a fool can only make himself more ridiculous, and a man of wicked\nEducation, wicked and vicious character more generally abhorred, than if fortune had kindly concealed their crimes and follies by placing them in a more obscure station.\n\nA considerable part of the members of society are placed in such circumstances, that it is impossible for them to receive the advantages of a liberal education. The mechanic and the husbandman, who earn a subsistence by their daily labour, can seldom afford, whatever parental fondness may suggest, to favour their children with many opportunities of literary instruction. Content if they can provide them with food and raiment till such time as they acquire sufficient strength to labour for their own support, parents in those humble circumstances seldom think it necessary that they should concern themselves about giving their children learning. Happily, it is not requisite that those who are destined to spend their days in this low <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> should be furnished with much literary or scientific knowledge. They may be taught to read their mother tongue, to write, and to perform some of the most common and the most generally useful operations of arithmetic; for without an acquaintance with the art of reading, it will scarce be possible for them to acquire any rational knowledge of the doctrines and precepts of religion, or of the duties of morality; the invaluable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the sacred Scriptures would be sealed to them; we may allow them to write, in order that they may be enabled to enjoy the sweet satisfaction of communicating accounts of their welfare to their absent friends; and, besides, both writing and arithmetic are necessary for the accomplishment of those little transactions which pass among them. It would be hard, if even the lowest and poorest were denied the simple and easily acquired branches of education; and happily that degree of skill in them which is necessary for the labourer and the mechanic may be attained without greater expense than may be afforded by parents in the meanest circumstances. Let the youth who is born to pass his days in this humble station be carefully taught to consider honest patient industry as one of the first of virtues; let him be taught to regard the flaggard as one of the most contemptible of characters; teach him contentment with his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOT\">lot</a>, by letting him know that wealth and honour seldom confer superior happiness; yet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SCRUPLE\">scruple</a> not to inform him, that if he can raise himself above the humble condition to which he was born, by honest arts, by abilities virtuously exerted, he may find some comfort in affluent circumstances, and may find reason to rejoice that he has been virtuous, industrious, and active.\n\nIn teaching him the principles of religion, be careful to show him religion as intimately connected with morality; teach him none of those mysterious doctrines, whose sole tendency is to foster that enthusiasm which naturally prevails among the vulgar, and to persuade them that they may be pious without being virtuous. Labour to inspire him with an invincible abhorrence for lying, fraud, and theft. Inspire him with a high esteem for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol6.html#article-CHASTITY\">chastity</a>, and with an awful regard to the duties of a son, a husband, and a father. Thus may he become respectable and happy, even in his humble station and indigent circumstances; a character infinitely superior, in the eyes of both God and man, to the rich and great man who misemploys his wealth and leisure in shameful and vicious pursuits.\n\nVIII. On the Education of the Female Sex.\n\nThe abstracts which we have given of some of the most celebrated and original treatises on education, as well as our own observations on this subject, have been hitherto either relative to the education of both the sexes, or directed chiefly to the education of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MALE\">male</a> sex. But as there is a natural difference between the characters of the two sexes, and as there are certain duties peculiar to each of them; it is easy to see that the education of the boy and that of the girl cannot, ought not, to be conducted precisely in the same manner. And since the duties of the female sex are so important to society, and they form so considerable a part of our species, their education, therefore, merits the highest attention.\n\nIn infancy, the instincts, the dispositions, and the faculties of boys and girls seem to be nearly the same. They discover the same curiosity, and the same disposition to activity. For a while they are fond of the same sports and amusements. But by and by, when we begin to make a distinction in their dress; when the girl begins to be more confined to a sedentary life under her mother's eye, while the boys are permitted to ramble about without doors; the distinction between their characters begins to be formed, and their taste of the character and manners begin to become different. The boy now takes up both sexes imitates the arts and the active amusements of his father; digs and plants a little garden, builds a house in period of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINIATURE\">miniature</a>, shoots his bow, or draws his little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CART\">cart</a>; while the girl, with no less emulation, imitates her mother, knits, sews, and dresses her doll. They are no longer merely children; the one is now a girl, the other a boy. This taste for female arts, which the girl so easily and naturally acquires, has been judiciously taken notice of by Rousseau, as affording a happy opportunity for instructing her in a very considerable part of those arts which it is proper to teach her. While the girl is busied in adorning her doll, she insensibly becomes expert at needle work, and learns how to adjust her own dress in a becoming manner. And therefore, if she be kindly treated, it will not be a matter of difficulty to prevail with her to apply to these branches of female education. Her mother or governess, if capable of managing her with mildness and prudence, may teach her to read with great facility. For being already more disposed to sedentary application than the boy of the same age, the confinement to which she must submit in order to learn to read will be less irksome to her. Some have pretended that the reasoning powers of girls begin to exert themselves sooner than those of boys. But, as we have already declared our opinion, that the reasoning powers of children of both sexes begin to display themselves at a very early period; so we do not believe that those of the one sex begin to appear or attain maturity, sooner than those of the other. But the different occupations and amusements in which we cause them to engage from their earliest years, naturally call forth their powers in different manners, and perhaps cause the one to imitate our modes of speaking and behaviour sooner than the other. However, as we wish both boys and girls to learn the art of reading at a very early age, even as soon as they are capable of\nEducation, any serious application; so we wish girls to be taught the art of writing, arithmetic, and the principles of religion and morals, in the same order in which these are inculcated on boys.\n\nWe need not point out the reasons which induce us to regard these as accomplishments proper for the female sex: they seem to be generally considered as not only suitable, but necessary. It is our most important privilege, as beings placed in a situation different from that of the inferior animals, that we are capable of religious sentiments and religious knowledge; it therefore becomes us to communicate religious instruction with no less affluency and care to the youth of the female sex than to those of our own. Besides, as the care of children during their earlier years belongs in a particular manner to the mother; she, therefore, whom nature has destined to the important duties of a mother, ought to be carefully prepared for the proper discharge of those duties, by being accurately instructed, in her youth, in such things as it will be afterwards requisite for her to teach her children.\n\nLadies have sometimes distinguished themselves as prodigies of learning. Many of the most eminent geniuses of the French <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATION\">nation</a> have been of the female sex. Several of our countrywomen have also made a respectable figure in the republic of letters. Yet we cannot approve of giving girls a learned education. To acquire the accomplishments which are more proper for their sex, will afford sufficient employment for their earlier years. If they be instructed in the grammar of their mother tongue, and taught to read and speak it with propriety; be taught to write a fair hand, and to perform with readiness the most useful operations of arithmetic; if they be instructed in the nature of the duties which they owe to God, to themselves, and to society; this will be almost all the literary instruction necessary for them. Yet we do not mean to forbid them an acquaintance with the literature of their country. The periodical writers, who have taught all the duties of morality, the decencies of life, and the principles of taste, in so elegant and pleasing a manner, may with great propriety be put into the hands of our female pupil. Neither will we deny her the historians, the most popular voyages and travels, and such of our British poets as may be put into her hands without corrupting her heart or inflaming her passions. But could our opinion or advice have so much influence, we would endeavour to persuade our countrymen and countrywomen to banish from among them the novelists, those panders of vice, with no less determined severity than that with which Plato excludes the poets from his republic, or that with which the converts to Christianity, mentioned in the Acts, condemned their magical volumes to the flames. Unhappily, novels and plays are almost the only species of reading in which the young people of the present age take delight; and nothing has contributed more effectually to bring on that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DILAPIDATION\">dilapidation</a> of manners which prevails among all ranks.\n\nBut we will not discover so much austerity as to express a wish that the education of the female sex should be confined solely to such things as are plain and useful. We forbid not those accomplishments which are merely ornamental, and the design of which is to render them amiable in the eyes of the other sex. When we consider the duties for which they are destined by nature, we find that the art of pleasing constitutes no Education, inconsiderable part of these; and it would be wrong, therefore, to deny them those arts, the end of which is to enable them to please. Let them endeavour to acquire taste in dress: to dress in a neat graceful manner, to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> colours to her <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>, and the figure of her clothes to her shape, is no small accomplishment for a young woman. She who is rigged out by the taste and dexterity of her maid and her milliner, is nothing better than a doll sent abroad to public places as a sample of their handywork. Dancing is Dancing, a favourite exercise: nay, we might almost call it the favourite study of the fair sex: So many pleasing images are associated with the idea of dancing; dress, attendance, balls, elegance and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRACE\">grace</a> of motion irresistible, admiration, and courtship; and these are so early inculcated on the young by mothers and maids, that we need not be surprised if little Misses consider her lesson of dancing as a matter of much more importance than either her book or sampler. And indeed, though the public in general seem at present to place too high a value on dancing; and though the undue estimation which is paid to it seems owing to that taste for distinction, and that rage for public amusements, which naturally prevail amid such refinement and opulence; yet still dancing is an accomplishment which both sexes may cultivate with considerable advantage. It has a happy effect on the figure, the air, and the carriage; and we know not if it be not favourable even to dignity of mind: Yet as to be even a first-rate poet or painter, and to value himself on his genius in these arts, would be no real ornament in the character of a great monarch; so any very superior skill in dancing must serve rather to disgrace than to adorn the lady or the gentleman. There are some arts in which, though a moderate degree of skill may be useful or ornamental, yet superior taste and knowledge are rather hurtful, as they have a tendency to seduce us from the more important duties which we owe to ourselves and to society. Of these, dancing seems to be one: It is said of a certain Roman lady, by an eloquent historian, \"that she was more skilled in dancing than became a modest and virtuous woman.\"\n\nMusic, also, is an art in which the youth of the female sex are pretty generally instructed; and if their voice and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAR\">ear</a> be such as to enable them to attain any excellence in vocal music, it may conduce greatly to increase their influence over our sex, and may afford a pleasing and elegant amusement to their leisure hours. The harpsichord and the spinet are instruments often touched by female hands; nor do we presume to forbid the ladies to exercise their delicate fingers in calling forth the enchanting sounds of these instruments. But still, if your daughter have no voice or ear for music, compel her not to apply to it.\n\nDrawing is another accomplishment which generally enters into the plan of female education. Girls are usually taught to aim at some scratches with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a>: but when they grow up, they either lay it totally aside, or else apply to it with so much affluency as to neglect their more important duties. We do not consider skill in drawing, any more than skill in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-POETRY\">poetry</a>, as an accomplishment very necessary for the ladies; yet we agree with Rouffleau, that as far as it can contribute to improve their taste in dress, it may not be improper for them.\nEducation, them to pursue it. They may very properly be taught to sketch and colour flowers; but we do not wish them to forget or lay aside this as soon as the drawing-master is dismissed: let them retain it to be useful through life. Though pride can never be lovely, even in the fairest female form; yet ought the young woman to be carefully impressed with a due respect for herself. This will join with her native modesty to be the guardian of her virtue, and to preserve her from levity and impropriety of conduct.\n\nSuch are the hints which have occurred to us on the education proper for the female sex, as far as it ought to be conducted in a manner different from that of the male.\n\nIX. Public and Private Education.\n\nOne question usually discussed by the writers on this subject has not hitherto engaged our attention. It is, Whether it be most proper to educate a young man privately, or send him to receive his education at a public school? This question has been too often agitated, and by people enjoying opportunities of receiving all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> which experience can furnish on the subject, that we cannot be expected to advance any new argument of importance on either side. Yet we may state what has been urged both on the one and the other.\n\nThey who have considered children as receiving their education in the house and under the eye of their parents, and as secluded in a great measure from the society of other children, have been sometimes led to consider this situation as particularly favourable for their acquiring useful knowledge, and being formed to virtuous habits. Though we reap many advantages from mingling in social life, yet in society we are also tainted with many vices to which he who passes his life in solitary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RETIREMENT\">retirement</a> is a stranger. At whatever period of life we begin to mix with the world, we still find that we have not yet acquired sufficient strength to resist those temptations to vice with which we are there afflicted. But if we are thus ready to be infected with the contagion of vice, even at any age, no other argument can be necessary to show the propriety of confining children from those dangerous scenes in which this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFECTION\">infection</a> is so easily caught. And whoever surveys the state of morals in a public school with careful and candid attention, even though it be under the management of the most virtuous, judicious, and affusive teachers, will find reason to acknowledge, that the empire of vice is established there not less fully than in the great world. Nothing, therefore, can be more negligent or inhuman, than for parents to expose their children to those seductions which a great school presents, at a time when they are strongly disposed to imitate any example set before them, and have not yet learned to distinguish between such examples as are worthy of imitation, and those which ought to be beheld with abhorrence. Even when under the parent's eye, from intercourse with servants and visitors their native innocence is likely to suffer considerably. Yet the parent's care will be much more likely to preserve the manners of his child uncorrupted in his own house, than any affluence and watchfulness of his teachers in a school.\n\nThe morals and dispositions of a child ought to be the first objects of our concern in conducting his education; but to initiate him in the principles of useful knowledge is also an important object; and it will be happy, if in a private education virtue be not only better secured, but knowledge also more readily acquired, than in a public. But this actually happens. When one or two boys are committed to the care of a judicious tutor, he can watch the most favourable seasons for communicating instruction; he can awake curiosity and command attention by the gentle arts of imitation: though he strive not to inflame their breasts with emulation, which leads often to envy and inveterate hatred; yet he will succeed in rendering learning pleasing, by other means less likely to produce unfavourable effects on the temper and dispositions of his pupils. As his attention is not divided among a number, he can pay more regard to the particular dispositions and turn of mind of each of his pupils: he can encourage him who is modest and slow, and refresh the quickness and volatility of the other; and he can call forth and improve their powers, by leading them at one time to view the scenes of nature and the changes which successively undergoes through the varying seasons: at another, to attend to some of the most entertaining experiments of natural philosophy; and again alluring them artfully to their literary exercises. With these he may mix some active games; and he may assume so much of the fondness of the parent, as to join in them with his little pupils. These are certainly circumstances favourable both to the happiness and to the literary improvement of youth; but they are peculiar to a private education. Besides, in a private education, as children spend more of their time with grown-up people than in public; those, therefore, who receive a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOMESTIC\">domestic</a> education, sooner acquire our manner of thinking, of expressing ourselves, and of behaving in our ordinary intercourse with one another. For the very same reason for which girls are often observed to be capable of prudence and propriety of behaviour at an earlier age than boys, those boys who receive a family education will begin sooner to think and act like men, than those who pass their earlier days in a public seminary. And though you educate your son at home, there is no reason why he should be more accustomed to dominate over his inferiors, or to indulge a capricious or inhuman disposition, than if he were brought up among fifty boys, all of the same age, size, and rank, with himself. He may also, in a private education, exercise his limbs with the same activity as in a public one. He cannot indeed engage in those sports for which a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> of companions is necessary; but still there are a thousand objects which will call forth his activity: if in the country, he will be disposed to fish, to climb for bird nests, to imitate all that he sees performed by labourers and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICS\">mechanics</a>: in short, he will run, leap, throw and carry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a>, and keenly exert himself in a variety of exercises, which will produce the most favourable effects on the powers both of his mind and body. It may indeed be possible for you to oppose the delights of nature so effectually, if you take pains for that purpose, as to refresh the natural activity of your child or pupil, and cause him to pine away his time in little indolence; but you will thus do violence to his dispositions, as well as to those instincts which nature has for wise purposes implanted in his breast.\nAnd the bad consequences which may result from this management are not to be considered as the natural effects of a domestic education, but as the effects of an education carelessly or imprudently conducted.\n\nBut there is another consideration which will perhaps be still more likely than any of those which we have hitherto urged, to prevail with the fond parent to give his child a private education. As the infant who is abandoned by its mother to the care of an hireling nurse, naturally transfers its affection from the unnatural parent to the person who supplies her room and performs the duties incumbent upon her; so the boy who is banished from a parent's house at a time when he has scarcely begun to know the relation in which he stands to his father and mother, brothers or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SISTERS\">sisters</a>, soon ceases to regard them with that fondness which he had contracted for them from living in their company and receiving their good offices. His respect, his affection, and his kindness, are bestowed on new objects, perhaps on his master or his companions; or else his heart becomes selfish and destitute of every tender and generous feeling; and when the gentle and amiable affections of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILIAL\">filial</a> and fraternal love are thus, as it were, torn up by the roots, every evil passion springs up, with a rapid growth, to supply their place. The boy returns afterwards to his father's house; but he returns as a stranger; he is no longer capable of regarding his parents and relations with the same tenderness of affection. He is now a stranger to that filial love which springs up in the breast of the child who is constantly sensible of the tender care of his parents, and spends his earlier years under their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol16.html#article-ROOF\">roof</a>, in such a manner as to appear the effect of instinct rather than of habit. Selfish views are now the only bond which attaches him to his parents and relations; and by coming under their influence at so early a period of life, he is rendered forever incapable of all the most amiable virtues which can adorn human nature. Let the parent, therefore, who loves his child, and wishes to obtain from him a mutual return of affection, beware of excluding him from his house, and devolving the sole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of him upon another, in his childhood.\n\nThese views represent a private education as the most favourable to virtue, to knowledge, and to the mutual affection which ought always to unite the parent and his child. But let us now listen to the arguments which are usually urged in behalf of a public education.\n\nIn the first place, it has been asserted, that a public education is much more favourable than a private, to the pupil's improvement in knowledge, and much more likely to inspire him with an ardour for learning. In a private education, with whatever affluence and tenderness you labour to render learning agreeable to your pupil, still it will be but an irksome task. You may confine him to his books but for a very short space in the course of the day, and allow him an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALTERNATION\">alternation</a> of study and recreation. Still, however, you will never be able to render his books the favourite objects of his attention. He will apply to them with reluctance and careless indifference; even while he seems engaged on his lesson, his mind will be otherwise occupied; it will wander to the scenes where he pursues his diversions, and to those objects which have attracted his desire. If the period during which you require his application be extremely short; during the first part of it, he will still be thinking of the amusements from which you have called him, and regretting his confinement; during the last, he will fondly anticipate the moment when he is to be set at liberty, and think of new amusements. Again, if you confine him during a longer period, still more unfavourable effects will follow. Peevishness, dullness, and a determined aversion to all that bears the name of literature, will be naturally impressed on his mind by such treatment. How can it be otherwise? Books possess so few of those qualities which recommend any object to the attention of children, that they cannot be naturally agreeable. They have nothing to attract and detain the eye, the ear, or any of the senses; they present things with which children are unacquainted, and of which they know not the value: children cannot look beyond the letters and words, to the things which these represent; and even though they could, yet it is much more pleasing to view scenes and objects as they exist originally in nature, than to trace their images in a faint and imperfect representation. It is vain, therefore, to hope that children will be prevailed with to pay attention to books by means of any allurements which books can of themselves present. Other means must be used; but those in a private education you cannot command. In a public seminary, the situation of matters with respect to their pupils is widely different. When a number of boys meet together in the same school, each of them soon begins to feel the impulse of a principle which enables the master to command their attention without difficulty, and prompts them to apply with cheerful ardour to tasks which would otherwise be extremely irksome. This principle is a generous emulation, which animates the breast with the desire of superior excellence, without inspiring envy or hatred of a competitor. When children are prudently managed in a great school, it is impossible for them not to feel its impulse. It renders their tasks far less agreeable than their amusements, and directs their activity and curiosity to proper objects. View the scholar at a public school, composing his theme, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> over his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DICTIONARY\">dictionary</a>; how alert! how cheerful! how indefatigable! He applies with all the eagerness, and all the perseverance, of a candidate for one of the most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> places in the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a>. Again, behold and pity that poor youth who is confined to his chamber with no companion but his tutor; none whose superiority can provoke his emulation, or whose inferiority might flatter him with thoughts of his own excellence, and thus move him to persevere by industrious application the advantages which he has already gained. His book is before him; but how languid, how listless his posture! how heavy and dull his eye! Nothing is expressed in his countenance but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEJECTION\">dejection</a> or indignation. Examine him concerning his lesson; he replies with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a> and hesitation. After a few minutes observation, you cannot fail to be convinced that he has spent his time without making any progress in learning; that his spirits are now broken, his natural cheerfulness destroyed, and his breast armed with invincible prejudices against all application in the pursuit of literary knowledge. Besides, in a school there is something more than emulation to render learning...\nThe slightest observation of life, or attention to our own conduct in various circumstances, will be sufficient to convince us, that whenever mankind are placed in circumstances of distress, or subjected to any disagreeable restraint, that which a single person bears with impatience or dejection will make a much less impression on his mind if a number of companions be joined with him in his suffering or restraint. It is deemed a piece of much greater severity to confine a prisoner in a solitary <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CELL\">cell</a>, than where he is permitted to mix with others in the same uncomfortable situation. A journey appears much less tedious to a party of travelers, than to him who beats the path alone. In the same manner, when a number of boys in a great school are all bullied on the same or on similar tasks, a spirit of industry and perseverance is communicated from one to another\u2014over the whole circle; each of them insensibly acquires new ardour and vigour; even though he feel not the spur of emulation, yet, while all are busy around him, he cannot remain idle. These are facts obvious to the most careless observer.\n\nNeither are public schools so unfavourable to the virtue of their members as they have been represented to be. If the masters are men of virtue and prudence, careful to set a good example before their pupils, attentive to the particular character and behaviour of each individual among them, firm to punish obdurate and incorrigible depravity, and even to expel those who are more likely to injure the morals of others than to be reclaimed themselves, and at the same time eager to applaud and encourage amiable and virtuous dispositions wherever they appear; under the government of such masters, a public school will not fail to be a school of virtue. There will no doubt be particular individuals among the pupils of such a seminary, whose morals may be corrupt and their dispositions vicious; but this, in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a>, will arise from the manner in which they were managed before entering the school, or from some other circumstances, rather than from their being sent for their education to a public school. Again, at a public school young people enjoy much greater advantages for preparing them to enter the world, than they can possibly be favoured with if brought up in a private and solitary manner. A great school is a miniature representation of the world at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a>. The objects which engage the attention of boys at a school are different from those which occupy their parents; the views of the boys are less extensive, and they are not yet capable of prosecuting them by so many safe and mean arts: but, in other respects, the two scenes and the actors upon them nearly resemble each other; on both you behold contending passions, opposite interests, weaknesses, cunning, folly, and vice. He therefore who has performed his part on the miniature scene, has rehearsed as it were for the greater; if he has acquitted himself well on the one, he may be also expected to distinguish himself on the other; and even he who has not distinguished himself at school, at least enters the world with superior advantages when viewed in comparison with him who has spent his earlier days in the ignorance and solitude of a private and domestic education. Besides, when a number of boys meet at a public seminary of education, separated from their parents and relations; nearly of the same age, engaged in the same studies, and fond of the same amusements; they naturally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONTRACT\">contract</a> friendships with one another which are more cordial and sincere than any that take place between persons farther advanced in life. A friendship is often formed between two boys at school which continues through life, and is productive of the happiest consequences to each of them. While at school, they mutually assist and encourage each other in their learning; and their mutual affection renders their talks less burdensome than they might otherwise find them. As they advance in life, their friendship still continues to produce happy effects on their sentiments and conduct: perhaps they are mutually useful to each other by interest or by personal assistance in making their way in the world; or when they are engaged in the cares and battle of life, their intercourse and correspondence with each other may contribute much to console them amid the vexations and fatigues to which they may be exposed.\n\nSuch are the chief arguments usually adduced in favour of a public education. When we compare them with those which have been urged to recommend a private education, we shall perhaps find that each has its peculiar advantages. A public education is the more favourable to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACQUISITION\">acquisition</a> of knowledge, to vigour of mind, and to the formation of habits of industry and fortitude. A private education, when judiciously conducted, will not fail to be peculiarly favourable to innocence and mildness of disposition; and notwithstanding what has sometimes been advanced by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol1.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> for a public education, it is surely better to keep youth at a distance from the seductions of vice till they be sufficiently armed against them, than to expose them to them at an age when they know not what dangers they lead, and a medium between the two parties, either a private or a public education would form characters more like to angels than to those men whom we ordinarily meet in the world: but they speak with the ardour of enthusiasts; and therefore we must listen with caution both to the facts which they adduce, and to the inferences which they draw. Could we without <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPOSING\">exposing</a> children to the contagion of a great town, procure for them the advantages of both a public and a private education at the same time, we would by this means probably succeed best in rendering them both respectable scholars and good men. If we may presume to give our opinion freely, we would advise parents never, except when some unavoidable necessity of circumstances obliges them, to expel their children from under their own roof till they be advanced beyond their boyish years: let the mother nurse her own child; let her and the father join in superintending its education: they may then expect to be rewarded, if they have acted their parts aright, by commanding the gratitude, the affection, and the respect of their child, while he and they continue to live together. Let matters be so ordered, that the boy may reside in his father's house, and at the same time attend a public school: but let the girl be educated wholly under her mother's eye.\n\nX. On\nX. On Travel.\n\nAnother question which has been often discussed comes here under our review. The philosophers of ancient Greece travelled in search of knowledge. Books were then scarce, and those few which were to be obtained were no very rich treasuries of useful information. The rhapsodies of a poet, the rude legends of some ill-informed and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol8.html#article-FABULOUS\">fabulous</a> historian, or the theories of fanciful philosophers, were all that they could afford. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THALES\">Thales</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LYCURGUS\">Lycurgus</a>, Solon, Plato, travelled, seeking that knowledge among more civilized nations which they could not find in their native country. In the course of their travels, they heard the lectures of celebrated philosophers; consulted the priests, who were the guardians of the traditions of antiquity, concerning the nature and origin of those traditions; and observed the institutions of those nations which were most renowned for the wisdom of their legislature. When they set out to visit foreign countries, they seem to have proposed to themselves a certain end; and by keeping that end steadily in view during the course of their travels, they gained such improvement as to be able on their return to command the veneration of their countrymen by means of the knowledge which they were enabled to communicate. Many besides the philosophers of ancient Greece have travelled for improvement, and have succeeded in their views. But ancient history does not relate to us, that travelling was considered by the Greeks or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROMANS\">Romans</a> as necessary to finish the education of their young men of fortune before they entered the scenes of active life. It is true, after Greece became a province of the Roman empire, and the Romans began to admire the science and elegance of Greece, and to cultivate Grecian literature, the young noblemen of Rome often repaired to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RHODES\">Rhodes</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a> to complete their studies under the masters of philosophy and eloquence who taught in those cities. But they went thither with the same views with which our youth in modern times are sent to free schools and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNIVERSITIES\">universities</a>, not to acquire knowledge by the observation of nature, of the institutions, manners, and customs of nations; but merely to hear lectures, read books, and perform exercises. In modern times, a few men of reflection and experience have now and then travelled for improvement: but the greatest part of our travellers, for a long time, were enthusiastic devotees who went in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILGRIMAGE\">pilgrimage</a> to visit the shrine or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELICS\">relics</a> of some favourite saint; soldiers, who wandered over the earth to destroy its inhabitants; or merchants, whose business as factors between widely distant countries and nations led them to brave every danger in traversing from one corner of the globe to another. But since the nations of modern Europe have begun to emerge from rudeness, ignorance, and fervile depression, they have formed one great commonwealth, the members of which are scarcely less intimately connected with each other than were the states of ancient Greece. The consequence of this mutual connexion and dependence is, that almost all the nations of Europe have frequent intercourse with one another; and as some of them are, and have long been, more enlightened and refined than others, those nations who have attained the highest degrees of civilization and refinement have naturally attracted the admiration and homage of the rest. Their language has been studied, their manners and arts have been adopted, and even their dress has been imitated. Other nations have struggled to pay the homage due to their superior merit, and to study under them as masters. Hence has arisen the practice which at present prevails among us of sending our youth to complete their education by travelling, before we introduce them to active life, or require them to engage in business. Formerly young men were not sent to travel till after they had proceeded through the forms of a regular education, and had at least attained such an age that they were no longer to be considered as mere boys. But the progress of luxury, the desire of parents to introduce their children into the world at an early age, that they may early attain to wealth and honours, and various other causes, have gradually introduced the practice of sending mere boys to foreign countries, under pretence of affording them opportunities of shaking off prejudices, of storing their minds with truly useful knowledge, and of acquiring those graceful manners and that manly address which will enable them to acquit themselves in a becoming manner when they are called to the duties of active life. How much travelling at such an early age contributes to fulfill the views of parents, a slight survey of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a>-house, the gambling-houses, the race-course, and the cockpit, will readily convince the sagacious observer.\n\nBut we wish to foster no prejudices against neighbouring nations; we entertain no such prejudices in favour of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRITAIN\">Britain</a>, as to wish to confine our countrymen within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a>-girt isle. Let us inquire what advantages may be gained by travelling, and at what age it may be most proper to set out in pursuit of those advantages.\n\nAfter all that bookish men have urged, and notwithstanding all that they may continue vehemently to urge, in behalf of the knowledge to be derived from their beloved books; it must still be acknowledged, that books can teach us little more than merely the language of men. Or, if we should <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a> that books are of higher importance, and that language is the least valuable part of the knowledge which they teach, yet still we need to beware that they lead us not astray; it is better to examine nature with the naked eye, than to view her through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECTACLES\">spectacles</a> of books. Neither the theories or experiments of philosophers, nor the narratives of travellers, nor the relations of historians, though supported by a numerous train of authorities, are worthy of implicit credit. You retire from the world, confine yourself for years to your closet, and read volume after volume, historians, philosophers, and poets; at last you fancy that you have gained an immense store of knowledge: But leave your retirement, return into the world, compare the knowledge which you have treasured up with the appearances of nature; you will find that you have laboured in vain, that it is only the semblance of knowledge which you have acquired, and will not serve for a faithful guide in life, nor even enable you to distinguish yourself for literary merit. Compare the relations of travellers with one another; how seldom do they agree when they describe the same scenes and the same people! Turn your attention to the most respectable historians, compare\nEducation. their accounts of the same events; what disagreement! what <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRARIETY\">contrariety</a>! Where shall truth be found? Listen to the cool, the candid philosophers; what contradictory theories do they build on the same system of facts!\n\nWe agree, then, that it is better to seek knowledge by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTUAL\">actual</a> observation and experiment, than to receive it at second hand from the information of others. He who would gain an acquaintance with the beauties of external nature, must view them with his own eyes; he who would know the operations of the human understanding, must reflect upon what passes in his own mind; he who would know the customs, opinions, and manners of any people, must mingle with them, must observe their conduct, and listen to their conversations. The arts are acquired by actual practice; the sciences by actual observation in your own person, and by deducing inferences from your observations.\n\nIf therefore to extend our knowledge can contribute in any degree to render us happier, wiser, or better; travelling, as being more favourable to knowledge than the study of books, must be highly advantageous. Get well acquainted with your own country; with the manners, the customs, the laws, and the political situation of your countrymen: Get also a knowledge of books; for books would not be altogether useless, though they could serve no other purpose but to teach us the language in which mankind express themselves: And then, if your judgment have attained maturity; if curiosity prompt you; if your constitution be robust and vigorous, and your spirits lively; you may imitate the Solons, Homers, and Platoes, of old, and visit foreign countries in search of knowledge, and with a view to bring home something which may be of real utility to yourself and your country. You will, by this time, be so much master of the language of your own country, that you will not lose it while you are learning the languages of foreign nations; your principles of taste and of right and wrong will be so formed and fixed, that you will not despise any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> or custom or opinion merely because it prevails not in your own country; nor yet will you be ready to admire and adopt anything, merely because it prevails among a foreign nation who are distinguished for profound and extensive knowledge, or for elegance of taste and manners. No; you will divest yourself of every prejudice, and judge only by the fixed unalterable principles which determine the distinction between right and wrong, between truth and falsehood, between beauty and deformity, sublimity and meanness. Your object will not be to learn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXOTIC\">exotic</a> vices, to mingle in frivolous amusements, or to form a catalogue of inns. Your views, your inquiries, will have a very different direction. You will attend to the state of the arts, of the sciences, of morals, manners, and government; you will also contemplate with eager delight, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> or beautiful scenes of nature, and examine the vegetable productions of the various regions through which you pass, as well as the different tribes of animals which inhabit them; you will observe what blessings the beneficence of nature has conferred on the inhabitants of each particular <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of the globe, and how far the ingenuity and industry of man have taken advantage of the kindness of nature. Thus surveying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the earth, and considering how advantages and disadvantages are balanced with each other through every various region and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a> from one extremity of the globe to another; you will admire and revere that impartiality with which the Author of nature has distributed his benefits to the whole human race. When from the chilly climes and stubborn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a>, you turn your eyes to the fertile genial regions of the south, where every tree is loaded with exquisite fruits, and every vegetable is nourishing and delicious; you will be pleased to find, that the inhabitants of the north, by their superior ingenuity and vigour, are able to raise themselves to circumstances no less comfortable and respectable than those which the nations inhabiting between the tropics enjoy: when you behold the French shaking off the yoke of despotism, and aspiring to the sweets of liberty as well as their British neighbours; you will be pleased to feel, that the natural gaiety and cheerfulness of the former nation render them not incapable of the energy of the latter. You will be pleased to view the remains of antiquity, and the noble monuments of art; but you will think it below you to trifle away your time in gazing at palaces and churches, and collecting rusty medals and fragments of marble; you will seek the society of eminent men, and eagerly cultivate an acquaintance with the most distinguished artists and men of science who adorn the nations among whom you may happen to sojourn. Knowing that the knowledge which is to be acquired in great towns, is by no means an adequate compensation for the vicious habits which you are liable to contract in them; and besides, that the luxuries, the arts, the manners, the virtues, and the vices of all great towns are nearly the same, so that when you have seen one, you have seen all others; you will avoid taking up your residence for any considerable time in any of the great towns through which you have occasion to pass in the course of your travels. The traveller who has attained the previous accomplishments which we have mentioned as necessary, who sets out with the views which we have supposed him to entertain, and who conducts his travels in this manner, cannot fail to return home enriched with much useful knowledge; he cannot but derive more real improvement from travelling, than he could have gained by spending the same period of time in solitary study: when he returns to his native country, he will appear among his countrymen as more than a philosopher; a sage, and a benefactor. His knowledge is so extensive and accurate, his views are so liberal and enlarged, and he is so superior to prejudices, without being the enemy of any useful establishment, that he will be enabled to command <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> esteem, by performing his part in life with becoming dignity and propriety, and perhaps to render his name illustrious, and his memory dear to future times, by some important services to the community to which he belongs, or even to mankind in general.\n\nBut though we have thus far, and we hope for obvious and solid reasons, decided in favour of travelling, it seems that as being more likely than a solitary application to read books, to furnish the mind with useful and ornamental knowledge; yet we do not see that our British youth either take care to furnish themselves with the previous knowledge which we consider as indispensably necessary in order to prepare them for travelling with advantage, or set out with proper views, or pro-\nEducation. secure their travels in a prudent judicious manner.\n\nAfter receiving a very imperfect education, in which religious and moral instruction are almost wholly neglected, and no means are used to inspire the youthful mind with solid, virtuous, manly qualities; but every art is tried to make the young man appear learned, while his mind is destitute of all useful information, and to teach him to assume the confidence of manhood before he has attained even to a moderate degree of sense and prudence;\u2014after an education conducted in this manner, and with these views, the stripling is sent abroad to view the world, and is expected to return home a finished character, an ornament and a comfort to his parents and all his connexions. He is hitherto unacquainted, perhaps, even with the simple events of the history of his native country; and either totally ignorant of classical literature, or but very superficially instructed in it. He has not yet viewed with a differing eye the manners and customs prevailing among his countrymen; he knows not the nature of the government under which he lives, nor the spirit of those laws by which his civil conduct must be regulated. He has no fixed principles; no clear, distinct views. But to supply all his wants of this nature, he is put into the hands of a travelling governor, who is to be entirely submissive to his will, and yet to serve him both for eyes and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTELLECT\">intellect</a>. This governor is generally either some macaroni officer, who is considered as well bred, and thought to know the world; or else, perhaps, some cringing son of literature, who having spent much time among his books, without acquiring such strength or dignity of mind as to raise him above frivolity of manners and conversation or pitiful fawning arts, is therefore regarded as happily qualified for this important charge. This respectable personage and his pupil are shipped off for France, that land of elegant dissipation, frivolity, and fashion. They travel on with eager impatience, till they reach the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a>. There the young man is industriously introduced to all the gay scenes which <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARIS\">Paris</a> can display. He is, at first, confounded; by and by his senses are fascinated; new desires are awakened in his breast; all around him he sees the sons of dissipation wallowing in debauchery, or the children of vanity fluttering about like so many gaudy insects. The poor youth has no fixed principles: he has not been taught to regard vanity as ridiculous, or to turn from vice with abhorrence. No attempt is made to allure him to those objects, an attention to which can alone render travelling truly beneficial. Hitherto his mind had been left almost wholly uncultivated; and now the seeds of vice are plentifully sown in it. From one great town he is conveyed to another, till he visits almost every place in Europe where profligacy of manners has attained to any uncommon height. In this happy course of education he probably continues to pursue improvement till he is well acquainted with most of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POST\">post</a> roads, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> inns, and the great towns at least in France and Italy; and perhaps till he has worn out his constitution, and rendered his mind totally incapable of any generous sentiments or sober reflection. He then revisits his native country, to the inexplicable happiness of his parents, who now eagerly long to embrace their all-accomplished child. But how miserably are the poor folks disappointed, when they find his constitution wasted, his understanding uninformed, his heart destitute of every manly or generous sentiment: and perceive him to possess no accomplishment, but such as are merely superficial? Perhaps, however, his parents are prevented by their partiality both for their child and for the means which they have adopted in conducting his education, from viewing his character and qualifications in a true light. Perhaps they overlook all his defects, or consider them as ornaments, and regard their dear son as the mirror of perfection. But, unfortunately, though they be blind to the hideous deformity of the monster which they have formed, they cannot hinder it from being conspicuous to others; though they may view their son's character as amiable and respectable, they cannot render it useful, they cannot prevent it from being hurtful to society. Let this youth whose education has been thus wisely conducted, let him be placed at the head of an opulent fortune, advanced to a fear in the legislative body of his country, or called to act in any public character; how will he distinguish himself? As the virtuous patriot, the honest yet able statesman, the skilful general, or the learned upright judge? How will he enjoy his fortune? Will he be the friend of the poor, the steady supporter of the laws and constitution under whose protection he lives? Will he show himself capable of enjoying otium cum dignitate? If we reason by the usual laws of probability, we cannot expect that he should; and if we observe the manners and principles of our men of wealth and high birth who have been brought up in his manner, we find our reasonings confirmed.\n\nSuch are the opinions which candid observation leads us to entertain with regard to the advantages which may be gained by travelling.\n\nHe whose mind has been judiciously cultivated, and who has attained to maturity of judgment, if he set out on his travels with a view to obtain real improvements, and persist invariably in the prosecution of that view, cannot but derive very great advantages from travelling.\n\nBut again, those young men whose minds have not been previously cultivated by a judicious education, who set out without a view to the acquisition of real knowledge, and who wander among foreign nations, without attention to anything but their luxuries, their follies, and their vices, those poor young men cannot gain any real improvement from their travels.\n\nOur countrymen, who travel for improvement, do not appear to derive so much advantage from their travels as were to be wished, because they generally receive too superficial an education, set out at too early a period of life, and direct not their views to objects of real utility and importance.\n\nXI. On Knowledge of the World, and Entrance into Life.\n\nMuch has been said concerning the utility of a knowledge of the world, and the advantage of acquiring it at an early period of life. But those who have too early received too superficial an education, set out at too early a period of life, and direct not their views to objects of real utility and importance.\nEducation with, that, in order to acquire it, young people may be early made acquainted with all the vices and follies of the world, introduced into polite company, carried to public places, and not confined even from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GAMING\">gaming</a> table and the stews. Some knowledge of the world may, no doubt, be gained by these means. But it is surely dearly purchased; nor are the advantages which can be derived from it so considerable, as to tempt the judicious and affectionate parent to expose his child to the infection of vanity, folly, and vice, for their sake. Carry a boy or girl into public life at the age of fourteen or fifteen; show them all the scenes of splendid vanity and dissipation which adorn <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-LONDON\">London</a> or Paris; tell them of the importance of dress, and of the ceremonies of good breeding and the forms of intercourse; teach them that fashionable indifference and assurance which give the ton to the manners of our fine gentlemen and fine ladies of the present age. What effects can you expect the scenes into which you introduce them, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MYSTERIES\">mysteries</a> which you now teach them, to produce on the minds of the children? They have a direct tendency to inspire them with a taste for vanity, frivolity, and dissipation. If you with them to be like the foolish, the dissipated, and the gay, you are likely to obtain your purpose; but if, on the contrary, your views are to prepare them for discharging the duties of life, you could not adopt more improper means; for though they be well acquainted with all those things on which you place so much value, yet they have not thereby gained any accretion of useful knowledge. They are not now more able than before to estimate the real value of objects; nay, their judgment is now more liable than before to be misled in estimating the value of the objects around them. Luxury, vanity, and fashion, have stamped on many things an ideal value. By mingling at an early age in those scenes of the world where luxury, vanity, and fashion, reign with arbitrary sway, young people are naturally impressed with all those prejudices which they have a tendency to inspire. Instead of acquiring an useful knowledge of the world, they are rendered incapable of ever viewing the world with an unprejudiced and discerning eye. If possible, therefore, we should rather labour to confine young people from mingling in the scenes of gay and dissipated life till after they have attained maturity of age and judgment. They will then view them in a proper light, and perhaps be happy enough to escape the infectious contagion of vice.\n\nBut there is another and a more valuable knowledge of the world, which we ought industriously to communicate to them as soon as they are capable of receiving it. As soon as they are made thoroughly acquainted with the distinctions between right and wrong, between virtue and vice, between piety and impiety, and have become capable of entering into our reasonings; we ought then to inform them concerning the various establishments and institutions which exist in society; concerning the customs, opinions, and manners of mankind; and concerning the various degrees of strength or weaknesses of mind, of ingenuity or dullness, of virtuous or vicious qualities, which discriminate those characters which appear in society. We ought also to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> every opportunity which may be presented of exemplifying our lessons by instances in real life. We must point out to them those circumstances which have led Edulcoration mankind to place an undue value on some objects, while they appreciate others much below their real utility and importance. Thus let us fortify their judgments against that impression which the dazzling novelty of the scene, and the force of passion, will be apt to produce; and communicate to them a knowledge of the world, without exposing them imprudently to the contagion of its vices and follies.\n\nWhen at length the period arrives at which they must be emancipated from subjection, and committed to the guidance of their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CONSCIENCE\">conscience</a> and reason, and of those principles which we have laboured to inculcate on their minds; let us warn them of the dangers to which they are about to be exposed; tell them of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GLORY\">glory</a> and the happiness to which they may attain; inspire them, if possible, with disdain for folly, vanity, and vice, whatever dazzling or enchanting forms they may assume; and then dismiss them to enrich their minds with new stores of knowledge by visiting foreign nations; or, if that should be inconvenient, to enter immediately on the duties of some useful employment in active life.","sp":165,"ep":192},{"h":"PHYSON HAVING BY THIS","t":"n having by this means got together an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARMY\">army</a> which seemed to him to be sufficient for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMPLISHMENT\">accomplishment</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a>, landed in Cyprus; but being there encountered by Philometor in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a>, he was entirely defeated, and obliged to shelter himself in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITY\">city</a> called Lapithos. Here he was closely besieged, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> obliged to surrender.

But he, soon after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a>'s departure, agreed with Demetrius king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYRIA\">Syria</a>, to betray the island to him for 500 talents. The treachery was discovered before it took effect; and the traitor, to avoid the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUNISHMENT\">punishment</a> due to his crime, laid violent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HANDS\">hands</a> on himself. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMY\">Ptolemy</a> being offended with Demetrius for this attempt on Cyprus, joined Attalus king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERGAMUS\">Pergamus</a>, and Ariarathes king of Cappadocia, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> up a pretender to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> of Syria. This was Alexander Balas; to whom he even gave his daughter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLEOPATRA\">Cleopatra</a> in marriage, after he had placed him on the throne of Syria. But he, notwithstanding these and many other favours, being suspected of having entered into a plot against his benefactor, Ptolemy became his greatest enemy; and marching against him, routed his army in the neighbourhood of Antioch. He did not, however, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> enjoy his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VICTORY\">victory</a>; for he died in a few days after the engagement, of the wounds he had received.\n\nOn the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> of Philometor, Cleopatra the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUEEN\">queen</a> despaired to secure the throne for her son. But some\nof the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRINCIPAL\">principal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOBILITY\">nobility</a> declaring for Phycon, a civil war was about to ensue, when matters were compromised on condition that Phycon should marry Cleopatra, that he should reign jointly with her during his life, and declare her son by Philometor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-HEIR\">heir</a> to the crown. These terms were no sooner agreed upon than Phycon married Cleopatra, and, on the very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAY\">day</a> of the nuptials, murdered her son in her arms. This was only a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRELUDE\">prelude</a> to the cruelties which he afterwards practised on his subjects. He was no sooner seated on the throne, than he put to death all those who had shown any concern for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MURDER\">murder</a> of the young prince. He then wreaked his fury on the Jews, whom he treated more like slaves than subjects, on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of their having favoured the cause of Cleopatra. His own people were treated with little more <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CEREMONY\">ceremony</a>. Numbers of them were every day put to death for the smallest faults, and often for no fault at all, but merely to gratify his inhuman temper. His cruelty towards the Alexandrians is particularly mentioned under the article Alexandria. In a short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, being wearied of his queen, who was also his sister, he divorced her; and married her daughter, who was also called Cleopatra, and whom he had previously ravished. In short, his behaviour was so exceedingly wicked, that it soon became quite intolerable to his subjects; and he was obliged to fly to the island of Cyprus with his new queen, and Memphitis, a son he had by her mother.\n\nOn the flight of the king, the divorced queen was placed on the throne by the Alexandrians; but Phycon, fearing lest a son whom he had left behind should be appointed king, sent for him into Cyprus, and caused him to be assassinated as soon as he landed. This provoked the people against him to such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a>, that they pulled <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> and dashed to pieces all the statues which had been erected to him at Alexandria. This the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRANT\">tyrant</a> supposed to have been done at the instigation of the queen, and therefore resolved to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REVENGE\">revenge</a> it on her by killing his own son whom he had by her. He therefore, without the least remorse, caused the young prince's throat to be cut; and having put his mangled limbs into a box, sent them as a present to his mother Cleopatra. The messenger with whom this box was sent, was one of his guards. He was ordered to wait till the queen's birthday, which approached, and was to be celebrated with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTRAORDINARY\">extraordinary</a> pomp; and in the midst of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> rejoicing, he was to deliver the present.\n\nThe horror and detestation occasioned by this unexampled piece of cruelty cannot be expressed. An army was soon raised, and the command of it given to one Marias, whom the queen had appointed general, and enjoined to take all the necessary steps for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFENCE\">defence</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COUNTRY\">country</a>. On the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, Phycon, having hired a numerous body of mercenaries, sent them, under the command of one Hegelocheus, against the Egyptians. The two armies met on the frontiers of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EGYPT\">Egypt</a>, on which a bloody <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BATTLE\">battle</a> ensued; but at last the Egyptians were entirely defeated, and Marias was taken prisoner. Every one expected that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPTIVE\">captive</a> general would have been put to death with the severest torments; but Phycon, perceiving that his cruelties only exasperated the people, resolved to try whether he could regain their affections by lenity; and therefore pardoned Marias, and let him at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIBERTY\">liberty</a>. Cleopatra, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAN\">mean</a> time, being greatly distressed by this overthrow, demanded assistance from Demetrius king of Syria, who had married her eldest daughter by Philometor, promising him the crown of Egypt for his reward. Demetrius accepted the proposal without hesitation, marched with all his forces into Egypt, and there laid siege to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PELUSIUM\">Pelusium</a>. But he being no less hated in Syria than Phycon was in Egypt, the people of Antioch, taking advantage of his absence, revolted against him, and were joined by most of the other cities in Syria. Thus Demetrius was obliged to return; and Cleopatra, being now in no condition to oppose Phycon, fled to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PTOLEMAIS\">Ptolemais</a>, where her daughter Phycon reigned the queen of Syria at that time resided. Phycon was then restored to the throne of Egypt, which he enjoyed without further molestation till his death; which happened at Alexandria, in the 29th year of his reign, and 67th of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AGE\">age</a>.\n\nTo Phycon succeeded Ptolemy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LATHYRUS\">Lathyrus</a>, about 122 years before Christ; but he had not reigned long, before his mother, finding that he would not be entirely governed by her, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FALSE\">false</a> promises flattered up the Alexandrians, who drove him from the throne, and placed Ptolemy on it his youngest brother Alexander. Lathyrus after this was obliged to content himself with the government of Cyprus, which he was permitted to enjoy in another quiet. Ptolemy Alexander, in the mean time, finding up, he was to have only the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHADOW\">shadow</a> of sovereignty, and that his mother Cleopatra was to have all the power, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STOLE\">stole</a> away privately from Alexandria. The queen used every artifice to bring him back, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> knowing that the Alexandrians would never suffer her to reign alone. At last her son yielded to her entreaties; but soon after, understanding that she had hired assassins to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISPATCH\">dispatch</a> him, he caused her to be murdered.\n\nThe death of the queen was no sooner known to the Alexandrians, than, disdaining to be commanded by restored, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARRICIDE\">parricide</a>, they drove out Alexander, and recalled Lathyrus.\u2014The deposed prince for some time led a rambling life in the island of Cos; but having got together some ships, he, the next year, attempted to return into Egypt. But being met by Tyrrhus, Lathyrus's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADMIRAL\">admiral</a>, he was defeated, and obliged to fly to Myra in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LYCIA\">Lycia</a>. From Myra he steered his course towards Cyprus, hoping that the inhabitants would <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a> him on the throne, instead of his brother. But Chares, another of Lathyrus's admirals, coming up with him while he was ready to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAND\">land</a>, an engagement ensued, in which Alexander's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEET\">fleet</a> was dispersed, and he himself killed.\n\nDuring these disturbances, Apion king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CYRENAICA\">Cyrenaica</a>, the son of Ptolemy Phycon by a concubine, having bequeathed maintained peace and tranquillity in his dominions during a reign of 21 years, died, and by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> left his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-KINGDOM\">kingdom</a> to the Romans; and thus the Egyptian empire was considerably reduced and circumcised.\n\nLathyrus being now delivered from all competitors, turned his arms against the city of Thebes, which had revolted from him. The king marched in person against the rebels; and, having defeated them in a pitched battle, laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> siege to their city. The inhabitants defended themselves with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESOLUTION\">resolution</a> for three years. At last, however, they were obliged to submit, and the city was given up to be plundered by the soldiery. They left everywhere the most melancholy\nholly monuments of their avarice and cruelty; so that Thebes, which till that time had been one of the most wealthy cities of Egypt, was now reduced so low that it never afterwards made any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a>.\n\nAbout 76 years before Christ, Ptolemy Lathyrus was succeeded by Alexander II. He was the son of the Ptolemy Alexander for whom Lathyrus had been driven out; and had met with many adventures. He was first sent by Cleopatra into the island of Cos, with a great sum of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MONEY\">money</a>, and all her jewels; as thinking that was the safest place where they could be kept. When <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MITHRIDATES\">Mithridates</a> king of Pontus made himself <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MASTER\">master</a> of that island, the inhabitants delivered up to him the young Egyptian prince, together with all the treasures. Mithridates gave him an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EDUCATION\">education</a> suitable to his birth; but he, not thinking himself safe with a prince who had shed the blood of his own children, fled to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAMP\">camp</a> of Sylla the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DICTATOR\">dictator</a>, who was then making war in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASIA\">Asia</a>. From that time he lived in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAMILY\">family</a> of the Roman general, till news was brought to Rome of the death of Lathyrus. Sylla then sent him to Egypt to take possession of the throne. But, before his arrival, the Alexandrians had chosen Cleopatra for their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOVEREIGN\">sovereign</a>. To compromise matters, however, it was agreed, that Ptolemy should marry her, and take her for his partner in the throne. This was accordingly done; and 19 days after the marriage, the unhappy queen was murdered by her husband, who for 15 years afterwards showed himself such a monster of wickedness, that a general insurrection at last ensued among his subjects, and he was obliged to fly to Pompey the Great, who was then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> on the war against Mithridates king of Pontus. But Pompey refusing to concern himself in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a>, he retired to the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TYRE\">Tyre</a>, where he died some months after.\n\nWhen he was forced to shut himself up in the city of Tyre, Alexander had sent ambassadors to Rome, in order to influence the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENATE\">senate</a> in his favour. But, dying before the negociation was finished, he made over by his last will all his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHTS\">rights</a> to the Roman people, declaring them heirs to his kingdom: not out of any affection to the republic; but with a view to raise disputes between the Romans and his rival Auletes, whom the Egyptians had placed on the throne. The will was brought to Rome, where it occasioned warm debates. Some were for taking immediate possession of the kingdom. Others thought that no notice should be taken of such a will, because Alexander had no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> to dispose of his dominions in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PREJUDICE\">prejudice</a> of his successor, and to exclude from the crown those who were of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROYAL\">royal</a> family of Egypt. Cicero represented, that such a notorious imposition would debauch the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MAJESTY\">majesty</a> of the Roman people, and involve them in endless wars and disputes; that the fruitful fields of Egypt would be a strong temptation to the avarice of the people, who would insist on their being divided among them; and lastly, that by this means the bloody quarrels about the Agrarian laws would be revived. These reasons had some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> with the senate; but what chiefly prevented them from seizing on Egypt at this time was, that they had lately taken possession of the kingdom of Bithynia in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> of the will of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NICOMEDES\">Nicomedes</a>, and of Cyrene and Libya by the will of Apion. They thought, therefore, that if they should, on the like pretence, take possession of the kingdom of Egypt, this might too much expose their design of setting up a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONARCHY\">monarchy</a>, and occasion a formidable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-COMBINATION\">combination</a> against them.\n\nAuletes, who was now raised to the throne by the Character Egyptians, is said to have surpassed all the kings that went before him in the effeminacy of his manners. The new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> Auletes, which signifies the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLUTE\">flute</a>-player, was given him because he prided himself on his skill in performing upon that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a>, and was not ashamed even to contend for the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIZE\">prize</a> in the public games. He took great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a> in imitating the manners of the Bacchanals; dancing in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FEMALE\">female</a> dress, and in the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-MEASURES\">measures</a> that they used during the solemnity of their god <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BACCHUS\">Bacchus</a>, and hence he had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SURNAME\">surname</a> of the New Dionysius <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> Bacchus. As his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TITLE\">title</a> to the crown was disputable (he being only the son of a concubine), the first care of Auletes was to get himself acknowledged by the Romans, and declared their ally. This was obtained by applying to Julius Caesar, who was at that time <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSUL\">consul</a>, and immensely in debt. Ledged by Caesar being glad of such an opportunity of raising the Roman money, made the king of Egypt pay pretty dear for his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLIANCE\">alliance</a>. Six thousand talents, a sum equal to \u00a31,625,000 <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STERLING\">sterling</a>, were paid partly to Caesar himself, and partly to Pompey, whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTEREST\">interest</a> was necessary for obtaining the consent of the people. Though the revenues of Egypt amounted to twice this sum, yet Auletes found it <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> for him to raise it without severely taxing his subjects. This occasioned a general discontent; and while the people were almost ready to take up arms, a most unjust <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECREE\">decree</a> passed at Rome for seizing the island of Cyprus. When the Alexandrians heard of the intentions of the republic, they preferred Auletes to demand that island as an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANCIENT\">ancient</a> appendage of Egypt; and, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of a refusal, to declare war against that haughty and imperious people, who, they now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAW\">saw</a>, though too late, aimed at nothing less than the sovereignty of the world. With this request the king refused to comply; upon which his subjects, already provoked beyond <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEASURE\">measure</a> at the taxes with which they were loaded, flew to arms, and surrounded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALACE\">palace</a>. The king had the good luck to throne, and escape their fury, and immediately leaving Alexandria, flies to Rome.\n\nIn his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> to that city, he landed on the island of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RHODES\">Rhodes</a>, where the famous Cato at that time was, being on his way to Cyprus, to put the unjust decree of the senate in execution. Auletes, desirous to confer with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAN\">man</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRUDENCE\">prudence</a>, immediately sent to acquaint him with his arrival. He imagined, that, upon this notice, Cato would immediately come and wait upon him; but the proud Roman told the messenger, that if the king of Egypt had anything to say to Cato, he might, if he thought proper, come to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUSE\">house</a>. Accordingly the king went to pay him a visit; but was received with very little ceremony by Cato, who did not even vouchsafe to rise out of his seat when he came into his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRESENCE\">presence</a>. When Auletes had laid his affairs before this haughty republican, he was blamed by him for leaving Egypt, the richest kingdom in the world, in order to expose himself, as he said, to the indignities he would meet with at Rome. There Cato told him, that nothing was in request but wealth and grandeur. All the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RICHES\">riches</a> of Egypt, he said, would not be sufficient\nEgypt sufficient to satisfy the avarice of the leading men in Rome. He therefore advised him to return to Egypt; and strive, by a more equitable conduct, to regain the affections of his people. He even offered to reconduct him thither, and employ his good offices in his behalf. But though Ptolemy was sensible of the propriety of this advice, the friends he had with him dissuaded him from following it, and accordingly he set out for Rome.\n\nOn his arrival in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METROPOLIS\">metropolis</a>, the king found, to his great concern, that Caesar, in whom he placed his greatest confidence, was then in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GAUL\">Gaul</a>. He was received, however, by Pompey with great kindness. He assigned him an apartment in his own house, and omitted nothing that lay in his power to serve him. But notwithstanding the protection of so powerful a man, Auletes was forced to go from house to house like a private person, soliciting the votes of the senators. After he had spent immense treasures in procuring a strong <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTY\">party</a> in the city, he was at last permitted to lay his complaints before the senate; and at the same time there arrived an embassy from the Alexandrians, consisting of 100 citizens, to acquaint the senate with the reasons of their revolt.\n\nWhen Auletes first set out for Rome, the Alexandrians, not knowing what was become of him, placed on the throne his daughter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BERENICE\">Berenice</a>; and sent an embassy into Syria to Antiochus Asiaticus, inviting him into Egypt to marry the queen, and reign in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARTNERSHIP\">partnership</a> with her. Antiochus was dead before the arrival of the ambassadors; upon which the same proposal was made to his brother Seleucus, who readily accepted it. This Seleucus is described by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STRABO\">Strabo</a> as monstrously deformed in body, and still more so in mind. The Egyptians nicknamed him Cybiotaeter, or the Scullion; a name which seemed more fit for him than any other. He was scarce settled on the throne, when he gave a signal instance of his lordly and avaricious temper. Ptolemy the first had caused the body of Alexander the Great to be deposited in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COFFIN\">coffin</a> of maffy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a>. This the king feigned upon; and by that means provoked his wife Berenice to such a degree, that she caused him to be murdered. She then married one Archelaus, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PRIEST\">priest</a> of Comana in Pontus, who pretended to be the son of Mithridates the Great; but was, in fact, only the son of that monarch's general.\n\nAuletes was not a little alarmed on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEARING\">hearing</a> of these transactions, especially when the ambassadors arrived, which he feared would overturn all the schemes he had laboured so much to bring about. The embassy was headed by one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DION\">Dion</a>, a celebrated Academic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PHILOSOPHER\">philosopher</a> who had many powerful friends at Rome. But Ptolemy found means to get both him and most of his followers assassinated; and this intimidated the rest to such a degree, that they durst not execute their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMISSION\">commission</a>, or, for some time, even demand justice for the murder of their colleagues.\n\nThe report of so many murders, however, at last spread a general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALARM\">alarm</a>. Auletes, sure of the protection of Pompey, did not <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SCRUPLE\">scruple</a> to own himself the perpetrator of them. Nay, though an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> was commenced against one Aetius, an assailer, who had stabbed Dion the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHIEF\">chief</a> of the embassy above mentioned, and the crime was fully proved; yet he was acquitted by the venal judges, who had all been bribed by Ptolemy. In a short time, the senate passed a decree, by which it was enacted, that the king of Egypt should be restored by force of arms. All the great men in Rome were ambitious of this commission; which, they thought well knew, would be attended with immense profit by the few. Their contests on this occasion took up a considerable time; and at last a prophecy of the Sybil was found out, which forbade the afflicting an Egyptian monarch with an army. Ptolemy, therefore, wearied out with too long a delay, retired from Rome, where he had made himself generally odious, to the temple of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIANA\">Diana</a> at Ephesus, there to wait the decision of his fate. Here he remained a considerable time; but as he saw that the senate came to no resolution, though he had solicited them by letters to do so; at last, by Pompey's advice, he applied to Gabinius the proconsul of Syria. This Gabinius was a man of a most infamous character, and ready to undertake anything for money. Therefore, though it was contrary to an express <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAW\">law</a> for any governor to go out of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROVINCE\">province</a> without positive orders from the senate and people of Rome, yet Gabinius ventured to transgress this law, upon condition of being well paid for his pains. As a recompense for his trouble, however, he demanded 10,000 talents; that is, 1,937,500L undertakes sterling. Ptolemy, glad to be restored on any terms, agreed to pay the above-mentioned sum; but Gabinius him for a great sum would not stir till he had received one half of it. This obliged the king to borrow it from a Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KNIGHT\">knight</a> named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIUS\">Caius</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RABIRIUS\">Rabirius</a> Posthumus; Pompey interposing his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDIT\">credit</a> and authority for the payment of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITAL\">capital</a> and interest.\n\nGabinius now set out for Egypt, attended by the famous Mark Antony, who at this time served in the army under him. He was met by Archelaus, who since the departure of Auletes had reigned in Egypt jointly with Berenice, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of a numerous army. The Egyptians were utterly defeated, and Archelaus taken prisoner in the first engagement. Thus Gabinius might have put an end to the war at once; but his avarice prompted him to dismiss Archelaus on his paying a considerable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RANSOM\">ransom</a>; after which, pretending that he had made his escape, fresh sums were demanded from Ptolemy for defraying the expenses of the war. For these sums Ptolemy was again obliged to apply to Rabirius, who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENT\">lent</a> him what money he wanted at a very high interest. At last, however, Archelaus was defeated and killed, and thus Ptolemy again became master of all Egypt.\n\nNo sooner was Auletes firmly settled on the throne, than he put to death his daughter Berenice, and opposed his people with the most cruel exactions, in order to procure the money he had been obliged to borrow while in a state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol8.html#article-EXILE\">exile</a>. These oppressions and exactions the cowardly Egyptians bore with great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol14.html#article-PATIENCE\">patience</a>, being intimidated by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GARRISON\">garrison</a> which Gabinius had left in Alexandria. But neither the fear of the Romans, nor the authority of Ptolemy, could make them put up an affront offered to their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGION\">religion</a>. A Roman soldier happened to kill a cat, which was an animal held sacred and even worshipped by the Egyptians; and no sooner was this supposed sacrilege known, than the Alexandrians made a general insurrection, and, gathering together in crowds, made their way through...\nEgypt through the Roman guards, dragged the soldier out of his house, and, in spite of all opposition, tore him in pieces.\n\nNotwithstanding the heavy taxes, however, which Ptolemy laid on his people, it doth not appear that he had any design of paying his debts. Rabirius, who, as we have already observed, had sent him immense sums, finding that the king affected delays, took a voyage to Egypt, in order to expolituate with him in person. Ptolemy paid very little regard to his expolitulations; but excused himself on account of the bad state of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FINANCES\">finances</a>. For this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> he offered to make Rabirius collector general of his revenues, that he might in that employment pay himself. The unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREDITOR\">creditor</a> accepted the employment for fear of losing his debt. But Ptolemy, soon after, upon some frivolous pretence or other, caused him and all his servants to be closely confined. This base conduct exasperated Pompey as much as Rabirius; for the former had been in a manner security for the debt, as the money had been lent at his request, and the business transferred at a country house of his near <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALBA\">Alba</a>. However, as Rabirius had reason to fear the worst, he took the first opportunity of making his escape, glad to get off with life from his cruel and faithless debtor. To complete his misfortunes, he was prosecuted at Rome as soon as he returned. 1. For having enabled Ptolemy to corrupt the senate with sums lent him for that purpose. 2. For having debauched and dishonoured the character of a Roman knight, by farming the revenues, and becoming the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SERVANT\">servant</a> of a foreign prince. 3. For having been an accomplice with Gabinius, and sharing with him the 10,000 talents which that proconsul had received for his Egyptian expedition. By the eloquence of Cicero he was acquitted; and one of the best orations to be found in the writings of that author was composed on this occasion. Gabinius was also prosecuted; and, as Cicero spoke against him, he very narrowly escaped death. He was, however, condemned to perpetual banishment, after having been stripped of all he was worth. He lived in exile till the time of the civil wars, when he was recalled by Caesar, in whose <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERVICE\">service</a> he lost his life.\n\nAuletes enjoyed the throne of Egypt about four years after his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RE\">re</a>-establishment; and at his death left his children, a son and two daughters, under the tuition of the Roman people. The name of the son was Ptolemy, those of the daughters were Cleopatra and Arsinoe. This was the Cleopatra who afterwards became so famous, and had so great a share in the civil wars of Rome. As the transactions of the present reign, however, are so closely connected with the affairs of Rome, that they cannot be well understood without knowing the situation of the Romans at that time, we refer for an account of them to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HISTORY\">History</a> of Rome.\n\nWith Cleopatra ended the family of Ptolemy Lagus, Egypt's first the founder of the Grecian empire in Egypt, after it conquest by had held that country in subjection for the space of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALIPH\">caliph</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAIRO\">Cairo</a>, 294 years. From this time Egypt became a province of the Roman empire, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTINUED\">continued</a> subject to the emperors of Rome or Constantinople. In the year 642, it was conquered by the Arabs under Amru Ibn al As, one of the generals of the caliph Omar. In the year 889, an independent government was set up in this kingdom by Ahmed Ebn Tolun, who rebelled against Al Mokhadi caliph of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BAGDAD\">Bagdad</a>. It continued to be governed by him and his successors for 27 years, when it was again reduced by Al Moctafi caliph of Bagdad. In about 30 years after, we find it again an independent state, being joined with Syria under Mahomet Ebn Taj, who had been appointed governor of these provinces. This government, however, was also but short-lived; for in the year 968 it was conquered by Jawhar, one of the generals of Moez Ledinillah, the Fatemite caliph of Cairo in Barbary. See Barbary, No. 34.\n\nNo sooner was Moez informed of the success of his general, than he prepared with all expedition to go and take possession of his new conquest. Accordingly he ordered all the vast quantities of gold which he and his predecessors had amassed, to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAST\">cast</a> into ingots of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> and figure of the millstones used in hand mills, and conveyed on camels back into Egypt. To show that he was fully determined to abandon his dominions in Barbary, and to make Egypt the residence of himself and his successors, he caused the remains of the three former princes of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RACE\">race</a> to be removed from Cairo in Barbary, and to be deposited in a stately <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOSQUE\">mosque</a> erected for that purpose in the city of Cairo in Egypt. This was a most effectual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> to induce his successors to reside in Egypt also, as it was become an established <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUSTOM\">custom</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DUTY\">duty</a> among those princes frequently to pay their respectful visits to the tombs of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANCESTORS\">ancestors</a>.\n\nTo establish himself the more effectually in his new dominions, Moez suppressed the usual prayers made in the mosques for the caliphs of Bagdad, and substituted for the his own name in their stead. This was complied with, not only in Egypt and Syria, but even throughout all Bagdad, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARABIA\">Arabia</a>, the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MECCA\">Mecca</a> alone excepted. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> was, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCHISM\">schism</a> in the Mahommedan <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAITH\">faith</a>, which continued upwards of 200 years, and was attended with continual anathemas, and sometimes destructive wars between the caliphs of Bagdad and of Egypt.\u2014Having fully established himself in his kingdom, he died in the 45th year of his age, three years after he had left his dominions in Barbary; and was succeeded by his son Abu Al Manfur Barar, named Aziz Billah.\n\nThe new caliph succeeded to the throne at the age of 21; and committed the management of affairs entirely to the care of Jawhar, his father's long-experienced general and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIME\">prime</a> minister. In 978, he sent this famous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WARRIOR\">warrior</a> to drive out Al Aftekin, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMIR\">emir</a> of Damascus. The Egyptian general accordingly formed the siege of that place; but at the end of two months, was obliged to raise it, on the approach of an army of Karmatians under the command of Al Hakem. As Jawhar was not strong enough to venture an engagement with these Karmatians, it was impossible for him to hinder them from effecting a junction with the forces of Al Aftekin. He therefore retreated, or rather fled, towards Egypt with the utmost expedition; but being overtaken by the two confederate armies, he was soon reduced to the last extremity. He was, however, permitted to resume his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-MARCH\">march</a>, on condition that he paused under Al Aftekin's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SWORD\">sword</a> and Al Hakem's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LANCE\">lance</a>; and to this disgraceful condition Jawhar found himself obliged to submit. On his arrival in Egypt,\nhe immediately advised Al Aziz to undertake an expedition in person into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EAST\">east</a>, against the combined army of Turks, Karmatians, and Damascenes, under the command of Al Aftekin and Al Hakem. The caliph followed his advice; and advancing against his enemies, overthrew them with great slaughter. Al Aftekin himself escaped out of the battle; but was afterwards taken and brought to Al Aziz, who made him his chamberlain, and treated him with great kindness. Jawhar, in the mean time, was disgraced on account of his bad success; and in his disgrace he continued till his death, which happened in the year of our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LORD\">Lord</a>, 990, and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEGIRA\">Hegira</a> 381.\n\nThis year Al Aziz having received advice of the death of Saado'dawla prince of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALEPPO\">Aleppo</a>, sent a formidable army under the command of a general named Manjubeckin, to reduce that place. Lulu, who had been appointed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARDIAN\">guardian</a> to Saado'dawla's son, finding himself pressed by the Egyptians, who carried on the siege with great vigour, demanded assistance from the Greek <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMPEROR\">emperor</a>. Accordingly, he ordered a body of troops to advance to Lulu's relief. Manjubeckin, being informed of their approach, immediately raised the siege, and advanced to give them battle. An obstinate engagement ensued, in which the Greeks were at last overthrown with great slaughter. After this victory, Manjubeckin pushed on the siege of Aleppo very briskly; but finding the place capable of defending itself much longer than he at first imagined, and his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PROVISIONS\">provisions</a> beginning to fail, he raised the siege. The caliph upon this sent him a very threatening <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LETTER\">letter</a>, and commanded him to return before Aleppo. He did so; and continued the siege for 13 months; during all which time it was defended by Lulu with incredible bravery. At last, the Egyptians hearing that a numerous army of Greeks was on their way to relieve the city, they raised the siege, and fled with the utmost precipitation. The Greeks then took and plundered some of the cities which Al Aziz possessed in Syria; and Manjubeckin made the best of his way to Damascus, where he set up for himself. Al Aziz being informed of this revolt, marched in person against him with a considerable army; but being taken ill by the way, he expired, in the 21st year of his reign and 42d of his age.\n\nAl Aziz was succeeded by his son Abu Al Mansur, surnamed Al Hakem; who, being only 11 years of age, was put under the tuition of a eunuch of approved integrity.\n\nThis reign is remarkable for nothing so much as the madness with which the caliph was seized in the latter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of it. This manifested itself first by his issuing many preposterous edicts; but at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> grew to such a height, that he fancied himself a god, and found no fewer than 16,000 persons who owned him as such. These were mostly the Dararians, a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SECT\">sect</a> sprung up about this time, who were led called from their chief, Mohammed Ebn Ithmael, surnamed Darari. He is supposed to have inspired the mad caliph with this impious <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NOTION\">notion</a>; and, as Darari set up for a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> Moses, he did not scruple to assert that Al Hakem was the great Creator of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSE\">universe</a>. For this reason, a zealous Turk stabbed him in the caliph's chariot. His death was followed by a three days uproar in the city of Cairo; during which, Darari's house was pulled down, and many of his followers massacred. The feet, however, did not expire with its author. He left behind him a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISCIPLE\">disciple</a> named Hamza, who, being encouraged by the mad caliph, spread it far and wide through his dominions. This was quickly followed by an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABROGATION\">abrogation</a> of all the Mahommedan laws, festivals, and pilgrimages, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRAND\">grand</a> one to Mecca in particular; so that the zealous Mahometans were now greatly alarmed, as justly supposing that Al Hakem designed entirely to suppress the worship of the true God, and introduce his own in its place. From this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPREHENSION\">apprehension</a>, however, they were delivered by the death of the caliph; who was assassinated, by a contrivance of his own father, in the year 1020.\n\nAl Hakem was succeeded by his son Al Thalier, who reigned 15 years; and left the throne to a son under seven years of age, named Al Moftaner Billah.\u2014In the year 1041, a revolt happened in Syria; but Al Moftaner having sent a powerful army into that country, under the command of one Manjubeckin, he not only reduced the rebels, but considerably enlarged the Egyptian dominions in Syria.\n\nIn 1054, a Turk named Al Baffafiri, having quarrelled with the vizir of Al Kayem caliph of Bagdad, fled for attempts to Egypt, and put himself under the protection of Al Moftaner. The latter, imagining this would be a favourable opportunity for enlarging his dominions, and perhaps seizing on the city of Bagdad, supplied Baffafiri with money and troops. By this affluence, he was enabled to possess himself of Arabian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IRAK\">Irak</a>, and ravaged that province to the very gates of Bagdad. On this, Al Kayem wrote to Togrol Beg, or Tangerolipix, the Turkish <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SULTAN\">sultan</a>, who possessed very extensive dominions in the east, to come to his affluence. The sultan immediately complied with his request, and soon arrived at Bagdad with a formidable army and 18 elephants. Of this Baffafiri gave notice to Al Moftaner, and entreated him to exert himself further for his support against so powerful an enemy. This was accordingly done, but nothing worthy of notice happened till the year 1058. At this time Baffafiri having found means to excite Ibrahim the sultan's brother to a revolt, Togrol Beg was obliged to employ all his force against him. This gave Baffafiri an opportunity of seizing on the city of Bagdad itself; and the unfortunate caliph, according to some, was taken prisoner, or, according to others, fled out of the city. Baffafiri, on his entry, caused Al Moftaner to be immediately proclaimed caliph in all <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of the city. Al Kayem's vizir he caused to be led on a camel through the streets of Bagdad, dreffed in a woollen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GOWN\">gown</a>, with a high <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RED\">red</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BONNET\">bonnet</a>, and a leathern <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLAR\">collar</a> about his neck; a man lashing him all the way behind. Then being sewed up in a bull's hide, with the horns placed over his head, and hung upon hooks, he was beaten without ceasing till he died. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERIAL\">imperial</a> palace was plundered, and the caliph himself detained a close prisoner.\n\nThis success was but short-lived; for, in 1059, To- The caliph Togrol Beg defeated his brother Ibrahim, took him pri- restored, foner, and strangled him with a bow string. He then marched to Bagdad, which Baffafiri thought proper to abandon at his approach. Here the caliph Al Kayem was delivered up by Mahras, the governor of a city called Hadiha, who had the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> of him. The caliph\ncaliph was immediately restored to his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIGNITY\">dignity</a>; which Ballafiri no sooner understood, than he again advanced towards the city. Against him Togrol Beg sent a part of his army under some of his generals, while he himself followed with the rest. A battle ensued, in which the army of Ballafiri was defeated, and he himself killed. His head was brought to Togrol Beg, who caused it to be carried on a pike through the streets of Bagdad.\n\nThus the hopes of Al Moftaner were entirely frustrated; and from this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERIOD\">period</a> we may <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DATE\">date</a> the declension of the Egyptian empire under the caliphs. They had made themselves masters of almost all Syria; but no sooner was Ballafiri's bad success known, than the younger part of the citizens of Aleppo revolted, and set up Mahmud Azzo'dawla, who immediately laid siege to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CITADEL\">citadel</a>. Al Moftaner sent a powerful army against him, which Azzo'dawla entirely defeated, and took the general himself prisoner; and soon after this, he made himself master both of the city and citadel, with all their dependencies. In his new dominions he behaved with the greatest cruelty, destroying everything with fire and sword, and making frequent incursions into the neighbouring provinces, which he treated in the same manner.\n\nThis disaster was soon followed by others still more terrible. In 1066, a famine raged over all Egypt and Syria, with such fury, that dogs and cats were sold for four or five Egyptian dinars each, and other provisions in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a>. Multitudes of people died in Cairo for want of food. Nay, so great was the scarcity, that the vizir had but one servant left who was able to attend him to the caliph's palace, and to whom he gave the care of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HORSE\">horse</a> when he alighted at the gate. But at his return, he was surprised to find that the horse had been carried off, killed and eaten by the famished people. Of this he complained to the caliph; who caused three of them who had carried off the horse to be hanged. Next day, however, he was still more surprised to hear, that all the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLESH\">flesh</a> had been picked off the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BONES\">bones</a> of the three unhappy criminals, so that nothing but the skeletons were left. And to such a degree of misery were the inhabitants, not only in Cairo but throughout all Egypt, reduced, that the carcases of those who died were sold for food at a great price, instead of being buried. All this time the caliph showed the greatest kindness and beneficence towards his unhappy subjects; inasmuch that of 10,000 horses, mules, and camels, which he had in his stables when the famine began, he had only three left when it was removed.\n\nThe famine was followed by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAGUE\">plague</a>; and this by an invasion of the Turks under Abu <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALI\">Ali</a> Al Hafan Naferod'dawla, the very general who had been sent against the rebel Azzo'dawla and defeated by him. He began with besieging the caliph in his own palace; and the unhappy prince, being in no condition to make resistance, was obliged to buy himself off at the expense of every thing valuable that was left in his exhausted capital and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREASURY\">treasury</a>. This, however, did not hinder those merciless plunderers from ravaging all the Lower Egypt from Cairo to Alexandria, and committing the most horrid cruelties through that whole tract.\u2014This happened in the years 1067 and 1068; and in 1069 and 1070, there happened two other revolts in Syria: so that this country was now almost entirely lost.\n\nIn 1095 died the caliph Al Moftaner, having reigned 60 years; and was succeeded by his son Abul Kasem, named Al Moftali. The most remarkable transaction of this prince's reign, was his taking the city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JERUSALEM\">Jerusalem</a> from the Turks in 1098; but this Jerusalem success was only of short <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DURATION\">duration</a>; for it was the same taken year taken by the crusaders.\n\nFrom this time to the year 1164, the Egyptian history affords little else than an account of the intestine broils and contests between the vizirs or prime ministers, who were now become so powerful, that they had in a great measure stripped the caliphs of their civil power, and left them nothing but a shadow of spiritual dignity. These contests at last gave occasion to a revolution, by which the race of Fatemite caliphs revolution was totally extinguished. This revolution was accomplished in the following manner. One Shauer, having overcome all his competitors, became vizir to Al <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADEL\">Adel</a>, the eleventh caliph of Egypt. He had not been long in possession of this office, when Al Dargam, an officer of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RANK\">rank</a>, endeavoured to deprive him of it. Both parties quickly had recourse to arms; and a battle ensued, in which Shauer was defeated, and obliged to fly to Nuroddin prince of Syria, by whom he was graciously received, and who promised to reinstate him in his office of vizir. As an inducement to Nuroddin to assist him more powerfully, Shauer told him that the crusaders had landed in Egypt, and made a considerable progress in the conquest of it. He promised also, that, in case he was reinstated in his office, he would pay Nuroddin annually the third part of the revenues of Egypt; and would, besides, defray the whole expense of the expedition.\n\nAs Nuroddin bore an implacable hatred to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHRISTIANS\">Christians</a>, he readily undertook an expedition against them, for which he was to be so well paid. He therefore sent an army into Egypt under the command of Shauer and a general named Afadoddin. Dargam, in the meantime, had cut off so many generals whom he imagined favourable to Shauer's interest, that he thereby weakened the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILITARY\">military</a> force of the kingdom, and in a great measure deprived himself of the power of resistance. He was therefore easily overthrown by Afadoddin, and Shauer reinstated in the office of vizir. The faithless minister, however, no sooner saw himself firmly established in his office, than he refused to fulfil his engagements to Nuroddin by paying the stipulated sums. Upon this, Afadoddin seized Pelusium and some other cities. Shauer then entered into an alliance with the crusaders, and Afadoddin was besieged by their combined forces in Pelusium. Nuroddin, however, having invaded the Christian dominions in Syria, and taken a strong fortress called Harem, Shauer and his confederates thought proper to hearken to some terms of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ACCOMMODATION\">accommodation</a>, and Afadoddin was permitted to depart for Syria.\n\nIn the mean time, Nuroddin, having subdued the greatest part of Syria and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MESOPOTAMIA\">Mesopotamia</a>, resolved to make Shauer feel the weight of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RESENTMENT\">resentment</a> on account of his perfidious conduct. He therefore sent back Afadoddin into Egypt with a sufficient force, to compel Shauer to fulfil his engagements; but this\nthe vizir took care to do before the arrival of Afadod-\ndin; and thus, for the present, avoided the danger.\nIt was not long, however, before he gave Nuruddin\nfresh occasion to fear this general against him. That\nprince had now driven the crusaders almost entirely\nout of Syria, but was greatly alarmed at their progress\nin Egypt; and consequently offended at the alliance\nwhich Shawer had concluded with them, and which\nhe still persisted in observing. This <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TREATY\">treaty</a> was also\nthought to be contrived on purpose to prevent Shawer\nfrom being able to fulfill his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROMISE\">promise</a> to Nuruddin,\nof sending him annually a third of the revenues of Egypt.\nNuruddin therefore again despatched Afaddoddin into\nEgypt, in the year 1166, with a sufficient force, and\nattended by the famous Salahaddin, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALADIN\">Saladin</a>, his\nown nephew. They entered the kingdom without op-\nposition, and totally defeated Shawer and the cru-\nsaders. They next made themselves masters of Alex-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ANDRIA\">andria</a>; and, after that, overran all the Upper Egypt.\nSaladin was left with a considerable garrison in Alexan-\ndria; but Afaddoddin was no sooner gone, than the\ncrusaders laid siege to that city. This at last obliged\nAfaddoddin to return to its relief. The great losses he\nhad sustained in this expedition probably occasioned\nhis agreeing to a treaty with Shawer, by which he\nengaged to retire out of Egypt, upon being paid a\nsum of money.\n\nAfaddoddin was no sooner gone, than Shawer enter-\ned into a fresh treaty with the Franks. By this new\nalliance he was to attack Nuruddin in his own domi-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NIONS\">nions</a>, as he was at that time engaged in quelling some\nrebels, which would effectually prevent his sending\nany more forces into Egypt. This treaty so provoked\nthe Syrian prince, that he resolved to suspend his other\nconquests for some time, and exert his whole strength\nin the conquest of Egypt.\n\nBy this time the crusaders had reduced Pelusium,\nand made a considerable progress in the kingdom, as\nwell as in some other countries, through the divisions\nwhich reigned among the Mahometan princes. In\nsuch places as they conquered, they put almost every\nbody to the sword, Christians as well as Mahometans;\nfelling their prisoners for slaves, and giving up the\ntowns to be plundered by the soldiers. From Pelu-\nsium they marched to Cairo; which was then in no\nposition of defense, and in the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFUSION\">confusion</a>, by\nreason of the divisions which reigned in it. Shawer,\ntherefore, as soon as he heard of their approach, cau-\nsed the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTER\">quarter</a> called Mefr to be set on fire,\nand the inhabitants to retire into the other parts. He\nalso prevailed upon the caliph to solicit the assistance\nof Nuruddin; which the latter was indeed pretty much\ninclined of himself to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRANT\">grant</a>, as it gave him the fairest\nopportunity he could have wished for, both of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DRIVING\">driving</a>\nthe crusaders out of Egypt, and of seizing the king-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol8.html#article-DOM\">dom</a> to himself. For this purpose he had already raised\nan army of 60,000 horse under his general Afaddoddin;\nand, on the receipt of Al Aded's message, gave them\norders to set out immediately. The crusaders were\nnow arrived at Cairo; and had to closely besiege that\nplace, that neither Shawer nor the caliph knew any\nthing of the approach of the Moslem army which was\nhastening to their relief. The vizir, therefore, find-\ning it impossible to hold out long against the enemy,\nhad recourse to his old refuge of treaties and high\npromises. He sent the enemy 100,000 dinars, and\npromised them 900,000 more, if they would raise the\nsiege; which they, dreading the approach of Afaddod-\ndin, very readily accepted.\n\nThe army of Nuruddin now approached the capital\nby hasty marches, and were everywhere received with\nrepulse by the greatest demonstrations of joy. Afaddoddin,\non his arrival at Cairo, was invited by Al Aded to the royal\npalace, where he was entertained in the most magnifi-\ncent manner, and received several presents; nor were\nSaladin and the other principal officers less magnificently\ntreated. Shawer also, confident of his perfidious\nconduct, was no less affiduous in attending punctually\nupon him. But having invited the general and some\nothers to an entertainment, he had formed a scheme of\nhaving them feasted and murdered. The plot, however,\nbeing discovered, Shawer himself had his head cut off,\nand Afaddoddin was made vizir in his stead. He did\nnot, however, long enjoy his new dignity; for he died\ntwo months and five days after his installation, being Saladin be-\nsucceeded in his office of vizir by his nephew <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SALA\">Sala</a> comes vizir\nof Egypt.\n\nThe new vizir was the youngest of all the grandees\nwho aspired to that office, but had already given some\nsignal proofs of his valour and conduct. What deter-\nmined the caliph to prefer him to all the rest is not\nknown; but it is certain that some of them were highly\ndispleased with his promotion, and even publicly de-\nclared that they would not obey him. In order to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAIN\">gain</a>\nthese to his interest, therefore, Saladin found it neces-\nsary to distribute among them part of the vast treasures\nleft by his uncle; by which means he soon governed\nEgypt without control, as had been customary with\nthe vizirs for some time before. Soon after his being\ninstalled into the office of vizir, he gave a total defeat\nto the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol7.html#article-NEGROES\">negroes</a> who guarded the royal palace, and had\nopposed his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTION\">election</a>; by which means, and a strong\ngarrison he had placed in the castle of Cairo, his power\nbecame firmly established. Though he had not the\nleast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTENTION\">intention</a> of continuing in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALLEGIANCE\">allegiance</a> to Nu-\nroddin, he did not think it prudent at first to declare\nhimself. He sent for his father, however, and the rest\nof his family, who were in Nuruddin's dominions, in\norder, as he said, to make them partakers of his gran-\ndeur and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAPPINESS\">happiness</a>. Nuruddin did not think proper\nto deny this request; though, being already jealous of\nthe great power of Saladin, he insisted that his family\nshould consider him only as one of his generals in E-\ngypt.\n\nA good understanding subsisted between Nuruddin\nand Saladin for some time, which did not a little con-\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIBUTE\">tribute</a> to raise the credit of the latter with the Egyp-\ntians. In 1169, Nuruddin sent him orders to omit\nthe name of Al Aded, the caliph of Egypt, in the pu-\nblic prayers, and substitute that of the caliph of Bagdad\nin its place. This was at any rate a dangerous at-\ntempt; as it might very readily produce a revolt in fa-\nvour of Al Aded; or if it did not, it gave Saladin an\nopportunity of engrossing even that small remnant of\npower which was left to the caliph. Al Aded, how-\never, was not sensible of his disgrace; for he was on\nthe deathbed, and past <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECOVERY\">recovery</a>, when Nuruddin's or-\nders were executed. After his death, Saladin seized on\nall his wealth and valuable effects; which consisted of\njewels of prodigious size, sumptuous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FURNITURE\">furniture</a>, a library\ncontaining 100,000 volumes, &c. His family he caused to be closely confined in the most private and retired part of the palace; and either manumitted his slaves, or kept them for himself, or disposed of them to others.\n\nSaladin was now arrived at the highest pitch of wealth, power, and grandeur. He was, however, obliged to behave with great circumspection with regard to Nuruddin: who still continued to treat him as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VASSAL\">vassal</a>, and would not suffer him to dispute the least of his commands. He relied for advice chiefly on his father Ayub; who was a consummate politician, and very ambitious of seeing his son raised to the throne of Egypt. He therefore advised Saladin to continue his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> in his resolutions; and, whilst he amused Nuruddin with feigned submissions, to take every method in his power to secure himself in the possession of so valuable a kingdom. Nuruddin himself, however, was too great a master in the art of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISSIMULATION\">dissimulation</a> to be easily imposed on by others; and therefore, though he pretended to be well pleased with Saladin's conduct, he was all this time raising a powerful army, with which he was fully determined to invade Egypt the following year. But while he meditated this expedition, he was seized with a quinsy at the castle of Damascus, which put an end to his life, in the year 1173.\n\nSaladin, though now freed from the apprehensions of such a formidable enemy, dared not venture to assume the title of Sovereign, while he saw the successor of Nuruddin at the head of a very powerful army, and no less devious than able to dispossess him. For this reason his first care was to secure to himself an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ASYLUM\">asylum</a>, in case he should be obliged to leave Egypt altogether. For this purpose he chose the kingdom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUBIA\">Nubia</a>; but having despatched his brother Malek Turanlihi thither, at the head of a considerable army, the latter was so much struck with the sterility and desolate appearance of the country, that he returned without attempting anything. Saladin then sent his brother into Arabia Felix. Arabia Felix, in order to subdue that country, which had been for some time held by Abdalnabi an Arabian prince. Malek entered the country without opposition; and having brought Abdalnabi to a general action, entirely defeated him, took him prisoner, and threw him into irons. He then overran and reduced under subjection to Saladin great part of the country, taking no fewer than 80 castles or fortresses of considerable strength.\n\nAfter this good fortune, Saladin, now sure of a convenient place of refuge in case of any misfortune, assumed the title of Sultan or sovereign of Egypt; and was acknowledged as such by the greater part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>. The zeal of the Egyptians for the Fatemite caliphs, however, soon produced a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REBELLION\">rebellion</a>. One Al Kanz, or Kanzanaddowla, governor of a city in Upper Egypt, assembled a great army of blacks, or rather swarthy natives; and marching directly into the lower country, was there joined by great numbers of other Egyptians. Against them Saladin despatched his brother Malek, who soon defeated and entirely dispersed them. This, however, did not prevent another insurrection under an impostor, who pretended to be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DAVID\">David</a> the son of Al Aided the last Fatemite caliph, and had collected a body of 100,000 men. But before they had time to do any great damage, they were surprised by the sultan's forces, and entirely defeated. Above 300 were publicly hanged, and a vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> perished in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FIELD\">field</a>, infomuch that it was thought scarce a fourth part of the whole body escaped.\n\nAbout this time Saladin gained a considerable advantage over the crusaders, commanded by William II., king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SICILY\">Sicily</a>. That prince had invaded Egypt with a numerous fleet and army, with which he laid close siege to Alexandria both by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEA\">sea</a> and land. Saladin, however, marched to the relief of the city with such surprising expedition, that the crusaders were seized with a sudden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PANIC\">panic</a>, and fled with the utmost precipitation, leaving all their military engines, stores, and baggage behind.\n\nIn the year 1175, the inhabitants of Damascus begged Saladin to accept the sovereignty of that city and its dependencies; being jealous of the minister, reign of Damascus, who had the tuition of the reigning prince, and who governed all with an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSOLUTE\">absolute</a> sway. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> was no sooner made, than the sultan set out with the utmost <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CELERITY\">celerity</a> to Damascus, at the head of a chosen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DETACHMENT\">detachment</a> of 700 horse. Having settled his affairs in that city, he appointed his brother Saif Al <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISLAM\">Islam</a> governor of it; and set out for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEMS\">Hems</a>, to which he immediately laid siege. Having made himself master of this place, he then proceeded to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HAMAH\">Hamah</a>. The city very soon surrendered, but the citadel held out for some time. Saladin pretended that he accepted the sovereignty of Damascus and the other places he had conquered, only as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPUTY\">deputy</a> to Al Malek Al Saleh, the successor of Nuruddin, and who was then under age; and that he was desirous of sending Azzoddin, who commanded in the citadel, with a letter to Aleppo, where the young prince resided. This so pleased Azzoddin, that he took the oath of fidelity to Saladin, and immediately set out with the sultan's letter. He had not, however, been long at Aleppo before he was by the minister's orders thrown into prison; upon which his brother, who had been appointed governor of the citadel Hamah in his absence, delivered it up to Saladin without further ceremony. The sultan then marched to Aleppo, with a design to reduce it; but, being vigorously repulsed in several attacks, he was at last obliged to abandon the enterprise. At the same time, Kamchegyn, Al Malek's minister or vizir, hired the chief of the Batanists, or Assassins*, to murder him. Several attempts were made in consequence of this application; but all of them, happily for Saladin, miscarried.\n\nAfter raising the siege of Aleppo, Saladin returned to Hems, which place the crusaders had invested. On his approach, however, they thought proper to retire; after which, the sultan made himself master of the strong castle belonging to that place, which before he had not been able to reduce. This was soon followed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUCTION\">reduction</a> of Baalbec; and these rapid conquests so alarmed the ministers of Al Malek, that, entering into a combination with some of the neighbouring princes, they raised a formidable army, with which they despatched to crush the sultan at once. Saladin, fearing the event of a war, offered to cede Hemsemenig, and Hamah to Al Malek, and govern Damascus only as his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIEUTENANT\">lieutenant</a>; but these terms being rejected, a battle ensued; in which the allied army was utterly defeated, and the shattered remains of it shut up in the city of Aleppo. This produced a treaty, by which\nSaladin was left master of all Syria, excepting only the city of Aleppo and the territory belonging to it.\n\nIn 1176 Saladin returned from the conquest of Syria, and made his triumphal entry into Cairo. Here, having rested himself and his troops for some time, he began to encompass the city with a wall 29,000 cubits in length, but which he did not live to finish. Next year he led a very numerous army into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PALESTINE\">Palestine</a> against the crusaders. But here his usual good fortune failed him. His army was entirely defeated. Forty thousand of his men were left dead on the field; and the rest fled with so much precipitation, that, having no towns in the neighbourhood where they could shelter themselves, they traversed the vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESERT\">desert</a> between Palestine and Egypt, and scarce stopped till they reached the capital itself. The greatest part of the army by this means perished; and as no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a> was to be had in the desert above mentioned, almost all the beasts died of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THIRST\">thirst</a> before the fugitives arrived on the confines of Egypt. Saladin himself seemed to have been greatly intimidated; for in a letter to his brother Al Malek, he told him, that \"he was more than once in the most imminent danger; and that God, as he apprehended, had delivered him from thence, in order to reserve him for the execution of some grand and important design.\"\n\nIn the year 1182, the sultan set out on an expedition to Syria with a formidable army, amidst the acclamations and good wishes of the people. He was, however, repulsed with loss both before Aleppo and Al Mawfak, after having spent much time and labour in besieging these two important places.\n\nIn the mean time, a most powerful fleet of European ships appeared on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol18.html#article-RED_SEA\">Red sea</a>, which threatened the cities of Mecca and Medina with the utmost danger. The news of this armament no sooner reached Cairo, than Abu Bekr, Saladin's brother, who had been left viceroy in the sultan's absence, caused another to be fitted out with all speed under the command of Lulu, a brave and experienced officer, who quickly came up with them, and a dreadful engagement ensued. The Christians were defeated after an obstinate resistance, and all the prisoners butchered in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLD\">cold</a> blood. This proved such a terrible blow to the Europeans, that they never more ventured on a like attempt.\n\nIn 1183, Saladin continued to extend his conquests. The city of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMIDA\">Amida</a> in Mesopotamia surrendered to him in eight days; after which, being provoked by some violences committed by the prince of Aleppo, he resolved at all events to make himself master of that place. He was now attended with better success than formerly; for as his army was very numerous, and he pushed on the siege with the utmost vigour, Amoddinin the prince capitulated, upon condition of being allowed to possess certain cities in Mesopotamia which had formerly belonged to him, and being ready to attend the sultan on whatever expedition he pleased. After the conquest of Aleppo, Saladin took three other cities, and then marched against his old enemies the crusaders. Having sent out a party to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECONNOITRE\">reconnoitre</a> the enemy, they fell in with a considerable detachment of Christians; whom they easily defeated, taking about 100 prisoners, with the loss of only a single man on their side. The sultan, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANIMATED\">animated</a> by this first instance of success, drew up his forces in order of battle, and advanced against the crusaders, who had assembled their whole army at Sepphoris in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GALILEE\">Galilee</a>. On viewing the sultan's troops, however, and perceiving them to be greatly superior in strength to what they had at first apprehended, they thought proper to decline an engagement, nor could Saladin with all his skill force them to it. But though it was found impossible to bring the crusaders to a decisive engagement, Saladin found means to harass them greatly, and destroyed great numbers of their men. He carried off also many prisoners, dismantled three of their strongest cities, laid waste their territories, and concluded the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAMPAIGN\">campaign</a> with taking another strong town.\n\nFor three years Saladin continued to gain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a> on Christians the crusaders, yet without any decisive advantage; but totally defeated in 1187, the fortune of war was remarkably unfavourable to them. The Christians now found themselves obliged to venture a battle, by reason of the cruel ravages committed in their territories by Saladin, and by reason of the encroachments he daily made on them. Both armies therefore being resolved to exert their utmost efforts, a most fierce and bloody battle ensued. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NIGHT\">Night</a> prevented victory from declaring on either side, and the fight was renewed with equal obstinacy next day. The victory was still left undecided; but the third day the sultan's men finding themselves surrounded by the enemy on all sides but one, and there also hemmed in by the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JORDAN\">Jordan</a>, so that there was no room to fly, fought like men in despair, and at last gained a most complete victory. Vast numbers of the Christians perished on the field. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> body found means to retire in safety to the top of a neighbouring hill covered with wood; but being surrounded by Saladin's troops, who set fire to the wood, they were all obliged to surrender at discretion. Some of them were butchered by their enemies as soon as they delivered themselves into their hands, and others thrown into irons. Among the latter were the king of Jerusalem himself, Arnold prince of Al Shawboc and Al Carac, the masters of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TEMPLARS\">Templars</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HOSPITALLERS\">Hospitallers</a>, with almost the whole body of the latter. So great was the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONFLAGRATION\">conflagration</a> of the Christians on this occasion, that one of Saladin's men is said to have taken 30 of them prisoners, and tied them together with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CORD\">cord</a> of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-TENT\">tent</a>, to prevent them from making their escape. The masters of the Templars and Hospitallers, with the knights acting under them, were no sooner brought into Saladin's presence, than he ordered them all to be cut in pieces. He called them Assassins or Batanists; and had been wont to pay 50 dinars for the head of every Templar or Hospitaller that was brought him. After the engagement, Saladin feasted himself in a magnificent tent, placing the king of Jerusalem on his right hand, and Arnold prince of Al Shawboc and Al Carac on his left. Then he drank to the former, who was at that time ready to expire with thirst, and at the same time offered him a cup of snow water. This was thankfully received; and the king immediately drank to the prince of Al Carac, who sat near him. But here Saladin interrupted him with some warmth: \"I will not (says he) suffer this cursed rogue to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRINK\">drink</a>; as that, according to the laudable and generous custom of the Arabs, would secure to him his life.\" Then, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a>\nturning towards the prince, he reproached him with having undertaken the expedition while in alliance with himself, with having intercepted an Egyptian caravan in the time of profound peace, and maiming the people of which it was composed, &c. Notwithstanding all this, he told him, he would grant him his life, if he would embrace Mahometanism. This condition, however, was refused; and the sultan, with one stroke of his scimitar, cut off the prince's head. This greatly terrified the king of Jerusalem; but Saladin assured him he had nothing to fear, and that Arnold had brought on himself a violent death by his want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> honesty.\n\nThe crusaders being thus totally defeated and dispersed, Saladin next laid siege to Tiberias, which capitulated in a short time. From thence he marched towards Acca or Ptolemais, which likewise surrendered after a short siege. Here he found 4000 Mahometan prisoners in chains, whom he immediately released. As the inhabitants enjoyed at present a very extensive trade, the place being full of merchants, he found there not only vast sums of money, but likewise a great variety of wares exceedingly valuable, all which he seized and applied to his own use. About the same time his brother Al Malec attacked and took a very strong fortress in the neighborhood; after which the sultan divided his army into three bodies, that he might with the greater facility overrun the territories of the Christians. Thus, in a very short time, he made himself master of Neapolis, Caesarea, Sepphoris, and other cities in the neighborhood of Ptolemais, where his soldiery found only women and children, the men having been all killed or taken prisoners. His next conquest was Joppa, which was taken by storm after a vigorous resistance. Everything being then settled, and a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTRIBUTION\">distribution</a> made of the spoils and captives, Saladin marched in person against Tebrieh, a strong fortress in the neighborhood of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIDON\">Sidon</a>; which was taken by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASSAULT\">assault</a>, after it had sustained a siege of six days. No sooner was he master of this place, than he ordered the fortresses to be razed, and the garrison put to the sword. From Tebrieh the victorious sultan proceeded to Sidon itself; which, being deserted by its prince, surrendered almost on the first summons. Berytus was next invested, and surrendered in seven days. Among the prisoners Saladin found in this place the prince of a territory called Hobeiil, who by way of ransom delivered up his dominions to him, and was of consequence released. About the same time, a Christian ship, in which was a nobleman of great courage and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> in war, arrived at the harbour of Ptolemais, not knowing that it was in the hands of Saladin. The governor might easily have secured the vessel; but neglecting the opportunity, she escaped to Tyre, where the above-mentioned nobleman, together with the prince of Hobeiil, contributed not a little to retrieve the affairs of the Christians, and enable them to make a stand for four years after.\n\nSaladin in the mean time went on with his conquests. Having made himself master of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ASCALON\">Ascalon</a> after a siege of 14 days, he next invested Jerusalem. The garrison was numerous, and made an obstinate defense; but Saladin having at last made a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREACH\">breach</a> in the walls by sapping, the besieged desired to capitulate. This was at first refused; upon which the Christian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AMBASSADOR\">ambassador</a> made the following speech: \"If that be the case, know, O sultan, that we who are extremely numerous, and have been retrained from fighting like men in despair only by the hopes of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONOURABLE\">honourable</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPITULATION\">capitulation</a>, will kill all our wives and children, commit all our wealth and valuable effects to the flames, massacre 5000 prisoners now in our hands, leave not a single <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEAST\">beast</a> of burden or animal of any kind belonging to us alive, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEVEL\">level</a> with the ground the rock you esteem sacred, together with the temple Al Akfa. After this we will fall out upon you in a body; and doubt not but we shall either cut to pieces a much greater number of you than we are, or force you to abandon the siege.\" This desperate speech had such an effect upon Saladin, that he immediately called a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNCIL\">council</a> of war, at which all the general officers declared, that it would be most proper to allow the Christians to depart unmolested. The sultan therefore allowed them to march out freely and securely with their wives, children, and effects; after which he received ten dinars from every man capable of paying that sum, five from every woman, and two from every young person under age. For the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-POOR\">poor</a> who were not able to pay anything, the rest of the inhabitants raised the sum of 30,000 dinars.\n\nMost of the inhabitants of Jerusalem were escorted by a detachment of Saladin's troops to Tyre; and soon after, he advanced with his army against that place. As the port was blocked up by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUADRON\">squadron</a> of five men of war, Saladin imagined that he should easily become master of it. But in this he found himself mistaken. For, one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORNING\">morning</a> by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> of day, a Christian fleet fell upon his squadron, and entirely defeated it; nor did a single vessel escape their pursuit. A considerable number of the Mahometans threw themselves into the sea during the engagement; most of whom were drowned, though some few escaped. About the same time Saladin himself was vigorously repulsed by land; so that, after calling a council of war, it was thought proper to raise the siege.\n\nIn 1188, Saladin, though his conquests were not so rapid and considerable as hitherto, continued still superior to his enemies. He reduced the city of Laodicea and some others, together with many strong castles; but met also with several repulses. At last he took the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROAD\">road</a> to Antioch; and having reduced all the fortresses that lay in his way, many of which had been deemed impregnable, Bohemond prince of Antioch was so much intimidated, that he desired a truce for seven or eight months. This Saladin found himself obliged to comply with, on account of the prodigious fatigues his men had endured, and because his auxiliaries now demanded leave to return home.\n\nAll these heavy losses of the Christians, however, proved in some respects an advantage, as they were thus obliged to lay aside their animosities, which had originally proved the ruin of their affairs. Those who had defended Jerusalem, and most of the other fortresses taken by Saladin, having retreated to Tyre, formed there a very numerous body. This proved the means of preserving that city, and also of re-establishing their affairs for the present. For, having received powerful succours from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-EUROPE\">Europe</a>, they were enabled in 1189 to take the field with 30,000 foot and 2000 horse. Their first attempt was upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ALEXANDRETTA\">Alexandretta</a>; from whence they dislodged a strong party of Mahometans, and made\nthemselfes masters of the place with very little loss. They next laid siege to Ptolemais; of which Saladin had no sooner received intelligence, than he marched to the relief of the place. After several skirmishes with various success, a general engagement ensued, in which Saladin was defeated with the loss of 10,000 men. This enabled the Christians to carry on the siege of Ptolemais with greater vigour; which place, however, they were not able to reduce for the space of two years.\n\nThis year the sultan was greatly alarmed by an account that the emperor of Germany was advancing to Constantinople with an army of 260,000 men, in order to assist the other crusaders. This prodigious armament, however, came to nothing. The multitude was so reduced with sickness, famine, and fatigue, that scarce 1000 of them reached the camp before Ptolemais. The siege of that city was continued, though with bad success on the part of the Christians. They were repulsed in all their attacks, their engines were burnt with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAPHTHA\">naphtha</a>, and the besieged always received supplies of provisions in spite of the utmost efforts of the besiegers; at the same time that a dreadful famine and pestilence raged in the Christian camp, which sometimes carried off 200 people a-day.\n\nIn 1191, the Christians received powerful succours from Europe. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHILIP\">Philip</a> II. of France, and Richard I. of England (from his great courage furred named Caur de Lion) arrived at the camp before Ptolemais. The latter was esteemed the bravest and most enterprising of all the generals the crusaders had; and the spirits of his soldiers were greatly elated by the thoughts of acting under such an experienced commander. Soon after his arrival, the English sunk a Mahometan ship of vast size, having on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOARD\">board</a> 650 soldiers, a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of arms and provisions, going from Berytus to Ptolemais. Of the soldiers and sailors who navigated this vessel, only a single person escaped; who being taken prisoner by the English, was despatched to the sultan with the news of the disaster. The besieged still defended themselves with the greatest resolution; and the king of England happening to fall sick, the operations of the besiegers were considerably delayed. On his recovery, however, the attacks were renewed with such fury, that the place was every moment in danger of being taken by assault. This induced them to send a letter to Saladin, informing him, that if they did not receive succours the very next day, they would be obliged to submit. As this town was the sultan's principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGAZINE\">magazine</a> of arms, he was greatly affected with the account of their distress, especially as he found it impossible to relieve them. The inhabitants, therefore, found themselves under a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NECESSITY\">necessity</a> of surrendering the place. One of the terms of the capitulation was, that the crusaders should receive a very considerable sum of money from Saladin, in consequence of their delivering up the Mahometan prisoners they had in their hands. This article Saladin refused to comply with; and, in consequence of his refusal, Richard caused 3000 of those unfortunate men to be slaughtered at once.\n\nAfter the reduction of Ptolemais, the king of England, now made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERALISSIMO\">generalissimo</a> of the crusaders, took the road to Acrelon, in order to besiege that place; after which, he intended to make an attempt upon Jerusalem itself. Saladin proposed to intercept his passage, and placed himself in the way with an army of 300,000 men. On this occasion was fought one of the greatest battles of that age. Saladin was totally defeated, with the loss of 40,000 men; and Acrelon soon fell into the hands of the crusaders. Other sieges were afterwards carried on with success, and Richard even approached within sight of Jerusalem, when he found, that by reason of the weakened state of his army, and the divisions which prevailed among the officers who commanded it, he should be under the necessity of concluding a truce with the sultan. This was accordingly done in the year 1193; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TERM\">term</a> was, three years, three months, three weeks, three days, and three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>; soon after which the king of England set out on his return to his own dominions.\n\nIn 1193 Saladin died, to the inexpressible grief of all true Mahometans, who held him in the utmost veneration. His dominions in Syria and Palestine were shared out among his children and relations into many petty principalities. His son Othman succeeded to the crown of Egypt; but as none of his successors possessed the enterprising <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENIUS\">genius</a> of Saladin, the history from that time till the year 1250 affords nothing remarkable. At this time the reigning sultan Malek Al-Mamouls Salek was dethroned and slain by the Mamelucks or Mamelouks, as they are called, a kind of mercenary soldiers' masters who served under him. In consequence of this revolution, the Mamelouks became masters of Egypt, and chose a sultan from among themselves.\u2014The Mamelouks are thought to have been young Turks or Tartars, sold to private persons by the merchants, from whom they were bought by the sultan, educated at his expense, and employed to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARITIME\">maritime</a> places of the kingdom. The reason of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTITUTION\">institution</a> originally was, that the native Egyptians were become cowardly, treacherous, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EFFEMINATE\">effeminate</a>, from a long course of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SLAVERY\">slavery</a>, that they were unfit for arms. The Mamelouks, on the contrary, made most excellent soldiers; for having no friends but amongst their own corps, they turned all their thoughts to their own profession. According to M. Volney, they came originally from Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAUCASUS\">Caucasus</a>, and are distinguished by the flaxen <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAIR\">hair</a>. Here they were found by the crusaders, and were by them called Mameluck, or more correctly Mamelouks. The expedition of the Tartars in 1227 proved indirectly the means of introducing them into Egypt. These horrible conquerors, having slaughtered and massacred till they were weary, brought along with them an immense number of slaves of both sexes, with whom they filled all the markets in Asia. The Turks, taking advantage of the opportunity, purchased about 12,000 young men, whom they bred up in the profession of arms, in which they soon attained to great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECTION\">perfection</a>; but becoming mutinous, like the Roman pretorian bands, they turned their arms against their masters, and in 1250 depoed and murdered the caliph, as has been already related.\n\nThe Mamelouks having got possession of the government, and neither understanding nor putting a value upon any thing besides the art of war, every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPECIES\">species</a> of learning decayed in Egypt, and a great degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARBARISM\">barbarism</a> was introduced. Neither was their empire of long duration notwithstanding all their martial abilities. The reason of this was, that they were originally only\nnot attempt the total extermination of the race of Mamlouks, though this would have been quite agreeable to the maxims of Turkish policy; but in the present case he seems to have recollected, that if he established a pacha in Egypt with the same powers with which he invested those of other parts, he would be under strong temptations to revolt by reason of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> from the capital. He therefore proposed a new form of government, by which the power being distributed among the different members of the state, should preserve an equilibrium, so that the dependence of the whole should be Selim upon himself. With this view, he chose from among the Mamlouks who had escaped the general massacre, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVAN\">divan</a>, or council of regency, consisting of the pacha and chiefs of the seven military corps. The former was to notify to this council the orders of the Porte, to send the tribute to Constantinople, and provide for the safety of government both <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> and internal; while, on the other hand, the members of the council had a right to reject the orders of the pacha, or even of deposing him, provided they could assign sufficient reasons. All civil and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POLITICAL\">political</a> ordinances must also be ratified by them. Besides this, he formed the whole body into a republic; for which purpose he issued an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EDICT\">edict</a> to the following purport: \"Though, by the help of the Almighty, we have conquered the whole kingdom of Egypt with our invincible armies; nevertheless our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol3.html#article-BENEVOLENCE\">benevolence</a> is willing to grant to the 24 fangiacs (a) of Egypt a republican government, with the following conditions.\n\n\"I. That our sovereignty shall be acknowledged by the republic; and in token of their obedience, our lieutenant shall be received as our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPRESENTATIVE\">representative</a>: but to do nothing against our will or the republic; but, on the contrary, shall cooperate with it for its welfare on all occasions. Or if he shall attempt to infringe any of its privileges, the republic is at liberty to suspend him from his authority, and to send to our Sublime Porte a complaint against him, &c.\n\n\"II. In time of war, the republic shall provide 12,000 troops at its own expense, to be commanded by a fangiac or fangiacs.\n\n\"III. The republic shall raise annually and send to our Sublime Porte the sum of 560,000 allany (b), accompanied by a fangiac, who shall have a satisfactory receipt, &c.\n\n\"IV. The same sum to be raised for the use of Medina, and Kaba or Mecca.\n\n\"V. No more troops of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JANIZARIES\">Janizaries</a> shall be kept by the republic in time of peace than 14,000; but in time of war they may be increased to oppose our and the republic's enemies.\n\n\"VI. The republic shall send annually to our <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRANARY\">granary</a>, out of the produce of the country, one million of caliz (c) or measures of corn, viz. 600,000 of wheat and 400,000 of barley.\n\n\"VII.

During the last 50 years, the Porte having relaxed from its vigilance, such a revolution has taken place, that the Turkish power is now almost reduced to nothing. But in order to understand this, we must consider the way in which the race of Mamlouks is continued or multiplied in Egypt. This is not in the ordinary way, by marriage. On the contrary, M. Volney affirms us, that \"during 350 years in which there have been Mamlouks in Egypt, not one of them has left sufficient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a>; all their children perish in the first or second decent. Almost the same thing holds good with regard to the Turks; and it is observed, that they can only secure the continuance of their families by marrying women who are natives, which the Mamlouks have always disdained. The means by which they are perpetuated and multiplied are the same by which they were first established, viz. by slaves brought from their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> country. From the time of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOGULS\">Moguls</a> this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMERCE\">commerce</a> has been continued on the banks of the Cuban and Phasis in the same manner as it is carried on in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AFRICA\">Africa</a>, by the wars among the hostile tribes, and the misery or avarice of the inhabitants, who sell their children to strangers. The slaves thus procured are first brought to Constantinople, and afterwards dispersed through the empire, where they are purchased by the wealthy. When the Turks subdued Egypt (says M. Volney), they should undoubtedly have prohibited this dangerous traffic; their omitting which seems about to dispose of them of their conquest, and which several political errors have long been preparing.\n\n\"For a considerable time the Porte had neglected the affairs of this province; and in order to restrain the pachas, had suffered the divan to extend its power till the chiefs of the janizaries and azabs were left without control. The soldiers themselves, become citizens by the marriages they had contracted, were no longer the creatures of Constantinople; and a change introduced into their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISCIPLINE\">discipline</a> still more increased these disorders. At first the seven military corps had one common treasury; and though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOCIETY\">society</a> was rich, individuals, not having anything at their own disposal, could effect nothing. The chiefs, finding their power diminished by this regulation, had interest enough to get it abolished, and obtained permission to possess distant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a>, lands, and villages. And as these lands and villages depended on the Mamlouk governors, it was necessary to conciliate them, to prevent their oppressions. From that moment the beys acquired an ascendancy over the soldiers, who till then had treated them with disdain; and this could not but continually increase, since their governments procured them considerable riches. These they employed in creating themselves friends and creatures. They multiplied their slaves; and after emancipating them, employed all their interest to promote them to various employments, and advance them in the army. These upstarts, retaining for their patrons the same superstitious veneration common in the East, formed factions implicitly devoted to their pleasure.\" Thus, about the year 1746, Ibrahim, one of Authority the kiayas (D) of the janizaries, rendered himself inburghed by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-REALITY\">reality</a> master of Egypt; having managed matters so Kiaya well, that of the 24 beys or tangiacs eight were of his houchehold. His influence too was augmented by always leaving vacancies in order to enjoy the emoluments himself; while the officers and soldiers of his corps were attached to his interest; and his power was completed by gaining over Rodoan, the most powerful of all the colonels, to his interest. Thus the pacha became altogether unable to oppose him, and the orders of the fultan were less respected than those of Ibrahim. On his death in 1757, his family, i.e. his enfranchised slaves, continued to rule in a despotic manner. Waging war, however, among each other, Rodoan, and several other chiefs were killed; until, in 1766, Ali <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEY\">Bey</a>, who had been a principal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTOR\">actor</a> in the disturbances, overcame his enemies, and for some time rendered himself absolute master of Egypt.\n\nOf this man there are various accounts. The following is that given by M. Volney. He begins with Ali Bey observing, that the private history of the Mamlouks in general must be subject to great uncertainty, by reason of their being generally carried off from their parents at a time of life when they can remember but little or nothing of their parents; and he remarks, that they are likewise unwilling to communicate the little they may happen to remember. It is most commonly supposed, however, that Ali Bey was born among the Abazans, a people of Mount Caucasus; from whom, next to the Circassians, the slaves most valued by the Turks, and other nations who <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEAL\">deal</a> in that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMODITY\">commodity</a>, are to be obtained. Having been brought to a public <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALE\">sale</a> at Cairo, he is Ali Bey was bought by two Jew brothers named <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISAAC\">Isaac</a> and Yousef, who made a present of him to Ibrahim educated by Ibrahim Kiaya.\n\n(D) These were the commanding officers of the janizaries, azabs, &c. who after the first year laid down their employments, and became veterans, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-VOICE\">voice</a> in the divan.\nKiaya. At this time he is supposed to have been about 13 or 14 years old, and was employed by his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PATRON\">patron</a> in offices similar to those of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PAGES\">pages</a> belonging to European princes. The usual education was also given him; viz., that of learning to manage a horse well; fire a carbine and pistol; throw the djerid, a kind of dart used in the diversions of that country, and which shall be afterwards described. He was also taught the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EXERCISE\">exercise</a> of the sabre, and a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-READING\">reading</a> and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a>. In all the feats of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVITY\">activity</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned, he discovered such impetuosity, that he obtained the surname of Djendalik, or \"madman;\" and as he grew up, discovered an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-AMBITION\">ambition</a> proportionate to the activity <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISPLAYED\">displayed</a> in his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YOUTH\">youth</a>. About the age of 18 or 20, his patron gave him his freedom; the badge of which among the Turks is the letting the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BEARD\">beard</a> grow, for among that people it is thought proper only for women and slaves to want a beard. By his kind patron also he was promoted to the rank of kachef or governor of a district, and at last elected one of the 24 beys. By the death of Ibrahim in 1757, he had an opportunity of satisfying his ambition; and now engaged in every scheme for the promotion or disgrace of the chiefs, and had a principal share in the ruin of Rodoan Kiaya above mentioned. Rodoan's place was quickly filled by another, who did not long enjoy it; and in 1762 Ali Bey, then styled Sheik-el-Beled, having got Abdelrahman, the possessor at that time, exiled, procured himself to be elected in his room.\n\nHowever, he soon shared the fate of the rest, being condemned to retire to Gaza. This place, being under the dominion of a Turkish pasha, was by no means agreeable; for which reason Ali having turned off to another place, kept himself concealed for some time, until in 1766 his friends at Cairo procured his recall. On this he appeared suddenly in that city; and in one night killed four of the beys who were inimical to his designs, banished the rest, and assumed the whole power to himself. Still, however, his ambition was not satisfied; and he determined on nothing less than to throw off his dependence on the Porte altogether, and become sultan of Egypt. With this view he expelled the pasha, refused to pay the accustomed tribute, and in the year 1768 proceeded to coin money in his own name. The Porte being at that time on the eve of a dangerous war with Russia, had not leisure to attend to the proceedings of Ali Bey; so that the latter had an opportunity of going forward with his enterprises very vigorously. His first expedition was against an Arabian prince named Hammam; against whom he sent his favourite Mohammed Bey, under pretence that the former had concealed a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TREASURE\">treasure</a> intrusted with him by Ibrahim Kiaya, and that he afforded protection to rebels. Having destroyed this unfortunate prince, he next began to put in execution a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAN\">plan</a> proposed to him by a young Venetian merchant, of rendering Jedda, the port of Mecca, an emporium for all the commerce of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-INDIA\">India</a>; and even imagined he should be able to make the Europeans abandon the passage to the Indies by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPE\">Cape</a> of Good <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOPE\">Hope</a>. With this view, he fitted out some vessels at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SUEZ\">Suez</a>; and manning them with Mamlouks, commanded the bey Haffan to sail with them to Jedda, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEIZE\">seize</a> upon it, while a body of cavalry under Mohammed Bey advanced against the town. Both these commissions were executed according to his will, and Ali became quite intoxicated with his success. Nothing but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-IDEAS\">ideas</a> of conquest now occupied his mind, without considering the immense disproportion between his own force and that of the grand signior. Circumstances, it must be owned, were at that time very favourable to his schemes. The sheik Daher was in rebellion against the Porte in Syria; and the pasha of Damascus had so exasperated the people by his extortions, that they were ready for a revolt.\n\nHaving therefore made the necessary preparations, Ali Bey despatched in 1770 about 500 Mamlouks to take possession of Gaza, and thus secure an entrance into Syria. Palestine. Ofman, the pasha of Damascus, however, no sooner heard of the invasion than he prepared for war with the utmost diligence, while the troops of Ali Bey held themselves in readiness to fly on the first attack. They were relieved from their embarrassment by Sheik Daher, who hastened to their assistance, while Ofman fled without even offering to make the least resistance; thus leaving the enemy masters of all Palestine without striking a stroke. About the end of February 1771, the grand army of Ali Bey arrived; which, by the representation made of it in Europe, was supposed to consist of 60,000 men. M. Volney, however, informs us, that this army was far from containing 60,000 full account of diers; though he allows that there might be two-thirds his army of that number, who were classified as follows: 1. Five thousand Mamlouks, constituting the whole effective part of the army. 2. Fifteen hundred Arabs from Barbary on foot, constituting the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANTRY\">infantry</a> of the army. Besides these, the servants of the Mamlouks, each of whom had two, would constitute a body of 10,000 men. A number of other servants would constitute a body of 2000: and the rest of the number would be made up by sutlers and other uluhal attendants on armies. It was commanded by Mohammed Bey the friend of Ali. \"But (says our author) as to order and discipline, these must not be mentioned. The armies of the Turks and Mamlouks are nothing but a confused multitude of horsemen, without uniforms, on horses of all colours and sizes, without either keeping their ranks or observing any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REGULAR\">regular</a> order.\" This rabble took the road to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACRE\">Acre</a>, leaving wherever they passed sufficient marks of their rapacity and want of discipline. At Acre a junction was formed with the troops of Sheik Daher, consisting of 1500 Safadans (the name of Sheik Daher's subjects, from Safad, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VILLAGE\">village</a> of Galilee, originally under his jurisdiction). There were on horseback, and accompanied by 1200 Motualis cavalry under the command of Sheik Naif, and about 1000 Mogrebian infantry. Thus they proceeded towards Damascus, while Ofman prepared to oppose them by another army equally numerous and ill regulated: and M. Volney gives the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a> of their operations: \"The reader must not here figure to himself a number of complicated and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARTIFICIAL\">artificial</a> movements: such furred methods as those which, within the last <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CENTURY\">century</a>, have reduced the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SCIENCE\">science</a> of war with us to a science of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYSTEM\">system</a> and calculation. The Asiatics are unacquainted with the first elements of this conduct. Their armies are mere mobs, their marches ravages, their campaigns inroads, and their battles bloody frays. The strongest or the most adventurous party goes in quest of the other, which frequently flies without making any resistance. If they stand their ground, they engage pell-mell, discharge their carbines, break their spears, and hack each other with their sabres; for\nfor they have seldom any cannon, and when they have, they are but of little service. A panic frequently diffuses itself without cause; one party flies, the other shouts victory; the vanquished submit to the will of the conqueror, and the campaign often terminates without a battle.\n\nSuch, in a great measure, were the military operations in Syria in the year 1771. The combined army of Ali Bey and Sheik Daher marched to Damascus. The pachas waited for them; they approached, and, on the 6th of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUNE\">June</a>, a decisive action took place: the Mamlouks and Safadins rushed on the Turks with such fury that, terrified at their courage, they immediately took to flight, and the pachas were not the last in endeavouring to make their escape. The allies became masters of the country, and took possession of the city without opposition, there being neither walls nor fortifications to defend it. The cattle alone resisted. Its ruined fortifications had not a single cannon, much less gunners; but it was surrounded by a muddy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DITCH\">ditch</a>, and behind the ruins were posted a few musketeers; and these alone were sufficient to check this army of cavalry. As the besieged, however, were already conquered by their fears, they capitulated the third day, and the place was to be surrendered next morning, when, at day-break, a most extraordinary revolution took place.\n\nThis was no less than the defection of Mohammed of Ali Bey's Bey himself, whom Osman had gained over in a conference during the night. At the moment, therefore, that the signal of surrender was expected, this treacherous general founded a retreat, and turned towards Egypt with all his cavalry, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLYING\">flying</a> with as great precipitation as if he had been pursued by a superior army. Mohammed continued his march with such celerity, that the report of his arrival in Egypt reached Cairo only six hours before him. Thus Ali Bey found himself at once deprived of all his expectations of conquest; and what was worse, found a traitor whom he durst not punish at the head of his forces. A sudden reverse of fortune now took place. Several vessels <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LADEN\">laden</a> with corn for Sheik Daher were taken by a Russian privateer; and Mohammed Bey, whom he designed to have put to death, not only made his escape, but was so well attended that he could not be attacked. His followers continuing daily to increase in number, Mohammed soon became sufficiently strong to march towards Cairo; and, in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MONTH\">month</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APRIL\">April</a> 1772, having defeated the troops of Ali in a rencounter, entered the city sword in hand, while the latter had scarce time to make his escape with 800 Mamlouks. With difficulty he was enabled to get to Syria by the assistance of Sheik Daher, whom he immediately joined with the troops he had with him. The Turks under Osman were at that time besieging Sidon, but raised the siege on the approach of the allied army, consisting of about 7000 cavalry. Though the Turkish army was at least three times their number, the allies did not hesitate to attack them, and gained a complete victory. Their affairs now began to wear a more favourable aspect; but the military operations were retarded by the siege of Yafa, a place which had revolted; and which, though defended only by a garden wall, without any ditch, held out for eight months. In the beginning of 1773 it capitulated, and Ali Bey began to think of returning to Cairo. For this purpose Sheik Daher had promised to furnish him with succours; and the Russians, with whom he had now contracted an alliance, made him a promise of the like kind. Ali, however, ruined everything by his own impatience. Deceived by an astrologer, who pretended that the auspicious moment when he would be highly favoured by the stars was just arrived, he himself impeded matters without waiting for the arrival of his allies. He was also farther deceived by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STRATAGEM\">stratagem</a> of Mohammed, who had by force extorted from the friends of Ali Bey letters <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PRESSING\">pressing</a> his return to Cairo, where the people were weary of his ungrateful slave, and wanted only his presence in order to expel him. Confiding in these promises, Ali Bey imprudently set out with his Mamlouks and 1500 Safadins given him by Daher; but had no sooner entered the desert which separates Gaza from Egypt, than he was attacked by a body of 1000 chosen Mamlouks who were lying in wait for his arrival. They were commanded by a young bey, named Mourad; who being enamoured of the wife of Ali Bey, had obtained a promise of her from Mohammed, in case he could bring him her husband's head. As soon as Mourad perceived the dust by which the approach of Ali Bey's armed was announced, he rushed upon him, attacked and took prisoner Ali Bey himself, after wounding him in the forehead with a sabre. Being conducted to Mohammed Bey, the latter pretended to treat him with extraordinary respect, and ordered a magnificent tent to be erected for him; but in three days he was found dead of his wounds, as was given out; though some affirm, perhaps with equal reason, that he was poisoned.\n\nAfter the death of Ali Bey, Mohammed Bey took succeeded upon him the supreme dignity; but this change of masters proved of very little service to the Egyptians. At first he pretended to be only the defender of the rights of the sultan, remitted the usual tribute to Constantinople, and took the customary oath of unlimited obedience; after which he solicited permission to make war upon Sheik Daher, the ally of Ali Bey. The reason of this request was a mere <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSONAL\">personal</a> pique; and as soon as it was granted, he made the most diligent preparations for war. Having procured an extraordinary train of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ARTILLERY\">artillery</a>, he provided foreign gunners, and gave the command of them to an Englishman named Robinson. He brought from Suez a cannon 16 feet long, which had for a considerable time remained useless against the enemy; and at length, in the month of February 1776, he appeared in Syria with an army equal in number to that which he had formerly commanded when in the service of Ali Bey. Daher's forces, despairing of being able to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPE\">cope</a> with such a formidable armament, abandoned Gaza, which Mohammed immediately took possession of, and then marched towards a fortified town named Yafa. The history of this siege gives a specimen of the Asiatic manner of conducting operations of that kind. \"Yafa (says he), situated on a part of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COAST\">coast</a>, the siege of the general level of which is very little above the sea. Yafa: a city built on an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a>, in the form of a flat specimen of a garlaf, in height about 130 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a>. The method of houses, distributed on the declivity, appear rising above each other, like the steps of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AMPHITHEATRE\">amphitheatre</a>. On the town's summit is a small citadel, which commands the town; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> of the hill is surrounded by a wall without a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAMPART\">rampart</a>, of 12 or 14 feet high, and two or three in thickness.\"\nthicknes. The battlements on the top are the only tokens by which it is distinguished from a common garden wall. This wall, which has no ditch, is environed by gardens, where lemons, oranges, and citrons, grow in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOIL\">soil</a> to a most prodigious size. The city was defended by five or six hundred Safadians and as many inhabitants, who, at the fight of the enemy, armed themselves with their sabres and muskets; they had likewise a few <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> cannon, 24 pounds, without carriages; these they mounted as well as they could, on timbers prepared in a hurry; and supplying the place of experience by hatred and courage, they replied to the summons of the enemy with menaces and cannon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a>.\n\n\"Mohammed, finding he must have recourse to force, formed his camp before the town; but so little acquainted with the business in which he was engaged, that he advanced within half cannon shot. The bullets, which flew upon the tents, apprizing him of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-ERROR\">error</a>, he retreated; and, by making a fresh experiment, was convinced he was still too near. At length he discovered the proper distance, and set up his tent, in which the most extravagant <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUXURY\">luxury</a> was displayed: around it, without any order, were pitched those of the Mamlouks, while the Barbary Arabs formed huts with the trunks and branches of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ORANGE\">orange</a> and lemon trees, and the followers of the army arranged themselves as they could: a few guards were distributed here and there; and, without making a single entrenchment, they called themselves encamped.\n\n\"Batteries were now to be erected; and a spot of rising ground was made choice of to the south-eastward of the town, where, behind some garden walls, eight pieces of cannon were pointed, at 200 paces from the town; and the firing began, notwithstanding the musquetry of the enemy, who, from the tops of the terraces, killed several of the gunners.\n\n\"It is evident that a wall only three feet thick, and without a rampart, must soon have a large breach in it; and the question was not how to mount, but how to get through it? The Mamlouks were for doing it on horseback; but they were made to comprehend that this was impossible; and they consented, for the first time, to march on foot. It must have been a curious sight to see them, with their huge <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREECHES\">breeches</a> of thick Venetian cloth, embarrassed with their tucked-up benichers, their crooked sabres in hand, and pistols hanging at their sides, advancing and tumbling among the ruins of the wall. They imagined that they had conquered every difficulty when this obstacle was surmounted; but the besieged, who formed a better judgment, waited till they arrived at the empty space between the city and wall; where they affailed them from the terraces and windows of the houses with such a shower of bullets, that the Mamlouks did not so much as think of setting them on fire, but retired under a persuasion that the breach was utterly impracticable, since it was impossible to enter it on horseback. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MORAD\">Morad</a> Bey brought them several times back to the charge, but in vain.\n\n\"Six weeks passed in this manner; and Mohammed was distracted with rage, anxiety, and despair. The besieged however, whose numbers were diminished by the repeated attacks, became weary of defending alone the cause of Daher. Some persons began to treat with the enemy; and it was proposed to abandon the place, on the Egyptians giving hostages. Conditions were agreed upon, and the treaty might be considered as concluded, when, in the midst of the security occasioned by this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BELIEF\">belief</a>, some Mamlouks entered the town; numbers of others followed their example, and attempted to plunder. The inhabitants defended themselves, and the attack recommenced; the whole army then rushed into the town, which suffered all the horrors of war; men, women and children, young and old, were all cut to pieces, and Mohammed, equally mean and barbarous, caused a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PYRAMID\">pyramid</a> formed of the heads of these unfortunate sufferers to be raised as a monument of his victory.\"\n\nBy this disaster the greatest terror and consternation were everywhere diffused. Sheik Daher himself fled, and Mohammed soon became master of Acre also. Here he behaved with his usual cruelty, and abandoned the city to be plundered by his soldiers. The French merchants claimed an exemption, and it was procured with the utmost difficulty: nor was even this likely to be of any consequence; for Mohammed, informed that the treasures of Ibrahim kiaya of Daher had been deposited in that place, made an immediate demand of them, threatening every one of the merchants with death if the treasures were not instantly produced. A day was appointed for making the search; but before this came, the tyrant himself died of a malignant fever after two days' illness. His death was no sooner known than the army made a precipitate retreat, such as has been already mentioned from Damascus. Sheik Daher continued his rebellion for some time, but was at last entirely defeated, and his head sent to Constantinople by Haflan Pacha the Turkish high-admiral.\n\nThe death of Mohammed was no sooner known in Egypt, than Morad Bey hastened to Cairo in order to dispute the sovereignty with Ibrahim Bey, who had that time been intrusted with the government on his departure to the year from that place for Syria. Preparations for war were made on both sides; but at last, both parties finding that the contest must be attended with great difficulty, as well as very uncertain in the event, thought proper to come to an accommodation, by which it was agreed that Ibrahim should retain the title of Sheik El Beled, and the power was to be divided between them. But now the beys and others who had been promoted by Ali Bey, perceiving their own importance totally annihilated by this new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACTION\">faction</a>, resolved to shake off the yoke, and therefore united in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAGUE\">league</a> under the title of the House of Ali Bey. They conducted their matters with so much silence and dexterity, that both Morad and Ibrahim were obliged to abandon Cairo. In a short time, however, they returned and defeated their enemies though three times their number; but notwithstanding this success, it was not in their power totally to suppress the party. This indeed was owing entirely to their unskilfulness in the art of war, and their operations for some time were very trifling. At last, a new combination having been formed among the beys, five of them were sentenced to banishment in the Delta. They pretended to comply with this order, but took the road of the Desert of the Pyramids, through which they were pursued for three days to no purpose. At last they arrived safe at Minia, a village situated on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILE\">Nile</a>, 40 leagues above Cairo.\nHere they took up their residence, and being masters of the river, soon reduced Cairo to distress by intercepting its provisions. Thus a new expedition became necessary, and Ibrahim took the command of it upon himself. In the month of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OCTOBER\">October</a> 1783 he set out with an army of 3000 cavalry; the two armies soon came in sight of each other, but Ibrahim thought proper to terminate the affair by negotiation. This gave such offence to Morad, who suspected some plot against himself, that he left Cairo. A war between the two rivals was now daily expected, and the armies continued for 25 days in sight of each other, only separated by the river. Negotiations took place; and the five exiled beys, finding themselves abandoned by Morad, took to flight, but were pursued and brought back to Cairo. Peace seemed now to be re-established; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JEALOUSY\">jealousy</a> of the two rivals producing new intrigues, Morad was once more obliged to quit Cairo in 1784. Forming his camp, however, directly at the gates of the city, he appeared so terrible to Ibrahim, that the latter thought proper in his turn to retire to the desert, where he remained till March 1785. A new treaty then took place; by which the rivals agreed to share the power between them, though there was certainly very little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PROBABILITY\">probability</a> that such a treaty would be long observed. Since that time we have no accounts of any remarkable transaction in Egypt; nor indeed can we reasonably expect anything of consequence in a country where matters are managed, as M. Volney expresses himself, by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERIES\">series</a> of \"cabals, intrigues, treachery, and murders.\"\n\nOf late Egypt has been visited by several travellers, all of whom have published descriptions of the country, its productions, inhabitants, &c. The latest are M. Savary, M. Volney, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARON\">baron</a> de Tott, and Mr Bruce; and from the accounts published by those gentlemen the following geographical description is principally compiled.\n\nThis country is still divided into two principal parts, called the Upper and Lower Egypt. According to M. Savary, the former is only a long narrow valley beginning at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYENE\">Syene</a> and terminating at Cairo. It is bounded by two chains of mountains running from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORTH\">north</a> to south, and taking their rise from the last cataract of the Nile. On reaching the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LATITUDE\">latitude</a> of Cairo they separate to the right and left; the one taking the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a> of Mount Colzoum, the other terminating in some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SAND\">sand</a> banks near Alexandria; the former being composed of high and steep rocks, the latter of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SANDY\">sandy</a> hillocks over a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BED\">bed</a> of calcareous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONE\">stone</a>. Beyond these mountains are deserts bounded by the Red Sea on the east, and on the west by other parts of Africa; having in the middle that long <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> which, even where widest, is not more than <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> leagues over. Here the Nile is confined in its course between these impenetrable barriers, and during the time of its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INUNDATION\">inundation</a> overflows the country all the way to the foot of the mountains; and Mr Bruce observes that there is a gradual slope from the bed of the river to those mountains on both sides. The baron de Tott says, that the mountains four leagues from the Nile, and facing Cairo, \"are only a ridge of rocks of about 40 or 50 feet high, which divide Egypt from the plains of Libya; which ridge accompanies the course of the river, at a greater or lesser distance, and seems as if only intended to serve as a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BANK\">bank</a> to the general inundation.\"\n\nLower Egypt, according to M. Savary, comprehends all the country between Cairo, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDITERRANEAN\">Mediterranean</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISTHMUS\">isthmus</a> of Suez and Libya. \"This immense plain (says he) presents on the borders of its parching sands a strip of lands cultivated along the canals of the river, and in the middle a triangular island to which the Greeks gave the name of Delta; at the top of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> of which the baron de Tott informs us the rocks of Libya and the coasts of Arabia open and recede from each other towards the east and west, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to the Mediterranean. This great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENT\">extent</a> of country, from the kingdom of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BARCA\">Barca</a> to Gaza, is either overflowed by the river, or capable of being so; which thus fertilizes in a high degree a tract of country seemingly devoted to perpetual barrenness on account of the want of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RAIN\">rain</a> and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLIMATE\">climate</a>.\n\nAccording to the testimonies of both Mr Bruce and M. Volney, the coast of Egypt is extremely low, that gyptian it cannot be discovered at sea till the mariners come within a few leagues of it. In ancient times the sailors pretended to know when they approached this country, by a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACK\">black</a> mud brought up by their founding line from the bottom of the sea; but this notion, though as old as the days of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERODOTUS\">Herodotus</a>, has been discovered to be a mistake by Mr Bruce, who found the mud in question to arise while the vessel was opposite to the deserts of Barca. All along the coast of Egypt a strong current sets to the eastward.\n\nIn former times Egypt was much celebrated for its fertility; and there is great reason to believe, that were the same pains bestowed upon the cultivation of the land as in former times, the distribution of the waters of the Nile in a proper manner, the same fertility would still be found to remain. The cause of decrease in the produce of Egypt we shall describe in the words of M. Savary. \"The canals,\" says he, speaking of the Delta, \"which used to convey fertility with their waters, are now filled. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a> no longer watered, and continually exposed to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURNING\">burning</a> ardour of the sun, is converted into a barren land. In those places where formerly were seen rich fields and flourishing towns, on the Pelusiac, the Tanitic, and the Mendelian branches, which all strike out from the canal of Damietta, nothing is to be found at this day but a few miserable hamlets, surrounded by date trees and by deserts. These once navigable canals are now no more than a vain resemblance of what they were: they have no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> with the lake Menzall, but what is merely temporary, on the swelling of the Nile; they are dry the remainder of the year. By deepening them by removing the mud deposited by the river since the Turks have made themselves masters of Egypt, the country they pass through would be again fertilized, and the Delta recover a third of its greatness.\"\n\nConcerning this island it has been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a> of a savant's great many, even from very ancient times, that it was produced by the mud brought down by the inundations of the Nile; and this opinion we find adopted in the strongest manner by M. Savary. His account of the supposed rise of the Delta, and indeed of the greatest part of Egypt, is to the following purpose.\nIn those early ages where history has not fixed any epoch, a certain people descended from the mountains near the cataracts into the valley overflowed by the Nile, and which was then an uninhabitable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MORASS\">morass</a> overgrown with reeds and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANES\">canes</a>. In what manner, or from what motive, these people were induced to descend from their ancient habitations to such a place, or how they found means to penetrate into a morass which he expressly tells us was impenetrable, we are not informed, neither is it to our present purpose to inquire. At that time, however, the sea bathed the feet of those mountains where the pyramids are built, and advanced far into Libya. It covered also part of the isthmus of Suez, and every part of what we now <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALL\">call</a> the Delta formed a great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GULF\">gulf</a>. After many ages the Egyptians, by what means is unknown, at least not specified by our author (though they ought to have been so), as the country it seems was then overflowed not only by the river but by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCEAN\">ocean</a>), formed canals to carry off the stagnant waters of the Nile; opposed strong dykes to its ravages; and, tired of dwelling in the caverns of rocks, built towns and cities upon spots elevated either by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a> or art. Already the river was kept within its bounds, the habitations of men were out of the reach of its inundations, and experience had taught the people to foresee and announce them. One of the kings of Egypt undertook to change the course of the river. After running 250 leagues between the barriers already mentioned, meeting with an insurmountable obstacle to the right, it turned suddenly to the left; and taking its course to the southward of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEMPHIS\">Memphis</a>, it spreads its waters through the sands of Libya. The prince we speak of caused a new bed to be dug for it to the east of Memphis; and by means of a large dyke obliged it to return between the mountains, and discharge itself into the gulf that bathes the rock on which the castle of Cairo is built. The ancient bed of the river was still to be seen in the time of Herodotus, and may even be traced at this day across the deserts, passing to the westward of the lakes of natrum. The Arabs still below it name the Babr Belama, \"or sea without water,\" and it is now almost choked up. To the labours of this monarch Egypt is indebted for the Delta. A <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REFLUX\">reflux</a> of the sea was occasioned by the enormous weight of the waters of the Nile, which precipitated themselves into the bottom of the gulf. Thus the sands and mud carried along with them were collected into heaps; and thus the Delta, at first very inconsiderable, rose out of the sea, of which it repelled the limits. It was a gift of the river, and it has since been defended from the attacks of the ocean by raising dykes around it. Five hundred years before the Trojan war, according to Herodotus, the Delta was in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFANCY\">infancy</a>; eight cubits of water being then sufficient to overflow it. Strabo tells us, that boats passed over it from one extremity to the other; and that its towns, built upon artificial eminences, resembled the islands of the Egean sea. At the time that Herodotus visited this country, 15 cubits were necessary to cover all the Lower Egypt; but the Nile then overflowed the country for the space of two days journey to the right and left of the island. Under the Roman empire 16 cubits performed the same effect. When the Arabs came to have the dominion, 17 cubits were requisite; and at this day 18 are necessary to produce a plentiful crop; but the inundation stops at Cairo and the neighbouring country, without being extended over the Lower Egypt. Sometimes, however, the Nile rises to 22 cubits; and the cause of this phenomenon is the mud for so many years accumulated on the island. Here, in the space of 3284 years, we see the Delta elevated 14 cubits. Our author wrote in 1777, and informs us that he twice made the tour of the island during the time of the inundation. \"The river (says he) flowed in full streams in the great branches of Roletta and Damietta, as well as in those which pass through the interior part of the country; but it did not overflow the lands, except in the lower parts, where the dykes were pierced for the purpose of watering the plantations of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol19.html#article-RICE\">rice</a>. We must not, however, imagine, as several travellers pretend, that this island will continue to rise, and that it will become unfruitful. As it owes its increase to the annual settling of the mud conveyed thither by the Nile, when it ceases to be overflowed it will no longer increase in height, for it is demonstrated that culture is not sufficient to raise land.\n\n\"It is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> to imagine that the Delta has increased in length as well as in height; and of this we may look upon the following fact to be a remarkable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>. Under the reign of Ptolemy, the Milesians, with 30 vessels, landed at the mouth of the Bolbitine branch of the Nile, now called that of Roletta, where they fortified themselves. There they built a town called Metelis, the same as Faouie, which, in the Coptic vocabularies, has preserved the name of Melis. This town, formerly a seaport, is now nine leagues distant from the sea; all which space the Delta has increased in length from the time of Ptolemy to the present. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOMER\">Homer</a>, in his Odyssey, puts the following words in the mouth of Menelaus. 'In the stormy sea which washes Egypt there is an island called <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PHAROS\">Pharos</a>. Its distance from the shore is such, that a vessel with a fair wind may make the passage in a day.' From the way in which he speaks of this island in other places, also, we may suppose that the island of Pharos, in his time, was not less than 20 leagues distant from the Egyptian coast, though now it forms the port of Alexandria; and this sentiment is confirmed by the most ancient writers.\n\n\"What prodigious changes great rivers occasion on the surface of the globe! How they elevate, at their mouths, islands which become at length large portions of the continent! It is thus that the Nile has formed almost all the Lower Egypt, and created out of the waters the Delta, which is 90 leagues in circumference. It is thus that the Meander, constantly repelling the waves of the Mediterranean, and gradually filling up the gulf into which it falls, has placed in the middle of the land the town of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILETUS\">Miletus</a>, formerly a celebrated harbour. It is thus that the Tigris and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EUPHRATES\">Euphrates</a>, let loose from the Armenian hills, and sweeping with them in their course the sands of Mesopotamia, are imperceptibly filling up the Persian gulf.\"\n\nThese are the reasons assigned by Mr. Savary for Mr. Bruce's thinking that the Delta, as well as the greatest part of reasons for the Lower Egypt, had been produced by the Nile; but this opinion is violently contested by other authors, particularly Mr. Bruce, who has given a pretty long dissertation upon it, as well as many occasional\nfional remarks through the course of his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a>. He begins with observing, 1. That the country of Egypt is entirely a valley bounded by rugged mountains; whence it might seem natural to imagine that the Nile, overflowing a country of this kind, would be more ready to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol21.html#article-WASH\">wash</a> away the soil than add to it. 2. It is observed by Dr Shaw, and the same is confirmed by our author, that there is a gentle slope from the middle of the valley to the foot of the mountains on each side; so that the middle, in which is the channel of the Nile, is really higher than any other part of the valley. Large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRENCHES\">trenches</a> are cut across the country from the channel of the river, and at right <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> with it, to the foot of the mountains. 3. As the river swells, the canals become filled with water, which naturally descending to the foot of the mountains, runs out at the farther end, and overflows the adjacent level country. 4. When the water, having attained the lowest ground, begins to stagnate, it does not acquire any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a> by reason of the canal's being at right angles with the channel of the Nile, unless in the case of excessive rains in Ethiopia, when the water by its regurgitation again joins the stream. In this case, the motion of the current is communicated to the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MASS\">mass</a> of waters, and every thing is swept away by them into the sea. 5. It has been the opinion of several authors, that there was a necessity for measuring the height of the inundation on account of the quantity of mud brought down annually by the waters, by which the landmarks were so covered, that the proprietors could not know their own grounds after the river subsided. But whatever might be the reason of this covering of the landmarks in ancient times, it is certain that the mud left by the Nile could not be so in the time of Herodotus, or during any period of time assigned by that historian; for he assigns only one foot of increase of soil throughout Egypt in an hundred years from the mud left by the river; the increase during one year, therefore, being only the hundredth part of a foot, could not cover any landmark whatever. Besides, the Egyptian lands are at this day parted by huge blocks of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-GRANITE\">granite</a>, which frequently have gigantic heads at the end of them; and these could not, at the rate mentioned by Herodotus, be covered in several thousand years. 6. The Nile does not now bring down any great quantity of mud; and it is absurd to suppose that it can at present bring down as much as it did soon after the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CREATION\">creation</a>, or the ages immediately succeeding the deluge. Throughout <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABYSSINIA\">Abyssinia</a>, according to the testimony of our author, the channel of every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TORRENT\">torrent</a> is now worn to the bare rock, and almost every rivulet runs in a hard stony bed, all the loose earth being long ago washed away; so that an annual and equable increase of the earth from the sediment of the waters is impossible. 7. Our author made a great number of trials of the water of the Nile during the time of its inundation in different places. At Bafboch, when just coming down from the cultivated parts of Abyssinia, and before it enters Scenar, the sediment is composed of fat earth and sand, and its quantity is exceedingly small. At the junction of the Nile and Attaboras the quantity of sediment is very little augmented; consisting still of the same materials, but now mostly sand. At Syene the quantity of sediment was almost nine times greater than before; but was now composed almost entirely of sand, with a very small quantity of black earth. The conclusion of our author's experiments, however, is different from what we should have been led to expect from those just mentioned. \"The experiment at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROSETTA\">Rosetta</a> (says he) was not so often repeated as the others; but the result was, that in the strength of the inundation the sediment consisted mostly of sand; and towards the end, was much the greater part earth. I think these experiments conclusive, as neither the Nile coming fresh from Abyssinia, nor the Attabara, though joined by the Mareb, likewise from the same country, brought any great quantity of soil from thence.\"\n\n8. Our author goes on to observe, that had the Nile brought down the quantities of mud which it has been said to do, it ought to have been most <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> with it at Syene; as there it contained the whole that was to be conveyed by it into Egypt. Instead of this, however, the principal part of the sediment at this place was sand; and this is very naturally accounted for from the vast quantities of sand taken up by the winds in the deserts between Gooz and Syene. Here our traveller frequently saw vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILLARS\">pillars</a> of this kind of sand, which is so fine and light as to form an impalpable powder, traversing the desert in various directions. Many of these were driven upon the river; and when it became <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CALM\">calm</a> in the evening, fell down into it entirely; thus affording materials for the many sandy islands to be met with in the Nile.\n\n9. Mr Bruce adopts the opinion of those who suppose that there has been a continual decrease of water since the creation of the world. In this case, therefore, if the land of Egypt had been continually increasing in height while the water that was to cover it decreased; then must have been frequent famines on account of the want of a sufficient inundation. But so far is this from being the case, that, according to the testimony of several Arabian MSS., there had not, when Mr Bruce was in Egypt, been one scarce season from the lowness of the inundation for 34 years; though during the same space they had three times experienced a famine by too great an abundance of water, which carried away the millet.\n\n10. If there had been such an increase of land as Herodotus and others suppose, it must now have been very perceptible in some of the most ancient public monuments. This, however, is by no means the case. The base of every obelisk in Upper Egypt is to this day quite bare and visible. Near Thebes there are still extant two colossal statues, plainly designed for kilometers, and which ought by this time to have been almost covered with earth; but notwithstanding the length of time these have remained there, they are still bare to the very base.\n\nThe strongest argument which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol1.html#article-ADVOCATES\">advocates</a> for the opinions of increase of land of Egypt can make use of is, that various authors have determined the measures by which the quantity of inundation is determined are smaller now than in former times; and these small measures are said to have been introduced by the Saracens. On this Mr Bruce very justly observes, that such an expedient could not have answered any good purpose; as no decrease of the measure could have augmented the quantity of corn produced by the ground. M. Savary observes, that, to render his calculation concerning the growth of land in Egypt absolutely exact, it would be necessary to determine the\nthe precise length of the Greek, Roman, and Arabian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CUBIT\">cubit</a>; and even to know the different alterations which that measure had undergone among these people: But this nicety he thinks needless; looking upon the general fact to be fully established by what he had said before. Mr Bruce, however, has treated the subject with much greater accuracy. He observes, that from the situation of Canopus, the distance between Egypt and Cyprus, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTENSION\">extension</a> of the land to the northward, it appears that no addition of any consequence has been made to it for 3000 years past. The only argument left for the increase of land therefore must be taken from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NILOMETER\">nilometer</a>. The use of this instrument was to determine the quantity of inundation, that so it might be known whether the crop would be sufficient to enable the people to pay the taxes exacted of them by the sovereign or not. The first step was to know what space of ground was overflowed in a given number of years; and this being determined by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MENSURATION\">mensuration</a>, the next thing was to ascertain the produce of the ground upon an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AVERAGE\">average</a>. Thus becoming acquainted with the greatest and least crops produced, together with the exact extent of ground overflowed, they were furnished with all the necessary principles for constructing a nilometer; and nothing now remained but to erect a pillar in a proper place, and divide it exactly into cubits. This was accordingly done; the pillar was first divided into cubits, and these again were subdivided into digits. The first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVISION\">division</a> of this kind was undoubtedly that mentioned in Scripture, and called the cubit of a man; being the length of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> from the middle of the round bone in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELBOW\">elbow</a> to the point of the middle finger; a measure still in use among all rude nations. As no standard could be found by which this measure might be exactly determined, authors have differed very much concerning the true length of the cubit when reduced to our feet and inches. Dr Arbuthnot reckons two cubits mentioned in Scripture; one of them containing one foot nine inches and \\(\\frac{8}{9}\\) of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a>; the other one foot and \\(\\frac{24}{75}\\) of a foot; but Mr Bruce is of opinion that both of these are too large. He found, by mensuration, the Egyptian cubit to be exactly one foot five inches and three-fifths of an inch; and Herodotus mentions, that in his time the cubit used for determining the increase of the Nile was the Samian cubit, about 18 of our inches. The latter also informs us, that in the time of Moeris, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINIMUM\">minimum</a> of increase was 8 cubits, at which time all Egypt below the city of Memphis was overflowed; but that in his time 16 or at least 15 cubits were necessary to produce the same effect. But to this account Mr Bruce objects, that Herodotus could have no certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFORMATION\">information</a> concerning the nilometer, because he himself says that the priests, who alone had access to it, would tell him nothing of the matter. Herodotus also informs us, that in the time of Moeris, great lakes were dug to carry off the waters of the inundation; and this superfluous quantity Mr Bruce supposes to have been conveyed into the desert for the use of the Arabs, and that by such a vast drain the rise of the water on the nilometer would undoubtedly be diminished. But even granting that there was such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> between the rise of the water in the time of Moeris and in that of Herodotus, it does not appear that anything like it has appeared ever since. Strabo, who travelled into Egypt 400 years after the time of Herodotus, found that eight cubits were then the minimum, as well as in the time of Moeris. From some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PASSAGES\">passages</a> in Strabo, however, it appears that it required a particular exertion of industry to cause this quantity of water produce a plentiful crop; but there is not the least reason to suppose, that the very same industry was not necessary in the time of Moeris; so that still there is not any increase of land indicated by the nilometer. About 100 years afterwards, when the emperor Adrian visited Egypt, we are informed from unquestionable authority, that 16 cubits were the minimum when the people were able to pay their tribute; and in the fourth century, under the emperor Julian, 15 cubits were the standard; both which accounts correspond with that of Herodotus. Lastly, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol15.html#article-PROCOPIUS\">Procopius</a>, who lived in the time of Justinian, informs us, that 18 cubits were then requisite for a minimum.\n\nFrom these accounts, so various and discordant, it is no increase obvious that no certain conclusion can be drawn. It of land in is not indeed easy to determine the reason of this difference in point of fact. The only conjecture we can reasonably offer is, that as it appears that by proper care a smaller potted quantity of water will answer the purpose of producing a plentiful crop, so it is not unreasonable to suppose that at different periods the industry of the people has varied so much as to occasion the disagreement in question. This would undoubtedly depend very much upon their governor; and indeed Strabo informs us that it was by the care of the governor Petronius, that such a small quantity of water was made to answer the purpose. The conclusion drawn by Mr Bruce from the whole of the accounts above related, is, that from them it is most probable that no increase of land has been indicated by the nilometer from the time of Moeris to that of Justinian.\n\nOn the conquest of Egypt by the Saracens, their nor barbarous and stupid caliph destroyed the nilometer, more mo causing another to be built in its stead, and afterwards fixed the standard of paying tribute considerably below what it had usually been. The Egyptians were thus kept in continual terror, and constantly watched the new nilometer to observe the gradual increase or decrease of the water. On this he ordered the new nilometer to be destroyed, and another to be constructed, and all access to it to be denied to the people. Which prohibition is still continued to Christians; though our author found means to get over this obstacle, and has given a figure of the instrument itself. That the people might not, however, be supposed to remain in total <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IGNORANCE\">ignorance</a> of their situation, he commanded a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCLAMATION\">proclamation</a> to be daily made concerning the height of the water, but in such an unintelligible manner that nobody was made any wiser; nor, according to our author, is the proclamation understood at this day. From his own observations, however, Mr Bruce concludes, that 15 cubits are now the minimum of inundation, and as this coincides with the accounts of it in the times of Herodotus and Adrian, he supposes with great probability, that the same quantity of water has been necessary to overflow this country from the earliest accounts to the present time.\n\nIt now remains only to take notice of what is said by M. Savary concerning the former distance of the island of Pharos from the land to which it is now joined.\nWith regard to his other assertions concerning the city of Metelis having been once a sea port, M. Volney proves that he has quoted Strabo unfairly, and consequently no stress is to be laid upon them. The principal, indeed the only, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVIDENCE\">evidence</a> which therefore remains, is the passage already quoted from Homer, viz. that \"the island of Pharos is as far distant from one of the mouths of the Nile as a vessel can sail in one day before the wind.\"\n\n\"But (says M. Volney) when Homer speaks of the distance of this island, he does not mean its distance from the shore opposite, as that traveller (M. Savary) has translated him, but from the land of Egypt and the river Nile. In the second place, by a day's sail we must not understand that indefinite space which the vessels, or rather the boats, of the ancient Greeks, could pass through in a day; but an accurate and determined measure of 540 stadia. This measure is ascertained by Herodotus, and is the precise distance between Pharos and the Nile, allowing, with M. d'Anville, 27,000 toises to 540 stadia. It is therefore far from being proved, that the increase of the Delta or of the continent was so rapid as has been represented; and, if we were disposed to maintain it, we should still have to explain how this shore, which has not gained half a league from the days of Alexander, should have gained eleven in the far shorter period from the time of Menelaus to that conqueror. The utmost extent of the encroachment of this land upon the sea, however, may be learned from the words of Herodotus; who informs us, that \"the breadth of Egypt, along the sea coast, from the gulf of Plinthus to the lake Serbonis near Mount C\u00e6sus, is 3600 stadia; and its length from the sea to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HELIOPOLIS\">Heliopolis</a> 1500 stadia.\" Allowing therefore the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-STADIUM\">stadium</a> of Herodotus to be between 50 and 51 French toises, the 1500 stadia just mentioned are equal to 76,000 toises; which, at the rate of 57,000 to a degree, gives one degree and near 20 minutes and a half. But from the astronomical observations of M. Niebuhr, who travelled for the king of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DENMARK\">Denmark</a> in 1761, the difference of latitude between Heliopolis, now called Matara, and the sea, being one degree 29 minutes at Damietta, and one degree 24 minutes at Rosetta, there is a difference on one side of three minutes and a half, or a league and a half encroachment; and eight minutes and a half, or three leagues and a half on the other.\"\n\nThus the dispute concerning the augmentation of the land of Egypt by the Nile seems to be absolutely decided; and the encroachments of it on the sea so trifling, that we may justly doubt whether they exist, or whether we are not entirely to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-ATTRIBUTE\">attribute</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPARENT\">apparent</a> differences to those which certainly take place betwixt the ancient and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MODERN\">modern</a> mensuration. M. Volney gives a very particular description of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the country; but takes notice of the inconveniences under which travellers labour in this country, by which it is rendered extremely difficult to lay any thing certain with regard to the nature of the soil or mineral productions. These arise from the barbarity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPERSTITION\">superstition</a> of the people, who imagine all the Europeans to be magicians and sorcerers, who come by their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGIC\">magic</a> art to discover the treasures which the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENII\">genii</a> have concealed under the ruins. So deep-rooted is this opinion, that no person <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DARES\">dares</a> walk alone in the fields, nor can he find any one willing to accompany him; by which means he is confined to the banks of the river, and it is only by comparing the accounts of various travellers that any satisfactory knowledge can be acquired.\n\nAccording to this author, the entrance into Egypt at Rosetta presents a most delightful prospect, by the account of perpetual verdure of the palm trees on each side, the face of orchards watered by the river, with orange, lemon, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COUNT\">count</a> other fruit trees, which grow there in vast abundance; try, and the same beautiful appearance is continued all the way to Cairo. As we proceed farther up the river, he says, that nothing can more resemble the appearance of the country than the marshes of the Lower <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOIRE\">Loire</a>, or the plains of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLANDERS\">Flanders</a>: instead, however, of the numerous trees and country housetops of the latter, we must imagine some thin woods of palms and cypress trees, with a few villages of mud-walled cottages built on artificial mounds. All this part of Egypt is very low and flat, the declivity of the river being so gentle, that its waters do not flow at a greater rate than one league in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>. Throughout the country nothing is to be seen but palm trees, single or in clumps, which become more rare in proportion as you advance; with wretched villages composed of huts with mud walls, and a boundless plain, which at different seasons is an ocean of fresh water, a miry morass, a verdant field, or a dusty desert; and on every side an extensive and foggy <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a>, where the eye is wearied and disgusted. At length, towards the junction of the two branches of the river, the mountains of Cairo are discovered on the east; and to the south-west three detached masses appear, which from their triangular form are known to be the pyramids. We now enter a valley which turns to the southward, between two chains of parallel eminences. That to the east, which extends to the Red sea, merits the name of a mountain from its steepness and height, as well as that of a desert from its naked and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SAVAGE\">savage</a> appearance. Its name in the Arabic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-LANGUAGE\">language</a> is Moharatum, or the lewa mountain. The western is nothing but a ridge of rock covered with sand, which has been very properly termed a natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOUND\">mound</a> or earthen wall. In short, that the reader may at once form an idea of this country, let him imagine on one side a narrow sea and rocks; on the other, immense plains of sand; and in the middle, a river, flowing through a valley of 150 leagues in length and from three to seven wide, which at the distance of 30 leagues from the sea separates into two arms; the branches of which wander over a soil almost free from obstructions, and void of declivity.\n\nFrom comparing his own observations with those of other travellers, our author concludes, that the basis of all Egypt from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABYDOS\">Abydos</a> (the ancient Syene) to the Mediterranean, is a continued bed of calcareous stone of whitish hue, and somewhat soft, containing the same kind of shells met with in the adjacent seas, and which forms the immense quarries extending from Saouadi to Manfalout for the space of more than 25 leagues, according to the testimony of Father Sicard.\n\nAs this country has been more recently visited by men of eminent abilities and profound research, who appear to have examined every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> that presented itself with a philosopher's eye, we beg leave to add to the testimonies of the authors already mentioned, the substance of the French general Reynier's account of the face of the country. He informs us, that the barriers by which Egypt is inclosed must be strong, because they have been planted by the hand of nature.\nIt is separated from Asia by deserts of considerable extent; and should an hostile army attempt to approach it on that side, it would have to take its route through marshy grounds below its general level, and presenting to the traveller little else than brackish water. Its flat shores towards the Mediterranean, and the mouths of the Nile <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GORGED\">gorged</a> up with mounds of sand, present to an enemy very few places which will be found proper for the debarkation of troops. Immense deserts constitute its natural boundaries on the west, on which account it has nothing to dread but the incursions of the Arabs from Barbary. A desert also separates Egypt from the Red Sea, which gives no flattering invitations to an enemy to invade it from that quarter, the two ports of that sea being destitute of resources, and Egypt itself being the only country from which a hostile army could procure provisions and camels, sufficient to enable it to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROSS\">cross</a> the desert.\n\nIn upper Egypt, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> of mountains present themselves to the eye of the traveller on either side of the Nile. The valley between these mountains, through which the course of the river is directed, is nearly five leagues <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-BROAD\">broad</a>, which the periodical inundations of the river completely cover. This valley alone is inhabited, and susceptible of cultivation. The eastern chain of mountains, by which the Nile is separated from the Red Sea, surpasses that on the west in respect of height, terminating by precipices towards the valley, affuming in different places the appearance of an immense wall, broken irregularly by narrow valleys, which have owed their origin to the sudden and temporary torrents of winter, and serve for passes over these stupendous mountains. The western chain, by which the valley of the Nile is separated from that of Oualis, has in general a gradual and gentle declivity, although it becomes more abrupt towards Siout, and is steep from the angle formed by the Nile towards Hennuh, till it reaches Syene, at which place the mountains have a more considerable height, affording but a narrow passage to the river.\n\nThe distance between these two chains of mountains is increased as you approach Cairo, the eastern chain terminating near the extremity of the Red Sea, without the appearance of any junction with the Arabian mountains, which have a similar termination. The western chain declines towards Fayyum, taking a north-west direction near Grand Cairo, and forming the Mediterranean coast in a direction to the west. Lower Egypt lies between these two great chains of mountains and the sea, which has most probably been formed, at least in a great measure, by the slime or mud which the river Nile deposits, as it is intersected by its branches, and a vast number of canals.\n\nThe seven branches by which the Nile anciently emptied itself into the Mediterranean, are at present reduced to two, viz., those of Damietta and Rosetta. There are now no vestiges of the other five, except a canal or two, which are only navigable during a part of the year. It is not improbable, that when all the branches of the Nile were entire and distinct, each of them contained about the same quantity of water. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CUTTING\">cutting</a> of canals to effect the equilibrium of the water, the channels of which were afterwards neglected, would diminish the quantum of water in one branch and increase it in another. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> water mingling with the fresh, would destroy the fecundity of the ground in some places, and thus induce the inhabitants to search for habitations where they might find the earth more fertile.\n\nIt has already been observed, that the principal part of Lower Egypt owes its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEPOSITION\">deposition</a> of mud or earth by the Nile, which also formed the banks at the different mouths of that river. The mud of the Nile would first cover the low ground nearest to its bed or channel, and the increase of land from the deposition of mud would be more gradual in its progress in distant parts, from which circumstance would arise the formation of lakes. These in their turn would be gradually filled up by the land growing out of the deposited mud of the river, which of consequence would increase the boundaries of Lower Egypt, by taking from the sea; but as it is natural for the sea to resist such encroachments, it is probable that the ground formed by the deposited mud of the Nile will no longer continue to increase in one direction without diminishing in another. The experience of centuries past has fully evinced, that the sea has actually taken more from the extent of Egypt than has been compensated by the mud of the Nile. By the simple operation of natural causes it may be safely concluded, that if nature and art do not cooperate; if the water is permitted to increase, and the channels of the different branches are allowed to be augmented, the sea will continue to snatch new lands from the inhabitants, which appears to be the inevitable doom of Egypt, while it continues in the hands of a people who are ignorant and uncultivated.\n\nA large proportion of the land formerly watered by the branches of the Nile, anciently denoted the Pelusiac, Tanitic, and Mendesian branches, is now the bed of Lake Menzaleh. Lake Bourlos is not far from the mouth of what was formerly called the Sebennitic branch, and Lake Maadich is near the mouth of the ancient Canopic. Lake Mareotic was at too great a distance from the Nile to be filled up with the mud which it deposits, the waters of which were diverted from the lake, by a canal which had been cut for the conveyance of water to the city of Alexandria; and having no communication with the sea, its waters of consequence were gradually evaporated. It still, however, contained a moving sand and a brackish mud, which receiving the rain in winter, and a small portion of the waters from the Nile by the canals of Bohireh, it exhibits the appearance of a marsh during the greater part of the year. There are also a few lakes which owe their origin to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REDUNDANT\">redundant</a> waters of the Nile, diffusing themselves over hollow places in which they are confined, and only disappear by the gradual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EVAPORATION\">evaporation</a>.\n\nIn addition to the branches and chief canals already mentioned, there are numerous canals in Lower Egypt by which it is intersected. These convey the waters of the inundation, which dykes in different districts serve to retain. By these waters the more elevated grounds are fertilized, and other cantons in succession, after which they are poured into the lakes, or are lost in the sea. The dwelling of this remarkable river commences about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUMMER\">summer</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLSTICE\">solstice</a>, reaching its utmost extent in the autumnal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUINOX\">equinox</a>; and after appearing for a few days in all its native majesty, it gradually begins.\ngins to subside. In point of time there is a difference of fifteen days, and sometimes twice that period, with respect to the rise and fall of the Nile; but it may be affirmed in general, that Lower Egypt cannot be safely passed during any more of the year than from the beginning of February to the end of August. At this time the great branches alone contain water, on which passage boats are always to be met with.\n\nIt is obvious from this succinct account of the general face of the country, that no invading army could carry on any military operations in Lower Egypt during more than seven months in the year. It may perhaps be admitted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TRUTH\">truth</a>, that the confines of the desert might be traversed during the five remaining months; but the villages in that direction are ill qualified to grant those necessary supplies to an army which, after crossing the desert, must be in want of every thing. No communication could be kept open from the desert with the interior, from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SEPTEMBER\">September</a> to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DECEMBER\">December</a> inclusive. At this period, therefore, an enemy could not carry on any military operations in the interior but by water. Nor would an army destined to defend Egypt find itself free from very considerable embarrassment during the continuance of the inundation; for as a considerable part of its movements would unavoidably be made on that element, they would be from the nature of things both tedious and difficult.\n\nMr Bruce has given us a particular account of the sources from whence were derived the vast quantities of marble met with in the remains of ancient buildings in this country. These he discovered during his journey from Kenne to Coffeir on the Red sea, before he took his expedition to Abyssinia. He gives a most dismal idea of the deserts through which he passed. What houles he met with were constructed like those M. Volney mentions, of clay, being no more than six feet in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, and about ten in height. The mountains were the most dreary and barren that can be imagined; and the heat of the sun so great, that two sticks rubbed together only for half a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> would take fire and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>. In these burning regions no living creature was to be met with, even the poisonous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERPENTS\">serpents</a> and scorpions not being able to find subsistence. The first animal he saw was a species of ants in a plain called Hamra from the purple colour of its sand; and it was remarkable that these insects were of the same colour with the sand itself. No water was anywhere to be met with on the surface; though at a place called Legeta there were some draw-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELLS\">wells</a>, the water of which was more bitter than salt itself. At Hamra the porphyry mountains and quarries begin, the stone of which is at first soft and brittle; but the quantity is immense, as a whole day was taken up in passing by them. These porphyry mountains begin in the latitude of nearly 24 degrees, and continue along the coast of the Red sea to about 22\u00b0 30', when they are succeeded by the marble mountains; these again by others of alabaster, and these last by basaltic mountains. From the marble mountains our author selected twelve kinds, of different colours, which he brought along with him. Some of the mountains appeared to be composed entirely of red and others of green marble, and by their different colours afforded an extraordinary spectacle. Not far from the porphyry mountains the cold was so great, that his camels died on his return from Abyssinia though the thermometer stood no lower than 42 degrees.\n\nNear to Coffeir he discovered the quarries whence the ancients obtained those immense quantities of marble with which they constructed so many wonderful works. The first place where the marks of their operations were very perceptible, was a mountain much higher than any they had yet passed, and where the stone was so hard that it did not even yield to the blows of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAMMER\">hammer</a>. In this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-QUARRY\">quarry</a> he observed that some ducts or channels for conveying water terminated; which, according to him, flows that water was one of the means by which these hard <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STONES\">stones</a> were cut. In four days, during which our author travelled among these mountains, he says, that he had \"passed more granite, porphyry, marble, and alabaster, than would build Rome, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATHENS\">Athens</a>, Corinth, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-SYRACUSE\">Syracuse</a>, Memphis, Alexandria, and half a dozen such cities.\" It appeared to him that the passageways between the mountains, and which he calls defiles, were not natural but artificial openings; where even whole mountains had been cut out, in order to preserve a gentle slope towards the river. This desert our author supposes not to be above one foot in 50; so that the carriages must have gone very easily, and rather required something to retard their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VELOCITY\">velocity</a> than any force to pull them forward. Concerning the mountains in general, he observes, that the porphyry is very beautiful to the eye, and is discovered by a fine purple sand without any glofs. An unvariegated marble of a green colour is generally met with in the same mountain; and where the two meet, the marble becomes soft for a few inches, but the porphyry retains its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HARDNESS\">hardness</a>. The granite has a dirty <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BROWN\">brown</a> appearance, being covered with sand; but on removing this, it appears of a gray colour with black spots, with a reddish cast all over it. The granite mountains <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol10.html#article-LIE\">lie</a> nearer to the Red sea, and seem to have afforded the materials for Pompey's pillar. The redness above mentioned seems to go off on exposure to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>; but re-appears on working or polishing the stone farther. The red marble is next to the granite, though not met with in the same mountain. There is also a red kind with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-WHITE\">white</a> veins, and vast quantities of the common green <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SERPENTINE\">serpentine</a>. Some samples of that beautiful marble named Isabella were likewise observed; one of them of that yellowish cast called quaker colour, the other of the blueish kind named dove colour. The most valuable kind is that named verde antico, which is found next to the Nile in the mountains of serpentine. It is covered by a kind of blue flaky stone, somewhat lighter than a flate, more beautiful than most kinds of marble, and when polished having the appearance of volcanic <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LAVA\">lava</a>. In these quarters the verde antico had been uncovered in patches of about 20 feet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>. There were small pieces of African marble scattered about in several places, but no rocks or mountains of it; so that our author conjectures it to lie in the heart of some other kind. The whole is situated on a ridge with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCENT\">descent</a> to the east and west; by which means it might easily be conveyed either to the Nile, or Red sea, while the hard gravel and level ground would readily allow the heaviest carriages to be moved with very little force.\n\nTravellers have talked of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMERALD\">emerald</a> mine in these deserts; but from the researches of Mr Bruce, it does not exist.\nnot appear to have any existence. In the Red Sea indeed, in the latitude of $25^\\circ 3'$, at a small distance from the south-western coast, there is an island called the Mountain of Emeralds; but none of these precious stones are to be met with there. Here, as well as on the continent, there were found many pieces of a green pellucid substance; but veined, and much softer than rock crystal, though somewhat harder than glass. A few yards up the mountain he found three pits, which are supposed to have been the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINES\">mines</a> whence the ancients obtained the emeralds; but though many pieces of the green substance above mentioned were met with about these pits, no signs of the true emerald could be perceived. This substance, however, he conjectures to have been the *fumaragus* of the Romans. In the mountains of Caffre, as well as in some places of the deserts of Nubia, our author found some rocks exactly resembling petrified wood.\n\nThe only metal said by the ancients to be produced in Egypt is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-COPPER\">copper</a>. On the road to Suez are found great numbers of those stones called Egyptian flints and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PEBBLES\">pebbles</a>, though the bottom is a hard, calcareous, and porous stone. Here also M. Volney tells us, that the stones above mentioned, and which resemble petrified wood, are to be met with. These, he says, are in the form of small logs cut slanting at the ends, and might easily be taken for petrifications, though he is convinced that they are real minerals.\n\nF. Sicard mentions two lakes, from the water of which is produced annually a great quantity of salt containing much mineral alkali; and M. Volney informs us, that the whole soil of this country is impregnated with salt; so that, upon <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIGGING\">digging</a> to some depth in the ground, we always meet with brackish water impregnated in some degree with the mineral alkali as well as with common salt. The two lakes mentioned by Sicard are situated in the desert to the west of the Delta; and are three or four leagues in length, and about a quarter of a league in breadth, with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SOLID\">solid</a> and stony bottom. For nine months in the year they are without water; but in the winter time there oozes out of the earth a reddish violet coloured water, which fills the lakes to the height of five or six feet. This being evaporated by the return of the heat, there remains a bed of salt two feet thick and very hard, which is broken into pieces with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a> bars; and no less than 30,000 quintals are procured every year from these lakes. So great is the propensity of the Egyptian soil to produce salt, that even when the gardens are overflowed for the sake of watering them, the surface of the ground, after the evaporation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ABSORPTION\">absorption</a> of the water, appears glazed over with salt. The water found in the wells contains mineral alkali, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol12.html#article-MARINE\">marine</a> salt, and a little nitre. M. Volney is of opinion, that the fertile mould of Egypt, which is of a blackish colour, differs essentially from that of the other parts; and is derived from the internal parts of Ethiopia along with the waters of the Nile. This seems to contradict what he had before advanced against M. Savary concerning the increase of the land of Egypt by means of the waters of this river; but there is no reason at all to suppose this kind of earth to be of a foreign origin; it being always the result of vegetation and cultivation. Even the most barren and sandy spots in the world, if properly watered, and such vegetables planted in them as would grow there, in time would be covered with this black earth as well as others; and of this kind of artificial formation of soil, travellers give us a remarkable instance in the garden of the monks at Mount <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SINAI\">Sinai</a>, where the country is naturally as barren as in any place of the world. \"The monks of Sinai (says Dr Shaw), in a long process of time, have covered over with dung and the sweepings of their convent near four acres of naked rocks; which produce as good cabbage, roots, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-SALAD\">salad</a>, and all kinds of pot herbs, as any soil and climate whatsoever. They have likewise raised olive, plum, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALMOND\">almond</a>, apple, and pear trees, not only in great numbers, but of excellent kinds. The pears, particularly are in such esteem at Cairo, that there is a present of them sent every year to the bakhaw and persons of the first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>. Neither are their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol10.html#article-GRAPES\">grapes</a> inferior in size and flavour to any whatsoever: it being fully demonstrated, by what this little garden produces, how far an indefatigable industry can prevail over nature; and that several places are capable of culture and improvement which were intended by nature to be barren, and which the lazy and slothful have always suffered to be so.\"\n\nFrom this general account of the country, we may reasonably conclude, that the natural fertility of Egypt is not diminished in modern times, provided the same pains were taken in the cultivation of it as formerly; but this is not to be expected from the present degenerate race of inhabitants. \"The Delta (says M. Savary) is at present in the most favourable state for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-AGRICULTURE\">agriculture</a>. Washed on the east and west by two rivers formed by the division of the Nile, each of which is as large and more deep than the Loire, intersected by innumerable rivulets; it presents to the eye an immense garden, all the different compartments of which may be easily watered. During the three months that the Thebais is under water, the Delta possesses fields covered with rice, barley, vegetables, and winter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FRUITS\">fruits</a>. It is also the only part of Egypt where the same field produces two crops of grain within the year, the one of rice, the other of barley.\"\n\nThe only cause of all this fertility is the Nile, without which the whole country would soon become an uninhabitable desert, as rain falls very seldom in this part of the world. It flows with a very gentle stream through the flat country, and its waters are very muddy, so that they must have time to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTLE\">settle</a>, or even require filtration before they can be drunk. For purifying the water, Method of the Egyptians, according to M. Volney, use bitter almonds, with which they rub the vessel containing it, and then the water becomes light and good; but on what principle this ingredient acts we cannot pretend to determine. Unglazed earthen vessels filled with water are kept in every apartment; which by a continual evaporation through their porous substance, render the contained fluid very cool even in the greatest heats. The river continues muddy for six mouths: and during the three which immediately precede the inundation, the stream being reduced to an inconsiderable depth, becomes heated, green, fetid, and full of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-WORMS\">worms</a>. The Egyptians in former times paid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVINE\">divine</a> honours to the Nile, and still hold it in great veneration. They believe its waters to be very nourishing, and that they are superior\nThis river, livelled by the rains which fall in Abyssinia, begins to rise in Egypt about the month of May; but the increase is inconsiderable till towards the end of June, when it is proclaimed by a public crier through the streets of Cairo. About this time it has usually risen five or six cubits; and when it has risen to 16, great rejoicings are made, and the people cry out Waffah Allah, that is, that God has given them abundance. This commonly takes place about the latter end of July, or at farthest before the 20th of August; and the sooner it takes place, so much the greater are the hopes of a good crop. Sometimes, though rarely, the necessary increase does not take place till later. In the year 1705, it did not rise to 16 cubits till the 19th of September; the consequence of which was that the country was depopulated by famine and pestilence.\n\nWe may easily imagine that the Nile cannot overflow the whole country of itself in such a manner as to render it fertile; for which reason there are innumerable canals cut from it across the country, it has already been observed, by which the water is conveyed to distant places, and almost every town or village has one of these canals. In those parts of the country where the inundation does not reach, and where more water is required than it can furnish, as for watering of gardens, they must have recourse to artificial means for raising it from the river. In former times they made use of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARCHIMEDES\">Archimedes</a>'s screw; but that is now disused, and in place of it they have chosen the Persian wheel. This is a large wheel turned by oxen, having a rope hung with several buckets which fill as it goes round, and empty themselves into a cistern at the top. Where the banks of the river are high, they frequently make a basin in the side of them, near which they fix an upright pole, and another with an axle across the top of that, at one end of which they hang a great stone, and at the other a leatheren bucket; this bucket being drawn down into the river by two men, is raised by the descent of the stone, and emptied into a cistern placed at a proper height. This kind of machine is used chiefly in the upper parts of the country, where the raising of water is more difficult than in places near the sea. When any of the gardens or plantations want water, it is conveyed from the cisterns into little trenches, and from thence conducted all round the beds in various rills, which the gardener easily stops by raising the mould against them with his foot, and diverts the current another way as he sees occasion.\n\nThe rise of the inundation is measured, as has already been observed, by an instrument adapted for the purpose, and called mikesas, which we translate nilometer. Mr Bruce informs us, that this is placed between Geeza and Cairo, on the point of an island named Rhoda, about the middle of the river, but somewhat nearer to Geeza. It is a round tower with an apartment, in the middle of which is a cistern neatly lined with marble. The bottom of this cistern reaches to that of the river, and there is a large opening by which the water has free access to the inside. The rise of the water is indicated by an octagonal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-COLUMN\">column</a> of blue and white marble, on which are marked 20 pecks or cubits of 22 inches each. The two lowermost of these have no subdivisions; but each of the rest is divided into 24 parts called digits; the whole height of the pillar being 36 feet 8 inches.\n\nWhen the river has attained its proper height, all the canals are opened, and the whole country laid under water. During the time of the inundation a certain vor, which the tical motion of the waters takes place; but notwithstanding this, the Nile is so easily managed, that many fields lower than the surface of its waters are preserved from injury merely by a dam of moistened earth not more than eight or ten inches in thickness. This method is made use of particularly in the Delta when it is threatened with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOD\">flood</a>.\n\nAs the Nile does not always rise to a height sufficient for the purposes of agriculture, the former sovereigns of Egypt were at vast pains to cut proper canals in order to supply the deficiency. Some of these are still preserved, but great numbers are rendered useless through the indolence or barbarity of their successors. Those which convey the water to Cairo, into the province of Fayoom, and to Alexandria, are best taken care of by government. The last is watched by an officer appointed for that purpose, whose office it is to hinder the Arabs of Bashiria, who receive this superfluous water, from turning it off before Alexandria be provided for, or opening it before the proper time, which would hinder the increase of the river. In like manner, that which conveys the water to Fayoom is watched, and cannot be opened before that of Cairo, which is called the Canal of Trajan. A number of other canals, only taken care of by those who derive advantage from them, proceed from that arm of the Nile which runs to Damietta, and fertilize the province of Sharkia; which, making part of the isthmus of Suez, is the most considerable of Egypt, and the most capable of a great increase of cultivation. The plains of Gaza which lie beyond, and are possessed by the Arabs, would be no less fertile, were it not for the excessive inclination these people have to destroy, so that they make war even with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPONTANEOUS\">spontaneous</a> productions of the earth. A number of other canals run through the Delta; and the vestiges of those which watered the provinces to the eastward and westward, show that in former times these were the best cultivated parts of Egypt. \"We may also presume (says the baron de Tott), from the extent of the ruins of Alexandria, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> of the canal, and the natural level of the lands which encompass the lake Mareotic, and extend themselves westward to the kingdom of Barca, that this country, at present given up to the Arabs, and almost deserted, was once sufficiently rich in productions of every kind to furnish the city of Alexander with its whole subsistence.\"\n\nThe air and climate of Egypt are extremely hot, and not only from the height of the sun, which in summer approaches to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-ZENITH\">zenith</a>, but from the want of rain and air from the vicinity of those burning and sandy deserts which lie to the southward. In the months of July and August, according to M. Volney, Reaumur's thermometer stands, even in the most temperate apartments, at the height of 24 or 25 degrees above the freezing point; and in the southern parts it is said to rise still higher. Hence, he says, only two seasons should be distinguished in Egypt, the cool and the hot, or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> and summer. The latter continues for the greatest part\nof the year, viz. from March to November or even longer; for by the end of February the sun is intolerable to a European at nine o'clock in the morning. During the whole of this season, the air seems to be inflated, the sky sparkles, and every one sweats profusely, even without the least exercise, and when covered with the lightest dress. This heat is tempered by the inundation of the Nile, the fall of the night dews, and the subsequent evaporation; so that some of the European merchants, as well as the natives, complain of the cold in winter. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DEW\">dew</a> we speak of does not fall regularly throughout the summer, as with us; the parched state of the country not affording a sufficient quantity of vapour for this purpose. It is first observed about St John's day (June 24th), when the river has begun to swell, and consequently a great quantity of water is raised from it by the heat of the sun, which being soon condensed by the cold of the night air, falls down in copious dews.\n\nIt might naturally be imagined, that as for three months in the year Egypt is in a wet and marshy situation, the excessive evaporation and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUTREFACTION\">putrefaction</a> of the stagnating waters would render it very unhealthy. But this is by no means the case. The great dryness of the air makes it absorb vapours of all kinds with the utmost avidity; and these rising to a great height, are carried off by the winds either to the southward or northward, without having time to communicate any of their pernicious effects. This dryness is so remarkable in the internal parts of the country, that flesh meat exposed to the open air does not putrefy even in summer, but soon becomes hard and dry like wood. In the deserts there are frequently dead carcases thus dried in such a manner, and become so light, that one may easily lift that of a camel with one hand. In the maritime parts, however, this dryness of the air is not to be expected. They discover the same degree of moisture which usually attends such situations. At Rofetta and Alexandria, iron cannot be exposed to the air for 24 hours without rusting. According to M. Volney, the air of Egypt is also strongly impregnated with salts; for which opinion he gives the following reason: \"The stones are corroded by natrum (mineral alkali or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SODA\">soda</a>), and in moist places long crystallizations of it are to be found, which might be taken for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALTPETRE\">saltpetre</a>. The wall of the Jesuits garden at Cairo, built with earth and bricks, is everywhere covered with a crust of this natrum as thick as a crown piece: and when this garden has been overflowed by the waters of the kaidj (canal), the ground, after they have drained off, appears sparkling on every side with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol3.html#article-CRYSTALS\">crystals</a>, which certainly were not brought thither by the water, as it shows no sign of salt either to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TASTE\">taste</a> or by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTILLATION\">distillation</a>.\"\u2014But whatever may be the quantity of salt contained in the earth, it is certain that M. Volney's opinion of its coming thither from the air cannot be just. The salt in question is excessively fixed, and cannot be diffused into the air without the violent heat of a glasshouse <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-FURNACE\">furnace</a>; and even after this has been done, it will not remain diffused through the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>, but quickly falls back again. No experiments have ever shown that any salt was or could be diffused in the air, except volatile alkali, and this is now known to be formed by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-UNION\">union</a> of two permanently <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTIC\">elastic</a> fluids; and it is certain that a saline air would quickly prove fatal to the animals who breathed it. The abundance of this kind of salt in Egypt therefore only shows, that by some unknown operation the heat of the sun forms it from the two ingredients of earth and water, though we do not yet understand the manner, nor are able to imitate this natural operation.\n\nTo this saline property of the earth M. Volney attributes the excessive quickness of vegetation in Egypt, which is so great, that a species of gourd called karra will, in 24 hours, send forth shoots of four inches in length; but for the same reason, in all probability, it is that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXOTIC\">exotic</a> plant will thrive in Egypt. The merchants are obliged annually to send to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MALTA\">Malta</a> for their garden seeds; for though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLANTS\">plants</a> thrive very well at first, yet if the seed of them is preserved, and sown in the second year, they always come up too tall and flender.\n\nBy reason of the great dryness of the air, Egypt is exempted from the phenomena of rain, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAIL\">hail</a>, snow, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-THUNDER\">thunder</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol6.html#article-LIGHTNING\">lightning</a>. Earthquakes are also seldom heard of in this country; though sometimes they have been very fatal and destructive, particularly one in the year 1112. In the Delta, it never rains in summer, and very seldom at any other time. In 1761, however, such a quantity of rain unexpectedly fell, that a great number of houses, built with mudwalls, tumbled entirely down by being soaked with the water, to which they were unaccustomed. In the Higher Egypt the rain is still less frequent; but the people, sensible of the advantages which accrue from it, always rejoice when any falls, however insufficient to answer the purpose. This deficiency of rain is supplied by the inundation and dews already mentioned. The latter proceed, as has already been said, partly from the waters of the inundation and partly from the sea. At Alexandria, after sunset, in the month of April, the clothes exposed to the air on the terraces are soaked with them as if it had rained. These dews are more or less copious according to the direction of the wind. They are produced in the greatest quantity by the westerly and northerly winds, which blow from the sea; but the south and south-east winds, blowing over the deserts of Africa and Arabia, produce none.\n\nThe periodical return of winds from a certain quarter is a very remarkable phenomenon in this country. When the sun approaches the tropic of Cancer, they shift from the east to the north; and, during the month of June, they always blow from the north or north-west. They continue northerly all the month of July, varying only sometimes towards the east, and sometimes the contrary way. About the end of this month, and during the whole of August and September, they blow directly from the north, and are but of a moderate strength, though somewhat weaker in the night than in the day. Towards the end of September they return to the east, though they do not absolutely fix on that point, but blow more regularly from it than any other except the north. As the sun approaches the southern tropic, they become more variable and tempestuous, blowing most commonly from the north, north-east, and west, which they continue to do throughout the months of December, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JANUARY\">January</a>, and February; and, during that season, the vapours raised from the Mediterranean condense into mist, or even sometimes\nEgypt sometimes into rain. Towards the end of February, and in the succeeding month, they more frequently blow from the south than from any other quarter. During some part of the month of March and in that of April, they blow from the south, south-east, and south-west; sometimes from the north and east, the latter becoming most prevalent about the end of that month, and continuing during the whole of May.\n\nIt is to the long continuance of the north winds, formerly called the Eteian winds, that Egypt probably owes its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol7.html#article-EXTREME\">extreme</a> dryness, as well as part of the inundation by which it is fertilized. From the month of April to July, there appear to be two immense currents in the atmosphere, the under one blowing from the north, and the upper from the south. By the former the vapours are raised from the Mediterranean and southern parts of Europe, where they are carried over Abyssinia, dissolving there in immense deluges of rain; while by the latter the superfluous vapours, or those raised from the country of Abyssinia itself, are carried northward toward the sources of the Euphrates. Here the clouds coming from the south, descending into the lower part of the atmosphere, dissolve in like manner into rain, and produce an inundation of the Euphrates similar to that of the Nile, and immediately succeeding it. Mr Bruce had an opportunity of attaining this fact in the month of June 1768; for at that time, while on a voyage from Sidon to Alexandria, he observed great numbers of thin white clouds moving rapidly from the south, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECT\">direct</a> opposition to the Eteian winds.\n\nBesides the ordinary winds here spoken of, Egypt is infested with the destructive blasts common to all warm countries which have deserts in their neighbourhood. These have been distinguished by various names, such as poisonous winds, hot winds of the desert, Samsel, the wind of Damascus, Kamjin, and Simoon. In Egypt they are denominated \"winds of 50 days,\" because they most commonly prevail during the 50 days preceding and following the equinox; though, should they blow constantly during one half of that time, an universal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESTRUCTION\">destruction</a> would be the consequence. Of these travellers have given various descriptions. M. Volney says, that the violence of their heat may be compared to that of a large oven at the moment of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> out the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BREAD\">bread</a>. They always blow from the south; and are undoubtedly owing to the motion of the atmosphere over such vast tracts of hot land, where it cannot be supplied by a sufficient quantity of moisture. When they begin to blow, the sky loses its usual serenity, and assumes a dark, heavy, and alarming aspect, the sun himself laying aside his usual splendor, and becoming of a violet colour. This terrific appearance seems not to be occasioned by any real haze or cloud in the atmosphere at that time, but solely to the vast quantity of fine sand carried along by those winds, and which is so excessively subtle that it penetrates everywhere. The motion of this wind is always rapid, but its heat is not intolerable till after it has continued for some time. Its pernicious qualities are evidently occasioned by its excessive avidity of moisture. Thus it dries and shrivels up the skin; and by doing the same to the lungs, will in a short time produce suffocation and death. The danger is greatest to those of a plethoric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HABIT\">habit</a> of body, or who have been exhausted by fatigue; and putrefaction soon takes place in the bodies of such as are destroyed by it. Its extreme dryness is such, that water sprinkled on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a> evaporates in a few minutes; all the plants are withered and stripped of their leaves; and a fever is instantly produced in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HUMAN\">human</a> species by the suppression of perspiration. It usually lasts three days, but is altogether insupportable if it continue beyond that time. The danger is greatest when the wind blows in squalls, and to travellers who happen to be exposed to its fury without any shelter. The best method in this case is to stop the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NOSE\">nose</a> and mouth with a handkerchief. Camels, by a natural <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTINCT\">instinct</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-BURY\">bury</a> their noses in the sand, and keep them there till the squall is over. The inhabitants, who have an opportunity of retiring to their houses, instantly shut themselves up in them, or go into pits made in the earth, till the destructive <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BLAST\">blast</a> be over.\n\nThe description of a blast of this kind which overtook Mr Bruce in the desert of Nubia is still more terrible than that just given from M. Volney. We have already mentioned something of the pillars of moving land raised by the winds in the desert. These were observed by our traveller on this occasion in all their terrific majesty. Sometimes they appeared to move slowly; at other times with incredible swiftness, so that they could not have been avoided by the fleetest horse. Sometimes they came so near, that they threatened destruction to the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a>. Frequently the tops, when arrived at an immense height, so that they were lost in the clouds, suddenly separated from the bodies, and dispersed themselves in the air; and sometimes the whole column broke off near the middle, as if it had received a cannon shot; and their size was such, that at the distance of about three miles, they appeared ten feet in diameter. Next day they appeared of a smaller size, but more numerous, and sometimes approached within two miles of the company. The sun was now obscured by them, and the transmission of his rays gave them a dreadful appearance resembling pillars of fire. This was pronounced by the guide to be a sign of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> Simoon or hot wind; and he directed, that when it came, the people should fall upon their faces and keep their mouths on the sand, to avoid the drawing in this pernicious blast with their breath. On his calling out that the Simoon was coming, Mr Bruce turned for a moment to the quarter from whence it came, which was the south-east. It appeared like a haze or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOG\">fog</a> of a purple colour, but less bright than the purple part of the rainbow; seemingly about 20 yards in breadth, and about 12 feet high from the ground. It moved with such rapidity, that before he could turn about and fall upon his face, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> the vehement heat of its current upon his face; and even after it passed over, which was very quickly, the air which followed was of such a heat as to threaten suffocation. Mr Bruce had unfortunately inspired some part of the pernicious blast; by which means he almost entirely lost his voice, and became subject to an asthmatic complaint, from which he did not get free for two years. The same phenomenon occurred twice more on their journey through this desert. The second time, it came from the south a little to the east; but it now seemed to have a shade of blue along with the purple, and its edges were less perfectly defined; resembling rather a thin <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a>, and having\nving about a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-YARD\">yard</a> in the middle tinged with blue and purple. The third time, it was preceded by an appearance of sandy pillars more magnificent than any they had yet observed; the sun shining through them in such a manner as to give those which were nearest a resemblance of being spangled with stars of gold. The simoom which followed had the same blue and purple appearance as before, and was followed by a most suffocating wind for two hours, which reduced our travelers to the lowest degree of weakness and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DELIRIUM\">delirium</a>.\n\nIt was remarkable that this wind always came from the south-east, while the sandy pillars, which prognosticated its approach, affected to keep to the westward, and to occupy the vast circular space inclosed by the Nile to the west of their route, going round by Chagre towards <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DONGOLA\">Dongola</a>. The heaps of sand left by them when they fell, or raised by the whirlwinds which carried them up, were 12 or 13 feet high, exactly conical, tapering to a fine point, and their bases well proportioned.\n\nThe inhabitants of Egypt may now be distinguished into four distinct races of people.\n\nI. The Arabs, who may be subdivided into three classes. 1. The poverty of those who settled here immediately after the conquest of the country by Amrou Ebn Al As, the khalif Omar's general. 2. The Magrebians, or Western Arabs, who at different times have migrated from the countries to the westward of Egypt, and are descended from the Saracen conquerors of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAURITANIA\">Mauritania</a>. 3. The Bedouins, or Arabs of the desert, known to the ancients by the name of Scenites, or dwellers in tents. The first of these classes are now found among the husbandmen and artisans; and are distinguished from the others by being of a more robust habit of body, as well as of a larger stature than the others. They are in general five feet four inches high; and many of them attain two or three inches more, and are muscular without being fleshy. Their countenances are almost black, but their features are not disagreeable; and as those of the country do not ally themselves in marriage but with the people of their own <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-TRIBE\">tribe</a>, their faces have all a strong resemblance to each other. This is not the case with such as live in towns, by reason of their promiscuous marriages. The second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CLASS\">class</a> are more numerous in the Said, where they have villages and even distinct sovereigns of their own. Like the former, they apply themselves to agriculture and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MECHANICAL\">mechanical</a> occupations. The Bedouins pass their lives among the rocks, ruins, and sequestered places where they can find water; sometimes uniting in tribes and living in low smoky tents, and shifting their habitations from the desert to the banks of the river and back again, as best suits their convenience. Their time of inhabiting the desert is the spring; but after the inundation they take up their residence in Egypt, in order to profit by the fertility of the country. Some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FARM\">farm</a> lands in the country, which they cultivate, but change annually. In general, all these Bedouins are robbers, and are a great terror to travellers as well as to the husbandmen; but though their number is estimated at not less than 30,000, they are dispersed in such a manner that they cannot attempt any thing of consequence.\n\nII. The Copts are descendants of those inhabitants of Egypt whom the Arabs subdued, and who were composed of original Egyptians, Persians and Greeks. M. Volney is of opinion that their name of Copts is only an abbreviation of the Greek word Aiguptios, an Egyptian. They are principally to be met with in the Said, though some also inhabit the Delta. They have all a yellowish dusky <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPLEXION\">complexion</a>, puffed-up visage, swollen eyes, flat noses, and thick lips; and in fact the exact countenance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MULATTO\">mulatto</a>. M. Volney, from a view of the sphynx, and finding its features to be such as is just now described, concludes, that the ancient Egyptians were real negroes; which he thinks is likewise confirmed by a passage in Herodotus, where he concludes, that the inhabitants of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLCHIS\">Colchis</a> were descended from the Egyptians, \"on account of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLACKNESS\">blackness</a> of their skins and frizzled hair.\" M. Volney also remarks, that the countenance of the negroes is such as exactly represents that state of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> assumed by our faces when strongly affected by heat. The eye-brows are knit, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHEEKS\">cheeks</a> rise, the eye-lids are contracted, and the mouth distorted; and this state of contraction to which the features of the negroes are perpetually exposed in the hot climates they inhabit, is become particularly characteristic. Excessive cold and snow produces the same effect; and hence this kind of countenance is also common among the Tartars; while, in the temperate climates, the features are proportionably lengthened, and the whole countenance expanded.\n\nThe Copts profess the Christian religion, but follow the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HERESY\">heresy</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EUTYCHIANS\">Eutychians</a>, whence they have been persecuted by the Greeks; but having at last got the better of their adversaries, they are become the depositaries of the registers of the lands and tribes. At Cairo they are called writers; and are the intendants, secretaries, and collectors for government. The head of their class is writer to the principal chief; but they are all hated by the Turks, to whom they are slaves, as well as by the peasants whom they oppress. Their language bears a great resemblance to the Greek; but they have five letters in their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALPHABET\">alphabet</a>, as well as a number of words in their language, which may be considered as the remains of the ancient Egyptian. There are found to bear a near resemblance to the dialects of some of the neighbouring nations, as the Arabic, Ethiopian, Syriac, &c., and even of those who lived on the banks of the Euphrates. The language of the Copts, however, has fallen into disuse for upwards of 300 years. On the conquest of the country by the Saracens, the latter obliged the people to learn their language; and about the year 722 the use of the Greek tongue was prohibited throughout the whole of their empire: the Arabic language then of course became universal; while the others, being only met with in books, soon became totally neglected. The true Coptic, therefore, though there is a translation of the scriptures and many books of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEVOTION\">devotion</a> written in it, is understood by nobody, not even the monks and priests.\n\nIII. The Turks, who have the title of being masters of Egypt, but are chiefly to be met with at Cairo, where they possess the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RELIGIOUS\">religious</a> and military employments. Formerly they possessed also the posts under government; but they are now occupied by the fourth race of inhabitants, viz.\n\nIV. The Mamouks. Of the origin of these we have already given some account; we have only, therefore,\nfore, to relate some of the most remarkable particulars concerning their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTITUTION\">constitution</a> and government, manners, &c.\n\nThese people, as has already been mentioned, are the real masters of Egypt; and in order to secure themselves in the possession of the country, they have taken several precautions. One of the principal of these is the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEGRADATION\">degradation</a> of the two military corps of azabs and janizaries, both of which were formerly very formidable. They have been able to effect this only in consequence of the corrupt and wretched government of the Turks; for before the revolt of Ibrahim Kiaya, the Turkilh troops, which ought to have consisted of 40,000, were reduced to less than half that number through the avarice and malversation of their officers. Their degradation was completed by Ali Bey; who having first displaced all the officers who gave him any umbrage, left their places vacant, and so reduced the consequence of the whole, that the azabs and janizaries are now only a rabble of vagabonds, who dread the Mamlouks as much as they meanest of the populace. The principal body of the Mamlouks reside at Cairo; but many of them are dispersed through the country, in order to keep up their authority, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLLECT\">collect</a> the tribute, and oppress the people: yet it should seem very easy for the Porte to dispossess them of this usurped authority, as their number is supposed not to exceed 8500, including among them a great many youth under 20 years of age.\n\nThe Mamlouks are all horsemen; and as war is accounted the only honourable employment among them, it is reckoned disgraceful to walk on foot, none but cavalry being accounted soldiers. The other inhabitants are allowed only the use of mules and asses; and the same mark of indignity is imposed upon Europeans; though by proper management and liberal presents, this may be got over. In the year 1776 Lord Algernon Percy, afterwards Lord Louvaine, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARL\">earl</a> of Charlemont, obtained permission to ride upon horseback. The Mamlouks, however, are not incited to this continual appearance on horseback merely by their supposed superiority to the rest of the inhabitants; it is rendered necessary by their dres, which is extremely unwieldy and cumbersome. It consists of a wide shirt of thin yellowish-colored cotton; over which is a gown of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-INDIAN\">Indian</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a>, or some of the light stuffs of Damascus or Aleppo. Over this is a second covering of the same form and wideness, with sleeves reaching down to the ends of the fingers. The former covering is called antari; and the latter caftan. The caftan is usually made of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> or some finer <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STUFF\">stuff</a> than the under garments; and both of them are fastened by a long belt, which divides the whole dress into two bundles. Over all these they have a third, named djouka, consisting of cloth without lining, and made nearly similar to the others, but that the sleeves are cut in the elbow. This coat is lined, sometimes even in summer, with fur; and as if all this was not sufficient, they have an outer covering called the beniche, which is the cloak or robe of ceremony; and so completely covers the body, that even the ends of the fingers are not to be seen. Thus, when the beniche and other accoutrements are on, the whole body appears like a long sack, with a bare neck and bald head covered with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TURBAN\">turban</a> thrust out of it. This turban is called a kaouk; and is of a cylindrical form, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-YELLOW\">yellow</a>, and turned up on the outside with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-ROLL\">roll</a> of mullin artificially folded up. On their feet they have a fock of yellow <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEATHER\">leather</a> reaching up to the heels, flippers without any quarters, which consequently are always ready to be left behind in walking. Lastly, to complete this extraordinary dress, they have a kind of pantaloons or trousers, long enough to reach up to the chin, and so large that each of the legs is big enough to contain the whole body; but that they may walk more at their ease under such a number of impediments, they tie all the loose parts of their dress with a running girth. \"Thus swaddled (says M. Volney), we may imagine the Mamlouks are not very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTIVE\">active</a> walkers; and those who are not acquainted by experience with the prejudices of different countries, will find it scarcely possible to believe that they look on this dress as exceedingly commodious. In vain we may object that it hinders them from walking and encumbers them unnecessarily on horseback; and that in battle a horseman once dismounted is a lost man. They reply, It is the custom, and every objection is answered.\"\n\nIn the accoutrements of their horses, the Mamlouks are almost equally absurd. The saddle is a clumsy piece of furniture, weighing with the saddle-cloths not less than 25 pounds; while the weight of the stirrups is never less than 9 or 10 pounds, nay, frequently exceeds 13. On the back-part of the saddle rises a truquim about eight inches in height, while a pommel before projects four or five inches, in such a manner as to endanger the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAST\">breast</a> of the horseman if he should happen to stoop. Instead of a stuffed frame, they have three thick woollen coverings below the saddle; the whole being fastened by a surcingle, which, instead of a buckle, is tied with leather thongs in very complicated knots, and liable to slip. Instead of a crupper they have a large <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MARTINGALE\">martingale</a> which throws them upon the horse's shoulders. The stirrups are made of copper, longer and wider than the foot, having circular edges an inch high in the middle, and gradually declining toward each end. The edges are sharp, and used instead of spurs, by which means the poor animal's sides are much wounded. The weight of the furniture has already been mentioned; and is the more ridiculous as the Egyptian horses are very small. The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRIDLE\">bridle</a> is equally ill contrived, and greatly injures the horse's mouth, especially by reason of the violent method they have of managing the animal. Their usual way is to put the horse to a full gallop, and suddenly stop him when at full speed. Thus checked by the bit, he <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BENDS\">bends</a> in his hind legs, stiffens the fore ones, and moves along as if he scarce had <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JOINTS\">joints</a> in his body: yet notwithstanding all these disadvantages, our author acknowledges that they are vigorous horsemen, having a martial appearance which pleases even strangers.\n\nIn the choice of their arms they have shown themselves more judicious. Their principal weapon is an English carbine about 30 inches long; but so large in bore, that it can discharge 10 or 12 balls at a time, which can scarcely fail of doing great execution even from the most unskillful hand. Besides two large pistols carried in the belt, they have sometimes a heavy mace at the bow of the saddle for knocking down their enemy; and by the shoulder belt they suspend a crooked sabre measuring 24 inches in a straight line from the hilt.\nEgypt: hilt to the point, but so at least in the curve. The reason of the preference given to the crooked <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BLADE\">blade</a> is, that the effect of a straight one depends merely on the force with which it falls, and is confined to a small space, but that of a crooked one is continued longer by the action of the arm in retiring. The Mamlouks commonly procure their sabres from Constantinople, or other parts of Europe; but the beys rival each other in those of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PERSIA\">Persia</a> and such as are fabricated of the ancient <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STEEL\">steel</a> of Damascus. For these they frequently pay as high as 40l. or 50l. sterling; but though it must be allowed that the edge of these weapons is exquisitely keen, yet they have the defect of being almost as brittle as glass. The whole education and employment of the Mamlouks consists in the exercise of these weapons, or what is conducive to it; so that we should imagine they might at last become altogether irresistible. Every morning the greater part of them exercise themselves in a plain near Cairo, by firing their carbines and pistols in the most expeditious manner, having an earthen vessel for a mark to shoot at; and the person who breaks it is highly applauded by the beys who attend in order to encourage them. Here also they exercise themselves in the use of the sabre, as well as of the bow and arrows; though they do not any longer make use of these last in their engagements. Their favourite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVERSION\">diversion</a> is throwing the dyerid; a word properly signifying a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REED\">reed</a>, but which is generally made use of to signify any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAFF\">staff</a> thrown by the hand after the manner of the Roman <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILUM\">pilum</a>. In this exercise they make use of the branches of the palm-tree freshly stripped. These branches, which have the form of the stalk of an artichoke, are about four feet long, and weigh five or six pounds. With these the cavaliers enter the lists, riding full speed, and throwing them afterwards at each other from a considerable distance. As soon as the assailant has thrown his weapon, he turns his horse, and his antagonist pursues in his turn. The diversion, however, frequently turns out very serious, as some are capable of throwing these weapons with force sufficient to wound their antagonists mortally. Ali Bey was particularly dexterous at this kind of sport, and frequently killed those who opposed him. All their military exercises, however, are by no means sufficient to render the Mamlouks formidable in the field. In their engagements they have neither order, discipline, nor even subordination; so that their wars are only scenes of robbery, plunder, and tumultuary encounters, which begin very often suddenly in the streets of Cairo without the least warning. If the contention happens to be transferred to the country, it is still carried on in the same manner. The strongest or most daring party pursues the other. If they are equal in courage, they will perhaps appoint a field of battle, and that without the least regard to advantages of situation, but fighting in platoons, with the boldest champions at the head of each. After <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> defiances, the attack begins, and every one chooses out his man. After discharging their fire-arms, if they have an opportunity they attack with their sabres; and such as happen to be dismounted are helped up again by their servants; but if nobody happens to be near, the servants will frequently kill them for the sake of the money they carry about them. Of late, however, the ordinary Mamlouks, who are all slaves to the rest, seem convinced that their patrons are the persons principally interested; for which reason they reasonably enough conclude that they ought to encounter the greatest dangers. Hence they generally leave them to carry on the dispute by themselves; and being always sure of finding a master who will employ them, they generally return quietly to Cairo until some new revolution takes place.\n\nThe <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a> of living among the Mamlouks is exceedingly expensive, as may easily be conceived from what has already been related. There is not one of them who does not cost above 100l. sterling annually, and many of them upwards of 200l. At every return of the fast of Ramadan, their masters must give them a new <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUIT\">suit</a> of French and Venetian clothes, with stuffs from India and Damascus. Frequently they require new horses and harnesses; they must likewise have pistols and sabres from Damascus, with gilt stirrups, and saddles and bridles plated with silver. The chiefs are distinguished from the vulgar by the trinkets and precious stones they wear; by riding Arabian horses of 200l. or 300l. value, wearing <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHAWLS\">shawls</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CASHMERE\">Cashmere</a> in value from 25l. to 50l. each, with a variety of peltries, the cheapest of which costs above 20l. Even the European merchants have given into this kind of extravagance; so that not one of them looks upon his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARDROBE\">wardrobe</a> to be decently furnished unless it be in value 500l. or 600l.\n\nAnciently it was customary for the women to adorn their heads with sequins; but this is now rejected as not sufficiently expensive. Instead of these, diamonds, emeralds, and rubies, are now substituted; and to these they add French stuffs and laces. In other respects the character of the Mamlouks is almost the worst that can be imagined. Without affection, tie, or kind, they give themselves up without controul to the most enormous vices; and, according to M. Volney, they are at once ferocious, perfidious, seditious, base, deceitful, and corrupted by every species of debauchery, not excepting even the unnatural vice; of which he tells us not one is free, this being the very first lesson each of them receives from his master, all being originally slaves, as has already been mentioned.\n\nAs these are the present governors of Egypt, we may easily judge that the condition of the common people cannot be very agreeable. The greater part of the lands indeed are in the hands of the Mamlouks, beys, and professors of the law, the property of all others being very precarious. Contributions are to be paid, or damages repaired, every moment; and there is neither right of succession nor <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INHERITANCE\">inheritance</a> for real property, but every thing must be purchased from government. The peasants are allowed nothing but what is barely sufficient to sustain life. They cultivate rice and corn indeed, but are not at liberty to use either. The only food allowed them is dora or Indian millet, from which they make a kind of tasteful bread; and of this, with water and raw onions, confits all their fare throughout the year. They esteem themselves happy, therefore, if along with these they can sometimes procure a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HONEY\">honey</a>, cheese, four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MILK\">milk</a>, or a few dates. They are very fond of flesh meat and fat; neither of which, however, they have an opportunity of tasting except at extraordinary festivals. Their ordinary\nEgyptian dress consists of a shirt of coarse blue linen, and a clumsy black cloak; with a sort of black bonnet over their heads; and over all they wear a long red woollen handkerchief. Their arms, legs, and breasts, are naked, and most of them do not even wear drawers. They live in mud-walled huts of the most miserable construction, where they are exposed to the inconveniences of smoke, heat, and unwholesome air; to all which are to be added the continual fears they live in of being robbed by the Arabs, oppressed by the Mameluks, or some other grievous calamity. The only <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONVERSATION\">conversation</a> is concerning the intestine troubles and misery of the country, murders, bandoleros, and executions. Here <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENTENCE\">sentence</a> of death is executed without the least delay or form of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIAL\">trial</a>. The officers who go the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROUNDS\">rounds</a> in the streets either by night or day, are attended by executioners, who carry along with them leather bags for receiving the heads they cut off in these expeditions. Even the appearance of guilt is not necessary to infer a capital punishment; for frequently nothing more is requisite than the possession of wealth, or being supposed to possess it. In this case the unfortunate person is summoned before some bey; and when he makes his appearance, a sum of money is demanded of him. If he denies that he possesses it, he is thrown on his back, and receives two or three hundred blows on the soles of the feet, nay perhaps is put to death without any ceremony. The only security of those who possess any wealth in this country therefore is, to preserve as great an appearance of poverty as possible.\n\nThough the climate of Egypt is far from being unhealthy; yet there are not a few diseases which seem to be peculiar to it, and to have their origin either from the constitution of the atmosphere, or the manner of living of the inhabitants. One of these till lately has been supposed to be the plague; which opinion we find supported by Dr <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MEAD\">Mead</a>, who has endeavoured to assign a natural reason why it should take its origin in this country. But it is now universally agreed, that the plague never originates in the interior parts of Egypt, but always begins at Alexandria, passing successively from thence to Rosetta, Cairo, Damietta, and the rest of the Delta. It is likewise observed, that its appearance is always preceded by the arrival of some vessel from <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMYRNA\">Smyrna</a> or Constantinople; and that if the plague has been very violent in either of these cities, the danger of Egypt is the greater. On proper inquiry, it is found to be really a native of Constantinople; from whence it is exported by the absurd negligence of the Turks, who refuse to take any care to prevent the spreading of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFECTION\">infection</a>. As they sell even the clothes of the dead without the least ceremony, and ships laden with this pernicious commodity are sent to Alexandria, it is no wonder that it should soon make its appearance there. As soon as it has reached Cairo, the European merchants shut themselves up with their families in their khans or lodgings, taking care to have no further communication with the city. Their provisions are now deposited at the gate of the khan, and are taken up by the porter with iron tongs; who plunges them into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BARREL\">barrel</a> of water provided for the purpose. If they have occasion to speak to any person, they take care to keep at such a distance as to avoid touching or even breathing upon each other.\n\nBy these precautions they certainly escape the general calamity, except by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCIDENT\">accident</a>; and it not long ago happened that the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISEASE\">disease</a> was conveyed by a cat into the dwellings of the French merchants in Cairo; by which two were infected, and one died. In this manner they are imprisoned for three or four months, without any other amusement than walking on their terraces in the evenings, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARDS\">cards</a>, or conversation with one another. There is a remarkable difference between the plague at Constantinople and in Egypt. In the former, it is most violent in summer; and in the latter in winter, ending there always in the month of June. It is also remarkable, that the water-carriers of Egypt, whose backs are constantly wet from the nature of their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OCCUPATION\">occupation</a>, never have the plague. It appears in Egypt every fourth or fifth year, when it makes such ravages as would depopulate the country, were it not for the vast concourse of strangers which arrive here every year from all parts of the Turkish empire.\n\nA malady which seems in reality to be peculiar to Egypt is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLINDNESS\">blindness</a>. This is so common at Cairo, as Mr Volney informs us, that out of 100 people whom he has met on the street, he might reckon 20 quite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BLIND\">blind</a>; 10 without the sight of one eye; and 20 others with their eyes red, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PURULENT\">purulent</a>, or blemished. Almost every one, says he, wears a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILLET\">fillet</a>, a token of an approaching or convalescent ophthalmia. In considering the causes of this disorder, he reckons the sleeping upon terraces to be a principal one. The south wind, he says, cannot be the cause; otherwise the Bedouins would be equally subject to it with the Egyptians themselves; but what is with the greatest probability to be assigned as the cause, according to our author, is the very poor and little nutritive food which the natives are obliged to use. \"The cheese, sour-milk, honey, confection of grapes, green fruits, and raw vegetables (says he), which are the ordinary food of the people, produce in the stomach a disorder which physicians have observed to affect the sight; the raw onions, especially, which they devour in great quantities, have a peculiar heating quality, as the monks of Syria made me remark on myself. Bodies thus nourished, abound in corrupted humours, which are constantly endeavouring a discharge. Diverted from the ordinary channels, by habitual perspiration, these humours fly to the exterior parts, and fix themselves where they find the least resistance. They therefore naturally attack the head, because the Egyptians, by having it once a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-WEEK\">week</a>, and covering it with a prodigiously hot head-dress, principally attract to it the perspiration; and if the head receives even so slight an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-IMPRESSION\">impression</a> of cold on being uncovered, this perspiration is suppressed, and falls upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol18.html#article-TEETH\">teeth</a>, or still more readily on the eyes as being the tenderest part. It will appear the more probable that the excessive perspiration of the head is a principal cause, when we reflect that the ancient Egyptians, who went bare-headed, are not mentioned by physicians as being so much afflicted with ophthalmies; though we are informed by historians that some of the Pharaohs died blind. The Arabs of the desert also, who cover the head but little, especially when young, are also very little subject to them.\" In this country blindness is often the consequence of the small-pox, a disorder very frequent and very fatal.\nE G Y\n\n[631]\n\nE G Y\n\ntal among the Egyptians; and no doubt the more dangerous on account of their absurd method of treating it, of which it is needless to enter into any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DISCUSSION\">discussion</a> in this place. They are not unacquainted with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INOCULATION\">inoculation</a>; but seem not to be sensible of its advantages, as they very seldom practise it.\n\nTo the same cause, viz. unwholesome food, M. Volney ascribes the general <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFORMITY\">deformity</a> of the beggars, and the miserable appearance of the children; which he says are nowhere so wretched. \"Their hollow eyes, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-PALE\">pale</a> and puffed faces, swollen bellies, meagre extremities, and yellow skins, make them always seem as if they had not long to live. Their ignorant mothers pretend that this is the effect of the evil eye of some envious person, who has bewitched them; and this ancient prejudice is still general in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURKEY\">Turkey</a>: but the real cause is the badness of their food. In spite of the talismans, therefore, an incredible number of them perish; nor is any city more fatal to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POPULATION\">population</a> of the neighbouring country than Grand Cairo.\n\nThe venereal disease, which, for reasons best known to themselves, the inhabitants call the big fed evil, is so general at Cairo, that one half of the inhabitants are infected. It is extremely difficult to cure, though the symptoms are comparatively very mild, inasmuch that people who are infected with it will frequently live to the age of 80; but it is fatal to children born with the infection, and exceedingly dangerous to such as emigrate to a colder climate.\n\nBesides these, there are two uncommon diseases met with in Egypt, viz. a cutaneous eruption which returns annually; and a swelling of the testicles, which often degenerates into an enormous hydrocele. The former comes on towards the end of June or beginning of July, making its appearance in red spots and pimples all over the body, occasioning a very troublesome itching. The cause of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTEMPER\">distemper</a>, in M. Volney's opinion, is the corruption of the waters of the Nile, which towards the end of April become very putrid, as has already been observed. After this has been drunk for some time, the waters of the inundation, which are fresh and wholesome, tend to introduce some change in the blood and humours; whence a cutaneous eruption is the natural consequence.\n\nThe hydrocele most commonly attacks the Greeks and Copts; and is attributed to the quantity of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a> they make use of, as well as to their frequent hot-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BATHING\">bathing</a>. Our author remarks, that \"in Syria as well as in Egypt, constant experience has shown, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRANDY\">brandy</a> distilled from common figs, or from the fruit of the fycamore tree, as well as from dates and the fruit of the nopal, has a most immediate effect on the testicles, which it renders hard and painful the third or fourth day after it has been drunk; and if the use of it be not discontinued, the disorder degenerates into a confirmed hydrocele. Brandy distilled from dried <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RAISINS\">raisins</a> has not the same effect: this is always mixed with aniseeds; and is very strong, being distilled three times. The Christians of Syria and the Copts of Egypt make great use of it; the latter especially drink whole bottles of it at their <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SUPPER\">supper</a>. I imagined this an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAGGERATION\">exaggeration</a>; but I have myself had ocular proofs of its truth, though nothing could equal my astonishment that such excellent drinks do not produce <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a> death, or at least every symptom of the most insensible <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DRUNKENNESS\">drunkenness</a>.\"\n\nIn the spring season malignant fevers prevail in this country; concerning which our author mentions no remarkable particular, but that eggs are a kind of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POISON\">poison</a>, and that bleeding is very prejudicial. He recommends a vegetable diet, and the bark in very large quantity.\n\nNotwithstanding the opprobrium which the Egyptians commerce labour under, a very considerable trade is carried on of Cairo from Cairo. This flourishing state of commerce is owing to three causes. 1. That all the commodities consumed in Egypt are collected within the walls of that city. 2. That the Mamouks and all the people of property reside in that place, and there spend their whole revenues. 3. By the situation of this city it is a centre of circulation; corresponding with Arabia and India, by the Red Sea; with Abyssinia and the interior parts of Africa, by the Nile; and with Europe and the Turkish empire, by means of the Mediterranean. A caravan comes here annually from Abyssinia, bringing from 1000 to 1200 slaves, with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-IVORY\">ivory</a>, gold-dust, ostrich-feathers, parrots, and monkeys.\u2014Another, which sets out from the extreme parts of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MOROCCO\">Morocco</a>, takes in pilgrims for Mecca from all that country as far south as the mouth of the river <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SENEGAL\">Senegal</a>. It consists of not fewer than three or four thousand camels; and, passing along the coasts of the Mediterranean, collects likewise the pilgrims from Algiers, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TRIPOLI\">Tripoli</a>, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TUNIS\">Tunis</a>, arriving at last at Alexandria by the way of the desert. Proceeding thence to Cairo, it joins the Egyptian caravan; and then setting out both together, they take their journey to Mecca, from whence they return in one hundred days; but the Morocco pilgrims, who have still 600 leagues to go, are upwards of a year in returning. The commodities they bring along with them are, India stuffs, shawls, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUMS\">gums</a>, perfumes, pearls, and principally <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COFFEE\">coffee</a>. Besides the profits of this merchandise, considerable sums arise from the duties paid by pilgrims, and the sums expended by them.","sp":209,"ep":241},{"h":"THESE STATES OF ELECTRICITY ARE USUALLY DISTINGUISHED BY","t":"e <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a> of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a> are usually distinguished by means of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> pith-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALL\">ball</a> electrometer.\n\nExperiment.\u2014Set the machine in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>, while both conductors are insulated, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> without connecting either the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PRIME\">prime</a> conductor or the rubber with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTIGUOUS\">contiguous</a> bodies.

The balls presented to the rubber will diverge with negative electricity, but being brought near the other conductor in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIVERGENT\">divergent</a> state, they will collapse.\n\nBut should a more precise <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> be required to determine the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a> of the electricity of an electrified body, the following may be used:\u2014First, electrify one of the electrometers C, placed upon the stand fig. 15, either positively, or negatively, at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>: touch it, for instance, with an excited glass tube, so that its balls may repel, and stand about two inches distant from one another; then touch the other electrometer C with the electrified body, that you desire to examine, so that it may be possessed of the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of electricity: lastly, take either of the two electrometers by the top of the glass handle, disengage it from the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-ARM\">arm</a> of the stand, and bring it near the other electrometer; if then the balls of one electrometer repel those of the other, you may conclude that they are possessed of the same kind of electricity; but if they attract each other, you may conclude that they have been electrified with contrary electricities; and as you know the electricity of that electrometer, which was first electrified, you will of course know the electricity of the other electrometer, i.e., of the electrified body, with which it was touched.\n\nThe above experiment may also be made with the single-thread electrometers; for if they are brought near to one another, when their feathers are electrified, they will, if possessed of the same electricity, repel each other, or, if possessed of contrary electricities, they will attract each other.\n\nWhile the conductors are thus insulated, if a pointed body (as for instance, the point of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-NEEDLE\">needle</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PIN\">pin</a>) be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a> presented to the back of the rubber, at the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of about two inches, a lucid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PENCIL\">pencil</a> of rays will appear to proceed from the point presented, and diverge towards the rubber.\n\nIf another pointed body be presented to the prime conductor, it will appear illuminated with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAR\">star</a>; but...\nIf a pointed wire, or other pointed conducting body, be connected with the prime conductor, it will throw out a pencil of rays.\n\nF. Beccaria remarks, that if two equally sharp <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POINTS\">points</a> are approached to a prime conductor, they will appear <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a> at only half the distance at which one of them would have done.\n\nFrom this experiment may be learned the method of distinguishing the quality of the electricity of an electrified body, by the appearance of the electric light; for if a needle, or any other pointed body, be presented in the dark, with the point towards a body strongly electrified, it will appear illuminated with a star, when that body is electrified positively, and with a pencil or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BRUSH\">brush</a>, when it is electrified negatively (q).\n\nHere it is proper to remark, that when two points (one of which is connected with the prime conductor, or the rubber) are opposed to one another, the appearance of light in both is pretty much the same. Mr Wilcke remarks, that when a point not electrified, is opposed to another point electrified positively, the cones of light, which otherwise would appear upon them, disappear; but that if a positive cone be opposed to a negative cone, they both preserve their own characteristic properties.\n\nMr Nicholson has given us some valuable observations on the different appearances of the electric light, when proceeding from bodies electrified positively or negatively.\n\n\"The escape of negative electricity from a ball,\" says Mr Nicholson, \"is attended with the appearance of straight sharp sparks with a hoarse or chirping noise. When the ball was less than two inches in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, it was usually covered with short flames of this kind, which were very numerous.\n\n\"When two equal balls were presented to each other, and one of them was rendered strongly positive, while the other remained in connection with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-EARTH\">earth</a>, the positive brush or ramified spark was seen to pass from the electrified ball: when the other ball was electrified negatively, and the ball, which before had been positive, was connected with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GROUND\">ground</a>, the electricity exhibited the negative <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a>, or dense, straight, and more luminous sparks from the negative ball; and when the one ball was electrified plus and the other minus, the signs of both electricities appeared. If the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a> was not too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a>, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a> zig-zag spark of the plus ball struck the straight <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a> of the minus ball, usually at the distance of about one third of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> of the latter from its point, rendering the other two thirds very bright: sometimes, however, the positive spark struck the ball at a distance from the negative flame. These effects are represented in Plate CLXXXVIII, figs. 35, 36, and 37.\n\n\"Two conductors of three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-QUARTERS\">quarters</a> of an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> diameter, with spherical ends of the same diameter, were laid <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to each other, at the distance of about two inches, in such a manner as that the ends pointed in opposite directions, and were six or eight inches asunder. These, which may be distinguished by the letters P and M, were successively electrified, as the balls were in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PARAGRAPH\">paragraph</a>. When one conductor P was positive, fig. 39, it exhibited the sparks of that electricity at its extremity, and struck the side of the other conductor M. When the last-mentioned conductor M was electrified negatively, fig. 38, the former being in its turn connected with the earth, the sparks ceased to strike as before, and the extremity of the electrified conductor M exhibited negative signs, and struck the side of the other conductor. And when one conductor was electrified plus and the other minus, fig. 40, both signs appeared at the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a>, and continual streams of electricity passed between the extremities of each conductor, to the side of the other conductor opposed to it.\n\n\"In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-DRAWING\">drawing</a> the long spark from a ball of four inches diameter, I found it of some <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> that the stem should not be too short, because the vicinity of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> prime conductor altered the disposition of the electricity to escape: I therefore made a set of experiments, the result of which showed, that the disposition of balls to receive or emit electricity, is greater when they stand remote from other surfaces in the same plate; and that between this greatest disposition in any ball, whatever may be its diameter, every possible less degree may be obtained by withdrawing the ball towards the broader or less convex surface out of which its stem projects, until at length the ball, being wholly deprived beneath that surface, loses the disposition entirely.\n\nFrom these experiments it follows, that a variety of balls is unnecessary in electricity: because any small ball, if near the prime conductor, will be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-EQUIVALENT\">equivalent</a> to a larger ball whose stem is longer.\n\n\"From comparing some experiments made by myself many years ago with the present set, I considered a point as a ball of an indefinitely small diameter, and which I constructed an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> consisting of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> ball of six inches diameter, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-AXIS\">axis</a> of which a stem, points <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CARRYING\">carrying</a> a fine point, was screwed. When this stem is illustrated fixed in the prime conductor, if the ball be moved on its axis in every <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIRECTION\">direction</a>, it causes the fine point either to protrude through a small hole in its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> surface, or to withdraw itself; because by this means the ball runs along the stem. The disposition of the point to transmit electricity may thus be made equal to that of any ball whatever, from the minutest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> to the diameter of six inches. See fig. 41, A.\n\n\"The effect of a positive surface appears to extend farther than that of a negative; for the point acts like a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FOCUS\">focus</a> for a ball, when considerably more prominent, if it be positive, than it will if negative.\"\n\nFig. 42 represents an instrument invented by Mr Nicholson for distinguishing positive from negative electricity. It consists of two metallic balls, A, B, which may be placed at a greater or less distance from each other, by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JOINT\">joint</a> at C, on which the two branches CA, CB move. These branches are of positive glass covered with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a>. A short point proceeds from one of the balls B towards the other A. If the two balls be placed near a body which is electrified, so that\n\n(q) The pencil of light exhibited by a point positively electrified was first seen by Mr Grey, though the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DIFFERENCE\">difference</a> of the two states was not in his time correctly ascertained.\nPrinciples of Electricity illustrated by experiment.\n\nFor supposing that the electricity passes from A to B, there will be a certain distance of the balls at which a spark will pass between the balls; but this distance will be much shorter when the electricity is passing from B to A. It is evident that this instrument will be of use only when the electricity to be examined is sufficiently strong to give sparks.\n\nThe appearances of positive and negative electricity are sufficiently distinct in almost every experiment which can be made with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXHIBITION\">exhibition</a> of electric light. <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">Paper</a> is a good substance for observing the visible passage of the electric power. If a strong positive electric stream be let <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> on the flat side of an uninflated sheet of paper, it will form a beautiful star about four inches in diameter, consisting of very distinct radii not ramified. Negative electricity, in perfectly similar circumstances, throws many pointed brushes to the paper, but forms no star upon it. This experiment is by Mr Nicholson, and the cylinder of the machine employed in making it was seven inches in diameter*.\n\nChap. V. Of the different states of electricity possessed by the two surfaces of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> electric.\n\nThe opposite surfaces of a charged electric are in opposite states, i.e., one positive, and the other negative.\n\nExper. 1. Inflate a coated phial, such as is described in fig. 34, without the bells, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a> it by holding the knob a to the positive conductor, while the knob b communicates with the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TABLE\">table</a>. When the phial is charged, hold a pith-ball electroscope to the knob a, and the balls will diverge with positive electricity, as will appear by presenting them in their diverging state to excited sealing-wax, when they will collapse. Now hold the balls to the knob b, which communicates with the outer coating of the phial, and they will diverge with negative electricity, as will appear by presenting them to an excited glass tube.\n\nIf the jar be charged at the negative conductor, these appearances will be reversed; the balls presented to the knob a will diverge with negative electricity, and presented to b, they will diverge with positive electricity.\n\nExper. 2. Fix a pointed wire into a hole in the knob of the inflated phial, and fix another wire in the positive conductor. Hold the knob a to the point in the positive conductor, and on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TURNING\">turning</a> the cylinder in the dark, a pencil of luminous rays will be seen diverging from the point in the conductor to the knob a, while a similar pencil of rays, diverges from the wire fixed in the knob b.\n\nIf the wire is fixed in the negative conductor, a luminous star will appear at each point.\n\nExper. 3.\u2014Fix a pointed wire into a hole in the knob a, while another pointed wire is fixed in b, as in the last experiment. Present the wire in the knob a in the dark, to the positive conductor, and a luminous star will appear at the point a, while the point at b throws out a pencil of luminous rays.\n\nIf the point at a be presented to the negative conductor, the luminous pencil will appear at a and the luminous star at b.\n\nExper. 4.\u2014Fig. 43. is an electric jar which serves to illustrate the contrary states of the sides of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a> phial while charging: BB is the tin foil coating; C, a stand which supports the jar; D, a socket of metal, carrying the glass rod EF, a bent brass wire pointed at each end, and fixed at the end of the rod G; this rod is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOVEABLE\">moveable</a> in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPRING\">spring</a> tube N at pleasure: that tube being fixed by a socket on the top of the glass rod E, the jar is charged by the inside wire, which communicates with the different divisions of the inside coating by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZONTAL\">horizontal</a> wires.\n\n<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">Place</a> the jar at the conductor as usual; and when charging, a luminous star will appear upon the upper point of the wire at F, clearly showing, according to the commonly received <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-OPINION\">opinion</a>, that the point is then receiving the electric power. From the upper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol18.html#article-RING\">ring</a> of the coating B, on the outside of the jar, a stream or pencil of rays will at the same time fly off, beautifully diverging from the lower point of the wire E upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BOTTOM\">bottom</a> ring of the coating of the jar. When the appearances cease, which they do when the jar is charged, let a pointed wire be presented to the conductor: this will soon discharge the jar filently; during which the point will be illuminated with a small spark, while the upper point of the wire will throw off a pencil of rays diverging towards the upper ring of the coating.\n\nWhen a charged electric is discharged, the electric course of power passes from the positive to the negative surface.\n\nExper. 1.\u2014When a jar has been charged at the positive conductor, take a discharging rod, furnished with pointed extremities, and hold it in such a position, that the point shall be at the distance of about an inch from the knob of the jar, while the other point shall be at nearly the same distance from the outside coating. In this way the jar will be filently discharged, and if the experiment be made in the dark, a luminous star will appear at that point which is held to the knob of the jar, and a luminous pencil at the point which is held to the outer coating.\n\nIf the jar has been charged at the negative conductor, the appearance of the light at the points will be reversed; a luminous pencil will now appear at the point which is held to the knob of the jar, and a luminous star at that which is held at the outer coating.\n\nExper. 2.\u2014Remove the circular piece of wood GH, by the direction of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-UNIVERSAL\">universal</a> discharger, fig. 29, fix the wires; EF, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-RECTIFICATION\">rectification</a> FT, so that its knobs FT may be about two inches distant from one another. Then fix upon the socket of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOARD\">board</a>, from which the board was removed, a small lighted wax <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TAPER\">taper</a> so that its flame may be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> in the middle between the knobs FT. When the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> is thus disposed, if the outside of a charged jar be connected by means of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHAIN\">chain</a> or other conducting substance, with one of the wires, and the knob of the jar be brought to the other wire, it will be observed, that, on making the discharge which must pass between the knobs FT, the flame of the taper will be driven in the direction of the electric power, i.e. it will be blown towards the knob of that wire which communicates with that surface of the jar which is negatively electrified.\n\nExper. 3.\u2014Fig. 44 and 45, of Plate CLXXXIX, represent a small phial coated on the outside, about three inches\nPrinciples of Electricity.\n\nElectricity phial, cemented a brass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a>, having a hole with a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VALVE\">valve</a>, and from the cap a wire proceeds a few inches within the phial, terminating in a blunt point. When this phial is exhausted of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, a brass ball is to be screwed on the brass cap, so as to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DEFEND\">defend</a> the valve, and prevent any air from getting into the exhausted glass. This phial exhibits clearly the direction of the electric power, both in charging and discharging; for if it be held by its bottom, and its brass knob be presented to the prime conductor positively electrified, you will see that the electric power causes a pencil of rays to proceed from the wire within the phial, as represented fig. 45, and when it is discharged, a star will appear in the place of the pencil, as represented in fig. 44. But if the phial be held by the brass cap, and its bottom be touched with the prime conductor, then the point of the wire, on its inside, will appear illuminated with a star when charging, and with a pencil when discharging. If it be presented to a prime conductor electrified negatively, all these appearances, both in charging and discharging, will be reversed.\n\nThis experiment of the Leyden <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a>, as it is called, is an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVENTION\">invention</a> of the late Mr Henry.\n\nExper. 4.\u2014Fig. 46 represents an electric jar, whose exterior coating is made up of small pieces of tin-foil placed at a small distance from each other. This jar is to be charged in the usual manner, when small sparks will pass from one piece of tin-foil to the other, in various directions, forming a very pleasing spectacle. The separation of the tin-foil is the cause of this visible passage, from the outside to the table; and the experiment is similar in appearance to that mentioned. If the jar be discharged by bringing a pointed wire gradually to the knob T, the unsealed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the glass between the wire and knob will be agreeably illuminated, attended by a cracking noise of the sparks. If the jar be suddenly discharged, the whole outside will be illuminated. The jar, used in these experiments, must be very dry.\n\nExper. 5.\u2014Fig. 47 represents two jars, or Leyden phials, placed one over the other, by which various experiments may be made in order to elucidate the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-THEORY\">theory</a> of electricity. Bring the outside coating of the bottle A in contact with the prime conductor, and turn the machine till the bottle is charged; then place one ball of the discharging rod upon the coating of B, and with the other touch the knob of the jar A; an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPLOSION\">explosion</a> will follow; now place one ball of the discharger on the knob A, and bring the other ball to its coating, and you have a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SECOND\">second</a> discharge. Again, apply one ball of the discharger to the coating of B, and carry the other to the coating of A, and it will produce a third discharge. A fourth is obtained by applying the discharger from the coating of A to its knob.\n\nThe outer coating of the upper jar <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> with the inside of the under one, conveys the electric power from the conductor to the large jar which is therefore charged positively; the upper jar does not charge, but when a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> is formed from the outside of A to the inside of B, part of the electric power on the inside of A will be conveyed to the negative coating of B, and the jar will be discharged. The second explosion is occasioned by the discharge of the jar A; but as the outside of this communicates by conducting substances with the positive inside of the jar B, if the ball of the discharging rod remains for a little time after the discharge on the knob of A, part of the electric power of the inside of A will escape, and be replaced by an equal <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> on the outside from the jar B, by which means A is charged a second time; the discharge of this produces the third, and of B the fourth explosion.\n\nMr Brooke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWICH\">Norwich</a> brings the following experiments to prove that the opposite surfaces of an electric, while charging, are not necessarily in opposite states of electricity.\n\n1. Let two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-POUND\">pound</a> phials be coated with tin-foil on their outsides, and filled to convenient height with common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SHOT\">shot</a>, to serve as a coating within side, as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> as to keep a wire steady in the phials without a stopple in the mouth of them. Let each phial be furnished with a wire about the size of a goose-quill, and about ten inches long, and let each wire be sharpened a little at one end, that it may the more easily be thrust <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> into the shot, so as not to touch the glass anywhere at the mouth of the phials, yet so as to stand steadily in them. Let a metallic ball about six or seven eighths of an inch diameter be screwed on at the other end of each wire; also, let there be in readiness a third wire, fitted up like those for the phials, except that another ball of nearly the same size as the former may occasionally be screwed on at the sharpened end of it. I say, instead of suspending the phials from the prime conductor, let one of those above described be charged at the prime conductor, and then set it aside, but let it be in readiness in its charged state; then let the other be placed upon a good insulating stand, and let the third wire also be laid upon the stand, so that its ball, or some part of the wire, may touch the coating of the phial. Let the sharpened end of this wire project five or six inches over the edge of the stand; all of these being now placed <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-CLOSE\">close</a> to the edge of a table, hang a pair of cork balls on the sharpened end of the wire, and make a communication from the prime conductor to the ball on the wire on the bottle: on working the machine, the sharpened end of the wire will permit the bottle to be charged although it be insulated; and if the wire be very finely pointed, the bottle may be charged nearly as well as if it were not insulated: I say, on working the machine, the phial will charge, and the cork balls will immediately repel each other; but whilst this phial is charging, take the first phial, which having been previously charged at the same prime conductor in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and while the second phial is charging, present the ball of the first to the cork balls, and they will all repel each other. This plainly proves that the outside of the second bottle is electrified plus at the time that it is charging, the same as the inside of the first; and the inside of both the bottles will readily be allowed to charge alike, that is plus or positive.\n\n2. Let the second bottle in the last experiment be wholly discharged, and charge it again as before (the first bottle yet remaining charged); and whilst it is charging, let the ball of the first approach the cork balls contiguous with the second, and they will, as before, all repel each other; withdraw the ball of the first, and lo...\nPrinciples of long as the machine continues to charge the second bot-\ntle higher, the cork balls will continue to repel each other; but cease working the machine, and the cork balls will cease to repel each other till they touch, and will then very soon repel each other again; then let the ball in the first phial approach the cork balls, and they will now be attracted by it, instead of being repelled as above, as in the last experiment. This also plainly shows, that both sides of a Leyden phial are alike at the time it is charging; and at the same time evidently shows, that the difference of the two sides does not take place till after the bottle is charged, or till the machine ceases to charge it higher.\n\n3. In this experiment, let both of the former bottles be discharged, then let one of them be placed upon the insulating stand. Let a ball be put on over the sharpened end of the third wire, and let it be laid on the stand as before, so as to touch the coating of the phial; place the other phial on the table, so that its ball or wire may touch the ball on the third wire, or any part of the wire itself; make a communication from the ball on the wire of the first phial to the prime conductor; then, by working the machine, both bottles will soon become charged. As soon as they are pretty well charged, and before the machine ceases working, remove the second phial from the third wire; after the second phial is removed, cease working the machine as soon as possible; take the third wire, with its two balls, off the stand with the hand, and lay it on the table, so that one of its balls may touch the outside coating of the second phial; remove the first phial off the stand, and place it on the table so as to touch the ball at the other end of the third wire; then with an insulated discharging rod, make a communication from the ball in one bottle to the ball in the other. If the outside of the first phial be negative at the time it is charging, the inside of the second will be the same, and making the above communication would produce an explosion, and both bottles would be discharged; but the contrary will happen, for there will be no explosion, nor will either of the bottles be discharged, although there be a complete communication between their outsides, because the inside of them both will be positive. This is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a>, that considering one side of a phial to be positive and the other negative at the time they are charging is a mistake; as well as that, if any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NUMBER\">number</a> of bottles be suspended at the tail of each other, all the intermediate surfaces or sides do not continue so.\n\n4. Here also let the apparatus be disposed as in the last experiment, till the bottles are highly charged, then with a clean stick of glass, or the like, remove the communication between the balls of the first phial and the prime conductor, before the machine ceases working; then, with an insulated discharging rod, make a communication from the outside to the inside of the first phial; a strong explosion will take place on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXCESS\">excess</a> withinside, notwithstanding they are both positive.\n\n5. This experiment being something of a continuation of the preceding one, immediately after the last explosion takes place, discharge the prime conductor of its electricity and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-ATMOSPHERE\">atmosphere</a>; then touch the ball in the first phial with the hand, or any conducting substance that is not insulated; then will the inside coating of the first phial, which at first was so strongly positive, be in principles of the same state as the outside coating of the second, having a communication with the hand, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>, &c., with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> each other; that is negative, if anything can properly be called negative or positive that has a communication with the common stock: but a pair of cork-balls that are electrified either plus or minus will no more be attracted by either the inside coating of the first phial or the outside coating of the second, than they will by the table on which they stand, or a common <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol5.html#article-CHAIR\">chair</a> in the room, while they continue in that situation. Remove the aforeaid communication from the ball of the first phial; touch the ball in the second, as before in the first, or discharge the bottle with the discharging rod, and the ball in the first bottle will immediately become negative; with a pair of cork balls electrified negatively, approach the ball in the first phial, and they will all repel each other, or if the cork-balls be electrified positively, they will be attracted. All these circumstances together serve fully to prove what has already been said, not only that the inside of the first phial, which was so strongly positive, may be altered so as to become in the same state as the outside of the second, without discharging the phial, or any more working the machine; but that it may be fairly changed, from being positively charged to being negatively charged. If a pair of cork-balls are now hung on to the ball of the wire in this phial, by the help of a stick of glass, they will repel each other, being negatively electrified. Make a communication from the outside of the bottle to the table, and replace the communication from the prime conductor to the ball in the bottle; then, upon moderately working the machine to charge the bottle, the cork-balls will cease to repel each other till they touch, and will soon repel each other again by being electrified positively.\n\nHere the working the machine anew, plainly shows that the inside of the first bottle, which was positive, was changed to negative.\n\nThe following observations and experiments on the Milner's Leyden phial, are taken from a little <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WORK\">work</a> by Dr Thomas Milner.\n\nAn electric power communicated to any insulated substances has been named simple electrification; the Leyden phial, in order to distinguish this particular state from that of the charged phial; but it will appear whether this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTINCTION\">distinction</a> ought to be retained or not, by taking a comparative view of both these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a>. And, if the changes which an electrical power in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERAL\">general</a> is capable of making in the electrical state of any substance contained within the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPHERE\">sphere</a> of its influence, be taken into consideration, and compared with those which have been observed in the charged phial, it is apprehended that they will not appear to be different in any material circumstance.\n\n1. In the charged phial, when the inside has either kind of electricity communicated to it, the outside is found to possess a contrary power. It appears also that either kind of electricity always produces the other on any conducting substance placed within the sphere of influence. And as the same effect is also produced on electrics themselves, in the same situation, and as some portion of the air, supposing no other substance to be near enough, must be unavoidably exposed to such influence, it necessarily follows, that neither power can exist.\nWhen a plate of coated glass has been charged, and principles of the circuit between the coatings has been completed, by the mediation of a good conducting substance, no part of the coated surface is supposed to retain any part of the charge; but, according to the commonly received doctrine, the whole of it is said to be discharged; or in other words, to be brought into its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-NATURAL\">natural</a> state. This however is not really the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a>, as will evidently appear from the following experiment; the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESIGN\">design</a> of which is to show the effects produced by charging and discharging a plate of glass.\n\nLet the middle of a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CROWN\">crown</a> window glass, seven inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SQUARE\">square</a>, be placed between two circular plates of brass, about the 16th part of an inch thick, and five inches in diameter. In order to enable these plates to retain a greater degree of power, it will be proper to terminate each of them with a round bead the third part of an inch thick; and the whole of the bead should be formed on one side of the plate, that the other side may remain quite flat, and apply well to the surface of the glass. Let the whole be inflated about four inches above the table, and in a horizontal position, by fastening one end of a cylindrical piece of some good insulating substance to the middle of the under plate, the other end of it being fixed in any convenient stand. Let a like insulating item be fastened to the middle of the upper plate. Let a brass chain, which may easily be removed, reach from the under plate to the table. In the last place <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol1.html#article-BEND\">bend</a> a piece of brass wire into such a shape, that it may stand perpendicularly on the upper plate; and let the upper extremity of this wire be formed into a hook, that it may be removed at any time by the assistance of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> string, without destroying the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFLATION\">inflation</a> of the plate.\n\nThe glass being thus coated with metal on both sides, and having also a proper communication with the table, will admit of being charged; and both coatings may be separated from the glass, and examined apart, without destroying the inflation of either: for the upper coating may be separated by the means of its own proper stem; and the under coating may be separated by taking hold of the corners of the glass, and lifting the glass itself. As glass readily attracts moisture from the atmosphere, it will therefore be necessary to warm it in the beginning, and to repeat it several times in the course of the experiment, unless the air should be very dry.\n\nExcite a smooth glass tube, of the common size, by rubbing it with silk, and apply it repeatedly to the bent wire, until the glass be well charged. Then remove the chain, which reaches from the lower plate to the table, and also the charging wire from the upper plate, by laying hold of its hook with a silk string. It necessarily follows, from considering the quality of the power employed in the present case, that the upper surface of the glass, together with the upper coating, must be electrified positively; and that the under surface and coating must be electrified negatively; but as it is designed in this experiment to examine the powers of charged glass, that no <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VIRTUE\">virtue</a> may be imputed to the glass but what really belongs to it, let both coatings be separated from it; and after they have been brought to their natural state, by touching them with a conducting body not inflated, let the glass be replaced between them; and whatever effects may be now produced must be ascribed solely\nPrinciples of solely to the powers of the charged glass. On bringing a finger near the upper coating, a small electrical spark will appear between that coating and the finger, attended with a snapping noise. Apply a finger in the same manner to the under coating, and the same thing will happen. This effect cannot be produced twice, by two succeeding applications to the same coating; but it may be repeated several hundred times over, in a favourable state of the atmosphere, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ALTERNATE\">alternate</a> applications to the two coatings; and the powers of the glass will be thus gradually weakened.\n\nThis part of the experiment may be explained, by observing that the contrary electricities have a natural tendency to produce and to preserve each other, on the opposite sides of a plate of glass; and therefore, the increase or decrease of power, on the other side: and as in charging a plate of glass positively, no gradual addition of electric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MATTER\">matter</a> can be made to the upper surface, without a proper conveyance for a proportionate part to pass away from the lower surface; so in this method of uncharging it, the electric power cannot be gradually taken away from the upper surface, without adding a proportionate part to the under surface: one operation is the reverse of the other, and so are the effects; one case being attended with an increase and the other with a decrease of power.\n\nLet the glass be again fully charged, and after bringing both coatings to their natural state, as before, let the glass be replaced between them; and on touching the upper coating with a finger, and then separating it from the upper and positive surface of the glass by the insulating item, this coating will acquire a weak negative power, which will be sufficient to produce a small spark while the glass is in full force, though after the power of the glass has been reduced, it will give little or no spark: but in both cases, on touching the coatings alternately two or three times, the negative power of this coating, when separated from the positive surface of the glass, will be considerably increased, as to produce strong negative sparks.\u2014This effect may now be repeated several times, by only touching the upper coating, but the sparks will grow weaker every time; and they may be restored again to nearly their former strength, by alternate applications to both coatings, as before. The same things will also happen to the under coating, in the same circumstances; but with this difference, that the power of the under coating, on being separated from the under and negative surface of the glass will be positive. And thus a long succession of both positive and negative sparks may be produced in favourable <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEATHER\">weather</a>, or at any time by keeping the glass moderately warm.\n\nIt appears from this part of the experiment, that each of the surfaces of the charged glass has a power of producing a contrary electricity in the coating in contact with it, by a momentary interruption of the insulation. It necessarily follows, in producing these effects, that more electrical matter must have passed away from the upper coating, at the time of touching it, than the same coating could receive from the upper surface of the glass; and therefore the upper coating, by losing some of its natural quantity, will be negatively electrified; and also that more electric matter must have been added to the under coating at the time of touching it, than the under surface of the glass could receive from it; and therefore the under coating, by receiving some addition to its natural quantity, will be positively electrified. It appears further, that the greatest degree of this influential power, which may be consistent with the circumstances of the case, will be produced in either coating by taking care at the same time to bring the opposite coating into a like state of influential electricity; and thus it is evident, that the influential powers of the two coatings have the same relation to each other, as the contrary powers of the glass itself, and will therefore always increase or decrease together.\n\nThe glass being again well charged, as at first, let a brass wire bent in the form of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STAPLE\">staple</a> be brought into contact with the upper and lower coating at the same time. By this the common discharge will be made; but the equilibrium of the coated glass will be only restored in part; for a considerable degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a> will happen at the same time between the upper coating and the glass, which has frequently been strong enough to lift a piece of plate glass weighing ten ounces. Neither coating will now show the least external sign of electricity while it is in contact with the glass: but on separating either of them from it, if care be taken to preserve their insulations, the upper coating will be strongly electrified negatively, and the under coating will be strongly electrified positively. Let then both coatings be brought to their natural state, by touching them when separated from the glass, with a conducting body not insulated, and let the glass be replaced between them as before. In this state of things, on touching the upper coating only, and separating it from the glass, it will not be capable of giving any spark; but on touching the coatings alternately five or six times, it will then give a weak spark; and this may now be repeated several times by only touching the upper coating: but on a second <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of the bent wire to both coatings at the same time, a second discharge may be perceived, though much weaker than the first, and the coatings will be again brought into the same electrical state as immediately after the first discharge. This may frequently be repeated; and a considerable number of strong negative sparks may be taken from the coating when it is separated from the positive surface of the glass. If the glass in replacing it between the two plates be turned upside down, the electrical powers of both coatings will be changed by the next application of the discharging wire to complete the circuit; and a succession of strong positive sparks may be taken from the coating when it is separated from the negative surface of the glass.\n\nIt appears from this part of the experiment, that the coated part of the charged glass was not brought into its natural state by completing the circuit between the coatings, but that it still retained a degree of permanent electricity; that the powers of both coatings were actually changed at the time of the first discharge; and that a succession of the same powers may be produced in the coatings, without renewing the least application of electricity to the glass itself.\n\nThe whole quantity of electric power added to the glass in charging it, is evidently distinguished into two parts in this experiment. The first part, which is by far the most considerable, appears to have been readily communicated from one surface of the glass to the other.\nPrinciples of other, along the bent wire, when it was first brought into contact with both coatings at the same time. The second part of the charge appears to be more permanent, and remains still united with the glass, notwithstanding the circuit has been completed (r). This permanent electricity, as well as the other, must be positive on the upper surface, and negative on the lower surface: because, in the present experiment, the charge was given by a smooth glass tube excited with a silk rubber. Now, the influence of the opposite and permanent powers on the different sides of the glass (each side having a tendency to bring the coating in contact with it into a state of electricity contrary to its own) must affect each other, in causing part of the electric matter naturally belonging to the upper coating to pass away from it to the under coating, along the discharging wire, and at the same time the discharge to pass the same way. The upper coating, therefore, by losing some part of its natural quantity, must be negatively electrified; and the under coating, by receiving an addition to its natural quantity, must be positively electrified. The whole quantity of electric matter, which the influence of the permanent electricity of the glass is capable of taking from one coating and of adding to the other, bears but a small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> to the whole charge: and therefore the second and every subsequent discharge must be considerably weaker than the first.\n\nIt appears from several of the preceding experiments, that a considerable degree of influential power may be produced at some distance by an electric in full force; and therefore a small excited body of a cylindrical shape was sufficient to answer that purpose: but when the excited electric has been so far weakened that it cannot communicate its own power, nor produce this influential power in any body, unless it be brought very near or in contact with it, bodies of a cylindrical form must then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACT\">act</a> to great disadvantage, and a small degree of power only can be produced; because the strength of the influential electricity in this case will be in proportion to the surfaces of the electric and conducting bodies, which are brought near together, or in contact with each other; and therefore a plate of glass in the same circumstances, whether its permanent power be derived from excitation or communication, is enabled from its shape to produce a considerable degree of the influential powers in the coatings in contact with it.\n\nIt has been very properly recommended to use a particular kind of rubber, and to attend to the state of it, in order to excite glass well; but it will not be necessary to pay the least regard to these circumstances in the following experiments, in which a method will be shown of charging a small phial and a plate of glass at the same time, by a gradual <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a> of power; that power being entirely derived from the glass itself, and with no other degree or kind of friction than is necessarily connected with the form of the experiment.\n\nPlace a circle of tin-foil five inches in diameter on the table, between a soft piece of baize and the middle of the same plate of glass that was used in the last experiment, which will thus be coated on the under side: and in order to preserve a proper communication with this coating, let a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FILLET\">fillet</a> of tin-foil reach from it beyond the extremity of the glass. The same insulated metal cover is to be used for the upper coating as before. Let a thin ounce phial of glass be filled with brass filings, and coated with tin-foil on the outside to about one inch from the top. Let a large brass wire, the fifth part of an inch in diameter, pass through the cork of the phial into the filings, about an inch of it being left above the cork, and let the upper extremity of this wire be well rounded. This experiment requires, that the whole <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSTRUCTION\">construction</a> should be well warmed at first; and it will be necessary to repeat it at proper intervals, unless the atmosphere should be very dry.\n\nTaking hold of the wire of the phial with one hand, let it be placed on the upper surface of the glass, and its bottom carried in contact over the middle of the upper surface, as far as the tin-foil coating reaches on the under side: and during this part of the operation, a finger of the other hand must be kept in contact with the fillet of tin-foil. Then lifting the phial by the wire with one hand, let it be placed on the insulated metal cover, suspended in the air with the other hand; and after shifting the hand from the wire to the coating, let the bottom of the phial be placed on the end of the tin-foil fillet. Place the insulated metal cover on the middle of the glass, and touch it with a finger of one hand, while the other hand touches the tin-foil fillet. Now lift the insulated cover by its stem, and bring the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-HEAD\">head</a> of the cover in contact with the wire of the phial, and a very small spark of light will appear between them. Let this be repeated in the same manner about fifteen times, taking care to preserve a proper communication between the coating and the floor. Then taking hold of the phial by the coating, let it be replaced on the insulated cover while it is suspended in the air; and after shifting the hand from the coating to the wire, let it be again placed on the middle of the glass: and let the bottom be again carried in contact over the middle of the glass, holding the wire in one hand, while the other has a proper communication with the tin-foil coating. Let the phial be again returned to the tin-foil fillet as before, and let the insulated cover be applied repeatedly to the wire, immediately after every separation from the glass; and a brighter spark, together with a weak snapping, will now attend each application, if it be carefully observed to touch the cover with one hand before every separation, while the other hand rests on the fillet of tin-foil. By proceeding in this manner, after the third application of the phial to the glass, a very\n\n(r) Some new terms seem to be wanted in order to express with precision the different parts of the charge. And if that part of it which cannot be destroyed by completing the circuit, should be called the permanent part of the charge, or more simply the charge; then might the other part, or that which may be destroyed by completing the circuit, be named the firecharge.\nPrinciples of very weak shock will be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> in those fingers which are used in completing the circuit of the glass; and after repeating two <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-ROUNDS\">rounds</a> more in the manner before mentioned, the phial will be fully charged. By applying the coating of the phial when it is in full force to the upper surface as before, the glass plate will get the greatest power it is thus capable of receiving, and will then give a shock as <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a> as the elbows. After this, on attempting to lift the insulated cover, the glass itself will generally be lifted at the same time, with the tin-foil coating adhering to the under surface; but by continuing the separations of the cover from the glass, a succession of strong negative sparks may be produced by the influence of the upper surface; and by turning the glass over, and leaving the tin-foil coating on the baize, a succession of strong positive sparks may be produced by the influence of the other side.\n\nThis experiment may be performed more steadily by placing the glass, together with the tin-foil coating and baize, on a plate of metal about one-tenth of an inch thick, and of the same square as the glass. The whole may be fastened together by two small hoidsails placed at the opposite corners, which will prevent the glass from being lifted. This plate of metal will be useful in another view; for after it has been sufficiently warmed, by retaining <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HEAT\">heat</a> well, it will help to keep the glass dry, and consequently fit for use so much the longer. But when it shall be required to show the contrary powers of the opposite sides of the glass, it will be more convenient not to fasten the parts together, and the whole may be kept sufficiently steady, by the operator's keeping down one corner of the glass with a finger, and by placing a proper <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WEIGHT\">weight</a> on the opposite corner.\n\nThe bottom of the phial cannot be carried in contact over the glass without producing some little degree of friction; from which the power in this experiment is originally derived. The cover will appear on <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXAMINATION\">examination</a> to be electrified negatively after every separation from the glass; but as it was touched in completing the circuit between the coatings before every separation, it necessarily follows, that the cover can have only an influential electricity, and consequently that the permanent power of the upper surface of the glass must be positive. The negative power of the cover is communicated to the wire of the phial, by which the inside is electrified negatively and the outside positively; and both these powers will increase with every application, because the circumstances of the phial are favourable to its charging. The phial must be insulated every time it is required to shift the hand from the wire to the coating, or from the coating to the wire; for without this precaution the phial would be discharged. By applying the outside of the phial to the upper surface of the glass, in the manner above mentioned, the phial will be partly discharged on the surface; and though it must be therefore weakened, the power of the glass will be increased, and consequently enabled to produce a proportionally stronger effect on the brass cover, which by the next round of applications will give the phial a stronger charge than it had before. And thus a very small degree of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-ORIGINAL\">original</a> power is first <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GENERATED\">generated</a>, and then employed in forming two different accumulations: and by making each of these subservient to the increase of the other, the phial is at last fully charged, and the glass plate acquires such a degree of charge, as to give a pretty smart shock; and after, it remains capable, by the influence of its permanent powers, of producing a succession of positive and negative sparks on the opposite surfaces.\n\nThe contrary charge may be given to the phial by taking hold of the coating, and carrying the wire in contact over the middle of the upper surface of the glass, and by applying the power of the insulated cover to the coating; for if the operation be conducted in every other respect in the same manner as before, then will the inside be electrified positively, and the outside negatively. The powers of the glass plate will be the same as they were in the former case.\n\nAfter the phial has been fully charged negatively, by the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol18.html#article-PROCESS\">process</a> of the last experiment, let it be insulated; and taking hold of the wire, let the bottom be held uppermost, and let the hand which holds it rest on the fillet of tin-foil. Apply the insulated cover to the glass, and after touching it with a finger of the other hand, separate it from the glass; and on bringing it towards the coating of the phial, a strong spark will pass between them. After repeating this between 20 and 30 times, the powers of the phial will be destroyed; and by continuing the same operation, they will be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a>; for the inside will be at last fully charged positively, and the outside negatively.\n\nThe same effect may be produced by turning the glass over, and by repeatedly applying the influential electricity, produced on that side, to the wire of the phial.\n\nWhen the phial has been fully charged negatively, as in the last experiment, take hold of the coating of the phial with one hand, and while the other hand rests on the tin foil fillet, apply the wire to the middle of the upper surface of the glass, as far as the tin-foil coating extends on the other side. By this the powers of the glass plate will be changed.\n\nAnother, and perhaps a better method of applying the phial, is to place the insulated cover on the surface of the glass, and then holding the phial by the coating in one hand, to apply the wire to the cover, while the other hand touches the fillet of tin-foil; by which a shock will be given, and the same change of powers will be produced in an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-INSTANT\">instant</a>, which before took up some little time. On lifting the insulated cover by its stem immediately after the shock, it will be negative, or have the same power as the inside of the phial; but on replacing the cover, and completing the circuit of the glass plate, the surcharge will be destroyed; another shock will be felt; and the power of the cover, after the next separation, will be positive, or contrary to that of the inside of the phial. Apply this positive power to the wire of the phial as before; and after 15 applications, the powers of the phial will be destroyed; and by still proceeding in the same manner, the powers of the phial will be changed, and the inside will be fully charged positively, and the outside negatively, by 60 applications.\n\nThese effects may also be produced by a single application of the coating of the phial to the other side of the glass plate; and by repeated applications of the influential electricity, produced on the same side, to the coating of the phial.\n\nIf it were simply the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OBJECT\">object</a> in this experiment to change\nPrinciples of change the powers of the phial, the operation might then be considerably shortened, by completing the circuit of the phial, and consequently destroying the whole by expert furlage; but it was intended to show what effects might be produced, by opposing the contrary powers to each other; and by doing this it appears that either side of the glass plate can destroy the powers of the phial, and give it a contrary charge; that either side of the phial can also change the powers of the glass plate; and that the powers of the glass plate, thus inverted, can again destroy the powers of the phial, and give it a full charge of the contrary electricity.\n\nHere it may be observed, that, in some cases, the quality of the power may be determined by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OBSERVATION\">observation</a> alone. When the phial employed in the two last experiments has been fully charged, it may be known whether the inside be positive or negative from the light which appears at the wire, or from the hissing noise which attends it: for when the phial has been fully charged positively, if the room be sufficiently darkened, a bright luminous appearance may be seen, diverging in separate rays to the distance of an inch, attended with an interrupted hissing noise; and both the light and the noise continue a very short time. But when the phial is fully charged negatively, a weaker and more uniform light appears, which does not extend itself more than the sixth part of an inch, and is attended with a closer and more uniform hissing; and this noise and light always continue longer than the former. Even positive and negative sparks, passing between the insulated cover and a finger, may be distinguished from each other: for the positive sparks are more divided, give less light, make a weaker snapping noise, and affect the finger less sensibly than the negative.\n\nThe strongest sparks which can be produced in these experiments, are those that pass between the coating of the phial and the insulated cover, when they possess the contrary powers; but they will be more particularly vigorous if the coating be positive, and the insulated cover negative.\n\n**Chap. VI. Miscellaneous Experiments with charged Electrics.**\n\nSig. Cigna made some curious experiments on the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ADHESION\">adhesion</a> of electrified plates of glass. He laid two of these plates well dried, one upon the other as one piece, the lowermost of them being coated on the outside; and, when they were insulated, he alternately rubbed the uppermost plate with one hand, and took a spark from the coating of the lower with the other till they were charged; when the coating and both the plates adhered firmly together. Giving a coating to the other side, and making a communication between the two coatings, the usual explosion was produced. But, though the united electric was thus discharged, the plate still cohered, and though no sign of electricity appeared while they were united, they were, when separated, found possessed of opposite states of electricity.\n\nIf the two plates were separated before they were discharged, and the coating of each was touched, a spark came from each, and when they were again placed together, they cohered as before, but were not capable of giving a flock.\n\nIf plates of glass, thus coated and electrified, be separated in the dark, flashes of light will be perceived between them. By laying the plates together again, and again separating them successively, the appearance of these luminous flashes may be repeated several times, but always in a weaker degree than the first.\n\nMr Symmer made several experiments of the same kind before Sig. Cigna. He found that when the two plates were coated only on one side, they were charged as one plate, and the uncoated sides adhered together; but when they were coated each on both sides, they became charged distinctly from each other, and did not adhere.\n\nMr Henley, in describing an experiment of this kind, makes the following observation. \"Crown glass, that is, the glass commonly used for sash-windows, though so much thinner, succeeds in this experiment as well as the plate-glass; but what is very remarkable, the Dutch plates, when treated in the same manner, have each a positive and a negative surface, and the electricity of both surfaces of both plates is exchanged for the contrary electricity in the discharge. If a clean, dry, uncoated plate of looking-glass be placed between the coated looking-glass plates, or between the plates of crown-glass, it appears after charging, to be negatively electrified on both sides; but if it be placed between the Dutch plates it acquires, like them, a positive electricity on one surface, and a negative electricity on the other.\"\n\nA very curious and elegant experiment on the Leyden phial was made by Professor Richman of Petersburgh, whose unfortunate <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol5.html#article-DEATH\">death</a> will be hereafter related.\n\nHe coated both sides of a pane of glass, within two or three inches of the edge, and fastened <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol13.html#article-LINEN\">linen</a> threads to the upper part of the coating, on both sides; which, when the plate was not charged, hung down in contact with the coating: but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SETTING\">setting</a> the plate upright and charging it, he observed, that when neither of the sides was touched by his finger, or any other conductor communicating with the earth, both the threads were repelled from the coating, and stood at an equal distance from it; but when he brought his finger or any other conductor to one of the sides, the thread hanging to that side fell nearer to the coating, while the thread on the opposite side receded as much; and that when his finger was brought into contact with one of the sides, the thread on that side fell into contact with it likewise, while the thread on the opposite side receded twice the distance at which it hung originally; so that the two threads always hung so as to make the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FAME\">fame</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> with one another.\n\nOne of the most diverting experiments with charged electrics, is that which Dr Franklin calls the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MAGIC\">Magic</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PICTURE\">Picture</a>, and which he describes in the following manner. Having a large mezzotinto print (supposed of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-KING\">king</a>), with a frame and glass; take out the print and cut a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PANEL\">panel</a> out of it, near two inches distant from the frame all round. If the cut be through the picture, it is not the worse. With thin paste or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol5.html#article-GUM\">gum</a>-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WATER\">water</a>, fix the board that is cut off on the inside of the glass, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol9.html#article-PRESSING\">pressing</a> it smooth and close, then fill up the vacancy by gilding.\nPrinciples of gilding the glass well with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol9.html#article-GOLD\">gold</a> or brass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEAF\">leaf</a>. Gild Electricity likewise the inner edge of the back of the frame all round, except the top part, and form a communication between that gilding and the gilding behind the glass; then put in the board and that side is finished. Turn up the glass, and gild the foreside exactly over the back gilding; and when it is dry, cover it, by pasting on the panel of the picture that has been cut out, observing to bring the correspondent parts of the board and picture together, by which the picture will appear of a piece as at first, only part is behind the glass, and part is before. Lastly, hold the picture horizontally by the top, and place a little moveable gilt crown on the king's head.\n\nIf now the picture be moderately electrified, and another <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> take hold of the frame with one hand, so that his fingers touch its inside gilding, and with the other hand endeavour to take off the crown, he will receive a severe shock, and fail in the attempt. The operator who, to prevent it from falling holds the picture by the upper end, where the inside of the frame is not gilt, feels nothing of the shock, and may touch the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FACE\">face</a> of the picture with impunity, which he pretends to be a test of his loyalty. If a ring of persons take a shock among them, the experiment is called the conspirators*.\n\nOn the same principle that the wires of phials charged differently, will attract and repel differently, is made an electrical wheel, which, Dr Franklin says, turns with considerable strength, and of which he gives the following <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">description</a>. A small upright <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SHAFT\">shaft</a> of wood passes at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol1.html#article-ANGLES\">angles</a> through a thin round board, of about twelve inches diameter, and turns on a sharp point of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, fixed in the lower end; while a strong wire in the upper end, passing through a small hole in a thin brass plate, keeps the shaft truly vertical. About thirty radii of equal length, made of soft-glass, cut in narrow lips, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-ISSUE\">issue</a> horizontally from the circumference of the board; the ends most distant from the centre, being about four inches apart. On the end of every one a brass thimble is fixed.\n\nIf now the wire of a bottle electrified in the common way, be brought near the circumference of this wheel, it will attract the nearest thimble, and so put the wheel in motion. That thimble, in passing by, receives a spark, and thereby being electrified is repelled, and so driven forwards; while a second being attracted, approaches the wire, receives a spark, and is driven after the first; and so on till the wheel has gone once round; when the thimbles before electrified <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPROACHING\">approaching</a> the wire, instead of being attracted as they were at first, are repelled, and the motion presently ceases.\n\nBut if another bottle which had been charged through the coating, be placed near the same wheel, its wire will attract the thimble repelled by the first, and thereby double the force that carries the wheel round; and not only taking out the electric power that had been communicated by the thimbles to the first bottle, but even depriving them of their natural quantity, instead of being repelled when they come again towards the first bottle, they are more strongly attracted; so that the wheel mends its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-PACE\">pace</a>, till it goes with great rapidity, 12 or 15 rounds in a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a>, and with such strength, that the weight of 100 Spanish, with which it was once loaded, did not seem in the least to retard its motion. This is called an electrical <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-JACK\">jack</a>, and if a large bottle of wine were spilt on the upper shaft, it would be carried round before a fire, with a motion fit for roadding.\n\nBut this wheel, like those driven by wind, moves by a foreign force, viz. that communicated to it by the bottles.\n\nThe self-moving wheel, though constructed on the same principles, appears more surprising. It is made of a thin round plate of window glass, seventeen inches in diameter, well gilt on both sides, to within two inches of the circumference. Two small hemispheres of wood are then fixed with cement, to the middle of the upper and under sides, centrally opposite, and in each of them a thick strong wire, eight or ten inches long, together making the axis of the wheel. It turns horizontally on a point at the lower end of its axis, which rests on a bit of brass cemented within a glass <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol18.html#article-SALT\">salt</a> cellar. The upper end of its axis passes through a hole in a thin brass plate, cemented to a long and strong piece of glass; which keeps it fix or eight inches distant from any non-electric, and has a small ball of wax or metal on its top.\n\nIn a circle on the table which supports the wheel, are fixed twelve small <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PILLARS\">pillars</a> of glass, at about eleven inches distance, with a thimble on the top of each. On the edge of the wheel is a small leaden bullet, communicating by a wire with the upper surface of the wheel; and about six inches from it, is another bullet, communicating, in like manner, with the under surface. When the wheel is to be charged by the upper surface, a communication must be made from the under surface with the table.\n\nWhen it is well charged it begins to move. The bullet nearest to a pillar moves toward the thimble on that pillar, and passing by, electrifies it, and then pushes itself from it. The succeeding bullet, which communicates with the other surface of the glass, more strongly attracts that thimble, on account of its being electrified before by the other bullet, and thus the wheel increases its motion, till the resistance of the air regulates it. It will go half an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOUR\">hour</a>, and make one minute with another, twenty turns in a minute, which is six hundred turns in the whole, the bullet of the upper surface giving in each turn, twelve sparks to the thimbles, which makes seven thousand two hundred sparks, and the bullet of the under surface receiving as many from the thimble, these bullets moving in the time near two thousand five hundred feet. The thimbles are well fixed, and in so exact a circle, that the bullets may pass within a very small distance of each of them.\n\nIf instead of two bullets you put eight, four communicating with the upper surface, and four with the under surface, placed alternately, (which eight at about six inches distance, complete the circumference) the force and swiftness will be greatly increased, the wheel making fifty turns in a minute, but then it will not continue moving so long.\n\nThese <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol20.html#article-WHEELS\">wheels</a> may be applied perhaps to the ringing chimes, and moving light made orreries*.\n\nMr Cavalli gives the following description of an instrument which he calls the self-charging Leyden phial.\n\nTake a glass tube of about eighteen inches in length, and an inch, or an inch and a half, in diameter. It is immaterial\nPrinciples of Electricity illustrated by experiment.\n\nCoat the inside of it with tin-foil, but only from one open extremity of it about as far as its middle; the other part, which remains uncoated, we shall call the naked part of the instrument. Put a cork into the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APERTURE\">aperture</a> of the coated end, and let a knopped wire pass through the cork, and come in contact with the coating. The instrument being thus prepared, hold it in one hand by the naked part, and with the other hand clean and dry-rub the outside of the coated part of the tube; but after every three or four strokes you must remove the rubbing hand, and must touch the knob of the wire, and in so doing a little spark will be drawn from it. By this means the coated end of the tube will gradually acquire a charge, which may be increased to a considerable degree. If then you grasp the outside of the coated end of the tube with one hand, and touch the knob of the wire with the other hand, you will obtain a shock, &c.\n\nIn this experiment the coated part of the tube answers the double office of electrical machine and of Leyden phial; the naked part of it being only a sort of handle to hold the instrument by. The friction on the outside of the tube accumulates a quantity of positive electricity upon it, and this electricity forces out of the inside a quantity of electricity also positive. Then by taking the spark from the knob, this inside electricity, which is by the coating communicated to the knob through the wire, is removed, consequently the inside remains undercharged or negative, and of course the positive electricity of the outside comes closer to the surface of the glass, and begins to form the charge. By farther rubbing and taking the spark from the knob this charge is increased, &c.\n\nInstead of a tube, this instrument may be constructed with a pane of glass, in which case it will be rather simpler, but it cannot be managed so easily, nor of course can it be charged so high as the tube. A piece of tin-foil must be pasted in the middle of only one surface of the pane, leaving about two inches and a half or three inches of uncoated glass all round. This done, hold the glass by a corner, with the coated side from you, and with the other hand rub its uncoated side, and take the spark from the tin-foil alternately, until you think that the glass may be sufficiently charged; then lay the glass with its uncoated side flat upon one hand, and on turning the tin-foil with the other hand you will receive the shock.\n\n**<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CHAPTER\">Chapter</a> VII. Of the chemical effects of the Electric Spark.**\n\n**Exper. 1.\u2014To fire rosin.** Wrap some cotton <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WOOL\">wool</a>, containing as much powdered rosin as it will hold, about one of the knobs of a discharging rod. Then having charged a Leyden jar, apply the naked knob of the rod to the external coating, and the knob enveloped by the cotton to the ball of the wire. The act of discharging the jar will set fire to the rosin.\n\nA piece of phosphorus or camphor wrapped in cotton wool, and used in the same way, will be much more easily inflamed.\n\n**Exper. 2.\u2014To fire spirits.** Hang a small ball with a stem to the prime conductor, so that the ball may project below the conductor. Then warm a little ardent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a>, by holding it a short time over a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a> in a metallic spoon; hold the spoon about an inch below the ball, and let the machine in motion. A spark will soon issue from the ball and set fire to the spirits.\n\nThis experiment succeeds in the very same manner, whether the conductor is electrified positively or negatively, i.e., whether the spark be made to come from the conductor or from the spoon; it being only in consequence of the rapid motion of the spark that the spirits are kindled.\n\nIt will perhaps scarce necessary to remark, that the more inflammable the spirits are, the more proper they will be for this experiment, as a smaller spark will be sufficient to inflame them; therefore rectified spirit of wine is better than common proof spirit, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-ETHER\">ether</a> is better than either.\n\nThis experiment may be varied different ways, and may be rendered very agreeable to a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPANY\">company</a> of spectators. A person, for instance, standing upon an electric stool, and communicating with the prime conductor, may hold the spoon with the spirits in his hand, and another person, standing upon the floor, may set the spirits on fire, by bringing his finger within a small distance of it. Instead of his finger, he may fire the spirits with a piece of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-ICE\">ice</a>; when the experiment will seem much more surprising. If the spoon is held by the person standing upon the floor, and the insulated person brings some conducting substance over the surface of the spirit, the experiment succeeds as well.\n\nMr Winckler says, that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OIL\">oil</a>, pitch, and sealing-wax, might be lighted by electric sparks, provided those substances were first heated to a degree next to kindling. To these it must be added, that Mr Graham fired the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SMOKE\">smoke</a> of a candle just blown out, and lighted it again; and that Mr Boze fired <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol10.html#article-GUNPOWDER\">gunpowder</a>, melting it in a spoon, and fired the vapour that rose from it.\n\nThis experiment will succeed better with a charged jar.\n\n**Exper. 3.\u2014To fire hydrogenous <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GAS\">gas</a>.** Provide a bottle of strong glass with two necks, as a, fig. 48. Let a hydrogenous gas be fitted to each neck c, d; one of which is furnished with a cock, and through the other e, CLXXXIX. a glass tube s is passed, containing a wire projecting beyond the tube at one end, which is terminated by a knob n, while the other passing within the bottle turns round so as to come within an inch of the brass through which the glass tube passes. The bottle being thus prepared, fill it with water, and throw up into it equal parts of hydrogen gas and common air, or three parts of hydrogen and one of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol16.html#article-OXYGEN\">oxygen</a> gas; fix in the cork, and shake the bottle so as to mix the gases well together. Then bring the knob n, near the knob of a charged jar, or a ball of the prime conductor, and the hydrogen will be inflamed with a loud report.\n\nIn general the cork will be forced out by the explosion; but if this should not be the case, an opportunity is afforded of proving that the gases have disappeared, and water has been produced by the experiment. On taking out the cork below the surface of water, the water will rush in, and fill the bottle, thus shewing that the gases have disappeared.\n\nTo prove the production of water, it is necessary that the bottle should have been filled with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> before","sp":290,"ep":301},{"h":"THEY MADE SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS TO GIVE THE ELECTRIC SHOCK BY","t":"y made several experiments to give the electric shock by means of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-AIR\">air</a>, and at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LENGTH\">length</a> succeeded by suspending <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LARGE\">large</a> boards of wood covered with tin with the flat sides <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PARALLEL\">parallel</a> to one another, and at some inches asunder; for they found, that upon electrifying one of the boards positively, the other was always <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NEGATIVE\">negative</a>. But the discovery was made complete and indubitable by a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERSON\">person</a> touching one of the plates with one <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-HAND\">hand</a>, and bringing his other hand to the other plate; for he then received a shock through his body, exactly like that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LEYDEN\">Leyden</a> experiment.\n\nWith this plate of air, they made a variety of curious experiments. The two metal plates, being in opposite <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-STATES\">states</a>, strongly attracted each other, and would have rushed together, if they had not been kept asunder by strings. Sometimes the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELECTRICITY\">electricity</a> of both would be discharged by a strong spark between them, as when a pane of glass bursts with too <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-GREAT\">great</a> a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGE\">charge</a>. A finger put between them promoted the discharge, and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol4.html#article-FELT\">felt</a> the shock. If an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-EMINENCE\">eminence</a> was made <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-ON\">on</a> either of the plates, the self discharge would always be made through it, and a pointed body fixed upon either of them prevented their being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CHARGED\">charged</a> at all.*\n\nAt the end of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol21.html#article-TABLE\">table</a> of conductors given in page 646, it was observed that a Torricellian <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VACUUM\">vacuum</a> was a non-conductor of electricity. Some experiments were made by Mr Walib, which proved the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERFECT\">perfect</a> impermeability of a vacuum by the electric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1823/vol12.html#article-LIGHT\">light</a>. But the most complete experiments on this subject are those of Mr W. Morgan and Mr Cavallo. The following are Mr Morgan's experiments.\n\nA mercurial gage B, fig. 83, about 15 inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LONG\">long</a>, Mr Morgan carefully and accurately boiled, till every particle of air was expelled from the inside, was coated with tin-foil, five inches <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DOWN\">down</a> from its sealed end (A), and being <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INVERTED\">inverted</a> into <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MERCURY\">mercury</a> through a perforation D, in the power of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol4.html#article-BRASS\">brass</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol6.html#article-CAP\">cap</a> E, which covered the mouth of the cistern perfect vacuum H; the whole was cemented together, and the air was exhausted from the inside of the cistern through a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VALVE\">valve</a> C, in the brass cap E <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-JUST\">just</a> mentioned; which producing a perfect vacuum in the gage B, afforded an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INSTRUMENT\">instrument</a> peculiarly <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WELL\">well</a> adapted for experiments of this kind. Things being thus adjusted, a small wire, F, having been previously fixed on the inside of the cistern, to form a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATION\">communication</a> between the brass cap E, and the mercury G, into which the gage was inverted; the coated end A was applied to the conductor of an electrical machine; and, notwithstanding every effort, neither the smallest ray of light, nor the slightest charge, could ever be procured in this exhausted gage. It is well known, that if a glass tube be exhausted by an air-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PUMP\">pump</a>, and coated on the outside, both light and charge may very readily be procured. If the mercury in the gage be imperfectly boiled, the experiment <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WILL\">will</a> not succeed; but the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COLOUR\">colour</a> of the electric light, which, in air rarefied by an exhausteur, is always violet <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-OR\">or</a> purple, appears in this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-CASE\">case</a> of a beautiful green; and what is very curious, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DEGREE\">degree</a> of the air's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RAREFACTION\">rarefaction</a> may be nearly determined by this means. There have been instances known, in a course of experiments, where a small particle of air having found its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WAY\">way</a> into the tube B, the electric light became visible, and as usual of a green colour; but the charge being often repeated, the gage has at length cracked at its sealed end, and in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONSEQUENCE\">consequence</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXTERNAL\">external</a> air, by being admitted into the inside, has gradually produced a change in the electric light, from green to blue, from blue to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INDIGO\">indigo</a>, and so on to violet and purple, till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-MEDIUM\">medium</a> has at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LAST\">last</a> become so dense, as no longer to be a conductor of electricity. There can be little doubt, from the above experiments, of the non-conducting power of a perfect vacuum; and this fact is still more strongly confirmed by the phenomena which appear upon the admission of a very <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MINUTE\">minute</a> particle of air into the inside of the gage. In this case, the whole becomes immediately <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LUMINOUS\">luminous</a>, upon the slightest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-APPLICATION\">application</a> of electricity, and a charge takes <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLACE\">place</a>, which continues to grow more and more powerful, in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTION\">proportion</a> as fresh air is admitted, till the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol7.html#article-DENSITY\">density</a> of the conducting medium arrives at its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol14.html#article-MAXIMUM\">maximum</a>, which it always does when the colour of the electric light is indigo or violet. Under these circumstances, the charge may be so far increased, as frequently to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol5.html#article-BREAK\">break</a> the glass. In some tubes, which have not been completely boiled, they will not conduct the electric fluid, when the mercury is fallen very low in them; yet upon letting in air into the cistern H, so that the mercury shall rise in the gage B, the electricity, which was before latent in the inside, shall now become visible, and as the mercury continues to rise, and of consequence the medium is rendered less rare, the light shall grow...\nElectricity grows more and more visible, and the gage shall at last be charged, notwithstanding it has not been near an electrical machine for two or three days. This seems to prove, that there is a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LIMIT\">limit</a>, even in the rarefaction of air, which sets bounds to its conducting power; or, in other words, that the particles of air may be so far separated from each other, as no longer to be able to transmit the electricity; that if they are brought within a certain <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-DISTANCE\">distance</a> of each other, their conducting power begins, and continually increases, till their approach also arrives at its limit, when the particles again become so near, as to resist the passage of the electricity entirely, without employing violence, which is the case in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMON\">common</a> and condensed air, but more particularly in the latter.\n\nIt is surprising to observe, how readily an exhausted tube is charged with electricity. By placing it at ten or twelve inches from the conductor, the light may be seen pervading its inside, and as strong a charge may sometimes be procured, as if it were in contact with the conductor. Nor does it signify how narrow the bore of the glass may be; for even a thermometer tube, having the minutest perforation possible, will charge with the utmost facility; and in this experiment, the phenomena are peculiarly beautiful.\n\nLet one end of a thermometer tube be sealed hermetically; let the other end be cemented into a brass cap with a valve, or into a brass cock, so that it may be fitted to the plate of an air-pump. When it is exhausted, let the sealed end be applied to the conductor of an electrical machine, while the other end is either held in the hand, or connected to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FLOOR\">floor</a>. Upon the slightest excitation, the electricity will accumulate at the sealed end, and be discharged through the inside in the form of a spark; and this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCUMULATION\">accumulation</a> and discharge may be incessantly repeated, till the tube is broken. By this means, a spark 42 inches long may be procured; and if a proper tube could be found, we might have a spark three or four times that length: if, instead of the sealed end, a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol2.html#article-BULB\">bulb</a> be blown at that extremity of the tube, the electric light will fill the whole of that bulb, and then pass through the tube in the form of a brilliant spark, as in the foregoing experiment; though in this case, the charge, after a few trials, will make a small perforation in the bulb. If, again, a thermometer, filled with mercury, be inverted into a cistern, and the air exhausted in the manner before described for making the experiment with the gage, a Torricellian vacuum will be produced; and now the electric light in the bulb, as well as the spark in the tube, will be of a vivid green; but the bulb will not bear a frequent repetition of charges, before it is perforated in like manner as when it has been exhausted by an air-pump. It can hardly be necessary to observe, that in these <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CASES\">cases</a> the electricity assumes the appearance of a spark, (v) from the narrowness of the passage through which it forces its way. If a tube, 40 inches long, be fixed into a globe eight or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NINE\">nine</a> inches in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DIAMETER\">diameter</a>, and the whole be exhausted, the electricity, after passing in the form of a brilliant spark throughout the length of the tube, will, when it gets into the inside of the globe, expand itself in all directions, entirely filling it with a violet and purple light, and exhibiting a striking instance of the vast <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol7.html#article-ELASTICITY\">elasticity</a> of the electric power.\n\nMr Morgan concludes his remarks with acknowledging his obligations to Mr Brooke of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol15.html#article-NORWICH\">Norwich</a> for <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMMUNICATING\">communicating</a> to him his <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol13.html#article-METHOD\">method</a> of making mercurial gages.\n\nMr Brooke's method of making mercurial gages is nearly as follows: Let a glass tube L (fig. 84.), hermetically sealed at one end, be bent into a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol19.html#article-RIGHT\">right</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-ANGLE\">angle</a> with two or three inches of the other end. At the distance of about an <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INCH\">inch</a> or less from the angle, let a bulb K, of about three-fourths of an inch in diameter, be blown in the curved end, and let the remainder of this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol8.html#article-PART\">part</a> of the tube be drawn out I, so as to be sufficiently long to take hold of when the mercury is <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol4.html#article-BOILING\">boiling</a>. The bulb K is designed as a receptacle for the mercury, to prevent its boiling over; and the bent <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FIGURE\">figure</a> of the tube is adapted for its insertion into the cistern: for by breaking off the tube at M within an eighth or a fourth part of an inch of the angle, the open end of the gage may be held <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PERPENDICULAR\">perpendicular</a> to the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HORIZON\">horizon</a> when it is dipped into the mercury in the cistern, without obliging us to bring our finger or any other substance into contact with the mercury in the gage, which never fails to render the instrument <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IMPERFECT\">imperfect</a>. It is necessary to observe, that if the tube be 14 or 15 inches long, it will be <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol12.html#article-IMPOSSIBLE\">impossible</a> to boil it effectually for the experiments mentioned above in less than three or four <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol10.html#article-HOURS\">hours</a>, although Mr Brooke seems to prefer a much shorter <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-TIME\">time</a> for the purpose; nor will it even then succeed, unless the greatest <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTENTION\">attention</a> be paid that no bubbles of air lurk behind, which is frequently the case: but <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXPERIENCE\">experience</a> has taught how to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUARD\">guard</a> pretty well against this disappointment, particularly by taking care that the tube be completely dry before the mercury is put into it; for if this caution be not observed, the instrument can never be made perfect. There is, however, one evil which it is sufficient to remedy; and that is, the introduction of air into the gage, owing to the unboiled mercury in the cistern: for when the gage has been a few times exhausted, the mercury which originally filled it becomes mixed with that into which it is inverted, and in consequence the vacuum is rendered less and less perfect, till at last the instrument is entirely spoiled.\n\nMr Cavallo's experiments were made with an excellent air-pump, which is described in the 73rd <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VOLUME\">volume</a> of the Philosophical Transactions.\n\nThe following is the result of Mr Cavallo's experiments as given by himself.\n\n\"From these experiments it appears, first, that in the same air-pump, which amounts to about one thousandth part of the same subject, both the electric light and the electric <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-ATTRACTION\">attraction</a>, though very weak, are still observable; but, secondly, that the attraction and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REPULSION\">repulsion</a> of electricity become weaker in proportion as the air is more rarefied, and in the same manner the intensity of the light is gradually diminished. Now, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASONING\">reasoning</a> on this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ANALOGY\">analogy</a>, we may conclude\n\n(v) By cementing the string of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol11.html#article-GUITAR\">guitar</a> into one end of a thermometer tube, a spark may be obtained, as well as if the tube had been sealed hermetically.\nWhen an insulated conductor is thus presented to any other conductor, Signor Volta calls it a Conjugate Conductor.\n\nIn order to show by experiment the above-mentioned <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPERTY\">property</a> or increase of <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CAPACITY\">capacity</a> in a conductor, take the metal plate of an electrophorus, and holding it by its insulating handle in the air, electrify it so <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1815/vol7.html#article-HIGH\">high</a>, as that the index of an electrometer annexed to it might be elevated to $60^\\circ$; then <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol13.html#article-LOWERING\">lowering</a> this metal plate by degrees towards a table or other conducting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLAIN\">plain</a> surface, you will observe that the index of the electrometer will <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-FALL\">fall</a> gradually from $60^\\circ$ to $50^\\circ$, $40^\\circ$, $30^\\circ$, &c. Notwithstanding this appearance, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUANTITY\">quantity</a> of electricity in the plate remains the same, except the said plate be brought so near the table as to occasion a transmigration of the electricity from the former to the latter; at least the quantity of electricity will remain as much the same as the dampness of the air, &c. will permit. The decrease, therefore, of intensity is owing to the increased capacity of the plate, which is now conjugate, viz. opposed to another conducting surface. In <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol2.html#article-PROOF\">proof</a> of which, remove gradually the metal plate from the table, and it will be found that the electrometer rises again to its former <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol8.html#article-ELEVATION\">elevation</a>, namely to $60^\\circ$, excepting the loss of that quantity of electricity, which during the experiment must have been imparted to the air.\n\nThe two following experiments will throw more light upon the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-RECIPROCAL\">reciprocal</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACTION\">action</a> of the electric atmospheres. First, suppose two flat conductors, electrified both positively or both negatively, to be presented towards, and to be gradually brought near, each other; it will appear by two annexed electrometers, that the nearer those two conductors come to each other, the more their intensities will increase; which shows, that either of the two conjugate conductors has a much less capacity now, than when it was singly insulated, and out of the influence of the other.\n\nSecondly, let the preceding experiment be repeated, with this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-VARIATION\">variation</a> only, viz. that one of the flat conductors be electrified positively, and the other negatively; the effects then will be just the reverse of the preceding; viz. the intensities of their electricities will be diminished, because their capacities are increased, the nearer the conductors come to each other.\n\nLet us now apply the explanation of this last experiment to that of bringing an electrified metal plate towards an uninflated conducting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol16.html#article-PLANE\">plane</a>; for as this plane acquires a contrary electricity by the vicinity of the electrified plate, it follows that the intensity of the electricity of the metal plate must be diminished, and in the same proportion its capacity is increased; consequently the metal plate in that case may receive a greater quantity of electricity.\n\nThis property may be rendered still more evident, by inflating the conducting plane whilst the electrified plate is very near it, and afterwards separating them; for then both the metal plate and the conducting plane (which may be called the inferior plane) will be found electrified, but poffelled of contrary electricities, as may be ascertained by electrometers.\n\nIf the inferior plane be inflated first, and then the electrified plate be brought over it, then the latter will cause an endeavour in the former to acquire a contrary electricity, which however the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INFLATION\">inflation</a> prevents from taking place.\nPrinciples of taking place; hence the intensity of the electricity of Electricity the plate is not diminished, at least the electrometer will shew a very little and almost imperceptible depression, which is owing to the imperfection of the inflation of the inferior plane, and to the small rarefaction and <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDENSATION\">condensation</a> of the electric fluid, which may take place in different parts of the said inferior plane. But if in this situation the inferior plane be touched, so as to cut off the inflation for a moment, then it will immediately acquire the contrary electricity, and the intensity in the metal plate will be diminished.\n\nIf the inferior plane, instead of being insulated, were itself a non-conducting substance, then the same phenomena would happen, viz. the intensity of the electrified metal plate laid upon it would not be diminished. This, however, is not always the case; for if the said inferior non-conducting plane be very thin, and be laid upon a conductor, then the intensity of the electrified metal plate will be diminished, and its capacity will be increased by being laid upon the thin insulating stratum, because, in that case, the conducting substance which stands under the non-conducting stratum acquiring an electricity contrary to that of the metal plate, will diminish its intensity, &c., and the insulating stratum will only diminish the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-MUTUAL\">mutual</a> action of the two atmospheres, more or less, according as it keeps them more or less alund.\n\nThe intensity or electric action of the metal plate, which diminishes gradually as it is brought nearer and nearer to a conducting plane not insulated, becomes almost nothing when the plate is nearly in contact with the plane, the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-COMPENSATION\">compensation</a> or accidental <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol3.html#article-BALANCE\">balance</a> being then almost perfect; hence if the inferior plane only opposes a small resistance to the passage of the electricity (whether such resistance be occasioned by a thin electric stratum, or by the plane's imperfect conducting <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NATURE\">nature</a>, as is the case with dry wood, marble, &c.), that resistance, and the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-INTERVAL\">interval</a>, however small, that is between the two planes, cannot be overcome by the weak intensity of the electricity of the metal plate, which on that <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol2.html#article-ACCOUNT\">account</a> will not dart any spark to the inferior plane (except its electricity were very powerful, or its edges not well rounded) and will rather retain its electricity; so that, being removed from the inferior plane, its electrometer will nearly recover its former height. Besides, the electrified plate may even come to touch the imperfectly conducting plane, and may remain in that situation for some time; in which case the intensity being reduced almost to nothing, the electricity will pass to the inferior plane exceedingly slowly.\n\nBut the case will not be the same, if, in performing the experiment, the electrified metal plate be made to touch the inferior plane edgewise; for then its intensity being greater than when laid flat, as it appears by the electrometer, the electricity easily overcomes the small resistance, and passes to the inferior plane, even across a thin electric stratum; because the electricity of one plane is balanced by that of the other, only in proportion to the quantity of surface which they oppose to each other within a given distance; whereby, when the metal plate touches the other plane in flat and ample contact, its electricity is not dissipated.\n\nHitherto we have considered in what manner the action of electric atmospheres must modify the electricity of the metal plate in various situations. We must now consider the effects which take place when the electricity is communicated to the metal plate whilst standing upon the imperfectly conducting plane; however, the explanation of this easily follows from what has been said above. Suppose, for instance, that a Leyden phial or a conductor were so weakly electrified, that the intensity of its electricity were only half a degree, or even less; if the metal plate, when standing upon the proper plane, were touched with that phial or conductor, it is evident that either of them would impart to it a quantity of its electricity, <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-PROPORTIONAL\">proportional</a> to the plate's capacity, viz. so much of it as would make the intensity of the electricity of the plate equal to that of the electricity in the conductor or phial, supposed of half a degree; but the plate's capacity, now that it lies upon the proper plane, is above 100 times greater than if it stood insulated in the air; or, which is the same thing, it requires 100 times more electricity in order to shew the same intensity; therefore, in this case, it must acquire upwards of a hundred times more electricity from the phial or conductor. It naturally follows, that when the metal plate is afterwards removed from the proper plane, its capacity being lessened so as to remain equal to the hundredth part of what it was before, the intensity of its electricity must become of 50\u00b0; since, agreeably to the supposition, the intensity of the electricity in the phial or conductor was of half a degree.\n\nHaving premised thus much respecting the capacity of conductors, we shall now proceed to describe Signor Volta's method of rendering sensible minute degrees of electricity.\n\nHis method, in short, is to communicate the other-<a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol7.html#article-DESCRIPTION\">Description</a> wife unobservable quantity of electricity to the metallic plate of an electrophorus, while standing on an imperfectly insulating plane; for the capacity of the metallic plate being thus augmented, it will acquire a much greater quantity of electricity than if it stood completely insulated in the air, and when it is again separated from the plane its capacity will be diminished; consequently, its electricity increasing at the same time, the intensity of this will be rendered manifest either by sparks or by means of a delicate electrometer.\n\nThe particulars necessary to be kept in view in this method, are the following. The metal plate must be at least five inches in diameter, with the edge well rounded, and having a varnished glass handle, or instead of the glass, three <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-SILK\">silk</a> strings. The inferior plane must be of a very imperfect conducting nature, as dry marble, very dry and slightly varnished wood, a common piece of wood covered with oiled silk, or such like substance; but let the substance be what it will, its surface must be very smooth, and such as to coincide as well as possible with the surface of the metal plate; on which account, if a marble slab be chosen for the inferior plane, it will be proper to fit the metal plate to that of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol11.html#article-IRON\">iron</a>, by <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol10.html#article-GRINDING\">grinding</a> one against the other. What Mr Cavallo found to be very fit for this purpose was a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol17.html#article-PAPER\">paper</a> <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol2.html#article-DRUM\">drum</a>, consisting of a common wooden hoop, such as are used for barrels, over which a piece of thick <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WRITING\">writing</a> paper was pasted, and on the back of which he pasted a piece of tin-foil. The upper surface of the paper was varnished only once with shell-lac dissolved\nPrinciples of dissolved in <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol1.html#article-ALCOHOL\">alcohol</a> or <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol19.html#article-SPIRIT\">spirit</a> of wine. This sort of plane has many advantages, viz., it is easily made, and from its lightness is very portable; its surface is perfectly flat, excepting when the hoop is not very strong, for then the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONTRACTION\">contraction</a> of the paper has power sufficient to <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-WARP\">warp</a> it; and lastly, as the thickness of the paper and of the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol20.html#article-VARNISH\">varnish</a> may be varied at <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-PLEASURE\">pleasure</a>, and very easily, the plane may be rendered of any required degree of conducting power.\n\nHaving such a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SEMI\">semi</a>-conducting plane and metallic plate properly constructed, the former is to be laid upon a table, and the latter is to be placed upon it, taking care that the inferior plane be not excited by any degree of friction. If the surface of the inferior plane should have acquired any electricity by accidentally rubbing it, &c., the best way of freeing it of that electricity is to pass it two or three times over the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLAME\">flame</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol5.html#article-CANDLE\">candle</a>. Now the metallic plate is to be struck five or six times with the corner of a dry handkerchief, a piece of dry <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1860/vol9.html#article-FLANNEL\">flannel</a> or paper, &c.; then it is to be raised from the inferior plane by means of its insulating handle, and presented to an electrometer, when it will be found sensibly electrified. If the metallic plate be struck while it is not in contact with the semi-conducting plane, it will be found either to possess no electricity or an incomparably smaller degree than it acquires in the other <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-MODE\">mode</a>.\n\nBy this means electricity may be obtained from substances which could hardly be supposed electrified, and that not only in sufficient quantity to ascertain its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1771/vol3.html#article-QUALITY\">quality</a>, but even sufficient to afford sparks. Signor Volta has given to this <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol3.html#article-APPARATUS\">apparatus</a> the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol14.html#article-NAME\">name</a> of condensing apparatus.\n\nMr Cavallo, observing that in stroking the metallic plate, in order to obtain electricity from various substances, and especially from the hand, the plate was often moved so as to occasion some friction on the inferior plane, whereby this was excited, and consequently the result of the experiment rendered precarious, thought of the following method of preventing such <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol15.html#article-MOTION\">motion</a>.\n\nUpon a varnished glass handle he cemented a brass tube about six inches long and three-fourths of an inch in diameter, from the extremity of which proceeded a fine <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol8.html#article-FLEXIBLE\">flexible</a> wire about 14 inches long. Now, when the metallic plate was situated upon the inferior plane, he held the glass handle of the brass tube with his left hand, in such a manner that the end of the wire might touch the plate, the rest remaining in the air. Sometimes, in order to make a better contact, the end of the above-mentioned wire was put into a hole purposely made in the edge of the plate. In this disposition of the apparatus, the substances to be tried are stroked upon the brass tube, and the electricity produced by them is conveyed to the metallic plate by the wire, which being fine and flexible, communicates no motion to the plate.\n\nAnother improvement of Mr Cavallo's consists in rendering sensible degrees of electricity still more minute than those which may be discovered by the condensing apparatus.\n\nNotwithstanding the great <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1797/vol17.html#article-SENSIBILITY\">sensibility</a> of Volta's <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol6.html#article-CONDENSER\">condenser</a>, yet sometimes the electricity acquired by the metallic plate from some substances was so small as not to affect an electrometer sufficiently to ascertain its quality, or even its <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol9.html#article-EXISTENCE\">existence</a>; hence it naturally occurred to Mr Cavallo, that for the same <a class=\"xref\" href=\"vol17.html#article-REASON\">reason</a> for which the principles of metallic plate of the condensing apparatus manifested such minute degrees of electricity as could not be otherwise observed, another smaller plate, or small condensing apparatus, might be employed to render the weak electricity of the large metallic plate sensible. Accordingly, he constructed a small plate of about the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1842/vol20.html#article-SIZE\">size</a> of a <a class=\"xref\" href=\"../1778/vol10.html#article-SHILLING\">shilling</a>, having a glass handle covered with sealing-wax; and when the large metallic plate seemed to be so weakly electrified as not to affect an electrometer sensibly, he placed the small plate upon the inferior plane, and touched it with the edge of the large plate; then, after removing the small plate, he took up the small one from the plane, holding it by the extremity of the glass handle, and presented it to the electrometer, which was generally so much affected by it as to diverge to its utmost limits.\n\nIn this manner Mr Cavallo often obtained electricity more than sufficient for ascertaining its quality, from a single stroke of the corner of a handkerchief; viz., the large plate being placed upon the proper plane, was stroked once; then being removed and presented to an electrometer, it appeared not electrified; but by touching the small plate with the edge of it, that small plate acquired thereby electricity sufficient to make an electrometer diverge.\n\nWhen this secondary condensing apparatus is used, care must be taken to hold the large plate almost vertically while the small plate is touched by it. There is no need of having another inferior plane for the small plate, the large one being sufficient for both; for immediately after taking up the large plate, weakly electrified, with one hand, you lay down the small plate, &c.","sp":335,"ep":339},{"h":"VIR NOBILISSIMUS\nFRANCISCUS DOMINUS NAPIER","t":"REPUB.
